1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Wait, there's more.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,960
Eternal salvation.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,660
Or triple your money back.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,140
The Church of the Subgenius.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:29,100
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed, eraglic function.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,840
Over the quality audio-visual techniques exacerbated and complicated by the Church of the Subgenius.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,600
Oh, Dr. Sprint.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:59,800
She said, cutting her own legs off in what was to be the foment of a startling new trend among the...

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
So-called punk detail-a-hantia.

00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,600
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's off...

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
There's not enough photon that light releases, but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

18
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,140
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,720
Here's your host...

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,120
Reverend Ivan Stang.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,420
Dear friends, and this is KNON 90.9 FM in Nellis, Texas.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,880
Welcome to the show.

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,560
Come on, Hal.

24
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,560
We're already two hours late for the show.

25
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,160
Watch it with that water, man.

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,900
We don't have much.

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,980
So where's the road?

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,800
I think the road...

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
It's behind us.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Behind us?

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,900
What the...

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,380
I thought we were going towards the road.

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,920
Give me some of that air before it's gone.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,860
See, the sun's this way, so the road's got to be over there.

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,740
The radiation warning signs are all pointing that way.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,420
If that really is a sign.

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,580
Yeah, the sun's just coming out.

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
It looks pretty weird.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,620
Boy, the air smells good.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,580
I just wish...

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,940
That looks like the Cactus Wren, Arizona's national state.

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,740
I don't think this is Arizona, Hal. This is Texas.

43
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah, there it is.

44
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,360
We've got to be in Texas.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
Let's get out of here. It's creepy.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,020
I just hope the Indians haven't set one of their deadly traps.

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,120
Hey, watch out.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,080
Boy, we'll never get back to KPFA at this rate.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,760
KPFA?

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,340
No.

51
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,680
I thought we were going to KNON.

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,840
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,420
All we have to do is reach the mobile field antenna and we can start our broadcast.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,200
And also, we should just be able to see the rocket from here somewhere.

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,880
I'm afraid that went down several hours ago.

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
A rocket, too?

57
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,320
It would have shown up on our Nokia, but...

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,360
Hey, look over there.

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,580
Just a natural rock formation.

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
Nothing to be afraid of.

61
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,100
It's moving.

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
It looks like a big scary monster.

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,860
I know, but you know out in the desert, things can look...

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,060
look like things that they aren't.

65
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,580
It's called a psychic-y mirage.

66
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,160
The spirit of the desert.

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,520
They call them duendes.

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,880
Oh, don't talk about the duendes.

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,420
Duendes.

70
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,780
Yeah, the Indians say they're little shriveled, dried-up, mummified-like beings about a foot tall that grab onto you and bite you like you're a monster.

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,600
It ain't just a legend.

72
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,580
Just rock over here.

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,920
Just...

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
Oh!

75
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,060
Just tear a piece off.

76
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,200
Yeah, that...

77
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,620
What was that? A baby heel?

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,120
These cactus just feel like plastic.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
These rocks are made out of paper mache.

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,860
Nah, it's a fake.

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,100
This is...

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,480
This tree is made out of a spring.

83
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,760
What...

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,020
What...

85
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,840
What...

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,920
Maybe we can get some water, huh?

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,560
I don't know, you guys. What does that symbol mean?

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Oh, yeah, this is Bed Springs National Park.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,300
I don't have any more coffee.

90
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,420
Doesn't that mean biochemical hazard or something?

91
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,320
No sugar, no more beans.

92
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,880
You can't figure out where the road is.

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,680
That's the last of the beans.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,240
At least we got a good astronomical observation last night.

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,820
Check out the man pack, see if we can figure out where we are.

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,780
We better get a Geiger counter reading.

97
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,960
...star called SS 433.

98
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,460
It's kinda cold out here.

99
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:57,740
Yeah.

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,700
They don't call it nuclear winter for nothing.

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:04:59,920
But the air is clear.

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,440
But for our readings, we can take another reading a little later on.

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,440
I just hope we've got something to say when it's time for that broadcast to be made.

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,320
Yeah, no kidding. I lost my script.

105
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,480
A lot of people are counting on us.

106
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,400
Remember that. All ten listeners in the Bay Area...

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
The Bay Area?

108
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,620
...have got to hear us or...

109
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,760
Or you.

110
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,860
...make it through the morning.

111
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,360
This is Texas.

112
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,620
...as it were.

113
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,620
Come on, you guys.

114
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,900
Oh, look, a jackalope. Arizona's national rabbit.

115
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,100
Man, I thought those were extinct.

116
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,560
There it goes.

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,620
Okay, oh, it's glowing.

118
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
That little speaker's in its head.

119
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,600
Yeah, I wonder where that's coming from.

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,580
It's probably an observation drone.

121
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,220
You know, they say this whole area of the desert is haunted.

122
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,400
Hold it, hold it, I've got to wrap it in my shoe.

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Yeah, there's reasons for those tales.

124
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,700
Bob came through here years ago, Hal.

125
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,500
The rock?

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Put your shoes back on.

127
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,080
That's the crystal.

128
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,700
That rock crawled away.

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,180
Oh, let me have...

130
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,240
And look, there's a crack in it.

131
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,820
The Mokihana crystal.

132
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,480
Yeah, let me have some of that cracked crystal.

133
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,700
Yeah, let me have some of that cracked crystal.

134
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:06,700


135
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,900
Hmm, now we do.

136
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,800
Let us head topographically back toward the station.

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,940
Good idea, Doctor.

138
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah, no kidding.

139
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,060
And on the way, we can have some of that special frop you've been telling me about.

140
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,540
You're already late.

141
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,560
Yes, let us do so.

142
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,280
So anyway, I filled out the death certificate, sent it on to Bethesda.

143
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,060
Ha ha ha.

144
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,540
Pneumothorax area was...

145
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


146
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


147
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


148
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


149
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


150
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


151
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,540


152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,860
It was completely full of fluid.

153
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,860
Well, I must say, we sure put one over on the American people that time.

154
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,160
They still believe there was no second gunman on that grassy knoll.

155
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,360
Boy, what I would have...

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,080
I didn't even see the grassy knoll on the stage.

157
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,240
No, it was all fake, all phony.

158
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,020
But you were standing right next to it.

159
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,520
Yeah, but you know, you can't let on in a situation like that, involving national security,

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,140
that is.

161
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,640
Boy, I remember going to the airport with Bob that night, meeting him there in San Francisco

162
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,720
as he flew in for the show.

163
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,300
Ha ha.

164
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,940
Well, I remember going to the airport with Bob that night, meeting him there in San Francisco

165
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:55,940


166
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:55,940


167
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,540
Well, I remember going to the airport with Bob that night, meeting him there in San Francisco

168
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,100
and I see Bob got up on his nose, and he was just DJ-ing while he get his normal

169
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,100


170
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,660
Oh, I should have, if I were wearing a uniform, I could have packed back my

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,340
shoes and fr herumen.

172
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,580
I could have.

173
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,580


174
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,580


175
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:35,780
on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends. Right, Bob? Bob? Bob?

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,480
This is the church that's going to kick ass on the normals, the mediocrities, the pink boys,

177
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:53,900
the hippies, the Trekkies, and the Admin. I wonder. What? If God were to come to earth,

178
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:00,340
would they find him so strange that they would be afraid? And would they shoot him?

179
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,720
Did not his son come once, Pedro? And they nailed him to a cross.

180
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,880
And then spent 2,000 years learning to believe in him. All things take time, Pedro.

181
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,740
We would certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.

182
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,800
You talk like a madman.

183
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,740
Live like a sane one.

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,640
I was a fascist when Mussolini was on top. Now that he has been deposed, I am anti-fascist.

185
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:44,480
When the Germans were here, I was fanatically pro-German. Now I'm fanatically pro-American.

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,780
You'll find no more loyal parties in all of Italy than myself.

187
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,680
You're shameful.

188
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,020
You're a pro-opportunist. What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.

189
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,960
You have it backwards. It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

190
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
Enjoy life like Bob.

191
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:20,420
That is so true, dear friend. So true. There is a vast, nameless conspiracy struggling to control your mind.

192
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,880
And it only allows you one hour of sloth.

193
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:31,480
That hour comes at 11 o'clock every Sunday night on KNON.

194
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,740
Dear friends, there are only five basic things that can light up your mind.

195
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:53,700
Sex, drugs, great music, religion, or the hour of slack radio ministry sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius on KNON.

196
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:53,880
The hour of slack radio ministry sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius on KNON.

197
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,320
The hour of slack radio ministry sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius on KNON.

198
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
11 o'clock every Sunday night.

199
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,220
The hour of slack.

200
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,400
The radio voice of the saint of sales.

201
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,840
The living avatar of slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

202
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,180
The Church of the Subgenius began in Dallas, Texas.

203
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,560
Now your ears can experience the auditory hallucination which is the word of Bob.

204
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:21,560
Direct from the mysterious founders of this mystic cult devoted to getting us all the slack we deserve.

205
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,740
But the hour of slack at 11 o'clock.

206
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,040
Sunday's is not just a bunch of dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

207
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,840
Nay, nay.

208
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,740
The hour of slack is music.

209
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,220
From the most primitive to the most advanced.

210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,900
It is sound collages from TV shows and movie soundtracks that you'll pray had never existed.

211
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:50,740
It is tormented, gut-ripping original rants and Jeremiah ads from top subgenius preachers and bands the world over.

212
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,780
It is the most intense barrage of experiments.

213
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:53,880
It is the most intense barrage of experiments.

214
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,460
It is the most intense barrage of experiments.

215
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,460


216
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,460


217
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,460


218
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,900
It is the most intense barrage of experiments ever heard over stereo headphones.

219
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,640
It is the word of Bob.

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,600
Hope for the mutants in a crumbling world.

221
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,000
The hour of slack.

222
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,100
The most significant weekly event in the history of mankind.

223
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,080
Sundays at 11 p.m.

224
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,300
The hour of slack.

225
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,520
The show every episode of which you'll wish you had taped.

226
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,620
And the reason I taped that one, friends, is because that's going to be our new hour of slack promo.

227
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,600
And all I have to do is add in 49 layers.

228
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,300
the sound effects. See, I saved myself some time at your expense. But you know, at the same time,

229
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,380
most traffic accidents happen within a few miles of home. Did you know that? Even at low speeds,

230
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,180
a sudden stop or fender bender can cause severe injury to occupants who are not wearing a safety

231
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:54,100
belt. Take time to buckle up, dear friends, even on the shortest trips. This safety message from

232
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,820
KNON and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does not conflict in any major

233
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,480
way with doctrine from the Church of the Subgenius. But I'll tell you what, dear friends, there are

234
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,420
those of you who have strayed. Oh, you have strayed so far. And this is a good follow-up to

235
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,640
that ad I just read.

236
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:26,440
This memo here in my secret box here at the station, in the Reverend Stang box, and it says,

237
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,520
it's from the station managers, it says, folks, it's time for me to get down to the nitty-gritty.

238
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:40,040
KNON needs more money. Some of the shows and some entire formats have been doing a lousy job in

239
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,640
actually getting any money to the station, and time is running out. To be absolutely fair and

240
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,160
to give some money to the station, I'm going to need some money. I'm going to need some money.

241
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,320
KNONlly

242
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,360
Thanks.

243
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Your

244
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,880
patrons,

245
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,160


246
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,160


247
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,160


248
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:24,280
friends, is a long list of those of you who pledged during the pledge drive and hadn't sent

249
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:34,000
in money. Oh, man. I mean, it tears me up, folks. I can't believe that the subgeniuses have

250
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,860
embarrassed me personally and, so much more important, J.R. Bob Dobbs himself. Are you all

251
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,200
a bunch of liars? There are those. There are those of you fine, fine listeners out there who did

252
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,800
send in their check, and then there's a whole bunch that must have thought, oh, well, I want

253
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,240
to cheer up Reverend Stang while they're having a pledge. I want to make a funny joke over the

254
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,340
phone to someone. I want to do anything but send in my check. Well, friends, the subliminal,

255
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,200
the sound you hear right now is subliminally programming you to hurry up and write that

256
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,500
check.

257
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Send it to KNON, and I'm going to give you that box number. Get that pencil ready, and I don't

258
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,320
think I'm going to continue this show any longer until you do write that check, and actually,

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,860
now, don't let it sit around on your desk. Go ahead and send it in, because, frankly, if at

260
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,020
least half the people on this list don't go ahead and send in the money they promised they'd send,

261
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,540
there ain't going to be no hour of slack, and I wouldn't blame the station one bit for taking it

262
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,780
off.

263
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,100
Because they can't survive. None of the shows can survive without your money out there in the

264
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:59,240
audience. You sniveling worms who dare to steal the word of Bob. It's just like stealing. Stealing

265
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:11,680
the word of Bob. Bob don't like it, friends. Bob don't like it, too. He's going to come in an hour

266
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,480
you know not.

267
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:21,200
And visit upon ye bad luck if you don't get that pledge money that you promised in. It's really

268
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,540
disappointing, but those of you who have sent it in, I'll be calling you up personally to thank you,

269
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,380
and so forth.

270
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,840
Look, stick your hand in the water. It's radio water. This isn't real water at all. We're on the

271
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,100
show again. It might even be real water, but it's traveling at such a high speed, we can't tell.

272
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,060
But we're traveling at a speed somewhat relative to that.

273
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,940
Stick your hand in it.

274
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,480
Oh, no, I don't want to lose my fingers. You stick your hand in it.

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,260
Hey, watch.

276
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:50,520
Ah!

277
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,500
Oh, boy.

278
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,060
What a shame. Now put these other fingers on.

279
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,380
Look, the little seagulls are eating away at it now.

280
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:11,180
Yes, there goes Jonathan Living Fliggle, the infant seagull with a large, palpitating severed digit, and all the birds of Darbyshire and Somersetshire and Warwickshire. Oh, look, there's a light on the interositor main board.

281
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,980
Oh, look, there's a light on the interositor main board.

282
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,200
Are you sure the overcharge isn't too much, Doctor?

283
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
No, no, not at all. It's the same old thing.

284
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,780
It's definitely underwhelming.

285
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,900
All we can do is hold the front.

286
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:36,860
In every cry of every man, every infant's cry of fear, in every breath, in every band, the children's show called by him.

287
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,960
I left my radio on, and I caught my dog listening to your program.

288
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah, I wouldn't let a dog listen to this program.

289
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,780
You might have to eviscerate that dog now.

290
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,820
Might have to edit its memory, as it were. Practice time control on the poor cur.

291
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,060
Just erase the mutt's memory.

292
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,440
What the hell was this about F-rays coming from dogs anyway?

293
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,140
F-rays coming from dogs? Man rays coming from dogs. Man rays negatives coming from dogs.

294
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,440
Undetectable F-rays.

295
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,640
Ooh, scary.

296
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,800
Undetectable by normal instrumentation.

297
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,600
Oh, sorry, Doug. I didn't mean to be scary again.

298
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,760
Only subgenius science is managed to penetrate our brain nebulosity.

299
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,940
Are the little red lights are going? Yeah. This is a scary show. It's only scary.

300
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,660
I don't know. That's just what it says on the cue cards over there.

301
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,960
Anyway, I've been listening hourly, and wouldn't you believe it?

302
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,680
We believe in Monday morning going back to work.

303
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,820
And the sunlight shafts...

304
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,080
Does Bob have a credo?

305
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,480
Bob Dobbs. And Bob's credo is something we can't even tell you over the air, dear friends.

306
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,660
It's so nasty. Because Bob likes to have so much fun.

307
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,620
And this is a church that's trying to bring you to a slack awareness.

308
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,780
If we have to beat it...

309
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,900
Into your head!

310
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:50,460
And that's what we call in the church, in our highfaluted church dogma and jargon, acubiting.

311
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:59,900
Acubiting. That ancient Tibetan art which can bring you to justice and transfer pain from one part of your body to another.

312
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,420
It's really a miracle.

313
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:09,940
And you can send that money to K-N-O-N at P.O. Box 710909 in Dallas, Texas.

314
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,860
If you want to keep this show on the air.

315
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,600
You heard me. I'm going to give that number again.

316
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,960
K-N-O-N's box number.

317
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:37,580
If you want to hear anything like the word of Bob, anything half decent left on the radio, you need to send that money to K-N-O-N P.O. Box 710709, Dallas, Texas 75371.

318
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,920
Because the conspiracy really is out to get you.

319
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,780
This station.

320
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,440
And I mean this is the conspiracy, folks.

321
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,580
Oh, by the way.

322
00:18:51,620 --> 00:19:03,100
That was what you have been hearing there was more puzzling evidence from Dr. Hal Robbins and puzzling evidence on Engineer Bob Nelson.

323
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,140
On the more than an hour, less than a show show.

324
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,540
In Berkeley, California.

325
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,880
We'll be bringing back some more samples of that at any minute.

326
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,260
But first, this message.

327
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,040
Blazing guns still a bad man's lusty.

328
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,360
Alive.

329
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,640
Look how quietly he sprawls on the bloodstained ground.

330
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,460
Kill him again.

331
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,960
Shoot the nesters, greasers, horse thieves and cattle rustlers.

332
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,780
The crows pecked.

333
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:40,900
The cows.

334
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,960
Their eyeballs in the scrub and the sagebrush.

335
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,860
All the others may come out.

336
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,020
But you gunslinger will go on shooting.

337
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,660
Smiling.

338
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,080
Without unseemly passion.

339
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,020
Shoot the blood.

340
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,940
True blue is the yellow rose of Texas.

341
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,900
We're watching you.

342
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,600
won in a poker game in a Dodge City saloon.

343
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,520
Shoot her father, the ranch owner.

344
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,200
Shoot the sheriff.

345
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,500
Shoot the posse.

346
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,700
Shoot the birds out of the sky.

347
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,080
Shoot the mountain cats in their dark hollows.

348
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,440
Son of a gun.

349
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,460
Gatherer of darkness and silence.

350
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,860
Rider into the bloody sunset.

351
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,480
Emptiness, like a wind, rushes in behind you.

352
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,440
Man, and I've got to cut out of that one, see, because I believe, I'm not sure.

353
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,120
Dr. Philo Drummond sent me that tape, and I'm not sure what it is exactly.

354
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,380
But I think that that is an actual part of an actual Ku Klux Klan release,

355
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:37,400
because other stuff that was on here was just unbelievably nightmarishly racist.

356
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,480
I mean, God.

357
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,880
I really want to do...

358
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,880
I really want to do a race hour of slack, but I'm afraid that people would not understand.

359
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,880
Some of the stuff in our collection is so horrifying that I feel like people should know it exists.

360
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,360
But at the same time, it's like if we play it, half of the people hearing it go,

361
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,180
What? They really believe this stuff. I can't believe...

362
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:06,680
And so we get in terrible trouble, and everyone who works at the station the next day has to answer all the complaining phone calls.

363
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,720
Because people just don't understand bull-dotting.

364
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,380
You know, you can't present an example of something you hate without them thinking that you love it.

365
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,360
I just don't get it.

366
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,460
But this is negative land.

367
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,940
And remember...

368
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,280
Sound was used for centuries as a method of torture.

369
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,240
Place someone's head inside of a bell.

370
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,340
And ring it.

371
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,760
And eventually...

372
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,400
They'll go insane.

373
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,520
And eventually...

374
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,720
They'll go insane.

375
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,340
They'll go insane.

376
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,340
They'll go insane.

377
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,540
And eventually...

378
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
You're tired.

379
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,820
You're beaten down.

380
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,260
You're irritable.

381
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,040
Your mental and physical health...

382
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,060
are suffering.

383
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,100
Is there any escape?

384
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,740
You suffer so much.

385
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,880
Is there any escape?

386
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:42,800
Or...

387
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,940
Are you done this for?

388
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,760
You suffer so much?

389
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:45,860
or ask me to leave

390
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:45,860


391
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,160

395

396
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,200


397
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,200


398
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,200

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,380

414
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:51,560


415
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:51,560


416
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,180

S-

419
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,120
y-

420
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,740
Rectangular, yes. And what else?

421
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,420
Well, yellow and black and rectangular.

422
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,980
Rectangular, yes. What else?

423
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,860
Well, doctor, it has kind of black and yellow and black and...

424
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,440
Rectangular, yes.

425
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,980
It has kind of shapes inside.

426
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,260
Yellow, black and shapes inside.

427
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,980
Oh, I see them everywhere.

428
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,420
And what else?

429
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,680
It has kind of red shapes inside.

430
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,380
Yellow, black and yellow.

431
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,260
And with rectangular, red shapes inside.

432
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,940
Oh, I see them everywhere.

433
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,260
Do you hear me?

434
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,000
There, there.

435
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,280
Just fly.

436
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,660
Well, you see, friends, this is negative land still.

437
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,540
This is actually, this part, the last half of the show is going to be part three of the subgenius anti-drug special.

438
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,500
But before I get into that tape, it's actually...

439
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,600
It's actually a rerun from Old Hour of Slack.

440
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:19,480
But I just discovered this dub version of a Nina Hagen song in the station's record collection.

441
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,960
This is something that...

442
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,000
I mean, I haven't really heard it.

443
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,180
But I wanted to have a tape of it.

444
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,080
So I'm going to play it.

445
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
This is...

446
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,120
Quit worrying about what it means, friends.

447
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,060
That's the important thing.

448
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,040
Now, I'm just living.

449
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,460
Everywhere...

450
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,580
Just lie back.

451
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,520
Do you hear me?

452
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,280
There, there.

453
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,420
Everywhere, do you hear me?

454
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,060
There, there.

455
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,200
Do you hear me?

456
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,060
There, there.

457
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,280
This is rectangular.

458
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,460
This is rectangular.

459
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,600
Now, let's play acture.

460
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,800
This is a video of me.

461
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,040
I know I'm calling all those Speaker and Speaker things out of tens of minutes.

462
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,320
This is a video of a Goldberg guy playingill.

463
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,720
This is a video of a Goldberg guy playingill.

464
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,020
Now, let's get to the point.

465
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,020


466
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,100


467
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,100


468
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,100


469
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,300
Thank you.

470
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,160
Thank you.

471
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,980
Thank you.

472
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,480
Thank you.

473
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,180
Thank you.

474
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,760
Thank you.

475
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,240
Thank you.

476
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,820
Thank you.

477
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,720
Thank you.

478
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,760
Thank you.

479
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,220
Bob, Bob, Bob.

480
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,460
He wants to be sedated.

481
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,640
That's the swinging erudites, dear friends,

482
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,400
and what follows.

483
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,980
That's the swinging erudites, dear friends,

484
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,120
and what follows.

485
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,640
is not an example of what we think you should do,

486
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,520
but what you should never, ever do.

487
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,720
Doctor, doctor, here.

488
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
Take some more of this.

489
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,200
Have some of that.

490
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,060
Maybe the show will finish

491
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,420
and we'll get to make another tape.

492
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,020
Oh, no, more prescriptions again.

493
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,520
I don't know if I can keep up

494
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,280
with all these prescriptions

495
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,040
and all these callers

496
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,240
and all these fake shows.

497
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,340
Oh, my God.

498
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,120
This subgenius thing, it's more than that.

499
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,760
Just take the pills, doctor.

500
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,320
I can't.

501
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,940
Oh, my God.

502
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,700
I mean, man, I don't think I can keep up with it.

503
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,640
I mean, it's like there's too much of it.

504
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,400
There's these letters that come in the mail,

505
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,020
these weird magazines, these characters

506
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,620
that show up at the door.

507
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,800
These, these, these Bobbies, these.

508
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,560
And they want to know things.

509
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,480
They want to know how to run their lives.

510
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,360
Oh, what's your identity,

511
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,680
whatever you're saying about.

512
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,700
Open to libel and slander.

513
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,380
That's our lawyer now.

514
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
That's our lawyer now.

515
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,020
Oh, my God.

516
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,240
He's in.

517
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,420
Hey, I feel much better now.

518
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,860
Oh, man.

519
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,860
That's because Bob sent this for you.

520
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,360
These normal souls are amazing.

521
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,020
You can drink them.

522
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,840
You can smoke them.

523
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,000
You can eat them.

524
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't know.

525
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,900
Who knows what you can do.

526
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
You can even snort them.

527
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,680
I tried rubbing one up under my gums.

528
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,100
You're crazy.

529
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,920
I'm going to try.

530
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,620
I'm going to try a line of this human soul here.

531
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,720
If you'll excuse me a minute.

532
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:10,980
I've got.

533
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,380
Oh, man.

534
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,220
Now, that's what I call soul.

535
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,340
I'll try some of that.

536
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,560
Thanks.

537
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:21,980
.

538
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,160
Jesus.

539
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,520
That must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

540
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
Oh, no, that wasn't a normal.

541
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,140
That was.

542
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,180
God, I think I got some of his memories off of that.

543
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,640
Wow.

544
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,100
Yeah.

545
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,880
It's like I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s just for a second.

546
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,500
It's probably the guy's mom.

547
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,540
Yeah.

548
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,320
God, you can snort their souls.

549
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,720
Yeah.

550
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,180
And these little primal memories come.

551
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,920
You've just got to give them a final lunch and then dry them out first.

552
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,380
OK.

553
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,160
God, how long have you guys known about this?

554
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,680
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

555
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,240
Yeah, yeah.

556
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,900
It's too rainy to light a fire, to smoke a cigarette.

557
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:07,900


558
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:07,900


559
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,080
Yeah.

560
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,940
They had to dry the soul a lot of times.

561
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,080
So they just dry it and keep it in with volcanic rock as an absorbent.

562
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,660
And they just grind it up and snort it through huge, huge caves.

563
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,180
But they didn't have the technology to extract souls.

564
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,180
I mean, how'd they get them under pressure?

565
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,600
How'd they get them into the canisters?

566
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,500
They don't do it that way.

567
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,500
They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal.

568
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,040
You're kidding.

569
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,560
No.

570
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,020
Why can't we do that?

571
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,680
We can if we've got the right pill.

572
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:37,700
We can if we've got the right pills.

573
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,140
But...

574
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,500
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic.

575
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,120
I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract.

576
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,520
You can go high technology or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys with...

577
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,560
Why did Bob set up these extraction machines?

578
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,040
I mean, what's this, these emaculators?

579
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,700
Well, all you gotta do is you dig a little pit.

580
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,300
You dig a little pit in the ground, you line it with plastic, peg down with wood, and then you put the body in.

581
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,440
A normal, right?

582
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,760
Yeah.

583
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,780
Any normal?

584
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,820
It doesn't have to be...

585
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,100
Any normal.

586
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,000
It's not dead yet.

587
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,440
The stole is still in him, right?

588
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,840
Uh-huh.

589
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,740
Okay, then you cover him with kerosene and acetone.

590
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,100
And then you just jump up and down on him until it turns kind of green and thick.

591
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,720
Then you remove him, strain the liquid, then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

592
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,060
But then there's some kind of ritualistic...

593
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,760
I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

594
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:37,660
Well, there's a group of people around the pit adding a psychic element of the alveoli.

595
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:37,680


596
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,280
And then they start doing the alchemy, you see.

597
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,880
They concentrate.

598
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,700
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the sole amplifier.

599
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,140
Right.

600
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,060
So it's done with psychic methods.

601
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,480
Oh, man.

602
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,800
And then, after it's boiled...

603
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,640
God, that's incredible.

604
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,640
After it's boiled, they add...

605
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,980
A bunch of Brazilian tribal jungle people could...

606
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,260
And Bolivians.

607
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,040
And Bolivians.

608
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,340
Both.

609
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,340
They both do it.

610
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,620
In the lowlands on both sides there.

611
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,680
And then you boil...

612
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,180
They boil the sole.

613
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,060
They actually boil the sole.

614
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,680
Little combo soles.

615
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:02,600
Yeah.

616
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,220
They boil.

617
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,940
And little coya soles, too, you know?

618
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,240
And they boil them.

619
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,660
And then when it starts to thicken, they boil them.

620
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:07,660


621
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,000
When they thicken, they add another liquid.

622
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,140
It's some kind of corrosive, I believe.

623
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,380
And then it turns into a thick white paste.

624
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,340
And they just spread the sole out into the sun.

625
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
And it dries.

626
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,100
And then you just have to chop it up.

627
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,280
They'd probably think we were idiots for crystallizing them and compressing them.

628
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:24,960
Yeah.

629
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,060
I mean, it's...

630
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,180
It probably doesn't cost them...

631
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,640
You know, it costs them a couple of necklaces or a taper.

632
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,220
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

633
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,180
Their pet taper.

634
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,140
Yeah.

635
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,100
Well, going...

636
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,460
The most expense they've got.

637
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,380
And it costs us a hundred grand a year to keep these things pumping.

638
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,640
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

639
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,580
And not to mention the bodies and the soles and getting rid of them and storing them.

640
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,680
See, the body dissolves.

641
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,280
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

642
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,920
Well, do you do up the body, too?

643
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,560
No, they just strain it out with the solid waste.

644
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,400
What do they do with that?

645
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,840
With that?

646
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,820
They put it on the...

647
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,900
They press it into little cakes and burn it, like for fires and stuff like that.

648
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,420
They usually give it back to the guy's family.

649
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,540
How come the...

650
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,320
How come they...

651
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,260
How come this was...

652
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,720
Like, how come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

653
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,360
Well, you see, it's because...

654
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,420
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

655
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,640
How come we didn't rip them off?

656
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,080
Well, because we can pay for sole and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up here.

657
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,260
Because, you know, like down there, nobody complains if you go through four or five hundred bodies in one night.

658
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,860
You know, you can sit around and smoke all the sole you want to.

659
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,220
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of...

660
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,900
That's right.

661
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,400
...questionable to...

662
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,600
They got a lot more...

663
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,220
...to be digging pits in your backyard and throwing normal bodies in there and trampling

664
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,220


665
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,460
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

666
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,160
...noisy, if nothing else.

667
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
It's just little pressed cakes.

668
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,760
Most people...

669
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,220
Most people barbecue on them later, you know.

670
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,720
Well, I've never got indicted.

671
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,980
Bob never forgot him.

672
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,320
You see?

673
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,700
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away to the...

674
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,700
Whatever...

675
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,320
Wherever they're taken on Jupiter.

676
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,920
Holy...

677
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,760
Well, of course, the thing about...

678
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,100
That weirds me out, man.

679
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,200
A lot of things weird me out.

680
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,200


681
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,200


682
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,660
The fact is that you can't get any good sole here in the States, dry or liquid.

683
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,460
It's always been cut with something.

684
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,740
And I like my sole unstepped on myself, you know.

685
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,760
Oh, yeah.

686
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,120
They...

687
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,380
Yeah, they'll use monkey soles, chimpanzee soles.

688
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,140
Hell, they just take up crystallized...

689
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,360
It's probably two-thirds...

690
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,480
They just take crystallized emotions and mix them in, for God's sake.

691
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,420
I mean, you get a bad blast of rage mixed in with your sole, and the next thing you know,

692
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,020
man, you...

693
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,660
That's probably what happened to me last week.

694
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,940
...to the salad table.

695
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,320
And that took a lot of the fun out of the problem.

696
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,260
They put a lot of anguish in it, too, you know.

697
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,100
It just makes you depressed.

698
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:49,500
Whereas pure sole is nothing more than a psychic and, you know, almanic amplifier.

699
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,120
And, you know, if your sole's in good shape when you do pure sole, I mean, it's even better.

700
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,000
But, you know, like, you put...

701
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,440
The stuff that's been stepped on and mixed with monkey sole or alligator...

702
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,380
Yeah, next thing you know, your sole is...

703
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,480
It's tainted.

704
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,680
...very tainted.

705
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:05,920
Got it.

706
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,380
Got holes eaten through it, you know.

707
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:07,780
Uh-oh.

708
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,760
Man, I wonder if that's what happened to Jayner.

709
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,600
What happened to Jayner?

710
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,220
Yeah.

711
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,700
Jayner shoots sole.

712
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,580
Oh, no.

713
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,700
He's all, you know, magnetized my Palmer head.

714
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,180
He calls it.

715
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Yeah.

716
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,180
Yeah.

717
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,620
Hey, you need to give me some remagnetized Palmer.

718
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,440
I won't do any demagnetized Trevino head.

719
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,520
See, that's a problem with Jayner is doing it.

720
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,640
That Palmer head.

721
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,580
And, you know, it's...

722
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,220
It was not a good molecule to begin with.

723
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,420
And, you know, he's just synthesizing more and more of bad stuff and making it purer

724
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,940
and purer.

725
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,280
And each time he makes it purer, it's more pure bad.

726
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,820
That's his basic problem.

727
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,380
Running up demagnetized sole, bad golfer soles.

728
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,900
Yeah.

729
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,940
Can you imagine?

730
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

731
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

732
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,500
This is it.

733
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

I'm just a few miles away

737
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm in a future where there's a day that there's a documentary

738
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,220
That's a day that makes me pray

739
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,900
I'm gonna try and super clever and look at it forever

740
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,360
One day when I will know that you

741
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,640
Have been assigned to a grave just becoming a slave

742
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,740
Come on, find your blade again

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,880
Come on, find your blade again

746
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,980
The legendary manslaughter.

747
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:39,740
And it is this doctor's opinion that anal sex was performed on the dead bodies after the brutal slaughter and was done.

You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is, and don't you wish you did.

756
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,660
Oh dear, that ding ding ding.

757
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,060
Well, Dr. Howell, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us

758
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,480
about the relationship between the demopods and the ussopods?

759
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,340
Well, the demopods and the myriapods got together at the early...

760
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,020
No, the demopods and ussopods.

761
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,480
Oh, the demopods.

762
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,520
It says right here on the script we're supposed to...

763
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,340
I didn't understand that.

764
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,300
I thought you meant this script right here, the one with the red lines on the cover.

765
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,260
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

766
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,960
I never believe anything with red dots.

767
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,940
It says read addresses to people you don't like on the show.

768
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,860
God, they're coming in from all sides.

769
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,000
Too many buttons to push, too many tape recorders to watch.

770
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,200
It was obvious that during the game they should not have launched ahead with that size of

771
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,500
a rocket.

772
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,160
They should have used a smaller rocket, not hurt so many people.

773
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,400
A small bore.

774
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,280
Some perhaps, but not so many.

775
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,540
As it turned out, JFK was turning to Governor Connolly to tell him the name of the band

776
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,280
that dare not speak his name, and was shot because of that.

777
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,620
We thank you for your input, caller.

778
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,160
What does it sound like where you are?

779
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,820
Perfectly well-minted people.

780
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,340
But what...

781
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:49,940
What does it sound like?

782
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,760
What does it sound like where you are?

783
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,380
What is weird?

784
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:51,740
Huh?

785
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,700
Some weird DJ dressed up in a crown of thorns and a dirty, dirty sheet.

786
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,260
Starts kissing on you.

787
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,080
I...

788
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,320
And don't forget to...

789
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,920
Oh, hi.

790
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,400
You guys know what is it, no?

791
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,200
You turn a telephone over to an molecule and you make a Shayla Park-er.

792
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,080
And someone says, what's the problem?

793
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:05,300
Call Officer Amy!

794
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,860
advantaged!

795
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,240
No wied-up wings, Mr. Brown!

796
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:31,620
Ah, yes, dear friends, here we are at home on the airwaves of KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington.

797
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:42,500
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, and you better stop and explain, just in credit at least, we can't ever explain.

798
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,900
The fools making those weird noises were playing on your radio.

799
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:54,820
Let's see, the music started off with a band called They Might Be Giants, which Reverend Bleepo Abernathy in Boston has been sending tapes of.

800
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,660
You'll hear them every now and then.

801
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:11,260
But quite a bit of there was the show Less Than an Hour, or Less Than a Show, More Than an Hour from San Francisco, or the Berklee Show.

802
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,100
The puzzling evidence, Dr. Gary Brogue-Fran, Dr. Howell.

803
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,520
And, um...

804
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,320
Various insidious guests, Mobius Rex and so forth, and evil subgeniuses.

805
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,780
Evil.

806
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,120
Intermixed with a tape from...

807
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,020
It's all intermixed, dear friends.

808
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,060
Bishop Huey of Houston, the Archbishop of Houston.

809
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,700
There's no such thing as all of us.

810
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,800
It's all on tape.

811
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,100
He sends these tapes that are always labeled collages from hell.

812
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,140
And double mixes from heaven.

813
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,720
Starring.

814
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,800
Everyone but you, the listener.

815
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,800
Dear friends, once again, as we saw...

816
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,040
Again and again.

817
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,280
We come to the end of this side of the show.

818
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,620
Prepare to turn your show on.

819
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,320
Once again, you'll have to...

820
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,080
Turn your show over.

821
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,520
Turn your radio over.

822
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,540
Flip it so that you can hear the rest.

823
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,640
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

824
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,260
The subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

825
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,960
Just for that.

826
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,420
Only.

827
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:30,960
, but I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can.

828
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,040
Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man.

829
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,520
When I put a spike into my vein.

830
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,040
And I tell you things aren't quite the same.

831
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,360
When I'm rushing on my run.

832
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,880
And I feel like I'm a man.

833
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:46,880


834
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:46,880


835
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,760
And I feel just like Jesus' son.

836
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,300
And I guess that I just don't know.

837
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,500
And I guess that I just don't know.

838
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,580
I am me.

839
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,000
And me.

840
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,620
I am me.

841
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,080
This is me.

842
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,780
Yeah.

843
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,020
Welcome to side two of your radio show.

844
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,820
Oh, yes, dear friends, we're back.

845
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,860
And, boy, it's getting tough doing these shows night after night after night.

846
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,840
It's easy for you.

847
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,020
You only have to listen once a week, but we do ten shows a day.

848
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,260
We have to keep up, stay ahead.

849
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,400
What is that noise?

850
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,480
I have no idea.

851
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,560
I think it might be the exits on the outside of the hull.

852
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,000
No, a little bit.

853
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,460
Yeah, I can hear the hiss, the air noise.

854
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,120
We're still on the fringes of the atmosphere, you know.

855
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,100
That's just a few molecules.

856
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,460
What happens if I push this button?

857
00:48:59,460 --> 00:48:59,840
Basic problem.

858
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,000
What?

859
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,080
Running up, demagnetized.

860
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,300
Oh, you can hear us.

861
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,980
Bad golfer's sound.

862
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,320
What if we flip this?

863
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,860
You've got a whole week's show there.

864
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,620
Here we go.

865
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,360
Visit land unveiled in mystery and magic.

866
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,600
Up there went the mystery and the magic.

867
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,200
Right there.

868
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,880
Why did you have to?

869
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,460
I didn't have to say that.

870
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,880
Here are heroic legends of ages past.

871
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,960
Timeless myths.

872
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,420
Haunted ghost stories.

873
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,480
Hey, is this that Time magazine ad about Vietnam?

874
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,640
Yeah, certainly is.

875
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,240
It's something.

876
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:26,580
Yeah.

877
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,820
Jump ship before it's too late.

878
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:29,520
Okay, thanks.

879
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,780
A feast for the eye, mind, and spirit.

880
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,620
We don't want to do that.

881
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,760
I think he's right.

882
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,320
He?

883
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,120
What do you mean, he?

884
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,620
Wasn't that a female calling?

885
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,960
No, I used the term he to describe all aliens that call the show.

886
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,480
I don't think a human would ever call.

887
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,300
Show.

888
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:44,820
Show.

889
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,300
Listen, it.

890
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,140
What is that?

891
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,800
I want to get fixed, too.

892
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,700
First time by the editors of the Book of the Subgenius.

893
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,400
Yes, all of the show was getting fixed.

894
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,860
They were fixing the show.

895
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,180
And nobody knew exactly where it would be.

896
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,100
Publishing guides you through this intriguing realm in a unique and spectacular family library,

897
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,900
the Book of the Subgenius.

898
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:06,860
Here we go.

899
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,180
Visit land unveiled in mystery and magic.

900
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,340
Up there went the mystery and the magic.

901
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:12,940
Right there.

902
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,120
Why did you have to say that?

903
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,620
Well, Gary, we just thought we'd...

904
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,400
There went the mystery and the magic.

905
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah, it's all over now.

906
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,420
You use a million gigawatts of electricity to extract souls up here.

907
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,900
The energy is released psychoactively and with simple chemicals down there.

908
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,080
And we never free base soul either.

909
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,400
I mean, that's really bad.

910
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,280
Just drinking it.

911
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,840
That's all.

912
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,300
Drinking it and snorting it.

913
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,440
I like a little.

914
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,200
I like a little iced soul myself.

915
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,220
I like it best out of balloons, to tell the truth.

916
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,180
That is my favorite way of doing up some soul.

917
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,760
Yeah, tank soul is good stuff.

918
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,480
High pressure tank soul.

919
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:58,940
I like it.

920
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,520
Just the pure stuff straight out.

921
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,240
Straight out.

922
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,700
That's just they cook it, you know, and then it turns into a gas.

923
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,200
And then they pump it under pressure.

924
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,240
They scrub it.

925
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,360
They scrub it through dog meth filters and stuff like that to make sure because when you get it into that excited state,

926
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,900
every little part of the soul separates from every other.

927
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,840
So you get little pockets of, you know, stuff that was like childhood dogma rammed into you.

928
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,720
So they scrub that all out.

929
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,940
So it becomes it's the most pure form in gaseous form.

930
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,860
Oh, yeah.

931
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,140
But the only problem is that, you know, the people that end up banging their head against the wall all night long because they can't stop.

932
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,240
They're in such ecstasy or whatever.

933
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,260
People fall down the floor a lot.

934
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,020
Pure beingness.

935
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,340
The beingness.

936
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,800
The beingness of it.

937
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,040
They, you know, makes them for some reason chew the ground.

938
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,440
And that's what I did.

939
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,860
That's how my jaw got messed up.

940
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,960
You know, you can tell.

941
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,300
Woke up chewing the ground.

942
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:55,740
Yes.

943
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,500
Woke up.

944
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,860
I loved Mother Earth.

945
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,060
I woke up chewing the ground.

946
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,780
Made a big mess.

947
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,320
Yeah.

948
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:09,300
You can tell that the soul really affects people more in gaseous state because the minute they speak, their voice isn't the same, you know.

949
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,640
It goes directly, directly to the main gland.

950
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,660
Yeah.

951
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,100
I mean.

952
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,480
It just diffuses in the blood so fast.

953
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,120
Yeah.

954
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,440
We got Barry Mantle.

955
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,600
Put some Barry Mantle on.

956
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,860
There we go.

957
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,960
This is scrambled signal.

958
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,920
We have not been able to figure this one out.

959
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,180
You can slow it down and it's like old TV shows.

960
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:43,360
But in between the lines are these even more, these incredibly fast little, like, micro blips of sound that we have not been able to stretch out enough.

961
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,000
Not been able to stretch out.

962
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,260
Even, I mean, the best thing.

963
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,300
Yeah.

964
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,300


965
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,900
It's a digital equipment. You can't slow it down enough.

966
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,600
Maybe the space is between the blips of the actual message.

967
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,360
Yeah, but we can't slow it down that much. I mean, you can't differentiate. The machines won't...

968
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,100
It's alien. It is a truly alien signal. It's there.

969
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,500
Play the music.

970
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,720
Boy, it's almost 60 gigabits per head, right?

971
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,020
Yeah, that was a great band, man. I wonder whatever happened to them.

972
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,820
They're playing the hydrogen line now, I think.

973
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,040
I think this is one of their numbers coming in right now on channel 7.

974
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,620
Well...

975
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,400
Here they come. Stay down. Here they come.

976
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,800
Scary little ugly things.

977
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,160
That's a heliopter.

978
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,580
I don't understand why our own church sends these things in to try to kill us on our own show.

979
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,920
Well, it's part of the dogma.

980
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,820
Your own show will try to kill thee.

981
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,480
Well, there's little babies back there.

982
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,280
It's a little holographic baby. See it again.

983
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:45,860
I'm going down.

984
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,660
And I can't kiss.

985
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,700
Yeah, if I can't talk.

986
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:50,980
If I can't whoop it again.

987
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,260
If I can't talk, I'll vote.

988
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,660
All right, fax.

989
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,620
Fax it.

990
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:09,980
The reason why you don't get the slack you need is because you got it mixed up with what they tell you what you should want.

991
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,000


992
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:21,600
Pretty girl, big breasts, a big fast car, 75 pounds of cocaine, and some real bad rock and roll on the radio.

993
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,300
That is false slack.

994
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,400
And should be handled by church hierarchy.

995
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,960
They are poison for you. Poison.

996
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,860
They're the peripheral residue left after the slack juice drains out.

997
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,340
I can't do any show anymore.

998
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,980
If you think that kind of stuff is true, then you're wrong.

999
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:45,100
If you think that kind of stuff is real slack, then you're lost into some delusions that are not your own.

1000
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,100
Too much anti-slack show right now.

1001
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,860
They're just lost in that.

1002
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,620
It's draining me. There's no callers.

1003
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,740
They're just lost in that TV image.

1004
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,160
They're all sitting at home watching MTV or something like that.

1005
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,260
They're all watching them.

1006
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,980
They're all watching their own unobtainable middle class dreams on their screens.

1007
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,660
I'm just going to kill Bob.

1008
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,980
You ever had a truck roll over your foot?

1009
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,820
I'm so frustrated. I just can't.

1010
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,540
You ever stood on the edge of a curb and had a bus smack you in the face, turn the corner?

1011
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,180
I...

1012
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,980
You ever crossed a busy intersection on the White Street?

1013
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,380
Do not be afraid. I am not here to harm you.

1014
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,040
He is the first of your kind to attain immortality.

1015
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,520
Immortality?

1016
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,340
We're not interested in that kind of immortality.

1017
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,960
I know you want to destroy me.

1018
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,800
But listen. Please listen.

1019
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,400
I only want to help you.

1020
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,220
I've chosen you.

1021
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,920
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

1022
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,580
Seems better.

1023
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,780
I know we're trying to fly the show tapes out of here now.

1024
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,820
See, we fly them out early before the show's over.

1025
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,760
No, we're not going to have to jump this one.

1026
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,960
And get them to the other stations and they play that solid model display software stuff that you like so much here on the air.

1027
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,780
What about the fact that, uh...

1028
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,840
The fact? What a bad word to say.

1029
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,240
There are no facts.

1030
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,960
Look what happened. You see, as soon as they say it, the engine breaks down.

1031
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,020
Hold on, we're going to have to fix things.

1032
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,540
Oh, man, I don't believe it. I don't know if I have my wrenches here.

1033
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,320
Come on.

1034
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,420
Gary, see... Oh, okay. He's trying to get it up there.

1035
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,180
Now, there's got to be some spooky, scary monster movies later on.

1036
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,980
This is really going to delay the end of the show, you know.

1037
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,460
For example, this.

1038
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,960
If we can't get this thing started and get out of here before Emmett comes in.

1039
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,580
Kiss the blood off my hand.

1040
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,920
Let's watch that while we're waiting.

1041
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,700
I spit on your grave.

1042
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,660
No, I saw that.

1043
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,540
I eat your grave. I eat your skin.

1044
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,140
Don't look in the basement.

1045
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,760
And Dracula has wet the bed in the grave again.

1046
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,680
Oh, right, right.

1047
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,800
There's scars of Dracula's hands.

1048
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,740
And counter-strike.

1049
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:58,980
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

1050
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,600
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

1051
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,540
living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on Planet Earth.

1052
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,280
Are we controlled by secret forces?

1053
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,640
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

1054
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,040
Do people think you're strange?

1055
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,540
Do you?

1056
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,200
Then you may be on the right track.

1057
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,920
Are you abnormal?

1058
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,940
Then you are probably better than most people.

1059
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,580
Yes, your kind shall change.

1060
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:34,660
I'm a little bit more of a troll.

1061
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,580
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

1062
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,340
This is it, the only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

1063
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,740
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

1064
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,740
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

1065
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,300
Bob is a way of life to millions.

1066
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,840
Yet half of them don't even know it.

1067
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,680
He's the one true living Slack master

1068
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,880
with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

1069
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,720
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

1070
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,380
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

1071
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,900
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

1072
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,740
Become physically attractive overnight.

1073
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,680
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

1074
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,520
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

1075
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,840
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

1076
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,520
And coming right back.

1077
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

1078
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:57,840
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

1079
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,960
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

1080
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,320
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

1081
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,140
That will fool normals and get you sex.

1082
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,600
Bob Woo!

1083
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:21,800
Ah, yes dear friends.

1084
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,920
Huh.

1085
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,820
Yes.

1086
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:29,680
And this, that, the church of the subgenius that you've been hearing about.

1087
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,620
Hearing so much about, friends.

1088
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,180
You can get more information on just how much more information you can get.

1089
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,580
If you'll write to this simple P.O. Box number.

1090
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,300
That's Bob, friends, at the church of the subgenius.

1091
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,760
P.O. Box.

1092
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,300
140306.

1093
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,680
Dallas, Texas.

1094
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,740
Dallas, Texas.

1095
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:57,840
75214.

1096
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,500
That's P.O. Box 140306.

1097
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,000
Dallas, Texas.

1098
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,300
75214.

1099
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:14,600
And stay tuned for Soul Oldies with Ron Lindsey.

1100
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,540
He's standing right behind me ready to take over.

1101
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,420
When this Jimi Hendrix version of Peter Gunn goes off.

1102
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:27,020
And friends, those of you once again who didn't send in your pledge money.

1103
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,240
Send that money in.

1104
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,820
Or you can, I mean, forget your slack.

1105
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,460
That's it.

1106
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:33,680
Hear it?

1107
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,060
Gall just died.

1108
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:35,620
Just died.

1109
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,000
So it's K-N-O-N.

1110
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,020
P.O. Box 710909.

1111
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,500
Dallas, Texas.

1112
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,380
75231.

1113
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,980
Get that money in today.

1114
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,600
It's all yours, Ron.

1115
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,180
Gracias, amigos.

1116
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,220
Be listening to the voice of the people.

1117
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,840
Gay Annoying 90.9.

1118
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,920
P.O.

1119
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,440
Dallas.

1120
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,760
Praise Bob.

1121
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,880
I stumbled on this photograph.

1122
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,240
It kind of made me laugh.

1123
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,780
It took me way back.

1124
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,280
Back down memory lane.

1125
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,680
I see the happiness.

1126
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,300
I see the pain.

1127
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,060
Where am I?

1128
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,000
Back down memory lane.

1129
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,900
I see her standing there.

1130
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,500
Such a happy, happy pair.

1131
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,600
Love beyond compare.

1132
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,640
Look up there.

1133
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,880
Look up there.

1134
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,080
The way you held me.

1135
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,380
No one could tell me.

1136
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:57,300
That love would die.

1137
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,080
Oh, why?

1138
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,400
Did I have to find this photograph?

1139
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,740
I thought I had forgot the past.

1140
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,160
And now I'm slipping fast.

1141
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,500
Back down memory lane.

1142
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,560
I feel the happiness.

1143
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,880
I feel the pain.

1144
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,360
That love would die.

1145
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:23,360


1146
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:23,360


1147
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:23,360


1148
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:23,360


1149
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,640
Here am I

1150
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,080
Back down memory lane

1151
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,620
I'm in the sunshine

1152
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,860
I'm in the rain

1153
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,740
Thought it was over

1154
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,920
Here I go again

1155
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,260
The way it held me

1156
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,400
No one could tell me

1157
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,720
That love would die

1158
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,100
Oh, oh, oh
