1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:27,120
And now, the ssssss of Genius Hour of Swag!

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,800
And this episode,

3
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,240
hour of slack number 1,852,

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
is a rerun of number 852.

5
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,900
The third rerun in a row that I've done that way,

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,760
reruns that are all exactly 1,000 shows

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,100
or roughly 20 years old.

8
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,340
I'm going to keep doing it

9
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,940
until my current physical therapy kicks in and pays off.

10
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,960
My back slid downhill again from arthritis

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,380
and 50 years.

12
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,620
I'm having to spend a certain amount of my time

13
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,780
doing these very careful exercises again.

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,760
They worked before, though, and I never should have stopped.

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,060
It's just so time-consuming.

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,560
But the dogs insist on walking me.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,360
Forever.

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,720
And I have many jobs for Bob

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
not related to this.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Damn show.

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Anyway, back to 2002

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,980
and a detailed look into the Devo subgenius connection.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,820
Little Neepy is still in Devo land.

24
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,520
And now, dear friends,

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,380
after the Devo convention or the devotional in Cleveland,

26
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,620
now it can be told we're all Devo.

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,980
And we all trade our weird-ass jobs.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,820
Devo cover tune copies.

29
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,700
The one just heard was a Bach cover

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,420
by Mark Mothersbaugh and yours truly.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,480
We have Occupant coming up, friends,

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,300
which will follow this mix

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,540
by Reverend Greg Cheetham.

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,880
People had to amuse themselves or die.

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,320
You know, spiritually die.

36
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,820
So that's why the particular,

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
kind of music came out of there.

38
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,940
It's like an inward, imaginative music.

39
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,120
You know, it obviously isn't,

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,360
it wasn't based on mainstream currents

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,840
or big beat hard rock and roll.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,620
It was more like little clicks and whirs

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,200
and brainwaves.

44
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,580
Inward, imaginative music.

45
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,380
Little clicks and whirs.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,620
Brainwaves.

47
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,540
Polyrhythmic experimental sound.

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,460
Not even real drums.

49
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,520
Just a crude forerunner of electronic drums

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
built by one of Mark's brothers.

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
You know, within the realm of music,

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,420
there were obviously influences from Bowie and Eno.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,720
And even just more pure electronic composers.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,280
Well, Hey!

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,720
Look,

56
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:00,720


57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,840
You nervous?

58
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,700
Well, I kind of feel sorry for Jimmy.

59
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,360
Yeah, but you don't know the whole story.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
He wasn't a nice guy.

61
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,740
What do you mean?

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,660
Let me tell you.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,640
Jimmy's in a wheelchair.

64
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,900
And I don't care.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,160
Jimmy's in a wheel chair.

66
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
And I don't care.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,640
Jimmy's in a wheel chair.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,760
And I don't care.

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,300
Jimmy's in a wheel chair.

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,600
Sorry man, I advise you two not to be slack.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,540
This dog didn't beat him good

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,000
Like his pretty wife

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,180
Now the rough man gone

74
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,360
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,820
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

76
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,220
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

77
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,580
Jimmy's in a wheelchair

78
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,020
He was the president

79
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,540
Of a company

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,220
He kept his workers poor

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,940
He lied and cheated and sneered

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
But with justice strikes

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,600
Every once in a while

84
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,180
He makes a bullseye hit

85
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,460
Every once in a while

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
He used to yell and scream

87
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,020
Till his son would cry

88
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,380
He used to spank his dog

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
But he don't spank no more

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,960
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,760
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,000
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000


94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

95
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,700
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

96
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:00,700


97
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,960
He got big and fell

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,520
And he was rising high

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Making lies again

100
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Trashin' others' lives

101
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,820
But with justice strikes

102
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,260
Every once in a while

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
He makes a bullseye hit

104
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,120
And trying to many things

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:39,600
He left a haha

106
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,500
Nyar

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,160
Jimmy's in a wheelchair you're covered

108
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,560
by Occupant.

109
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,480
Friends, if you need to know more about

110
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,780
Occupant, and you do, check out

111
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,720

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,320
www.mp3.com

113
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,960
Occupant.

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,820
You know how to

115
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,800
spell it.

116
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,580
Okay, here's the story.

117
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,460
But aren't you going to molest me some more?

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,620
Dr. Piper

119
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,800
Pop?

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,660
That's right, that's a good boy. Climb right up here on my lap.

121
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,660
Now bend over. I'm going to have to

122
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
give you a... Oh, boy! Can I have my

123
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,580
spanking? Where are you going? Come on, boys.

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
Come on out of here. Now I'm getting it all.

125
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,560
The doctor's going to give you a good spanking and teach you about

126
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,600
Planet X. We're just cannibal

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,160
apes.

128
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,100
And so,

129
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,580
the poor little

130
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,040
children were abused

131
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,620
and abandoned by the

132
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,740
evil doctor.

133
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Left to their own devices,

134
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,640
there wasn't much left to eat but

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,720
rat meat and sundaes for the week.

136
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,820
Some of the little

137
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,640
boys resorted to crying, but

138
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,580
they knew they had to be bigger

139
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,720
than that. They had to

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,600
stand tough and swallow back

141
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,280
their tears.

142
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,220
Speaking of Devo,

143
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,260
there is a, um,

144
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,580
the third of the Devo

145
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,200
conventions.

146
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,140
Or, the devotional

147
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,160
2002

148
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,260
is coming up August 10th

149
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,400
all day on Saturday

150
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
at the

151
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Starwood Center, Cleveland, Ohio.

152
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,140
Um, yes.

153
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
The, uh,

154
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,240
and that's, again, that's all day

155
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,260
August 10th. I

156
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,600
think there's, I'm sure

157
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,140
there's some kind of a charge for it. It's great.

158
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
I was at the last two, and

159
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,660
they've never been able

160
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,280
to get any of the Devo's out.

161
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,560
Yeah, they're, except the first,

162
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,960
from the very first order,

163
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,060
the earliest evolution, the first ones

164
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,040
to crawl out of the water,

165
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,680
Jim, Jungle Jim Mothersbaugh,

166
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,880
the little-known first drummer,

167
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,160
is, is there, will be there,

168
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,540
was there last time,

169
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
was actually a real funny guy,

170
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,820
and General Boy!

171
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,940
Yes, the progenitor and sire,

172
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,960
a friend and a brother, a monkey,

173
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,940
and a robot.

174
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,040
Occupant OCCUPANT.

175
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm a mechanical man.

176
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,120
Two mechanical arms.

177
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,720
Two mechanical legs.

178
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,940
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

179
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,380
I'm a mechanical man.

180
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,140
Two mechanical arms.

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
Two mechanical legs.

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm a two mechanical arms. Two mechanical legs.

183
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm a mechanical man.

185
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,380
Two mechanical arms.

186
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,940
Two mechanical legs.

187
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

188
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,600
We build swell.

189
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,260
We work well.

190
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,380
We want what you want.

191
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,420
We build swell.

192
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,860
We work well.

193
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,180
We want what you want.

194
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,600
You want.

195
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,860
You want.

196
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,200
You want.

197
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,380


198
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,100
I'm a mechanical man.

199
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,880
Two mechanical arms.

200
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,440
Two mechanical legs.

201
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

202
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm a two mechanical arms.

203
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,180
Two mechanical legs.

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

205
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,100
We build swell.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
We work well.

207
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,140
We want what you want.

208
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
We build swell.

209
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,740
We work well.

210
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,880
We want what you want

211
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,860
We feel swell

212
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,320
We work well

213
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,580
We want what you want

214
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,580
We feel swell

215
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,240
We work well

216
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,080
We want what you want

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Baby, give me what you got

218
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,160
We feel swell

219
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
We work well

220
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,760
We want what you want

221
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,820
We feel swell

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,780
We work well

223
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,480
We want what you want

224
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,540
We feel swell

225
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,280
We work well

226
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,600
We want what

227
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,060
You want

228
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:23,720
Baby, me feels swell We work well, me want what you want

229
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,600
You want, you want, you want You want, you want, you want

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:38,400
You want, you want, you've got You've got, you've got, you've got

231
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,700
You've got, you've got, you've got You've got

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,460
Wait a second! Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?

233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,260
Nay, like most of your followers I was maimed building the great brewery.

234
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Mechanical Man was covered by Occupant. That's Reverend Onan Canobite and Reverend Mitch.

235
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,360
And now, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo has a little fun

236
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,380
with the best of the best.

237
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,600
The pinkest creature known to Bob.

238
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,280
In this case, the Drive Time Rock Station DJ.

239
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,380
I'm Bob Waugh. Time for the 5.30 phone call.

240
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,900
And today, we have Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo on the phone.

241
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,320
Hi, Mark.

242
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,280
Hi, Mighty Waugh.

243
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,620
How's Devo these days?

244
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,780
Oh, busy, busy. We just finished an album.

245
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,960
I don't know if you've heard it yet or not.

246
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,820
Yeah, we're playing it.

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,200
Oh, you're playing it?

248
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,460
Yeah.

249
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,900
Oh, good.

250
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,460
Well, then I'm gonna have to buy a radio.

251
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,260
Yeah, it's, uh, Shout is the name of the new record.

252
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,480
That's right. Um, actually, it's, uh, for us, it's a real interesting album because

253
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:54,400
this is the first one where we gave up total control and let someone else, uh, direct it for the first time.

254
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,060
Um, I don't know if you're familiar with the Church of the Subgenius,

255
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,560
uh, but I made friends with them in the last three or four years, became a reverend in the Church of the Subgenius,

256
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,560
and, uh, now, um, all, uh, Devo Incorporated is totally controlled by, uh, the Church of the Subgenius,

257
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,860
and, uh, Bob Dobbs, who is our spiritual leader, makes all the decisions now.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,460
Uh-huh.

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,980
Well, actually, with a little help from Jimi Hendrix.

260
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,180
I see. Yeah, in fact, uh, you guys did a cover version of Are You Experienced on the new record, huh?

261
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,040
Yeah, um, it wasn't by choice, either.

262
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,120
This was another, uh, this is, was a surprise to me, too.

263
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,100
We, we actually hadn't planned on putting that song on the record.

264
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,540
We had a couple other songs.

265
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,040
We were going to put on, and, and we were in the studio, and it was late at night, and, and, uh,

266
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,240
who should appear in the room in this big purple, uh, gas cloud?

267
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,240
It really, it didn't smell very good. It had that sickening sweet smell of, uh, LSD.

268
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,920
Mm-hmm.

269
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,200
And, you know, I didn't recognize him at first, but it was Jimi Hendrix, and he chased us around the room.

270
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,560
It was.

271
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,440
Uh, he, he told us we had to record Are You Experienced. It wasn't by choice.

272
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,520
Well, that's a pretty tough, uh, order to follow.

273
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,000
It was a little bit of a challenge to say no to, I guess.

274
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,420
Well, actually, um, we were pretty happy with the way it came out, so we, we did use it on the record.

275
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,900
Now, what about these, uh, neon green Chinese-American friendship suits?

276
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, well, um, that, that's easy to explain.

277
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:30,220
In the last couple years since, uh, we put out, uh, Oh No, It's Devoe, we, we did five world tours and five albums and 22 videos all in about four and a half years.

278
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,320
And, uh, so about the end of the 82, we said,

279
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,260
Forget it. Forget it.

280
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,100
And we, we, um, we dropped out. We went underground and we got jobs at a fast food restaurant.

281
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,700
No.

282
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,060
Well, they were the outfits and they let us keep them.

283
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,900
Mm-hmm. I see.

284
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,240
They matched.

285
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,720
What have you been doing besides, uh, recording the new record?

286
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,400
You making any more movies or?

287
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,720
Well, as I said, we dropped out. Uh, we've grown our hair. Um, although that's computer hair you see in the photo.

288
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,980
We, we all have long hair now and we've kind of...

289
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,880
We had never, to tell you the truth, we didn't have time for drugs, uh, back in the, uh, prior to 1982.

290
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,820
And, and, well, we decided we'd experiment in the last couple years and things are a lot groovier and far, more far out for us than they've ever been before.

291
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:25,840
You guys took some time out to do, uh, a Devoe endorsement for Honda, I know. How was, how was that? Is that fun making commercials?

292
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,760
Well, Church of the Subgenius, once again, they, they, um, made us do it. It wasn't by our own hands.

293
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,620
Ah, I see.

294
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:41,720
Uh, it was alright. They, um, they, uh, they fed us, uh, at once every day and, you know, let us out at night. So it was okay.

295
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,820
Mark Mothersbaugh from Devoe is on the telephone at WLIR.

296
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,280
They were the Hondas of wrecked already, the Hondas they gave us.

297
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,220
Really? Two of them?

298
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,000
I have to tell you that.

299
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,700
Oh, um.

300
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,100
So you're in Garden City, right?

301
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,900
Yeah. Yeah, uh, in, on Long Island.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,660
Actually, I know that. I'm, uh, you, you think I'm talking to you from Los Angeles, but in reality I'm in that phone booth at the 7-Eleven.

303
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
Oh, yeah, I know that one.

304
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,200
Yeah.

305
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,960
Uh, listen, Mark, I...

306
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm just putting static noise over, so...

307
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,600
What I really want to know is, since this is an election year, what's the candidate that, uh, Devoe is collectively, uh, endorsing?

308
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,400
Well, to tell you the truth, uh, we're awful disappointed that, uh, Larry Flint dropped out of the running.

309
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,500
He had our vote, and, uh...

310
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,640
Uh-huh.

311
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,640
Um, he, you know, I, I don't, I don't know. I think, you know, you have no other choice.

312
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


313
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,200
Uh, you know, you...

314
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,720
There's really no way to vote, because Republican and Democrat, it's all the same at this point in time.

315
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,520
Well, you could still put him in on the, uh, the write-in ballot, I guess, you know.

316
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,320
Yeah, well, I think General Boy may, uh, get a few votes out of us. Other than that...

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,940
Um...

318
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,720
I, I don't know what, what to suggest.

319
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:52,960
Ugh!

320
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,900
Gag onto me with a spoon!

321
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,080
Malachi! It's high time I laid down a few commandments.

322
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,160
You got a chisel? Take this down.

323
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,720
Well, that's what I say, because that's what the word of Bob says.

324
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,700
I tell you, friend, there's no slack, there's no slack, there's no slack.

325
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,340
I tell you, in this world, in this flesh, in this devil, there's no slack!

326
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,980
And if you can't whoop it, go ye down, my friend. That's what I said. Go ye down!

327
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,020
There's nothing that says you can't. The devil don't have a rule book.

328
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,560
That's right, the devil, the devil does not have a rule book.

329
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,420
He is not humanistic, he is not pacifistic, and he owes you money, my friend.

330
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
That's right, the devil owes you money, and so does Uncle Sam.

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,140
You have to recognize the devil, just like you recognize Uncle Sam.

332
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,860
Now, I'm going down there to pay taxes. As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.

333
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm sorry, but that's just the way things are. It's a test of faith!

334
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,740
And that's why God put the devil down here, to see if you could tell the difference between the devil and Uncle Sam.

335
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,180
Let there be slack.

336
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,260
My lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.

337
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,980
Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming from you?

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,420
They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee, rise up against them.

339
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,980
Smite someone who deserves it for once.

340
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,100
Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.

341
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,400
But, but, metal lord...

342
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,300
What part of nay dothn't thou understand?

343
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,540
Armageddon! Who says that? I didn't.

344
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm a man of the law.

345
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:36,600


346
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:36,600


347
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Now, join me, Screamy-Temp Horde!

348
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,240
Do it!

349
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,200
We interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units of speed.

350
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,880
A large object traveling at supersonic speed is headed over the North Atlantic, towards the east coast of the United States.

351
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:55,940
Armageddon!

352
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,040
It's what we call a global killer. The end of mankind.

353
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,740
Doesn't matter where it hits. Nothing would survive, not even bacteria.

354
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Armageddon!

355
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,760
Team, CX-MS is recommend... might recommend alert one.

356
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,300
The more you make a big deal out of denying something, the more people think it must be true.

357
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,920
You're on the air, Laurie.

358
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,780
If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd know that there won't be another thousand years.

359
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,920
Right now, we're in the middle of the war.

360
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,700
Everything in the last days is foretold in the book of Revel...

361
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,360
The last days? You mean the coming of the apocalypse, right? The rapture?

362
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,440
You only have to look at the signs. There are wars and rumors of wars...

363
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,220
Now, just so the rest of us know how much time is left, when is the rapture supposed to hit?

364
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,980
Exactly. Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

365
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,800
That's right.

366
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:49,360
Now, is that midnight L.A. time or Eastern Standard Time or what? I mean, what time zone has God in, anyway?

367
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,840
I pray for you all.

368
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,800
These people are nuts!

369
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,760
Skybird, this is Dropkick with a Red Dash Alpha message in two parts. Break.

370
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,480
Stand by for mind control...

371
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,860
Prepare yourselves for destruction!

372
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,140
You speak crazily, little boy.

373
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,380
The best way to take our minds off the smell of burning flesh is to begin tonight's karaoke contest.

374
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,600
I gotta sing a Doom song now.

375
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,520
Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.

376
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,360
Doom, doom, doom!

377
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,920
As I was saying, the universe is just doing what it wants.

378
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:25,920


379
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,940
Doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed.

380
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,380
Guess what, guys?

381
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,920
It's time to embrace the horror.

382
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,360
Look, we got fun road tickets to the end of the earth.

383
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,160
There's a 68.71% chance you're right.

384
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,900
That's the fact, yeah!

385
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,020
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.

386
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,220
I think something is happening.

387
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,000
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

388
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,940
I will fear no evil.

389
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,460
No, no, no!

390
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,020
It's seen him!

391
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,160
Thou anointest my head with oil,

392
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,980
my cup runneth over,

393
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:17,240
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

394
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,460
Let him run!

395
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,260
Fire!

396
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:26,740


397
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,080
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!

398
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,160
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!

399
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,220
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!

400
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,140
Shut up, you mouth!

401
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,620
All I'm saying is that there are some things beyond the can of mortal man

402
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,160
that shouldn't be tampered with.

403
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,400
We don't know everything, Andy.

404
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,380
There's plenty going on right now in the Twilight Zone

405
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,000
that we don't know anything about,

406
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,760
and I think we ought to stay clear.

407
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,900
See that the humans remain entertained until the end.

408
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,120
And...

409
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Armageddon!

410
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,600
A mix by our friend Reverend DJ E-Pock.

411
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,740
That's not E-Popped, but E-Pock.

412
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,720
It's all American, friends, and it's weird.

413
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,540
All Ameri-keed.

414
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,420
Bob loves you.

415
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,580
Bob loves you.

416
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,300
Bob loves you.

417
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,400
Bob loves you.

418
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,220
Bob loves you.

419
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,240
Bob loves you.

420
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,300
Bob loves you.

421
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,000
Bob loves you.

422
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,240
Bob loves you.

423
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,760
Bob loves you.

424
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,300
Bob loves you.

425
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,480
Bob loves you.

426
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,080
Bob loves you.

427
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,680
Have any favorite Bob songs?

428
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,240
God!

429
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,360
That is unbelievable, man.

430
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,600
The Bob Spangled Banner

431
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,080
by Professor Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.

432
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:03,260
And now in the patriotic spirit, to continue that spirit, the Rainmakers with Government Cheese.

433
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,880
The table and the bills ain't paid, cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA.

434
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,540
They'll turn us all into beggars cause they're easier to please.

435
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,440
They're feeding our people that Government Cheese.

436
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,540
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat.

437
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,420
Cause he doesn't have to pay.

438
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,060
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat.

439
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,500
Give a woman free kids and you'll find them in the dirt.

440
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,500
Learning how to carry on the family line of work.

441
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
It's the man in the White House, the man under the steeple.

442
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,560
Passing out drugs to the American people.

443
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
I don't believe in anything, nothing is free.

444
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,500
They're feeding our people that Government Cheese.

445
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,080
Government Cheese.

446
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
Government Cheese.

447
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,540
Government Cheese.

448
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:33,860
Get out!

449
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,320
Decline and fall.

450
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,520
Decline and fall.

451
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,680
Fall down, baby.

452
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,540
Decline and fall.

453
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,120
I said fall way down now.

454
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,580
Decline and fall.

455
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,060
Come on, fall down baby.

456
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,560
Little mama

457
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,640
Decline and fall

458
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,660
Oh, decline and fall

459
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,600
Give a man a free ticket

460
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,420
On a dead-end ride

461
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,620
And you'll climb in the back

462
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,660
Even though nobody's driving

463
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,600
Too goddamn lazy

464
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,620
To crawl out of the wreck

465
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,100
And you'll ride a while

466
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,620
He waits up for the welfare check

467
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,180
Gone to hell in a handbag

468
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,600
Can't you see

469
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,680
I ain't gonna eat

470
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
No government cheese

471
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,680
No government cheese

472
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,620
No government cheese

473
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,560
No government cheese

474
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,580
No cheese, no cheese, no cheese

475
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,440
No government, no money

476
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,440


477
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,440


478
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,440


479
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,440


480
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,440


481
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,440


482
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,900
And I'm hovering like a fly

483
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,320
Waiting for the windshield

484
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,820
On the freeway

485
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,860
That's too nihilistic for me, guys.

486
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,060
Oh, that's cool the way he does it.

487
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,800
Yeah, but that's nihilistic.

488
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,540
You know what I mean?

489
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
That's anti-chromatic.

490
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,460
That's re-fistulating.

491
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,960
That's totally imbibed I think, if it's not drunk already.

492
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,600
You're gripping onto the waves of life and riding forward as fast as you can, right?

493
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:31,800
You don't want to sink down into that gray, neutral nothingness of squared-off, murky plainness and ordinariness.

494
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,160
You want to dive for the heights and float down to the lowest lows.

495
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,100
And that means waiting for the windshield with a fly-by on the freeway.

496
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,080
Manic depressive waiting for the bus in the middle of the road.

497
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,820
The ups and downs of the number seven. The ups and downs of the crosstown B.

498
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,520
The ups and downs of getting on without the change, right? Getting up and down.

499
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,080
They didn't tell me to take those pills, but I didn't take them anyway.

500
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,540
I love you. I love you.

501
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,600
Let there be light!

502
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,260
Yippee!

503
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,040
I got it! I got it!

504
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,560
Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.

505
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,440
But when you've made it to the verses and made sure it's clear, you're ready to read your mind.

506
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,880
Stop to blame ideas for wrong interpreted RyuK量

507
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,280
The Cenotaph of the

508
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,740
пис19

509
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,580
I'm is

510
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,060
Matt

511
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,580
guarantees

512
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:04,660
これで

513
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:04,660


514
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:04,660


515
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,820
your

516
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:05,820


517
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,080
ones

518
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,520
The gift of freedom, you know what to do.

519
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,520
I guess I remember, don't think I forgot.

520
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,180
I was having a party the night that you were shot.

521
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,500
Shot right in the brain cells, so that all that stuff came out.

522
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,560
All the evil ranting that you never knew about.

523
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,980
Yes, yes, the ranting, that evil twist of fate.

524
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,000
Faces you thought you could never do, but now you have to hate.

525
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,280
Ah, that's right, doctor.

526
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,300
Soon there'll come a day

527
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,400
when all the rational civilized thoughts

528
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,860
have gone.

529
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,760
In a way.

530
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
That's right, doctor.

531
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,140
That's right, doctor.

532
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,100
That's right, doctor.

533
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,300
That's right, doctor.

534
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,380
Ah!

535
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,240
Let's ride, doctor

536
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,300
Let's ride, doctor

537
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,500
Yes, that is right, doctor

538
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,100
You heard what I said

539
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,780
We must watch TV

540
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,260
Till our eyeballs turn blood red

541
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,280
That's right, doctor

542
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
What's the other laws?

543
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,340
We must show our incompetence

544
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,700
By fighting all our flaws

545
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,380
The walls are closed again

546
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,700
The room is hitting small

547
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,300
I don't know where you've been

548
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:58,340
I haven't tried to talk

549
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,040
Let's ride, doctor

550
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's ride, doctor

551
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,360
Let's ride, doctor

552
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,040
Let's ride, doctor

553
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,080
Let's ride, doctor

554
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,980
Let's ride, doctor

555
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,400
Let's ride, doctor

556
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,580
Let's ride, doctor

557
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
Let's ride, doctor

558
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,980
Let's ride, doctor

559
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:29,980


560
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,980
Doctor

561
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,720
Let's ride, doctor

562
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,800
Let's ride, doctor

563
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,940
Let's ride, doctor

564
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,980
Moleboy is unfocused Truly friends that never knew

565
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,440
That's Right Doctor

566
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,280
That's Right Doctor

567
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,420
Uh by Reverend Dr. Haj

568
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:16,180
Josh, Uncle, Onan's Wotan Band, Onan Canobite, and Mitch there.

569
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,340
Praise the Lord.

570
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,180
Finding God, that's important, yeah.

571
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,100
But you know what might be a treat for everyone?

572
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,980
If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender.

573
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,100
I don't know what to say, other than...

574
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,720
Absolutely not. Your loss is a tragedy, but our work is...

575
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on, you guys have forever to look for God.

576
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,240
All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.

577
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,640
He speaks out of love for his friend.

578
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,520
Perhaps that love in his heart is God.

579
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,300
Oh, how convenient.

580
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,020
A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope.

581
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,660
Get back to work.

582
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,800
Or better,...

583
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,900
And that's, if I might say, afunded.

584
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:24,940
Time's up moves us to the exit.

585
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,220
You can trust's not a joke.

586
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,300
Not a lie.

587
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,980
Or a true shot that Cats haven't paid...

588
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:37,580
We this isn't Madonna, I'm the one on the clock!

589
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,240
Thank you.

590
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,360
Thank you.

591
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,800
Thank you.

592
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,080
Thank you.

593
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,120
Thank you.

594
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,260
Thank you.

595
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,480
Thank you.

596
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,360
Thank you.

597
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,960
Thank you.

598
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,320
Thank you.

599
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,220
Thank you.

600
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,660
Thank you.

601
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,280
Thank you.

602
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,660
Thank you.

603
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:37,960
Thank you.

604
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:46,980
Now I'm happy all the time I can't think I'm feeling fine

605
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,580
I've got feelings they don't show Don't ask me, I don't know

606
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,980
Don't know, know

607
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,300
All of us

608
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,300
All of us

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,820
All of us

610
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,580
You've heard this all before

611
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,960
I am the one

612
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:30,960


613
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,560
You're gonna hear some more

614
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,560
I know a place where dreams are crushed

615
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,320
Hope you're smashed at it much

616
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,540
Are you stupid anyway?

617
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,740
We're all gonna die someday

618
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah

619
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,300
All of us

620
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,480

All of us

626
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,600
All of us

627
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,480
All of us

628
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:08,540
He loves with boogie boy He'd fall out of china doll

629
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:18,500
Pogo man got chippy steps Bad girl laughing floppy tits

630
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:27,900
Listen listen me no lie He likes stuff what makes us cry

631
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:30,820

All of us All of us

635
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,980
All of us By Gachetto

636
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:17,160
Gachetto All of us By Gachetto

637
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,900
Gachetto

638
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:24,760
Guest friends Gachetto, Will Black performed at the devotional and that song All of Us,

639
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,640
believe it or not, is a really ancient Devo song before any of their albums came out.

640
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,900
And as we sign off for this week, The King.

641
00:44:50,300 --> 00:45:03,040
As I walk through this wicked world Searching for light in the darkness of insanity

642
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:16,620
I ask myself Is all hope lost Is there only pain and hatred and misery

643
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,140
And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing I wanna know

644
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,080
What's so funny about this love and understanding

645
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,900
What's so funny about this love and understanding

646
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:57,140
And as I walk on Through troubled times

647
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,000
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes

648
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,920
So where I've gone And who I've trusted

649
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,920
And where is the heart

650
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,460
And where is the harmony

651
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,140
Sweet harmony

652
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,340
Cause each time I feel it slip away

653
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,100
Just makes me wanna cry

654
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,100
What's so funny about this love and understanding

655
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,960
Oh, what's so funny about this love and understanding

656
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,080
Is it just me or the world

657
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,860
Oh, what's so funny about this love and understanding

658
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,860


659
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,860


660
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,540
Who's the one that I trust

661
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,900
Is it just me or the world

662
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,800
Who's the one that I aim for

663
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,660
Is it my partner

664
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,560
Who slays the iron

665
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,840
Is it my constant

666
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,520
Who wants to절

667
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,180
I slaughtered it

668
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,180
Whalsoě

669
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,780
Who I cannot

670
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,720
Understand her

671
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,340
They're dead

672
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,380
All dead

673
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,300
Who would have known

674
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,760
Playing God could have

675
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,320
Such terrible consequences

676
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,300
Elvis did

677
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,480
What's so funny about

678
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,620
Peace, love, and understanding

679
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,000
And we have another classic

680
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,200
Costello song coming up

681
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,560
After Mark Mothersbaugh

682
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,800
Once again encounters

683
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,780
The Pink Boy

684
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,040
We've had a lot of Devo fans

685
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,240
Calling the radio station

686
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,240
All day long, Mark

687
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,340
So I have to ask you

688
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,240
When is Devo coming

689
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,120
To the New York area

690
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,560
And

691
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:43,740
When is Devo coming

692
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:43,740


693
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,020
And do you have any plans

694
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,480
To come by and do some gigs

695
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:47,880
Around here?

696
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,940
Yeah, we'll be going

697
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,800
Between Texas and L.A. though

698
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,820
For the next three months

699
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,280
We'll be

700
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,460
Hopefully we're going to

701
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,280
Make a video album

702
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,280
That's our plans

703
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,380
We're working with the church

704
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,180
Of the subgenius

705
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,300
They're located in Dallas

706
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,520
So we'll be flying

707
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,260
Back and forth

708
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,720
And we'll do an

709
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,360
Are you experienced video first

710
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,620
I don't know if it'll be

711
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,200
Out for Halloween

712
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,500
I think it'll be a week or two

713
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,260
After that

714
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,660
But then we'll do a video album

715
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,740
Between now and then

716
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,320
At the end of the year

717
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,200
And hopefully by

718
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,580
The first of the year

719
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,260
We'll be able to make

720
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,280
Definite plans

721
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,300
For a world tour

722
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,340
And probably start

723
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,060
On the east coast

724
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,140
Well good, alright

725
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,660
Well listen

726
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,260
Mark Mothersbaugh

727
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,060
Thank you very much

728
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,940
And good luck with the

729
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,840
New Devo album

730
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,760
Which is called Shout

731
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,080
Oh thank you Mighty Wah

732
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,300
Sure, yeah

733
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,500
Mark, before you go

734
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,200
Do you know what the station is

735
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,080
That dares to be different?

736
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,860
I sure do

737
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,140
W-I-O-I

738
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,100
Thank you Mark

739
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,960
I watch children

740
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,680
In the shine

741
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,360
In the light

742
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:43,620
Night

743
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,720
I'll do it

744
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,520
Anything my radio advised

745
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,980
With every one

746
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,780
Of those late night stations

747
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,540
Playing songs

748
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,420
Bringing tears to my eyes

749
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,660
I was seriously thinking

750
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,220
About hiding the receiver

751
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,860
When the switch broke

752
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,680
Cause it's old

753
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,060
They're saying things

754
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,480
That I can hardly believe

755
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,520
They really think

756
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,040
We're getting out of control

757
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,660
Radio is the sound salvation

758
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,080
Radio is cleaning up the nation

759
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,600
I'm a radio fan

760
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,200
They say you better listen

761
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,100
To the vice of reason

762
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,840
But they don't give you any choice

763
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,860
Cause they think that it's treason

764
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,000
So you had better do

765
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,980
As you were told

766
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,960
You better listen to the radio

767
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:38,820
I wanna bite the hand

768
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,920
That feeds me

769
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,100
I wanna bite that hand

770
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,600
So badly

771
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:43,580
So badly

772
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:43,580


773
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,500
I wanna make them wish

774
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,260
They'd never see me

775
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,160
Some of my friends

776
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,880
Sit around every evening

777
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,920
And they worry about

778
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,000
The times ahead

779
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,600
But everybody else

780
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,340
Is overwhelmed

781
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,520
By indifference

782
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,280
And the promise

783
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,680
Of an early bed

784
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,620
You either shut up

785
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,480
Or get cut out

786
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,200
They don't wanna hear about it

787
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,980
So many inches

788
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,480
On the reel to reel

789
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,440
And the radio

790
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,480
Is in the hands

791
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,880
Of such a lot of fools

792
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,560
Trying to ignore me

793
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,600
And euthanize the way

794
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,500
That you can feel

795
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,980
Radio is the sound salvation

796
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,640
Radio is cleaning up the nation

797
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,700
They say you better listen

798
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,560
To the vice of reason

799
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,420
They say they don't give you any choice

800
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,340
Cause they think that it's treason

801
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,620
So you had better do

802
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
As you were told

803
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,600
You better listen to the radio

804
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,540
Radio is the sound salvation

805
00:51:51,240 --> 00:52:13,520
Radio is the sound salvation

806
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:24,920
Radio is the drum Chile

807
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:32,360
And recognition

808
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,360


809
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,380
They say

810
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,680
Manat xx

811
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:33,680


812
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,680
Am I here to cheat一个�і

813
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,480
From ,

814
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,340
I Met A Man

815
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:39,340


816
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,360
I know

817
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,360


818
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,600
A real

819
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,520
What I didn't-

820
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:43,520


821
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,440
And there's the Devo convention coming up also.

822
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,740
And a Devo the next day.

823
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,920
Devo convention here.

824
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,940
It's in August, right?

825
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,560
Mass baptism.

826
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,960
You said there was going to be a mass baptism in the middle of August, like August 15th?

827
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,540
Reverend Ivan Stang.

828
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,700
Hellfire preaching by Reverend Ivan Stang.

829
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,820
Dr. Katatan, again.

830
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,680
And Dr. Onan Kanobai.

831
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,000
He's coming out from Portland?

832
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:18,520
Yep.

833
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,060
Wow.

834
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:19,520
Yes.

835
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,500
It'll be good to see Onan.

836
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,180
He's a fellow rocketeer.

837
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,000
Yes.

838
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,400
He's a rocket man.

839
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
And a full-grown cannibal.

840
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,740
He's the oldest, youngest of genius doctors.

841
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,700
And St. Ann and Helen Hambaskin.

842
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,400
She rocked.

843
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,420
I thought she was right on the mark singing her songs.

844
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,320
I thought for once.

845
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,660
That's going to be August 11th at the Lime Spider.

846
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,900
Some sort of stardom level.

847
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,680
In Akron.

848
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,340
In Akron.

849
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,320
August 11th in Akron.

850
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:42,680
It's two weeks.

851
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:42,680


852
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:42,920
August 11th, 2007.

853
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,220
South Main Street.

854
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,740
Yeah, you could know about that.

855
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,800
Where the rubber meets the toads.

856
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,200
And the day before that here in Cleveland is the devotional.

857
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,640
2002.

858
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,040
At the Starwood Center.

859
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,020
712 East 185th Street.

860
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,560
What time is that?

861
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,280
There's going to be a mass baptism, isn't it?

862
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:00,840
At that event?

863
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,300
That's all day.

864
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,080
That's like all day Saturday.

865
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,980
A general boy.

866
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,600
Just head down to the Starwood Center.

867
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:05,920
All day long.

868
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,460
Will be there.

869
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,800
The sire, the progenitor of all the devos.

870
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:11,820
Jim.

871
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,300
John.

872
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,720
August 10th.

873
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,460
Jim Mothersbaugh.

874
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:19,440
And if it's like last year, there'll be home videos that Mark Mothersbaugh sends.

875
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,120
Well, this is Sunday.

876
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,020
I hope all the subgeniuses come out on a Sunday night.

877
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,300
After all, don't they all go to church on Sunday?

878
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:25,720
Pass the show.

879
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,680
Akron, man.

880
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,760
And have a big fat old chicken dinner underneath.

881
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,480
Rubber City.

882
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,440
Eight miles high.

883
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,500
And when you touch down.

884
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:42,100
You'll find that it's stranger than known.

885
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,800
Science in the streets.

886
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,540
That say where you're going.

887
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,160
Are somewhere just being their own.

888
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,140
Nowhere is there a walk to be found.

889
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,000
Unknown.

890
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,160
But most afraid of losing their ground.

891
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,640
Way, way down.

892
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,060
Known for its sound.

893
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,520
In places.

894
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,480
Small places.

895
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,580
And I.

896
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,520
What should I do?

897
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,380
My heart almost Ababeth Hijl.

898
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,380


899
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,380


900
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,440
How was I?

901
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,440


902
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,440


903
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,440


904
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,340
John.

905
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:02,340


906
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:02,680
Oh, um.

907
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,480
Who?

908
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:13,260
guitar solo

909
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,640
Down the stairs

910
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,520
A little storm

911
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,340
Some laughing

912
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,580
Some just shameless

913
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,180
Boys

914
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,220
