1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,220
E.T. Communications. Yeah, I know what they mean by that.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,300
Sellouts to the aliens, most of them.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,960
Aliens from outer space.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,080
What?

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,100
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,920
Bring in the Hueys, boys.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:24,980
Hey.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,880
There's the Explorer.

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,100
This sucks.

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,020
What's the matter with me?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,260
Nothing. We're just in the middle of some big-time international incident like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,700
Figured that out for yourself, did you, Hip?

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,900
You know, we got Russian subs creeping around.

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,940
Anything goes wrong down here, they can say whatever they want happening.

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,860
Give the folks medals.

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,980
Relax, will you? You're making the women nervous.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Cute, Virgil.

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,020
You know, you know, those seals ain't telling us deadly.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,500
Something is going on.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,880
Come on, come on.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,240
Hippie, you think everything's a conspiracy.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,940
Everything is.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,060
Coming to you live and almost live from the studio of the gods,

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,360
Microsat Studio 2, production facilities of Baby Alpha Communications,

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,200
in conjunction with radio station KDHX, brings you

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,300
The Gateway Dioxinville Subliminal Radio Ministry Hour.

27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,080
Oh, what?

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,700
Tonight's special guests.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,760
North America's premier performance art party band.

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,200
It's the more we need.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,360
The more we need.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,180
The more we need.

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,400
The more we need.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,840
The more we need.

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,480
The more we need.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,760
The more we need.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,400
The more we need.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,920
The more we need.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,980
The more we need.

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,460
The more we need.

41
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,820
The more we need.

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,820
The more we need.

43
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,760
Oh, well, we are here, dear friends, and so are you.

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm sorry, but that's where you are.

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,060
You're welcome to actually call the station if you want to.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,540
Yeah, you can if you want.

47
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,840
But on the other hand, perhaps you'd rather be listening to or watching TV.

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,460
You know, I hated to drag myself away from that network TV movie about Jim and Tammy Baker,

49
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,580
but my wife said it just is horrible.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
She said it's really bad.

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,260
So if you're in the middle of it, just leave your recorder or your VHS recorder on like I did

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,300
and turn your cassette recorder on to record something else,

53
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,200
because we can't tell you to record this show.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,700
And now.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,600
We don't want you to.

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,060
It's the word of Bob coming to you live from the Doge of South St. Louis,

58
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,740
the Pope of U City, Pope Cecil X. Nixon and Dr. Philo Drummond.

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,660
It's a new scary show here in St. Louis.

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,180
Dr. Drummond, chill.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
Somebody get Dr. Drummond some frock, please.

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,720
He's got the shape.

63
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,100
Thanks.

64
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,060
Now, I understand, Pope Cecil, that you have a few words here to start the show off

65
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,600
in an equal time vein from the opposition.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,540
So could you let us know about that?

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,360
That's right.

68
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,940
That's right.

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,220
We have a public service message about the Church of the Subgenius from the Stamp Out Bob.

70
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,220
That's the SOB committee.

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,520
The Church of the Subgenius, a craved threat that faces America today,

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,440
a threat that most people have been manipulated into thinking is merely a sick joke.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,180
By now, you've probably heard of the Church of the Subgenius.

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,360
They seem to have no trouble getting broad media coverage.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,120
Like me, when you were first told of their bizarre practices and beliefs,

76
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
you laughed, thinking it was a parody of kook religions.

77
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,480
Hello, friends, and welcome.

78
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,620
You know, I had something funny happen to me the other day.

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,040
It was after the service, and this little boy about yay tall come up out of nowhere and asked,

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,680
Father Jomama, what is the truth?

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,300
Well, I couldn't tell him then.

82
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,000
I wasn't sure.

83
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,740
But I am sure now.

84
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,200
So sit down, make yourselves comfortable, open up your hearts, and open up your minds.

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,300
Because tonight, friends, I'm going to tell you the truth.

86
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,080
Not just a little bit of the truth, mind you, but the whole truth, the full truth, and nothing but the truth.

87
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,680
Are you ready?

88
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,060
Good.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,700
Let us start with the small lies and work our way upward, shall we?

90
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,080
The Church of the Subgenius is...

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,800
A fraud!

92
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,980
A joke!

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,240
A scam developed to dupe you out of your hard-earned dollars!

94
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,880
Bob Dobbs doesn't exist.

95
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,960
He never did.

96
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,900
Far from inventing the Church, the Church invented him!

97
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,840
His so-called portrait is nothing more than a stupid little piece of clip art that was plagiarized and perverted for our own use.

98
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,140
The supposed disciples and holy men are just a bunch of imposters.

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,060
Jobless, would-be comedians that might have had a career in professional nightclub clowning, except for their problems with alcohol, drugs, chronic depression,

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
and, yes, sexual disorientation.

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,940
These so-called high priests wouldn't know what to do with a real job if it stared them in the face.

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Most of them never even had a decent job.

103
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,480
The other half were quickly fired if ever they did.

104
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,180
The most money they ever earned came from an unemployment check, or food stamps, or illegal commerce and illegal substances.

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,460
You want to know why the Churches quit your job?

106
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,160
Because misery loves company!

107
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,760
You want to know why the Churches challenge authority?

108
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,460
Because the authors are all in trouble with the authorities!

109
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,280
But... but what about the book?

110
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,120
The book, dear friends, the holy book of the subgenius!

111
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,040
It's still in print, millions have read it, it must be legitimate!

112
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,600
Ha!

113
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,940
Have you ever tried to make sense out of that book when you weren't high?

114
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,220
Did you ever try to explain it to someone else who wasn't high?

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,160
Have you ever tried to define just what slack is?

116
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,380
If you had, you would never be listening to bullshit artists like me.

117
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,860
You would have turned out this immature radio ministry long ago.

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,160
You would have done something constructive with your life.

119
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,020
You would have met some people that don't have to wear sunglasses

120
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,900
at night time.

121
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,300
You'd be earning money instead of spending it on this cutesy little parody

122
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,700
that's ended up perrin' in itself.

123
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,220
Don't you see?

124
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,500
This is a knock-knock joke that's knocked itself out!

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,260
It's a runnin' gag that's gagged on its own vomit.

126
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,040
It's a one-trick pony that stayed alive only because the Dungeons and Dragon nerds

127
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,120
had nothing better to spend their parents' money on.

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,820
Ten years from now, it won't even register a blip on the pop culture meter.

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,120
Once compared to hula hoops, pet rocks, or clackers at any rate, you'll be too embarrassed to tell your

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,820
kids about it, and good thing, because they won't even know what the hell you're talking about.

131
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,640
All they'll know is that you wasted part of their inheritance on it, and it ain't that typical.

132
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,120
And what about Stang, and Jane or Hyperclete, and Dr.

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,660
Howell, and Puzzlin' Evidence, and all those big names?

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,920
Let me ask you a question.

135
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,180
Have you ever seen so much of one of those celebs on a celebrity show?

136
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,380
Has one of them even made a five-second cameo in an above-ground movie or TV show?

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,860
Oh, but Mark Mothersburg of Devo and Jelly Biafra of the Dead Kennedys,

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,380
they all sung songs about Bob.

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,420
There's even a cartoon on Zippy the Pinhead.

140
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,220
Folks, I hate to be the one to break the news to you, but Devo and the DKs are defunct.

141
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,600
The lead singers are dried-out drug addicts rebounding from rehab.

142
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,300
Of course they're going to sing about Bob,

143
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,460
because the Christians won't touch him even if they had claimed to be saved.

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,300
The establishment wouldn't even touch him if they made a comeback.

145
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,100
Hell, the Ad Council won't touch him.

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,780
They won't even run any of their retarded public service announcements.

147
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,700
Nobody but the underworld even remembers who those losers are.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And as far as Zippy the Pinhead is concerned, well, I think the name says it all.

149
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,580
I mean, I'm sorry to have to be the one

150
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,480
to shine the bright light of reality into your over-dilated eyes.

151
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
I know it hurts, but it's for your own good.

152
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Get out there and get out of this stupid cult.

153
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,520
Get a job. Do something productive with your life.

154
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,680
It's time to grow up.

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,280
It's time to get real.

156
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,480
It's time to stop listening to goo goo gurus like me.

157
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,520
Here ended tonight's sermon.

158
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,960
Dear friends, there's I have to take issue with something he said.

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,360
Mark Mothersbaugh is not a drug addict in rehab.

160
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,820
Mark Mothersbaugh doesn't do.

161
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,500
Oh, and one little detail I almost forgot to mention.

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,920
How many religions freely admit that they're

163
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,020
fake and are only out to get your money?

164
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,460
How many church leaders have come forth and told you that they're sexual perverts?

165
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,980
That is, before they're caught and everybody knows anyway.

166
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,880
How many politicians have campaigned on a platform of honesty, telling all that the

167
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,200
real reason they're running is to satisfy their egos, promote the cells and gain power?

168
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,380
No salesman in the world would ever consider telling a potential buyer about

169
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,100
all the problems they're getting themselves into by buying that broken down, mileage

170
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,320
reverse, bent frame lemon mobile?

171
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,840
Only a salesman out of this world would do that and then expect to make the deal

172
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,140
and then expect to be thanked now and forevermore.

173
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,560
That sales God is honest.

174
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,300
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the only fraud never to commit fraud.

175
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,320
He's a fake, but you can shake on it.

176
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,240
He'll smile, look you square in the eye and say, I promise not to make any promises.

177
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,760
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the

178
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,140
only true religion.

179
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,040
Of honest liars, honest cheats and honest thieves.

180
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,200
The Church of the Subgenius.

181
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,340
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

182
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,340
If you can't trust Bob, you can't trust anybody.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,660
Herein is the word of Bob.

184
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,820
Praise Bob.

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,380
It's unbelievable.

186
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,740
OK, it's clear.

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,560
It's all yours, sir.

188
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,040
Yeah, I can see that.

189
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,760
Topside, topside.

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,380
Pay out some slack. We're getting dragged.

191
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,600
Down on number one, Rich.

192
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,300
We're getting dragged.

193
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,360
Down on one.

194
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,560
The Church of the Subgenius is a real cult that is out to turn you and your family

195
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,000
into wild eyed dogma spouting, panhandling zombies for the grinning guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,940
Excuse me, getting carried away.

197
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
You let that guy in here.

198
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,160
Who is this guy?

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,700
I mean, this is supposed to be a pro Bob, isn't it?

200
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,500
He sounds like he's from Citizens for Normalcy or something worse.

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,320
He could be employed here.

202
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,900
Don't fall under their spell, Bob.

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,980
I know you've been associated with all of the media ranting and hypes and everything, but.

204
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,100
Eid-Frag.

205
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,780
Freedback.

206
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,820
Hold on to yourself, Bob.

207
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,400
Screed-Mac.

208
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,780
There's still a chance.

209
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,960
Before the sub-programming sets in.

210
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,940
Wow.

211
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,920
So who are you guys and why are you here?

212
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,640
Why are we here?

213
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,980
What is the purpose of this endeavor?

214
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,200
We're here to get free advertisement on public radio.

215
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:11,100
The world's best rock and roll band, The Swinging Love Corpses.

216
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,840
And talk a little bit about Bob and anti-Bob.

217
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,060
Oh, yeah.

218
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,300
Speaking of the swinging love corpses.

219
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,300


220
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,300


221
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,560
And speaking of commercial plugs, I do have to get a word in for one of our sponsors.

222
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:30,280
So if we can just throw this in, guys, we'll be right back to the important religious discussion here on the Dioxinville subgenius radio hour.

223
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:38,260
Located in the basement of the Donut King Drive-In is a new and unique dining experience freeway close, but far enough to work up one heck of an appetite.

224
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,260
It's Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow restaurant.

225
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes, Leg of the Crow. Dining au naturel, nude and informal.

226
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,360
As it was in Rome before the tourists came.

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,180
Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restroom, where your host, Vincent, is ever ready to tickle your palate with a golden feather.

228
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,260
And the bathroom's just a quick drop down the hall.

229
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,600
Leg of the Crow, where the salad's tossed at you, not at your table.

230
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,380
And sharing dessert with a stranger is almost a way of life.

231
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,000
And if you want to drink your dinner and dunk your date, there's a wine list that make a Greek burp.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,180
Ha!

233
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,240
And a glass of wine that's just right for you to drink at your table, and an aluminum thumb screw just like Daddy used to do.

234
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,140
Whet your whistle with these fine selections.

235
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,920
Chablis, Beau Cholet, Nippon Cadet, Cabernet, Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir.

236
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,740
Red, white, blue, any year.

237
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,540
You name it, we print it, you drink it at Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow restaurant.

238
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,940
Conveniently located near the medical center.

239
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,380
Color TV in every room.

240
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,720
Phonetically translated.

241
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,340
Real French menu.

242
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,380
Food to go and free doggy bags supplied with every order of Vietnamese food.

243
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,220
At Vincent Tomein's domain, the Crippled Crow.

244
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,240
And remember, you only live once, but you have to eat every day.

245
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,100
Come on, break down and become a member.

246
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,180
You're a member of the Crippled Crow family.

247
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,020
In the Bible, they talk about the end times of the tribulations.

248
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,120
Well, it really refers to the re-tribulations or the re-tribalization.

249
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:36,180
So the individualist heritage of the Western world is identifying with the tribal archetypes preserved through the centuries in the Third World.

250
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,540
Now, those cultures are under identity crisis too, but this is our hypocrisy in relation to them.

251
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,840
We wake up the values of their culture.

252
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,520
And as we consume them, they consume us.

253
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:54,160
And we become more Western as we try to consume what we feel is the whole idea of the noble savage and the tribal person, right?

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:05,580
Yeah, so we have this worldwide trade on software cultural images feeding off each other as an anti-environment to the pain and the incredible pleasure of the imploded, discarded effect.

255
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,780
So the...

256
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,440
This is the tribulation that's come back to the West.

257
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,800
It's the tribal...

258
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,380
It is a specter of our past that we destroyed with visual space, you know?

259
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,060
And we're trying to regain it and thereby destroying it even more.

260
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:32,480
Yeah, and our hypocrisy is that we don't tell the Third World that we appreciate their culture out of our own illness.

261
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,960
Right.

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
All we say is, you should appreciate ours and embrace ours.

263
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,360
And we don't even say that anymore.

264
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,920
We're giving them land.

265
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,940
We're decentralizing it.

266
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,040
But we won't tell them.

267
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,300
And there are people in the secret pink prison control factor who know the hypocrisy of what I'm talking about.

268
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,980
And they plan to keep that hidden.

269
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,880
That's why you're only going to hear it on my show.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,520
The hidden knowledge that the oligarchs are using.

271
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,200
They celebrate the New Age, the various cultural things.

272
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,280
They celebrate this as a distraction.

273
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
That's what we got to...

274
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,520
We got to have the guts to, like that caller say, do nothing tomorrow when we get out.

275
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,260
Don't read.

276
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,740
Don't turn on the TV.

277
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,260
And then just see what happens to us.

278
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,820
We might get into trouble, but...

279
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,480
No time, no distance, no place to hide.

280
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,680
God will destroy Russia.

281
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
God will destroy Russia.

282
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,500
God, God, God will destroy Russia.

283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Oh, Lord, our God.

284
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,600
Help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells.

285
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,500
Help us to cover them with our blood.

286
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,700
Help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of the dead.

287
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,460
Help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded.

288
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,820
Riding in pain.

289
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,640
A prayer for war.

290
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
A prayer for war.

291
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,360
A prayer for war.

292
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,060
A prayer for war.

293
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,100
A prayer for war.

294
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:21,100
In the new period, World War III could begin anywhere at any moment.

295
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,920
Oh, Lord, our God.

296
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,080
Help us to waste our humble homes in a hurricane of fire.

297
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,720
Help us to wring the unabending hearts of their widows with grief.

298
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:44,780
Help us to turn them out with their children to wander the waste of their desolated land.

299
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,000
A prayer for war.

300
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,720
A prayer for war.

301
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,580
A prayer for war.

302
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,620
A prayer for war.

303
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,640
A prayer for war.

304
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,420
A prayer for war.

305
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,620
A prayer for war.

306
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,400
Integrity.

307
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,920
Black the hopes and black the lives of their bitter pilgrimage

308
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,900
Make heavy the steps and water the way with tears, my Lord

309
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,660
Stay the way slow with the blood of the wounded feet, my Lord

310
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,460
For we ask you to split the night

311
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,060
God, for this boy, my God

312
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,040
God, for this boy, my God

313
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,340
America

314
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,920
Bombs, air to surface missiles, think that's a whole car for this boy, Russia

315
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,220
In the nuclear war, war for a day could be done in a year's prayer

316
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,460
God himself will effect his passion to beat again the Soviet troops

317
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,720
And actually destroy five-sixths of the Soviet troops

318
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,620
Upon the mountain of Israel, not the U.S.

319
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,260
God will destroy Russia

320
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,620
America will destroy Russia

321
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:09,560
America will destroy Sweden

322
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,200
America will destroy Ukraine

323
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,220
America will destroy Sweden

324
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,800
America will destroy the Ukraine

325
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,000
America will destroy Russia

326
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,160
America will destroy Russia

327
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,240
America will destroy Russia

328
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,320
America will destroy Russia

329
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,460
America will destroy Russia

330
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:19,460


331
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,400
America will destroy Russia

332
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,420
America will destroy Russia

333
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,020
America will destroy Russia

334
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,440
So, yeah, I think the third world is not being told what...

335
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,920
I mean, we know the third world is a cliché,

336
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,620
but let's just use it for the course of this.

337
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,160
The third world is not being told the real truth of our culture,

338
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,380
and we're not being told the real truth of our culture.

339
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,860
So only I do that.

340
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,300
It drives us to consume other cultures.

341
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,360
Yeah, it's anesthetics.

342
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,040
It's called tri-anesthetic, and this is what's funny.

343
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,760
And it's censorship, too, in a way.

344
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,860
In what sense?

345
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,060
In the sense that there is no mass outlet

346
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,400
for what I could call alternative ideas,

347
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,520
what we might be talking about tonight,

348
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,920
because only those ideas which are accepted

349
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,740
are those which are in the hands of the status quo,

350
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,640
which reaches the wider audience,

351
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,660
which makes people brain-dead.

352
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,380
And you either have to submit,

353
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,780
or you have to join the spectacle, you know, the...

354
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,400
The invasion of bodies, yeah, the kind of thing.

355
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,380
The loudspeaker spoke up and said,

356
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,220
Christianity is stupid.

357
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,060
Christianity is stupid.

358
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,060
Christianity is stupid.

359
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,180
Christianity is stupid.

360
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:49,640
Christianity is stupid.

361
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,200
Christianity is stupid.

362
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,960
Christianity is stupid.

363
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,640
Christianity is stupid.

364
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,260
Christianity is stupid.

365
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:09,660


366
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,540
Communism is good.

367
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,440
Communism is good.

368
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,660
Well, friends, actually, it was the loudspeaker that spoke up and said that,

369
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,860
not me, dear friends.

370
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,500
Not me.

371
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,940
Even though I get the credits on the liner notes, I think you'll...

372
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,620
Meanwhat?

373
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
But I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

374
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,940
But I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

375
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,800
But I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

376
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,380
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

377
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,960
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

378
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,540
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

379
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,500
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

380
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,640
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

381
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,500
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

382
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,900
I didn't get the credits on these liner notes.

383
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Well, there's one of Bob's favorite rock and roll bands,

384
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:24,400
the ex-presidents, coming to you here on the Subgenius Radio Hour on KDHX St. Louis.

385
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,120
No, no, it's KNON in Dallas, Texas.

386
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,880
Wouldn't want to mix you up or anything.

387
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,680
I'm not into business, actually.

388
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,280
Those are the guys that are into trombone-propelled...

389
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,620
Trombone-propelled...

390
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,300
Hamsters.

391
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:38,920
Hamsters.

392
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,540
That's right.

393
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Ultrasonic transducers.

394
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,260
That's right.

395
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,880
I hear that the SPCA is really upset with them

396
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,720
because of the way they put those hamsters down

397
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,660
inside the trombone and they land on the wall.

398
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,540
It's the duct tape that really fries their bananas, though.

399
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,880
That's what's really bringing them down.

400
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,780
They play the trombones too hard and it hurts the hamsters' ears.

401
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,520
That's what they really are getting upset about.

402
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,280
Nose turns red.

403
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,900
You can tell when their blood pressure's too high.

404
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,260
Right.

405
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,020
And a lot of the hamsters are bored by the music, too.

406
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,940
And they're in tears.

407
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,420
They're really critical of the...

408
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,060
We are going to...

409
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,880
No, no, no.

410
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,100
We're out of tickets.

411
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,540
We're out of tickets.

412
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah, we won't be having any more tickets for the hamster review.

413
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,280
Neither Leon Rapone, Kaiser, or Discanso.

414
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,540
The trombone propelled the hamster, though.

415
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,120
Will boys and girls...

416
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,860
You know, Ken Nordean was around here a minute ago

417
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,580
and I can't find him now.

418
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,980
And that's really got me perplexed.

419
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,360
I can't think of anything else.

420
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,900
My mind is a total standstill.

421
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,420
Well, I hate to interrupt this...

422
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
A big block.

423
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,700
This gay repartee.

424
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:36,840
A door.

425
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
A metal door is slammed.

426
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,360
It's not gay repartee.

427
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,080
It's not.

428
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,400
Well, I hate to interrupt this straight repartee,

429
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,780
but could one of you tell us a little bit about

430
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,080
what the heck is this Church of the Subgenius, anyway?

431
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,580
I mean...

432
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,520
I mean, Pope or perhaps Doctor,

433
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,260
would you care to comment on that?

434
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,760
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is a pan-galactic religion

435
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,320
for all superior mutants and renegade weirdos.

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,040
It's actually a paradox in terms

437
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,220
because of the fact that the people that it caters to most

438
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,000
are those that would join the most unreadily.

439
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,140
As an undefinable market segment

440
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,780
subgeniuses are those that, for the most part,

441
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,800
won't join anything.

442
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,300
Right.

443
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,440
Right.

444
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,620
Right.

445
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,300
This is the society of non-joiners.

446
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,320
It's kind of hard to...

447
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,820
A society of non-joiners.

448
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,660
By very definition, the organization cannot exist.

449
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,040
That's right.

450
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,980
And so, therefore, one of the major tenets of the religion

451
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,420
is that as soon as you understand that,

452
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,880
that you start your own schism.

453
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,740
Exactly.

454
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
You gotta go for it.

455
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,120
So, therefore, it's a cult of leaders and nobles,

456
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,520
no followers.

457
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,020
Isn't that nice?

458
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,660
And, of course, all leaders in the cult will bow deference

459
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,900
to the guru, our high E-pop, Bob.

460
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,600
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

461
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,020
Bob Dobbs.

462
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

463
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,060
Right.

464
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,780
The saint of sales, the patron saint of sales,

465
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,440
worshipped by salesmen the world over.

466
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,620
He's possibly the salesman from legend

467
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,000
of all the traveling salesman jokes

468
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,960
that you've heard about over the years.

469
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,580
I knew it was something like that.

470
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,620
On your mail.

471
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,060
I knew it was something like that.

472
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,220
And you call up and say,

473
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,260
another truth, I didn't get my answer.

474
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,740
I didn't get my package.

475
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,940
But praises be unto an almighty God.

476
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,980
I do my best to rush you your answer right back.

477
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,500
For many of you forget to put your address

478
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,320
and to put your zip code.

479
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,380
So, have some do that you may be able to receive

480
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,440
your package back.

481
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,040
Take a little time.

482
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,260
Write your name and your address

483
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,420
and your zip code plainly.

484
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,460
So we can get you your packages back.

485
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,220
Because we want you to be helped,

486
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,020
blessed and receive your blessings from God.

487
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,800
Because this is a God sent plan for you.

488
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,940
And dear friends, Sister Truth is not kidding.

489
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,760
We want you to get those Bob blessed packages from us.

490
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,240
And it turns out that although we mailed the stark fist of removals to you,

491
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,180
the badness of your existence means that we continue to be

492
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,040
making correct progressions on your authority in the everyday longup.

493
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,600
We, who are called the STR faudent of faith,

494
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,560
may say this to you,

495
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,100
but I'm sure many of you don't know that

496
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


497
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


498
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


499
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


500
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


501
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


502
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


503
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,100


504
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,700
many, many of you have changed addresses

505
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,420
without letting us know.

506
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,360
I mean, remember to put your return address

507
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,200
on those love offerings.

508
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,060
But and.

509
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,380
You can correct this by just sending your new

510
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,880
address to the subgenius post office box,

511
00:27:46,400 --> 00:28:04,540
A whole lot of you, like a couple of dozen at least, three, four dozen, 50, 60,000 people here in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex have been mailed their stark fists and never got them because you were too stupid to send your change address.

512
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
I know what you're doing out there.

513
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:14,100
I've seen you sitting there fooling around with your Playboy magazines, your MTV, and you forget.

514
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,160
I don't blame you.

515
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,780
I don't blame you.

516
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:23,900
You forget to send that change of address when you're evicted from one apartment or when you quit living with your parents or whatever,

517
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,020
or when you get fired from your job and go back to living with your parents.

518
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,500
I understand.

519
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,820
It's not a big deal.

520
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,520
We don't look down on you for living off of your parents or changing your addresses every three weeks,

521
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,580
but we want to know where you are if you sent your love offering.

522
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,560
And, of course, we'll probably get a flood.

523
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,120
We'll probably get a flood of people saying,

524
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,560
Yeah, I changed my address to this address, so please send me my free magazine.

525
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,720
Well, I'm sorry.

526
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,520
If you ever send us money, it's on the computer.

527
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,340
So you better, in case you do send your new address, please send your real name

528
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:09,520
or whatever fake name you used when you originally ordered Subgenius Materials for free

529
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,880
from Bob at Post Office Box 140.

530
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,460
306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

531
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:30,740
That's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

532
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,160
And we'll give that number again at the end of the broadcast.

533
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
Praise Bob and thank you, dear friends.

534
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,240
Yes.

535
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,180
Thank you.

536
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,260
Well, I think it's time to say goodbye to you.

537
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,960
Yes, you were.

538
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,820
Look, son, you've got a golden opportunity here to talk to King Stang.

539
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,580
I don't know why you're going on like this.

540
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,400
You know he won't be here forever.

541
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,480
Yeah, those callers, I can't believe their behavior on the air.

542
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,860
Jeez, it's so embarrassing.

543
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,160
Well, you know, this is California, King Stang,

544
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,380
and it's not uncommon to have a total stranger walk up and throw up all their emotions right on your shoes.

545
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:27,920
Ew.

546
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,760
I trust that Bob will forgive me at least, Bob, if you're listening.

547
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,040
And I know that you do.

548
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,860
We get it from a hospital.

549
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,460
All the time.

550
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,600
I know, Bob, that you will forgive me and perhaps even these poor Californians.

551
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,420
Where?

552
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:43,840
Who?

553
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,000
Well, I don't know.

554
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,480
You certainly can't meet us.

555
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,960
I don't see any.

556
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm looking, but...

557
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm from Ohio myself.

558
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,100
And have mercy, Bob, on these callers.

559
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,640
I know that guy over there is from Guam.

560
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,380
Even Bob and Reverend Nancy there is from Louisiana.

561
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,820
So save most of your mercy for the listeners at large.

562
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,360
For they're the ones that are truly needed.

563
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,300
They're the martyred ones, Bob, and I know that you can understand how that feels, Bob.

564
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,200
Bob.

565
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,700
Because...

566
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,580
More pills, Bob.

567
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,660
It wasn't really our fault that the show was like this.

568
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,860
What's that?

569
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,640
Oh, it wasn't?

570
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,500
It wasn't just the sound of nails being scraped across the pavement.

571
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,160
Now they want to blame...

572
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,460
Now they want to blame Bob on it.

573
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,660
It wasn't just the sound of the cash register chaining away.

574
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,580
Yeah, chaining away.

575
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,300
What's the end of the page?

576
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,180
Turn the page and what's the next part of the script?

577
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,800
I don't know.

578
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,400
There's an awful lot of applause here for something that was so old.

579
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,700
No joke at all.

580
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,500
That's right.

581
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,540
We've given up on jokes because there's only ten minutes left.

582
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,080
And we've given up on the music.

583
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,560
And we've given up on the callers.

584
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,300
And we've given up on Bob.

585
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,400
Hello, I'm on the air.

586
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:58,980
Oops.

587
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
Except for that little guy there.

588
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,120
Look at him.

589
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,100
He's waving his arms around.

590
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,640
Now, I've got some serious important business to talk about.

591
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,940
I was saying I'd appreciate it if you guys would just kind of pipe down there in the background.

592
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,700
Okay, shoot.

593
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,100
Yeah.

594
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,220
No, wait a minute.

595
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:13,940
Now, I've been...

596
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,400
Church has...

597
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,960
I think you hit him.

598
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,760
Has been raking in some rather considerable revenues lately.

599
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,780
Here's that thing again.

600
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,700
Oh, I can see that you know exactly what you're talking about.

601
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,000
I certainly do.

602
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,900
So, please go ahead.

603
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,020
And so my question is, listen, maybe it's about time we talked about all these millions of dollars you owe me.

604
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,900
Oh, it makes me laugh, too.

605
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,260
Millions of dollars, huh?

606
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,580
Yeah, I'm the founder of the...

607
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,580
Yeah, okay.

608
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,400
Here's your money.

609
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,920
Look at those bags of money falling from the sky.

610
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,980
Those are solid coins.

611
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,680
They could hurt that guy, too, if he tried to catch him.

612
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,140
Oh, wow.

613
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,500
He's still not convinced.

614
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,120
Oh, my God.

615
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh, my God.

616
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,180
Oh, my God.

617
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,480
Oh, my God.

618
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,540
Oh, my God.

619
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,540


620
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,540


621
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,540


622
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,540


623
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,280
I'm the Swami.

624
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,740
You ain't no Swami.

625
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,820
Now, watch.

626
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,060
The spirits will move the ketchup.

627
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,020
Ah, you kicked the table.

628
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,580
No, I didn't, creep face.

629
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,900
I'm the Swami.

630
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,060
That's just a dish towel around your head.

631
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,060
It's the turban, a hoopie doopie.

632
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,540
Now, the spirits are gonna move the dishes.

633
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,000
You pulled the table, Clark.

634
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,980
No, I didn't, chicken mouth, head fart.

635
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,240
I got powers.

636
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,760
You're just pushing stuff around.

637
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,120
I am the Swami.

638
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,760
I can make you go to sleep.

639
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,880
Are you awake?

640
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
Knock two times for yes.

641
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,800
Ha-ha.

642
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,620
I did it.

643
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,720
I'm gonna try my powers in the woods.

644
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,700
Ding, ding, ding.

645
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,800
Ding, ding, ding.

646
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,140
Ding, ding, ding.

647
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm not being starved or beaten.

648
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,660
Who are you?

649
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,860
What do I think? What do I think?

650
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,460
Who are you?

651
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,260
I'm your friend Bob.

652
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,620
Not being starved or beaten.

653
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,960
Don't be sorry.

654
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
Not unnecessarily frightened.

655
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,020
Not being un-fake.

656
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,140
Not fake.

657
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,920
Who are you?

658
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,700
Not being totally free.

659
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,540
I'm Bob. I'm going to give you slack, dear sister.

660
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,140
Not being starved or beaten.

661
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,840
Not unnecessarily frightened.

662
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,860
Not unnecessarily frightened.

663
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:58,860


664
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,140
Not being starved or beaten.

665
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,340
Not unnecessarily frightened.

666
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,420
That's so much fun. I really enjoyed that.

667
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,040
Oh, Deborah, pass me those Kleenexes.

668
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,900
Oh, here. Enjoy this toilet paper instead, Dr. Drummond.

669
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,660
That's the official KTHX circular Kleenex.

670
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Patty Hearst had such a hard time in life.

671
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,800
She really did.

672
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
From well...

673
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
To well...

674
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,340
To well...

675
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


676
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,460
To having to go through that horrible ordeal that she did.

677
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,900
It just breaks my heart.

678
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,120
Spending money doing demon markets.

679
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,060
And then she found the closet.

680
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,920
Praise Bob on the day she found that closet in the garbage can.

681
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:46,300
Pope Cecil, there's a lot of our listeners have been wondering if you're still having a problem with that manifestation that appeared on your back.

682
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,500
You know, the truss.

683
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,220
Yes, the hickey truss of Bob.

684
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,140
The one that's...

685
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:57,420
It's like a holographic image that appeared on your back.

686
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,620
What happened to that?

687
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,120
I mean, whatever became of that?

688
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,060
I guess you know...

689
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:19,580
As much as a tattoo is removed by pulling a graft of skin loose and folding another little flap daintily over it, electrons were induced into a substrate flow slightly under the skin surface, setting up this pyroflagellation vibration.

690
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,120
Did they use magnets?

691
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,520
Did they use magnets with that?

692
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,800
It's a very large toroidal device, yes.

693
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,580
Well, you know what they say.

694
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,540
I thought there was a dog sniffing my...

695
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,660
Was there a dog in here?

696
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,580
I think there's a dog sniffing my hand.

697
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,520
What is...

698
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,160
Where is that?

699
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
I think that's one of these Dobbs groupies.

700
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,060
We have to throw him out of the studio.

701
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,380
Well, you know what they say, gentlemen.

702
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,700
Gentlemen, you know what they say.

703
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,660
A lawyer who defends himself as a fool for a client, a doctor who practices on himself has a heck of a sport for a patient.

704
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,260
And I applaud you doctors.

705
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,560
You're kidding.

706
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,820
That's really...

707
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:46,960
I...

708
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,100
Doctors that operate on themselves have got to be successful.

709
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,100


710
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,720
They're going to be some of the bravest people around.

711
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,340
Right.

712
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,060
They really are.

713
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,520
Right.

714
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,580
Let's do some brain surgery here in the studio this afternoon.

715
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,300
All right.

716
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,020
We had some memory.

717
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,880
Should we have a caller call in and respond to some of the various...

718
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,260
Are those those abusive callers that call in and go...

719
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,580
This is one of these guys who...

720
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:09,760
...

721
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,480
No, it's one of those guys who just discovered what the phone is for.

722
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,620
It's very exciting.

723
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,840
I remember my first beer or two guy, no problem.

724
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,180
They know how to make a connection, but they don't know what they're supposed to do after that.

725
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:20,880
Hey!

726
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,100


727
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,760
And now what do I do?

728
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,780
He's chasing the short bus and we've got to respect that.

729
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,140
Oh yeah.

730
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,500
You're a candidate for acu-beating.

731
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,380
I punched this number and this is what happened.

732
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,920
... light blasting in front of my brain.

733
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,100
The caller.

734
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,380
Now what about it?

735
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,860
Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

736
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,360
The one listener here on the...

737
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,520
Only point light to this stupid show!

738
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,540
Every one person.

739
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,660
848-4425 if you want to replace this guy with yourself.

740
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,900
What a neat thing.

741
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:50,900


742
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,080
More people out there.

743
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,440
More people in the studio than are actually listening to the show.

744
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,540
We hope...

745
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,300
Well, that's often the case.

746
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,740
I'd be happy to.

747
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,720
Yeah, me too.

748
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
If only...

749
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,660
If only we could.

750
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,100
Do I just...

751
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,980
Oh, you're happy, aren't you?

752
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,420
Remember, there is no God.

753
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,680
There is no right or wrong.

754
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,220
Do your own thing.

755
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,220
The Bible is outdated and witchcraft and the occult are in.

756
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,380
Your parents can't punish you.

757
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,980
Bob can't punish you.

758
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,320
Hey.

759
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,860
Hey, Doug.

760
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,160
You there?

761
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:31,700
Yeah.

762
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,840
Philo!

763
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,780
I've been yakking for 30 minutes and...

764
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,020
I've been on the air.

765
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,660
... to hear what it sounded like and...

766
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,140
I'm sorry.

767
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,340
... there wasn't anything there.

768
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,500
You didn't tune...

769
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,460
It's 89.3, Dr. Drummond.

770
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,560
What?

771
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,080
Oh, no.

772
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,580
No!

773
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm sorry.

774
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,200


775
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,200


776
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,200


777
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,200


778
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,680
You just didn't tune it.

779
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:57,680


780
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:57,680


781
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,540
It's a story.

782
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,540


783
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,540


784
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,540


785
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,880
I can't find my shoes.

786
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:10,360
I see the heavens spread before me and, as I raise a corner of the way to the world,

787
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,080
I can reach out and touch the infinite...

788
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,640
Okay, keep listening.

789
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,580
Try it.

790
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,180
Let go.

791
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,180


792
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,180


793
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,180


794
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,180


795
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,180


796
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,180


797
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,840
It wasn't till years later that I realized the full impact of what he had told me that day.

798
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,300
Dinner could save our life.

799
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,160
Yet here on a mountainside, disguised by white powdered snow,

800
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,200
draped about our nostrils, we couldn't decide whether we were coming or going.

801
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,360
As we came and went, we remembered the soldiers as they lay in the snow,

802
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,560
dead and without reason, and the things they said in those days.

803
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,640
Their packs slashed and their noses covered with raspberry jam.

804
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,620
They were ancient soldiers and they didn't know what they were talking about.

805
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,460
But they tried and tried and tried hard and paid taxes and tied their shoes in the morning.

806
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,540
And no, it really didn't matter then.

807
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,300
The bleeding hair.

808
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,220
And resurrect.

809
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,100
They were just like us.

810
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,980
Where is...

811
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,000
It's time to launch the head.

812
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,320
Launch the head and glory.

813
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:27,900
Glory.

814
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:27,900


815
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:27,900


816
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,080
Glory.

817
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,260
Glory.

818
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,260


819
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,300
Glory.

820
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,320
Glory.

821
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


822
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


823
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


824
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


825
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


826
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


827
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


828
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


829
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


830
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,320


831
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,100
Joyous occasion.

832
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,580
How you feeling, Sterno?

833
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,220
So I just figured I'd go back to the farm.

834
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,880
Sterno, can you say anything?

835
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,120
Get it on.

836
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,200
I was born again.

837
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,380
And Bob made sure I died again.

838
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,080
And now I've been born a third time.

839
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,700
Born twice.

840
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,040
So the rumors were true.

841
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,340
By the women.

842
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,720
By the women.

843
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,260
What you have to do to it.

844
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,040
Praise Barbara.

845
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,320
The body of a man born of a woman.

846
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,920
The body of a man.

847
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,000
The body of a man.

848
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,140
The body of a woman.

849
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,200
The body of a man.

850
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,180
The body of a woman.

851
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,180


852
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,420
The body of a man.

853
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,300
Born again.

854
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,260
Born again.

855
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,520
Born again.

856
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:21,640
Born again.

857
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:21,640


858
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,660
Oh, dear friends.

859
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,180
I can't say as how I can...

860
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,420
It's a miracle!

861
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,440
It's a miracle!

862
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,820
Yes, it is, Buck.

863
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,320
This is a miracle!

864
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,300
It's a miracle!

865
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,740
It's a miracle!

866
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,840
It is a miracle, Buck.

867
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,000
And I can't say as how I can explain what you've been hearing, dear friends.

868
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,900
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

869
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,960
And you're hearing puzzling evidence and glass madness in the background.

870
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,960
Along with the...

871
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
1982 World

872
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,740
Subgenius Convention and

873
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,420
overlapped commentary

874
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,240
from other

875
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,280
centuries and I

876
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,540
don't get it either. None of us get it.

877
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,480
Come on. Okay. More show.

878
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,400
More show. Shove

879
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,260
the show down their ears

880
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,440
right now as much as you can

881
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,240
get down there, down that funnel.

882
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,560
Just cram it.

883
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,140
Yes, it's so good to see

884
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,400
the show forced down their

885
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,120
little listener ears.

886
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,200
Oh, if only we could put them down

887
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,380
the caller ears, but we don't have

888
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,280
callers here in Dallas. Nay, we

889
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,200
can only play tapes of callers from other

890
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,480
towns screaming and yelling

891
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,360
in the background as you hear

892
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,280
right now

893
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,680
from California. Thank you.

894
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,280
The Jell-O.

895
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,740
Colonel, the Jell-O is ready.

896
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,020
Colonel, the Jell-O is ready.

897
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,180
Well, that was pretty anticlimactic,

898
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,000
I've got to admit.

899
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,220
But you never know. I mean, sometimes

900
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,400
we hit just right.

901
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,780
Sometimes the tapes...

902
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,360
...go on to win high honors in combat

903
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,880
in the name of his father, El Tango

904
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,820
President. Thank you. Thank you.

905
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,500
I accept this honor

906
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,280
with

907
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,180
tremendous humility.

908
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,940
...van mail from some foreign...

909
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,460
I am

910
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,780
the almost Reverend Gopher Rock yourself,

911
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,860
the first fundamentalist church of the

912
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,980
Sweet Honey and the Money

913
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,220
Church of the Subgenius.

914
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,380
And in New York...

915
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,800
...in the interest of healing this jism-schism,

916
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,500
I am going to offer myself as the sacrifice...

917
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,200
Male sacrifice.

918
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,820
...the male sacrifice. Yes, friends.

919
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,900
And you can make a male sacrifice

920
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,360
by writing through the mails to...

921
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,680
Give me an idea.

922
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,380
What?

923
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,440
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

924
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,080
Okay, to Post Office Box.

925
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,160
What about you? You got an idea?

926
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,860
Yeah, yeah, my idea is write to Post Office Box,

927
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:49,540
what is it? Oh, 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

928
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,080
Yes, I'll say that number again.

929
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,260
Friends, you can write for free information

930
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,560
about just what's going on and why the women

931
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,140
at the convention in 1982 were launching

932
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,580
the bleeding head themselves and usurping

933
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,420
the glorious power of the Clayton Williams

934
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,180
as he tried to raise up and...

935
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,500
...launch in his own head and be serviced

936
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,800
in the service of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

937
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,100
That man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

938
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,120
But no, Connie had to come in and decide

939
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,040
she was gonna write down some new rules.

940
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,760
She took the bleeding head hostage.

941
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,440
And she and her evil women compadres

942
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,120
or compadres were demanding that we provide

943
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,780
the bleeding of Bob and the six-pack of chili

944
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,740
and several other things.

945
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,060
But how can you know, how can you really know

946
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,860
whether you have slack unless you write

947
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,300
for the free information from...

948
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:09,180
...Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

949
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,920
Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

950
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,500
75214.

951
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:15,980
That's...

952
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:32,580
That's Bob at Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

953
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,880
75214.

954
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,760
Give up. Give up.

955
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,620
Give up.

956
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,660
17 hours a day.

957
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,540
Give up. Give up.

958
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,320
Give up. Give up.

959
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,440
Give up. Give up.

960
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,520
Thank you. Thank you.

961
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,540
It has been a great show, I admit.

962
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,160
I am sick and tired of hearing about all of the...

963
00:46:59,160 --> 00:46:59,180
What? What?

964
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,180


965
00:46:59,340 --> 00:46:59,840
...radicals...

966
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,560
...and the perverts...

967
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,200
...and the liberals...

968
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,580
...and the leftists...

969
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,800
...and the communists...

970
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,520
coming out of the closets. It's time for God's people to come out of the closets, out of the

971
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,200
churches, and change America. We must do it.

972
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,280
We are reaching tens of millions of people every day.

973
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,120
Television has brought this awareness to the masses.

974
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,460
And satellites and computer printout page.

975
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,720
There's a brand new need of Pharisee for an electronic age.

976
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:00,980
From a last of me, home of the brave, white, then squeaky clean.

977
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,400
People prosperous and odious.

978
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,140
With malignant piety.

979
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,580
Yeah, these are the men who put the right to righteous.

980
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,040
Hypocrisy and Christianity is truly out of sight.

981
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,380
Jesus loves America.

982
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,700
But I don't love him either.

983
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,680
Jesus loves America.

984
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,780
But I don't love him either.

985
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:36,780


986
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,640
Well, frankly friends, I think that's a bunch of seditious nonsense.

987
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,140
I love America.

988
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,080
Well, I don't love both.

989
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,960
That was In Gorbachev We Trust.

990
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,540
I forgot what this one is.

991
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,400
Put it in a little pause.

992
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,600
carved on a quarry bed like a

993
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:24,700
pay note

994
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:24,920
Uh,

995
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,660
aunts

996
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,560
our bodies

997
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,880
we are god

998
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,020
because only we can create the idea of his existence in our holy brains

999
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,460
the idea of his son

1000
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,600
it's in the most diabolical ideas

1001
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,200
in the entire universe of man

1002
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,760
a revival of the universe

1003
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:06,760


1004
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:06,760


1005
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:06,760


1006
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,020
It is believed that you are no phantom when without

1007
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:20,880
This life is but a thousand nation years for each of brother Domingo

1008
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:54,420
We all know Domingo Santa Clara will be born today, tomorrow and the day after

1009
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,160
Millions of times till the end of the universe

1010
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,460
I will smile on his face to ask about species

1011
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,220
What is the catastrophe?

1012
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,920
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

1013
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,140
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

1014
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,660
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

1015
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,900
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

1016
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:12,940
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

1017
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,300
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

1018
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,560
Oh yes dear friends and that was er....

1019
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,360
Well actually that was either they might be giants or yellow or art of noise

1020
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:50,160
I don't know which and frankly you listeners please don't call in and try to tell us which one it is as if we were stupid idiots that can't even write down on our cassette, tiny little cassette labels that other people send us what these things are.

1021
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,780
Trying to show off how you know who they are, you're so hip.

1022
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,380
Well, we're so hip we don't even care who they are. How's that?

1023
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:07,320
And you can be just as cool man if you would only do what this guy says right now.

1024
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,640
Under that situation, it's a planet of the dead.

1025
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:18,520
And the alternative is not to offer other ideas because they'll be quickly consumed and recycled and played out.

1026
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:26,920
So the real alternative is a kind of new yoga, an environmental yoga, not a private spiritual or eastern yoga.

1027
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,820
The new yoga is to deal with the environments we've created.

1028
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,360
And we all...

1029
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:30,580
We all share.

1030
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,140
You know what I mean, Mike?

1031
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:44,740
And so that's why we have to deal with the conspiracy goes back to that, that caller that if I was able to take control and I do have control, but if I was able to present it in the pink world, then I could I could bring in this real alternative.

1032
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,440
And the way to have an alternative is to change the environments.

1033
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,920
One of the ways would be to turn off the electric environment.

1034
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,940
Can you imagine doing that?

1035
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,260
Well, I certainly can imagine doing that.

1036
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,180
In fact, I would like to do that as soon as possible.

1037
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,060
But it seems that.

1038
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:06,920
But whoever is doing the next show, perhaps they're not doing the next show.

1039
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,400
And I'm listeners.

1040
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,800
I just don't know what to tell you, except I'm sorry.

1041
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,840
I grieve.

1042
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,900
I mourn just as much as you do that.

1043
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,860
You have to listen to the hour of slack for an extra minute or two, maybe another hour or two.

1044
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,420
The last person I saw in here said, I'll be back at midnight.

1045
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,720
I wonder what that means, dear friends.

1046
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,020
It's a good thing.

1047
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:35,640
I've got a bunch of records here and endless, endless tapes of the subgenius radio shows from Berkeley.

1048
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,240
Oh, lots of stuff.

1049
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,600
Maybe we've all heard it before.

1050
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,940
Maybe we haven't.

1051
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,020
And probably we're not supposed to hear some of it because it's not edited yet.

1052
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:56,640
But until the next people come in, why, we'll just proceed to imbue you with the lovely slack, which even now is still dripping off your radio speakers.

1053
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,840
And it may just drip off for hours.

1054
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,700
And hours to come.

1055
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,460
We're not sure.

1056
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,780
There's only one thing we do know, however.

1057
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:19,880
You can write for more information from Bob at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1058
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:27,400
Once again, that's box 140306.

1059
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:38,800
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1060
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,380
Oh, yes.

1061
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,400
And now we'll just obviously it's time for the next show.

1062
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,620
And there isn't one.

1063
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,340
So it's this show still.

1064
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,840
Yes, I'm sorry.

1065
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,940
You're going to have to learn more and more about J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1066
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,700
And who is J.R. Bob Dobbs?

1067
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,960
You may ask why.

1068
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:57,900
Why?

1069
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:57,900


1070
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,180
Why?

1071
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,000
Why?

1072
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1073
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1074
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1075
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1076
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1077
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1078
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1079
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1080
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1081
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1082
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1083
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1084
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1085
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1086
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1087
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1088
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1089
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1090
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1091
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000


1092
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,680
You know, that's the hardest question in the world to answer.

1093
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:08,940
And I don't think I'm going to unless I can find a copy of my book of the subgenius from Simon and Schuster here.

1094
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,120
And if I can, I'll read you who J.R. Bob Dobbs is.

1095
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,660
In the meantime, you can listen to the lovely Wendy Carlos.

1096
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,260
Pardon me?

1097
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:25,820
Yes, still Wendy here with the Brandenburg Concertos number five.

1098
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,160
Hold on just a second.

1099
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:27,620
Thank you.

1100
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:38,520
Thank you.

1101
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,180
Thank you.

1102
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,260
Thank you.

1103
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:03,460
Thank you.

1104
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,920
Thank you.

1105
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,480
Thank you.

1106
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,740
Oh, saved in the nick of time, dear friends.

1107
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,160
I just heard the downstairs bell ring.

1108
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:20,480
Perhaps they really have come and you won't ever get to find out that the conspiracy, a conspiracy, dear friends, formed the background of your entire life.

1109
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,540
The conspiracy, which is inner conflict.

1110
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,520
It is your inferiority complex or your delusion of grandeur.

1111
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,700
It is nervous.

1112
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,060
It is nervous tension.

1113
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,200
The habit of worry.

1114
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,840
It is your darkest, most debilitating fears.

1115
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,180
And it's what keeps you afraid.

1116
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,140
What makes you scared to walk home alone at night.

1117
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,780
It is the very reason for all your problems.

1118
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:57,840
But there is one thing that can save you from the conspiracy, which we've been trying to force upon you tonight.

1119
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,620
And that is the upcoming show.

1120
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,500
Which has arrived.

1121
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:14,720
And yes, Lisa Taylor is here to do that self-same and much awaited, I'm sure by now, next quote, next show.

1122
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,240
Oh, yeah.

1123
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,900
The next show.

1124
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,020
They always want to know.

1125
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,780
Well, what?

1126
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,760
They call up.

1127
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,520
They go, where?

1128
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,080
Yeah.

1129
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,560
Yeah.

1130
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:21,880
Yeah.

1131
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,300
I know about this Bob stuff, man.

1132
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,920
But what about the next show?

1133
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,340
Oh, yeah.

1134
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:29,680
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1136
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1137
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1138
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1139
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1140
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1141
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:29,680


1142
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,440
Well, I'm into Bob.

1143
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,100
I love Bob.

1144
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,540
But I'm not going to send my money to Bob.

1145
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:39,460
I'd rather spend it on cigarettes or liquor or rock and roll records, you know, by somebody I can hear on the radio anyway.

1146
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,420
So what is the next show?

1147
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,820
It's all they care about, friends.

1148
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,980
Because they've got better things to think about than that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1149
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,300
Oh, yeah.

1150
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:57,100
There's more valuable things in their lives than their souls or anything else.

1151
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:58,680
Yeah.

1152
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:04,940
You know, it's interesting when somebody comes in to do the next show, the next show, they

1153
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,640
cue stuff up.

1154
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,760
What I'm hearing through these headphones are completely different from what's being

1155
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,240
heard over the radio.

1156
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,760
And yet, oh, wait.

1157
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:16,940
Oh, now.

1158
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:19,760
Yeah.

1159
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,320
It's a, wait a minute.

1160
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:23,620
Wait a minute.

1161
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,420
Let's put this on.

1162
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,060
There we go.

1163
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,360
No, no.

1164
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:27,700
Wait.

1165
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,440
Whatever you were queuing up.

1166
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:31,380
There.

1167
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,200
Oh, it's not a guy.

1168
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,700
Oh, I wanted them to hear how it sounds when you're queuing the stuff.

1169
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,100
That's when it, half of these records sound a lot better when you're queuing them up.

1170
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,180
Okay, I'm out of here, friend.

1171
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,220
Praise Bob.

1172
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,060
Help me with somebody.
