Time to rock.
I'm in there and have to dig life
with Father, and I mean
Father Slack.
We're
really
old.
That is Pat Paulson.
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.
And this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.
I know where that is.
Coming up on your morning station, it's the hour of slack drive-by comedy hour.
Once again, your wacky hosts Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave
help ease your morning commute with a fun-filled hour of classic rock, laughs, and trivia
where you can win fabulous prizes.
So stay tuned to your classic rock station coming up right after this.
Goodbye, Earth.
Good morning, Planet X.
Good morning, Planet X.
Good morning, Planet X.
Enter night.
Take my hand.
We're off to Never Never Land.
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob
Everybody out there is so crazy about Bob
Eternal salvation or triple your money back
All of the religions will be having a heart attack
A pipe full of fraud equals what?
A lot of slack, no matter how you kill it
He always keeps coming back, Bob
I'm talking about Dobbs
Repent, quit your job and slack off
Get ready to blast off
The next day comes and all the pigs are on the run from Bob
Pull the wool over your own eyes
Start to realize what till now has been disguised
Keep looking through the skies at the saucers flying by
And maybe by and by you will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs
Bob Dobbs
Talking about the salesman to the gods
He's still in check the coffin lid on a conspiracy of normality
Oh, who could it be but Bob?
Oh, who could it be but Bob?
Oh, who could it be but Bob?
Crazy about Bob
Crazy about Bob
Cause I looked deep into his eyes
All the dots there and soon I was hypnotized
Now there is no difference between two divides
The rich became the beggar and the fool became the wise
Cause it's a way out, far out
Psychedelic freak out
Took a hit at Bob
I'm starting to freak out
Geek out
My friends are gonna love it

Look out, look out everyone, here he comes, it's Bob!
You wish you could forget
about Bob!
Uhhhhhhhhhh
Yo, yeah, you know what time it is?
Aye, do do, well, time to rock, friends, and...
the Bob rap were by this new guy, the great...
Neptune!
Yes, the great Neptune!
We're gonna be playing tons more stuff by the great Neptune,
who is at www.neptune.itgo.com
or josephicus at yahoo.com, friends!
And we heard of...
Well, this whole show is the show designed to drive you insane
and make you think somebody slipped you a Mickey!
Isn't that a Mickey-meat?
And so we also heard Pat Boone and Moda Mac
driving you insane,
driving you crazy,
and upcoming friends,
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself!
Ugh!
And in the background we hear
MC Kevrock with time control!
And then...
Au revoir!
dyurance...
Show yourself...
Come on in.
The worst thing was I got a little angel baby hair in my spaghetti.
That was the worst thing.
I hate angel baby hair in my spaghetti.
Once it gets in my spaghetti, I start to get a little noodley, you know.
I hate that.
I hate to feel noodley.
Once you run around here along the sun, you can't camp a little too long.
You just get noodley, you know.
You start to hang out a little too long.
And it's noodley.
And noodley starts to noodley.
That's a sad day.
I hate it when my little noodley noodley starts to fart along.
So I try to rub things on it.
And little baby toes.
Little baby toes all over the tent too.
There's one right up there, Bob.
Right up on the sleeve of the shirt of the jacket of the tent.
It's sort of tangly.
Okay.
And now.
I want you.
To gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.
Bob?
People say that I gotta grow up.
I ain't got it any younger and I gotta settle down.
Find a wife.
I make a move to the white bread part of town.
Get a job.
I work at Fort O'Mare where they don't really appreciate you.
I try to go watch in a bed on the back way.
When your heart gives a labor of proof.
Don't want no babies.
Don't want no wife.
Don't want no nine to five.
I want a life.
Don't want no babies.
Don't want no wife.
Don't want no nine to five.
I want a life.
I want a life.
Don't want a wife.
Don't want no nine to five.
I want a text.










You think you don't want no baby, don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five, I wanna lie.
Cause I love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny?
Love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny? No!
People say I gotta grow up, I ain't getting any younger, and I gotta settle down.
Find a wife, I'll make a move to Long Island.
Get a job, I'm working for the man, baby, don't give a s*** about you.
I'll shiny go watch in a bed on the back when your heart gets a labor of cruel.
Don't want no baby, don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five, I wanna lie.
Don't want no baby, don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five, I wanna lie.
Cause I love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny?
Love to play music, love to make money, love to meet women, is that so funny? No!
Yeah, yeah.
Praise me, Bob.
My fellow Americans, the only thing we have to fear is a crippling, decade-long depression,
one in which thousands will die by starvation, riots, or even their own hands.
This is the sort of depression that destroys the faith of a people and their nation,
a sort of depression that does not make one stronger from the great challenge it brings, but rather weaker.
I stand before you today with a message born not of hope, but of despair.
Yes, misery awaits us all, and there's nothing we can do to avert this grim fate.
This economic depression is...
It is far too great for any of us to overcome,
and there is nothing left for America to do but suffer.
All is lost.
The situation is hopeless.
Yes, we as a nation are doomed.
Doomed! Doomed! Doomed!
Next song.
Ah, yes, took a little while until...
we found something that was, uh...
Oh, how shall I say? More spiritually enlightening...
to our, uh...
to our, uh...
general atmosphere of, uh...
view of reality.
Uh, I don't know the title for this song,
Andrew, I'm sure will write it down on the tape afterwards,
but here we go.
Hello, boys and girls and snuggles, the floppy bunny.
How you like my ears?
They're really floppy, huh?
And really fuzzy.
Ha ha ha!
A funny crowd!
Everywhere!
Oh look!
There's a fuzzy bear!
Everybody be happy!
Or else...
...I'll be a little bit more...
...fancy!
Cotton candy and clowns!
Balloons flying in the sky!
Everybody be happy!
Don't question how or why!
Happiness is inventory!
Sadness is a sin!
Don't be ugly!
Be cute and snuggly!
Be fuzzy!
Buries in!
This is Knuckles!
Your commentator!

Real cuteness is what I want!
Must be cute!
Don't be scary!
Gotta be hairy!
Don't be hairy!
Happiness is inventory!
No sad ending!
To the story!
Happiness is mandatory!
Do you feel cute?
Well do ya?
Punk?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

Oh!
Oh look at my fluffy tail!
Oh it's so fluffy and...
...scarp me!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
And everyone must be cute!
Everyone must be cute!
Our cute people...
...must be...
...obeyed!
Our uncute people...
...must be...
...destroyed!
The final solution...
...to ugliness...
...will be...
...revealed...
...by the cute...
...cute...
...cute!
We must have...
...big bright eyes!
Ha!
We must all be cute!
We must all look up in the sky...
...and see the white fluffy clouds!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm cute!
You're cute!
We're all cute!

Keeping a close eye on the backbeat in 409

Looked like one solitary headlight coming after me

Bob is a rock and Bob is a tree.
Bob is a bear and Bob is a bee.
Bob is truth and Bob is lies.
Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.
Bob's my house, Bob's my watch.
Bob's my sandwich, Bob's my crotch.
Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain.
Bob's an ugly, yellow stain.
Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch.
Bob is take off every stitch.
Bob's my master, Bob's my slave.
Bob will rob me, Bob will save.
Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge.
Bob's my little sister Mitch.
Bob will cost you, Bob is free.
Bob's the watch and Bob's the key.
Bob's the watch and Bob's the key.

In short, Bob is the man who used your leg as a frying pan.
If your mind is a jar, you can pour it out of the sink.
And the subgenius church is the missing link.
Damn it.
Jump! Jump off and down for Bob!
Cause Bob is the future!
Come on you lazy ass drag off and don't jump!
Bob!
You can see the future, it surrounds you and it surrounds you.
It surrounds the imagery in the church.
Bob is the industrial information and quantum revolution.
Bob is the color of the future.
What color is the future?
Bob is the bright refraction of the quantum field around us.
It's because Bob has slack.
Slack is the quantum field.
And that's why I'm on my knees praying now.
Praying here before Bob.
Because I am Bob.
And that's the odd thing.
Because I am Bob.
And I don't know if my mom was raped by a
parapaetic man with blonde hair who was delivering the milk.
Pounding the milk.
It was a little hard but there it was.
I just came.
And I just came again.
And I just keep coming.
I can't help but come here.
It's a special thing.
Hallelujah brother!
Bob is going to lead us into the future.
Bob is going to be the next revolution.
Bob is going to be the nanotech revolution.
The quantum revolution.
The spiritual revolution!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Woo!
All right.
Yeah.
All these dot coms that you see.
There's only one dot com that matters.
And that is www.subgenius.com!
Woo!
So what does this all have to do with you?
Well, you guys.
You're yetis.
You are the future.
You have to use that quantum field for your future.
You guys have to make the apocalypse happen.
The more you're yourself, the faster the apocalypse will come.
Yes, friends.

That's all good.

Yeah!
You see?
Something's wrong?
Shut the light.
Heavy thoughts tonight.
And they are too snow white.
Dreams of war?
Dreams of liars?
Dreams of dragon's fire and the things that will bite?
Sleep with one eye open.
Grip in your pillow tight.
Exit light.
Enter night.
Rain over...

Hi, this is Pat Paulson.
I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.
Bob's a lot of, well, he's not fun.
But anyway, this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.
One of my shoes got cow stuff on them.
It's the way conspiracy works, friends.
Conspiracy creeps into every human endeavor.
By nature of humanity.
That's why we just try to say, well, screw the humans.
We're subgeniuses. We're different.
Subgenius can be any age, any size, shape, color.
Can be from any background, any nationality, any damn planet or species.
We don't care.
As long as they have the fragment of Bob consciousness.
And have sent $30 to P.O. Box 1436 Dallas, Texas.
I'm not doing.
Oh, yes, friends.
You can be saved even if it kills you.
And that's how much Bob loves you, friends.
He will kill you to save you.
Because, you know, once you're saved and Bob, you never really die.
You know, it's, you know, his old saying.
What Bob offers his most famous discovery.
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.
What other words?
You know.

What does Bob offer, Zach, friends?
If you don't live forever, you get your money back.
A perfect, perfect formula for belief and love and slack.
Or slack, whatever that is.
Slack for me would be to shut up for a minute.
It's been a long day.
Someday the exes will come.
Bob's promise will come true.
Our alien benefactors will give us our own planets.
And we will be able to create the 25-hour day.
The 26-hour day.
The Martian time slip.
The day that lasts forever.
The night that never ends, dear friends.
The night that smells like cinnamon for three days.
And then it smells like epoxy the next three days.
Any planet you want.
The most bizarre.
Outlandish things you can imagine.
Could come physically, literally true.
You better hope you have a pure mind when that happens.
You better hope that you aren't thinking real paranoid bad thoughts in the back of your mind
at the moment when every wish can come true.
You better hope that you really have some good wishes in your head.
And so you can't be constantly thinking about how you're gonna get back at that conspiracy bastard.
Or so forth.
Friends, you gotta just learn to ride.
And you gotta be wise about it.
Time control is what Bob has been preaching all along.
And unfortunately, until we get the time machines working, the only true form of time control available to us is that boring virtue called patience.
And that's why you need to remember about the funny little monkeys.
Because otherwise it's so easy to lose patience with them.
And God knows, only Bob stands between most of us.
And us becoming mad serial killers, machine gunning entire McDonald's full of pink boys out of their smugness.
Neat.
You is what you am.
They count, don't they count.
You ain't what you're not.
So you see what you got.
You are what you is.
And that's all it is.
A foolish young man from a middle class family started singing the blues.
Cause he thought it was manly.
Now he talk like a kingfish.
From a Amos and Andy.
He tell you that chitlins, well they taste just like candy.
He thinks that he's got the whole thing down.
From the Nibbley Ocean to the Royal Crown.
Do you know what you are?
You are what you is.
You is what you am.
They count, don't they count.
You ain't what you're not.
So you see what you got.
You are what you is.
And that's all it is.
A foolish young man of the Negro persuasion.
Persuasion?
Did he say persuasion?
Devoted his life.
To become a Caucasian.
He stopped beating poor.
He stopped beating green.
He traded his dashi again.
For some Jordan's jeans.
He learned to play golf.
And he got a good score.
Now he say to himself.
I ain't no nigger no more.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I don't understand you, poor wama macumba.
Would you speak a little clearly, Mercedes Benzine?
That's your mama, baby.
Who is who?
I don't know.
And what is what?
Something I just got to know.
And why is this?
Somebody tell me now.
Appropriate.
That's a funny pronunciation if I ever get it right.
If you don't like.
Well, did you like?
You get that word.
But you have got.
You have got.
I spend all my days.
Driving in the dirt, yeah.
And let it rot.
I can smell it now.
Someone else.
Here they come, here they come, here they come.
They surely come.
I told you they were coming.
To pick it up.
To pick it up, yeah.
But she won't stop.
And she won it for free.
And when one day.
And then one day.
You wonder who.
You wonder who.
You used to watch.
Who watched it anyway.
And what'd you do?
I used to work at the post office.
You scratch your head.
I scratch my head.
And look around.
I don't wanna, I don't wanna do that.
But what you lost.
Just so you see.
Will not be found.
It just can't be found.
Do you know what you are?
I'm gonna buy me a Mercedes.
You are what you are.
I need a big red one now.
You use what you have.
And I'm on a 450 SLC.
It count don't make half.
Oh yeah.
You ain't what you're not.
You ain't what you're not.




You got a club sticking out of the truck.
So you see what you got.
I'm going down to the Lincoln Square.
You are what you is.
Do you wanna see my grandma?
And that's all it is.
No ma'am.
I'm hiding from UFOs.
You are what you is.
This is some lumpy gravy you made here.
And that's all it is.
I look like a damn cabana.
You are what you is.
And your mama.
Oh.
And that's all it is.
Give me a car with a headlight.
You are what you is.
I'm about to shoot you.
And that's all it is.
I know a fat old policeman.
He's always on our street.
A fat and jolly, red-faced man.
He really is a treat.
He's too kind for a policeman.
He's never known to frown.
And everybody says he is the happiest man in town.
Aah.
Aha.
He laughs upon pointy feet, he laughs upon his feet
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street
He never can stop laughing, he says he's never tried
But once he did arrest a man and laughed until he cried
His jolly face it wrinkled and then he shut his eyes
He opened his great mouth and was a wondrous sight
He laughed at everybody when he's walking in the street
He said I must arrest you, he didn't know what for
And then he started laughing until he dragged his jaw
So if you chance to meet him when walking round the town
Just shake him by his fat old hand and give him half a crown
His eyes will beam and sparkle, he'll gurgle with delight
And then you'll start him laughing with all his blessed life
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street
Gentle giggling and laughing
And singing
Dog panting
Dog panting
Pinky Booble.
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
Beautiful.
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
Raisin.
Ah, Bob.
I get up every day.
Work my life away.
I break my back.
I never get into slack
When X day comes, all you peeps better run
Cause the X-ists might blow up the sun
If slack was what I'd be sold
And if they can't take a joke
Atomic particles
Oppenheimer's blitz
But as for Bob
Yeah, he cut the shit
When X day comes, all you peeps better run
Bob's your own
Cause the X-ists might blow up the sun
Bob's your own
If slack was what I'd be sold
Bob's your own
And if they can't take a joke
Bob's your own
Bob's your own
You just can't believe everything you believe
You just can't believe it at all
You just can't believe it at all
You just can't believe it at all
You just can't believe it at all
You can't believe it at all
You can't believe it at all
You can't believe it at all

Well there once was a man
the world's greatest salesman
and he had devised a plan
to get the shanties from Baskin Robbins
Here I am, oh now he's gone
A martyr for the cause of his father
And he's coming again
Who knew that the first shot
Was gonna be the last shot
But he's got a hard driving pipe
The gas smoke all through the night
And although he may be hurting
The universe will keep on squirting
All the fun, oh
And he's coming again
He can save us from the men in black
With just a shot from his mighty sack
If only he could make it back
From the land of the dead
But until that happy day
We can only drink and say
Father's my Lord
And he's coming again
I know he can make it
Without him we can't take it
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the whims
Until the day that he comes back
It'll be over
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the whims
Until the day that he comes back
And he's coming again
Father's my Lord
Father's my Lord
Father's my Lord
Father's my Lord

Father's my Lord
And he's coming again
And if we don't want the exits upon us
And if we don't want the exits upon us
Then we need Bob to be on his part
Then we need Bob to be on his part
Then we need Bob to be on his part
Then Bob is my Lord
Then Bob is my Lord
Then Bob is my Lord
Bob is my Lord
And he's coming again
Great God is coming
So bring my death
Again
Wow!
Praise Pope Bob!
This is an epistle from
This is an epistle from the Reverend David Lee Black
The Reverend David Lee Black
I don't believe this
Read the first and last paragraph
Dear fellow subgeni
The evil forces of anti-slack that prevent me from going to America
Are the very same ones that prevent me from being with my brothers and sisters of slack on X Day in Brushwood
Subsequently
I think he meant consequently
Subsequently
I must have my own X Day in Kiel, Germany with my brothers and sisters of slack here
There's nothing
I mean nothing
That will stop me from getting on board the intergalactic love ships
On Wednesday the 5th of July
And being with the rest of you
Not the DEA
Not Janet Cujo Reno
Not Bill Clinton and his hordes of concubines
Not customs
Not even Mulder and Scully and the reanimated corpse of J. Edgar Hoover
Could stop me when that platform lowers
The red carpet rolls out
And I'm carried on board in a throne like an African chieftain
By my leather clad alien love slaves of the cosmos
I had a dream the other night
Which makes me believe this year is the year
One of the love goddesses came to me in a dream
Like a space cherub loved succubus
She floated through the air and revealed to me a divine revelation
Which I make known to you now
On her right leg and left leg there were ten holes
And a piece in the middle there were three
And in the middle there were three holes
She could suckle
Twenty-three
Which is the number of the illuminated
She took my hand and we floated up to the heavens
The pills are kicking in about this part in the epiphany
A-bom-a-ged-i
And anyway he foresees a battle of Armageddon
Where the demonic forces which you guys were talking about
Which have enslaved the human race
With the yoke of bad television
And have sold them sportswear, media-induced self-conceit
Landmines and cheap adrenaline-producing drugs
To then herd their unwitting victims into soccer stadiums
And pop-star concert halls
Only to farm their pain and misery
To feed its insatiable appetite
For hurt and suffering
Have finally realized that the exes know about their evil intentions
To make hostile bids for benign alien space corporations
Only to peddle their superficial cheapness
Of the evil of the universe
Hollywood black magic and so space mines
So they can create a hell in space
The intergalactic federation of alien races
Which currently live in peace and harmony
Will not tolerate their universal garden of Eden
To be invaded by the evil monkey-snake god of earth
The evil demon monkey-snake god
Who will replace all the stars with poison apples
And sell fig leaves to the goddesses
Who have 23 holes
This is all black all right
As I looked down into earth
I saw the saucers hovering over brushwood
Lemuria and Kiel
I saw smaller craft hovering over several other locations
Where subgenius ministers who are rich in slack
But poor in human money supposedly reside
I could see the masses of the illuminated
With their suitcases of cool
Boarding the saucers of love, hope and happiness
As they did the armies of earth
Scrambled to destroy the invading love ships
Of the sex goddesses
The very threat to their existence
Then it was the great and final war
As the last space saucer
Sex space saucer lifted high into the heavens
I could see great war begin
The navies and air armadas
With their rapid response forces scrambling to attack
I could hear the sirens of war around the planet wailing
Heralding the inescapably impending doom
That awaited citizens of this sinking battleship
Of hate, war and misery
But the great armies of earth didn't battle with the stars
But the star cruisers of the love goddesses
They battled with themselves
They battled with each other
For the right to battle with the invading saucers of slack
Hovering above the planet as it burned
I could hear the screams of billions of human souls
Who weren't lucky enough to get off this planet with the chosen ones
The alien sex goddesses took my hand again
And floated with me back down to earth
To my bed
Back to my alcoholic narcosa
And so I awakened with this revelation I now give
And with this revelation I also send the symbolic other half
In the form of a cake
I want Stang to have everyone line up for this cake
To be ritualistically served as communion of slack
For all at Hex Day in Brushwood
Make sure Nikki Death Chick gets a big piece
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her
