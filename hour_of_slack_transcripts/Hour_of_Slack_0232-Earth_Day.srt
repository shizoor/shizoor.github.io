1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
It's all I can't love.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,080
We're here.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,460
We don't require your money. We don't need your money. We only want your soul.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,880
And to wrap it up, to quote again from the book.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,600
And slack is what you want. Slack is what you need.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,420
As the Pope of all New York told the multitudes, with the fullness of slack, a change will come.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,940
Slackness will enter your life. Slackness will make you see. Slackness will set you free.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,220
Slackness is. Slackness lives. Slackness waits for you.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,360
And yeah, send the $20.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,960
Hallelujah.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:32,760
Praise God.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,640
We've overcome my obstacles in your way.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,320
And it seems that you can't go over it.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
You can't go under it.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,680
And you can't go around it.

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,240
This bath will help you.

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,960
It will set you free.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,100
It will give you wisdom and knowledge where you need it.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,740
Praise God.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,540
It will open your eyes where you're blind.

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,100
It will remove the blockage from your ears.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,860
That you hear the.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,060
The.

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,220
Self genius.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,100
Our.

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,820
All.

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,900
Slack.

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, no man can duplicate this bath.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,140
This is a God sent bath for you.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,920
To help you better understand current events, to put things in perspective, and most importantly,

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,100
to help you have that inner peace of knowing that God is on his throne and in control.

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,100
He's going to.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,700
The church of the living God is preaching and believing and looking for the coming of Jesus Christ.

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,240
There is a clear and present Davis in our nation.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,980
This world is destined for destruction.

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,980
It's doomed and it's damned according to the word of God.

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,220
Point one.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,540
I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,500
Beginning this moment.

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,580
This nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977. Never.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,900
Is this broadcast quality?

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,480
Or...

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,920
Is this broadcast quality?

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,560
Or...

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,140
Is this broadcast quality?

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,520
Or...

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,500
Is this broadcast quality?

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,300
Or...

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,080
Is this broadcast quality?

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Or...

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,440
Is this broadcast quality?

52
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,340
Or...

53
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,260
Is this broadcast quality?

54
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,760
Or...

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,160
Is this broadcast quality?

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
Or...

57
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,620
Is this broadcast quality?

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,660
Is this broadcast quality?

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Or...

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,360
Is this broadcast quality?

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,540
Is this broadcast quality?

62
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,600
Is this broadcast quality?

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,560
Is this broadcast quality?

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,300
Or...

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,100
Just relax.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,220
Just relax.

67
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,340
Just relax.

68
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,400
Just relax.

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,720
Just relax. Just relax. Just relax. Just relax. Just relax.

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,200
Oh yes, oh dear friends.

71
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,340
A little bit of a late start there.

72
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,700
It's okay, we can make it up.

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,080
We always, well, we make everything up.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Except for one thing, the truth above.

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,900
That's something we never made up.

76
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,800
Never once.

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,860
But, uh, I sure would like to, uh, talk about this wonderful day we're having today.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,260
Yes, here in Dallas at least.

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,060
I don't know about any in Rochester or Chicago or Stanford.

80
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,100
No, it's not still Earth Day.

81
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,280
But here in Dallas it's still Earth Day.

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,940
And, uh, well actually as a subgenius,

83
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,060
I'm not sure.

84
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,440
I guess you could call it Mirth Day.

85
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,420
When Jehovah One, that alien space god from a corporate sim galaxy,

86
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,580
laughs at our vain efforts to clean after,

87
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,920
to clean up after what we did last Saturday night,

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,060
or last Saturday aeon.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:50,400
Mirth Day, when the liberals laughingly congratulate themselves for being liberals,

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,260
and when the conservatives congratulate themselves

91
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,460
for fooling the liberals.

92
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,820
And, uh, I know that there are all sorts of, uh, special celebrations going on,

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,840
all over the city and in fact all over the world.

94
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,260
I'd like to talk about some of those and, I mean, because,

95
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,080
well, you've got three more hours to make it to some of these.

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,100
In Peru, the, uh, to celebrate Earth Day,

97
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,240
the Shining Path gorillas will be hacking the art of the Earth Day.

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,740
They're going to be using arms off of 500 peasants in remote villages,

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,780
using them for fertilizer for the rare endangered coca plant,

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,800
and also using those hacked off arms to spell out,

101
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,620
save the Earth,

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
so that it can be seen from outer space.

103
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,680
Um, and then after that, the Peruvian army will spell out,

104
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,240
save the planet using the heads of Shining Path gorillas.

105
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,060
Um, other Earth Day celebrations, or Mirth Day, I'm sorry,

106
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,760
uh, in Japan, there will be feasting on dolphin steaks and whale burgers.

107
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,720
Uh, blue whale burgers, uh, actually.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,600
And with, and, and, uh, dolphin brain, uh, I don't know what they call it,

109
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,860
I forget the Japanese word.

110
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,580
They insert these metal straws into still living dolphin brains,

111
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,420
right through the, the cranium of the dolphin,

112
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,480
and suck out his, his, uh, um, more than human emotional awareness.

113
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,460
At the University of Texas, uh, tonight, I believe,

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,920
a bunch of, uh, frat boys and Christians will be burning atheists,

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,760
uh, minorities, and homosexuals who burn flags.

116
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,560
And this is to demonstrate God's love of pieces of cloth,

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,320
over any human body that might contain an abnormal brain.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,880
Um, uh, and, uh, fireworks, yeah, let's see, I'm, I'm looking over there,

119
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,560
I've got this really confused list, this is out of Time magazine.

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,340
Uh, there's gonna be a lot of firework, uh, exercises, um,

121
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,960
let's see, in Beirut, uh, they're planning to put, uh, rockets,

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,540
yeah, they're gonna fire rockets into three million people,

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,500
and, uh, three more school buses full of children,

124
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,180
um, to prove the, the arguments about God, and, and to,

125
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,360
you know, just to sort of celebrate Earth Day,

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,300
so that, so that we'll know that we've done the,

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,000
that we're all trying to do the right thing to save the environment.

128
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,620
And that's all that counts, as long as we think we're doing the right thing

129
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,800
to save the environment, right?

130
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Uh, other fireworks, yeah, at, um, uh,

131
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,920
the Church of Universal Platitudes,

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,520
in, uh, uh, near Ye- just north of Yellowstone National Park,

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,000
they're going to ignite their spilled tankfuls of fuel supplies,

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,940
and turn Yellowstone National Park into one huge fireball

135
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,740
to bring the end of the world about, uh, they hope,

136
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,940
so that their fallout shelters won't go to waste.

137
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,900
That's the whole thing, they want to avoid waste.

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,740
Uh, let's see, what else here, uh,

139
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,900
oh, well, of course, the church of Universal Platitudes, uh,

140
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,420
the church of the subgenius will spell out

141
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,180
save the planet in golfer heads.

142
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, and the Soviet Union will ignite their own, uh,

143
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,360
gigantic celebratory fireball using gas,

144
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,380
natural gas that would otherwise have been wasted

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,340
warming the homes of uppity smarty pants in Lithuania.

146
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,380
Uh, speaking of which,

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,280
that's something I've been, I've been wondering about,

148
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,320
to tell the truth, friends.

149
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,080
I honestly don't understand why the United States

150
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,880
is so upset about, uh,

151
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,940
you know, Russia putting the squeeze on Lithuania.

152
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,380
I mean, uh, you know, uh,

153
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,020
we haven't threatened England,

154
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,540
or given England any kind of, uh,

155
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
you know, serious, uh, uh, disapproval

156
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,660
for not letting Ireland have independence,

157
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,040
and my, I mean, my gosh, the Irish have been trying to,

158
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,540
trying to do the same thing as Lithuania for, uh,

159
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,180
about a hundred years.

160
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,080
Of course, the Lithuanians have been trying to do this

161
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,580
for five hundred years, but, uh,

162
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,280
well, Russia's owned them for five hundred.

163
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,440
I mean, Ivan the Terrible conquered Lithuania.

164
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,820
I mean, what are they complaining about?

165
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,680
What I want to know is what about independence for the Texas?

166
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,380
When is Texas going to secede from the Union?

167
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,700
I've been trying to get people to do,

168
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,720
uh, think about that for years.

169
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,000
Anyway, in China, uh, soldiers from, uh,

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,960
small, remote villages will be injected with methamphetamines

171
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,420
and set loose upon all secret supporters of democracy

172
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,660
in the cities.

173
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,680
Grinding their, let's see, it says here,

174
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,440
grinding their bones beneath tank treads

175
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,320
to demonstrate proper waste disposal techniques.

176
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,780
China's always been on top of, uh,

177
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,620
earth, uh, save the earth sort of, uh, philosophies.

178
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,520
Uh, Mao, Chairman Mao back in the early 60s,

179
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,460
um, when people started wondering

180
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,480
why there were no more birds in northern China,

181
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,300
Chairman Mao said, well, the Americans,

182
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,680
uh, have flown over China with their satellites

183
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,580
and sprayed poison to destroy our, our lovely birds.

184
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,640
Actually, what, what happened apparently is that,

185
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,140
um, when DDT was invented, the Chinese just went nuts.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,140
They thought, God, it's a miracle chemical.

187
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,600
They, uh, we can destroy all insects who destroy our fields

188
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,220
and, uh, wreck our rice harvest in one generation.

189
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,540
Destroy all insects in one generation.

190
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,940
And they saturated their bugs and ground and everything with DDT,

191
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,580
at least in northern China.

192
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,540
And, of course, that generation of insects was, uh, wiped out,

193
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,400
except, of course, for the mutants.

194
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,140
However, all the birds also were wiped out,

195
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
and that's why, to this day, you still see, uh,

196
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,720
mutated insects, uh, destroying the rice fields

197
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,740
and causing the Gobi Desert to, uh,

198
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,280
infringe further and further into the cities.

199
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,400
Uh, but you, you know, you don't really see too many, uh,

200
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,140
little birdies there in the streets of, of lovely, uh, Beijing, China.

201
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Uh, uh, back here on the home scene,

202
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,140
the Bush administration, I believe, is going to,

203
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,300
the White House will be commemorating Earth Day

204
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,020
by selling all of our national parks to the lumber companies

205
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,980
because, and they're right, you know, the economy has to come first.

206
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,440
But, you know, the, the, the, the, but, uh,

207
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
all, all life on the planet can wait.

208
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,920
We've, we've gotta be, be able to afford life on the planet

209
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,380
before we can save it.

210
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,660
And they're also, I believe, announcing,

211
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,180
or maybe they've already done this, announcing that all scientists

212
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,360
in all nations have agreed that more research,

213
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,700
quote, more research, unquote,

214
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,460
is needed before any large corporations in which

215
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,360
the Bush or Thatcher families hold stock can be asked

216
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,240
to reduce, uh, greenhouse effect in any way.

217
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,180
Uh, if there really is one.

218
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,740
And of course that's up in the air.

219
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,160
We need more money for more research for the, those families.

220
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,820
And, you know, now that George Bush has glaucoma,

221
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,620
he's gonna need a greenhouse, dear friends.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,140
The McDonald's Corporation has announced that it will donate

223
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,460
over 90 billion of its, uh, little white foamy containers

224
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,780
to the, the barren cattle grazing lands

225
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,940
that were once Brazilian rainforests

226
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,460
to show their concern.

227
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,340
And the Brazilian government is going to unfreeze the assets

228
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,640
of the Amazonian Indians by sending them the gift

229
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,120
of one million new, uh, Caucasian settlers,

230
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,720
strip miners, and, uh, one million chainsaws.

231
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,220
And of course, uh, Exxon, the company,

232
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,300
is going to spell out, we, quote,

233
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,460
we love the planet, unquote,

234
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,280
in 14 mile wide letters on the ocean

235
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,980
using lead-based paint.

236
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,560
A lovely, lovely thing.

237
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,440
And, oh, in the background, by the way, was, uh,

238
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,340
you've been hearing The Glans.

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,980
That's, uh, a new band in Little Rock, Arkansas,

240
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,940
composed of, uh, Sternodocs, KK,

241
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,080
Brooks, Carruthers, uh, and a couple other guys

242
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,020
I don't know, actually.

243
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,940
And, uh, by the way, I, uh, what, uh,

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,040
the preceding reports came in from, um, uh,

245
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,840
the Subgenius Foundation news service.

246
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,440
Uh, Palmer, uh,

247
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,140
Mer, Vreedes, and, uh, Pope S. Cecilia.

248
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,580
Now, also, Pope S. Cecilia pointed out

249
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,320
that we shouldn't forget that Earth Day

250
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
follows by only a few hours

251
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,100
the 100th birthday of Adolf Hitler.

252
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,220
Or, yeah, at least his brain, I mean,

253
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,860
his brain can celebrate its 100th birthday,

254
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,020
for it still plots on in that little jar,

255
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,400
that laboratory jar in Argentina.

256
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,160
Oh, and, oh, and, uh, one last thing,

257
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
just came in, that in India,

258
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,660
a Sikh and Hindu extremist will clean up

259
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,500
their environments by ridding it of

260
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,420
hundreds of each other.

261
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,060
Uh, dear friends, it's a, it's a lovely,

262
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,160
lovely thing, and, uh, I, I think that we can all

263
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,100
lay back and congratulate ourselves on

264
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,580
another fine Earth Day having passed,

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,360
and, uh, after, you know, the great thing

266
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,520
about Earth Day is after it's over,

267
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,720
you don't have to think about it anymore.

268
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,740
That's the most important thing.

269
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,540
Right.

270
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,400
That wasn't very dramatic.

271
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,980
I was supposed to turn off the mic, not the tape.

272
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,880
Come on, break down and become a member.

273
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,560
So,がんばって

274

The jet will jog, must lock off, we'll join the combat takes control.

276
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,320
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of Bulldog.

277
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,980
Bob is calling, on the overran phone.

278
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,880
Bob is calling, can't you hear that time control tone?

279
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,280
For the spaceship, access the land, surf on the look plane with Bob all you can.

280
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,120
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of Bulldog.

281

Music

282
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,440
Bob is singing, songs of matcha irony.

283
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,560
Vader is drinking, and watching his TV ministry.

284
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Has the Stark mystery moon come?

285
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,620
Take a look.

286
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,140
For them gotcha on the road.

287
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,500
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of Bulldog.

288
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,980
They are Bob Dobbs, will take us all away.

289
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
No more Bob.

290
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,620
Simple smooth hands will have their day.

291
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,480
Into the wild trails, slippery station.

292
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,180
Prepare to make some splash party, here's the station.

293
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,440
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of Bulldog.

294
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,620
See you in sub-China.

295
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,860
Know that they long.

296
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,620
Change in the wind is the fifth Bob's cause.

297
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,620
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of Bulldog.

298
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,220
Bob Dobbs.

299
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,460
Never.

300
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,120
Never.

301
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,340
Manga life was a manga life.

302
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,280
One drama song too many.

303
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,520
If you itch, you need soft and soothe.

304
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,020
Swimming, you know.

305
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,600
High temp today, 100 degrees.

306
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,600


307
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,760
Even that makes it the 63rd day this summer that we've been there.

308
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,700
Well, actually this year because almost the entire.

309
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,060
And if weather conditions had been different, the toxic cloud released might have blown over Manhattan.

310
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,760
And it's scary, it's damn scary, especially the fact that I got two kids.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
You die normally, die with these chemicals, what's gonna do?

Aerid Double X helps keep you extra, extra dry.

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,100
Let your fears well up.

314
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
You have them.

315
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,580
Now don't deny them their chance to hear.

316
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,660
You claim your soul.

317
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,600
Know that within every man is a monster.

318
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,180
And this monster may create a monster.

319
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:34,080
A Frankenstein monster to bring your realistic world crashing down around you.

320
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,440
You say it can't be true.

321
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,720
Except when a species tries to destroy the universe.

322
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:41,720


323
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,180
You know any of you callers could just give yourself your.

324
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:51,620
And callers simply add your own sound effect.

Turn me on Phil, turn me on.

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
What's the frequency labor?

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,000
Oop's too late, he's gone in to the shadow of earth 12.

Open the bathroom door, please Al.

334
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,280
Sorry, it's jammed.

335
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,700
Put it on zero.

336
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,560
You'll have to use the zero gravity toilet while standing on your head.

337
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:09,560


338

Here's the instruction book.

344
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,980
Try the squeeze bag.

345
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,560
Well, all right.

346
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,620
No, I'm not getting this.

347
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,140
See you now.

348
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,460
I have to go.

349
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,620
Well, why don't you go?

350
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,240
We are checking your R200 M3 unit,

351
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,360
but we have not, repeat, have not found the obscene remark

352
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,560
reported by your HAL 9000 computer.

353
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,500
Fellas, this is new for us, too.

354
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,300
We're checking.

355
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,800
Oh.

356
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,820
Ah, here we are.

357
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,120
No, that's pronounced I'm on cue.

358
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,740
Stand by, please.

359
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,020
Stand by, please.

360
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,380
Here's the bulletin.

361
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,300
I'm on cue.

362
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:39,860
What is that?

363
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,120
What do you want to?

364
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,640
Many scientists with varying ideas of what could happen

365
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,300
have expressed their views that huge solar flares will take place,

366
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,060
resulting that could be disruptions in the television and radio communication

367
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,560
and a great deal more.

368
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,300
I see that I'm not going to have much time to go into this anymore today,

369
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,980
and so I'm going to carry it through tomorrow

370
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,920
and try to bring it to a more clear climax.

371
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,720
But may I tell you that all of these are warnings to us

372
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,980
to repent of our sins

373
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,360
and to get ready for the coming of the Lord.

374
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,080
But we can see great and drastic things that are going to take place on the earth.

375
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,320
Well, after we come through here and we purify through this plant here,

376
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,200
it takes out some of the chemicals in the mud out of it.

377
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,040
But you can't drink.

378
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,940
We can't drink it.

379
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,740
Nowhere in the world can you drink it unless you hold your nose.

380
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,300
Live by the river.

381
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,040
It'll also tell you about the prelude to Armageddon

382
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,980
and also some of the strange events that have been forecast for 1982,

383
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,440
some of the things that are coming in these last days.

384
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,180
You know, the future's a magnetic place.

385
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,420
Each year, a hundred billion are born into it.

386
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
Why, it seems all roads lead to tomorrow.

387
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,060
And you'll certainly feel at home

388
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,940
since the leaders here have chosen the architecture of the mediocritans of the middle class ages,

389
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,640
as the most relaxing and appeasing of all art forms.

390
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,640
It could be the old world charm of suburbs and franchises

391
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,700
or power plants and office buildings,

392
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,260
which might suddenly change to lovely forests and pastures.

393
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,080
But wherever you go, you're still amid the clean, ever-changing holograms of the future,

394
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,500
made possible by the amazing hologram projectors

395
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,440
and the careful planning of the folks behind the scenes.

396
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,640
You have no choice.

397
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,360
And our children will live, Mr. Beale,

398
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,360
to see that

399
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
perfect world

400
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,160
in which there's no war or famine,

401
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,900
oppression or brutality.

402
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,460
One vast and ecumenical holding company

403
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,060
for whom all men will work to serve a common profit.

404
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,120
In which all men will hold a share of stock.

405
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,020
All necessities provided.

406
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,120
All anxieties tranquilized.

407
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,980
All boredom amused.

408
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,060
The chemicals these factories create are welcomed by our modern-day lifestyle.

409
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,200
All the locals here complain

410
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,600
the campers commit what along this coast is perhaps the gravest possible crime.

411
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,240
They don't spend enough money.

412
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,400
Timelo, the ocean into the wild.

413
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,220
The essence keeps the wind from blowing

414
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,760
この attentiveness

415
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,480
We get a few

416
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,180
on an apparatus

417
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,960
that'll cut and destroy

418
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,600
any withת

419
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,600


420
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,600


421
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,600


422
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,720
we totally

423
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:52,720


424
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,180
nothing

425
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,540
to cake

426
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,360
our

427
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,400
over the rest. It's a lot easier than tearing all this up. We could air condition and it got rid of

428
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,100
the bugs. I don't know, it's just a lot easier to keep things clean. I mean, we got air conditioning,

429
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,940
toilet training for all our children. We've got all the rocks we could chew on.

430
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,480
But you don't need nature for beauty. The buildings here are inspiring monuments to

431
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,660
our adaptable workers. Oh Bob, oh Bob, oh Bob Give me food! Give me money! Give me food!

432
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,220
Give me everything! Oh Bob! Give me some food! Give me some money! Give me some food! Give me some clothes!

433
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:42,300
Give me pills, give me some food, and give me some clothes, give me some pills, give me some cars, give me some fire, give me this, give me that, give me everything, give me everything, give me this, give me that.

434
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,900
As shown in this diagram, the surface is actually the roof of a 150-story apartment building which encompasses the earth.

435
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,660
The future's treasures are housed in countless numbers in each of these identical levels, which contain the five types of reality to be found.

436
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:06,300
The corridors, work areas, metroplexes, holograms, and of course the units for eunuchs, which these content people call home.

437
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,780
Humans need not worry about getting lost on the way to their units.

438
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,920
They end up at a different unit each night, but it still looks just like home.

439
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,620
All are cleverly designed exactly alike.

440
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
The

441
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,340
I've got an apartment complex.

442
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,760
Here at the apartment complex.

443
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,560
I've got an apartment complex.

444
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,160
Here at the apartment complex.

445
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,080
Now.

446
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,080
Grease that competent level or lighting apartment life couldn't be more exciting.

447
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,480
Loaded room and clubhouse too.

448
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,100
I don't have a worry till my break comes through.

449
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,620
What?

450
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,620
I'm gonna pay the max nine after nine.

451
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,540
It's a tidal wave of suburban delight.

452
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,800
Hey, hey.

453
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,360
I've got an apartment complex.

454
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,000
Here at the apartment complex.

455
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,560
I've got an apartment complex.

456
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,380
Here at the apartment complex.

457
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,000
Now.

458
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,320
Oh, I know you like to live in the complex with me.

459
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,180
I'll tell you about it so easy you see.

460
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,300
Apartment life.

461
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,640
You can get your current range.

462
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,780
Or you can make it here on the minimum wage.

463
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:09,440
Each human shares his spacious total living unit with a different female each night, since

464
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,440
they are circulated to provide variety in companionship.

465
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,600
The unit contains two single beds and a large variety of luxuries, including the Eye of

466
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,180
Taxis, a crime prevention device, and of course, a normal machine, constantly supplying everyone

467
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,340
with the TV shows of your dreams.

468
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,640
Every single one of them is a good example of the life of a human.

469
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,200
Everyone watches the normal machine.

470
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,460
We should be.

471
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,780
My friends come over and they think it's so fine.

472
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,540
Well, they don't know that none of it is mine.

473
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,620
Rental furniture and colored tees.

474
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:57,620


475
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:57,620


476
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:57,840
They think it's a piece of TV.

477
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,500
None of my belongings belong to me.

478
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,540
For this life looks a real critical thing, cause I always feel better late through the

479
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,900
pain.

480
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,820
Hey, hey, I've got an apartment complex.

481
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,480
Here at the apartment complex.

482
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,280
I've got a parking place.

483
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,200
Here he'll dictate.

484
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,420
I'm gonna pick up.

485
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,980
Act like it was the end of the world.

486
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,340
Well, it could be.

487
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,980
Is money more important than people's lives?

488
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,400
And in their pursuit for private interests, a lot of chemical companies will not accept

489
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,620
legal aid.

490
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


491
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


492
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


493
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


494
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


495
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


496
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,340
It's not legal or even moral responsibility for the results of chemical waste pollution

497
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:37,320
until absolute proof shows that a specific chemical from a specific plant caused a specific

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,780
disease.

499
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,760
And treatment you receive when you do business with these industry giants.

500
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,380
It's frequently frustrating and to make matters worse, they don't seem to care.

501
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,640
You won't find this attitude at Bill King's Freiko.

502
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,820
Nor at K-N-O-N, dear friends.

503
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,480
Where, you know, you can write to the Church of the Subject.

504
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,340
Yeah, well, once again, we get these calls.

505
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,520
People going, what is this show?

506
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,760
Well, I mean, what we're doing is we're praising Bob Dobbs.

507
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,180
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

508
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,700
That should explain everything.

509
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,080
If it doesn't, though, you can write to the post office box number, which I'm about to

510
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,340
give, for free info.

511
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,000
Talk perfectly free information.

512
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,900
I mean, we wouldn't think of charging you.

513
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,460
Or at least not charging you.

514
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,040
We're talking about that kind of thing on a public service radio station.

515
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:39,220
So, you know, please write for free information from Bob.

516
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:54,240
Bob at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

517
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
That's box 140306.

518
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,440
Bob.

519
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,520
Bob at post office 14606 Dallas, Texas 75214.

520
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,900
And, well, you can hear these subgeniuses in the background enjoying the show and praying

521
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
to keep the transmitter working.

522
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,080
That's basically what we have to do to keep the transmitter working around here.

523
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,140
Because, hey, you bunch of you ain't going to fork out your pledge money.

524
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,500
We're going to continue our Earth Day, our Mirth Day celebrations with this old, these

525
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,320
old clips.

526
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,880
Here from the old subgenius, Church of the Subgenius Media Barrage tape number 480.

527
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,900
It was an oldie.

528
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,260
It was probably put together in 1980.

529
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,820
Believe it or not.

530
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,700
Oh.

531
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,160
Been a lot of gray hairs since then.

532
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,680
But, uh.

533
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,160
Well, I'll tell you what.

534
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,840
Everything I figure is a hazard.

535
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,580
It progresses as the years go on and eventually we'll never be able to control it.

536
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,420
If you take a look at those maps that show concentration of the Earth, you'll see that

537
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,420


538
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,420


539
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,420


540
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,420


541
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,420


542
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,420


543
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:03,940
there's a variety of forms of cancer that you can, you can pick out the industrialized

544
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,740
areas of America.

545
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,560
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

546
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,280
Well, okay.

547
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,500
What do you mean, well, okay?

548
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,580
Well, uh, that is, uh.

549
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,640
You stayed up all night for this and all you can say is, well, okay?

550
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,640
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

551
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
Don't you feel mad?

552
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:22,840
I don't know.

553
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,900
Don't you feel like complaining?

554
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,340
It's show.

555
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,620
It's about all I can say.

556
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,260
Well, of course.

557
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,940
I won't do anything.

558
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,440
I'm not mad at all, but all, all the good old that do is get me hung up on, which is

559
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
gonna happen anyway, so I might as well complain.

560
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,400
It's a race, though.

561
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,020
Well, you may have to make it so far.

562
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,700
But still, still, you called us.

563
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,140
That's right.

564
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,860
Even though you knew that was gonna happen.

565
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,460
Of course.

566
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,500
I'll, I'll do it again.

567
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,640
Well.

568
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,340
Is that a promise or a threat?

569
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,000
Well, it's, uh.

570
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,400
I don't know.

571
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,120
This seems like all it'll produce is more death and horror as near as I can tell.

572
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,400
Yeah, and that headache lasts more than a year.

573
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,140
The valve is closed off and the, the eggies just aren't gonna come forth.

574
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,640
Well, we were trying to use a coat hanger for sperm and it still didn't work.

575
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,820
Well, that's because it hurts.

576
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,940
That's because it hurts.

577
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,320
The Hennison dropper would be a lot more efficacious.

578
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,420
So, do you guys want to put an order in this morning?

579
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,280
Well, a modicum of snuff.

580
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,620
Yeah.

581
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,940
Uh, uh, we're gonna have the, uh, what, the, the number eight specials for everyone.

582
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,280
Number eight, that's a Collins special with extra canned, uh, refries.

583
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:25,860
That's right.

584
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,740
And the snails.

585
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,960
The snails.

586
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,460
So, how many of there are you?

587
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:30,960
Hmm?

588
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,360
This morning.

589
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,180
How many are you?

590
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,320
It's, uh.

591
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,480
What, what does the counting start with?

592
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,760
Two.

593
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,260
One.

594
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,000
Uh, one, two, three.

595
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,020
One, around here, yeah.

596
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,300
Uh, I think.

597
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,020
Uh, six.

598
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,900
There's at least five, maybe seven.

599
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
At least five, maybe seven?

600
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,340
Seven.

601
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,660
Seven subgeniuses on a griddle.

602
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:44,760
That's right.

603
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,260
Do you want me to go to the store now or do you guys want to go on the way here?

604
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,160
Well, uh.

605
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,360
It's a sea of monsters as far as I can see.

606
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,440
The sea of pies.

607
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,180
The sea.

608
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,760
And there's a delicious gooseberry floating right now.

609
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:54,760


610
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,480
Let's go over there.

611
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,320
Oh, it sure is big.

612
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,320


613
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,920
What will become of the Gary?

614
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,340
This time there's surely no escape.

615
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,480
And a big hello to poor Reverend John Squirley who was too ill to attend this night.

616
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,000
Lucky guy.

617
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,860
He blew his mind out in a car.

618
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,260
That's right.

619
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,320
I should have stayed at work.

620
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,900
A crowd of people stood in jeer.

621
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,680
He was last heard thrashing in a bed, covered in sweat, moaning, don't let them take my

622
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,160
brain.

623
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,220
Yes, he invented the horizontal thrash dance and performed it the other night in front

624
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,380
of a vast appreciation.

625
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,840
He was a very appreciative audience of one.

626
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,880
Opening for Paul McCartney.

627
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,380
Oh, ow, ow, ow.

628
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,480
Now which one was dead?

629
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,460
Okay, Paul is dead.

630
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,280
Doug had the gun.

631
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,720
A crowd of people stood and squealed as his brain splattered on the window shield.

632
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Yes, uh, dad rather.

633
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,180
He's rather sad.

634
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,360
His brain was just a forensic show.

635
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,400
You know, on the edge of the crowd there were a couple of people who actually seemed to

636
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,980
enjoy it.

637
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,960
You know, they have now.

638
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:48,920
Beep.

639
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,320
Oopsie.

640
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,360
Couldn't take the mustard so he got out of the kitchen.

641
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
Well, he made his bed so he ate it.

642
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,680
Well, maybe it was.

643
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,360
He had his bed so he slept in it.

644
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,360


645
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,220
That's right.

646
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,860
There's Dr. Cabot.

647
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,520
You got a button.

648
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,140
Where are you guys?

649
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,440
You're treating me like a listener.

650
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,880
I'm not doing it.

651
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
You know who operates it, right?

652
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:01,760


653
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,560
Don't put listening.

654
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,020
Yeah, well.

655
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,060
Catch you later.

656
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

657
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,640
All right.

658
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,440
All right.

659
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,620
You're listening to the subgenius show.

660
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,660
Okay.

661
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,740
Now's your chance.

662
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,100
Subgeniuses.

663
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,360
That's right.

664
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,020
You can talk to some of the real people behind the Bob Dobbs.

665
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,600
The legends behind the rumors behind the headlines.

666
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,260
The subgeniuses.

667
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,380
Not gentlefolk.

668
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,340
Are all.

669
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,680
All assembled and ready to run wild in the streets until the gutters fill with blood.

670
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,720
You know, it's hard to believe people actually listen to this program.

671
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,400
I know.

672
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,300
I don't.

673
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,520
That's right.

674
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,640
That's okay.

675
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,280
I get scared.

676
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,240
Many a time I've stayed at home.

677
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,460
I've actually been awake and had the choice to listen to this show and I've refused to.

678
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:52,120
I have to edit these shows for mine but this time I won't have any problem at all.

679
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,800
This time he won't even bother because it's beyond.

680
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm the pale.

681
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,780
Man, you, you, it's just hard to edit down such a beautiful thang.

682
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,700
Yeah, it's one man's beautiful shows, another man's poison, right?

683
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,380
That's right.

684
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,600
Now I know why in Ireland.

685
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,220
Just the way they do it back in old Ireland.

686
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, green, pink brains.

687
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,460
Hello, I'm the little troll in your cereal bowl.

688
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:10,980
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

689
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,520
I like pink brains, green livers, yellow pancreas, pink heart.

690
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,600
And that's all that'll be left of you after you eat this delicious burger.

691
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,740
Well, it's a green grass court there, too.

692
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,080
Come along, Dr. Howell.

693
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,580
I like it, too.

694
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,700
It's time for the Brit store.

695
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:24,780
Oh, I like it, too.

696
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:24,780


697
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:24,780


698
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:24,780


699
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,560
I'm going to work you over.

700
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,600
Oh, dear, my old scrotum injury has started me again.

701
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,080
That's right, you're in sunny Ulster.

702
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,760
And sunny Jimmy Olsen will work me over with the end of a lead bike.

703
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,740
Yes, I shouldn't have firebombed that police station, but they were full of bobbies, and

704
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,940
you know how I hate bobbies.

705
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,640
Oh, bobbies, yeah.

706
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,160
Oh, bobbies.

707
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,180
Not that kind.

708
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,060
Not that kind.

709
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,480
Oh, I just had to blast them.

710
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,860
No, not British policemen.

711
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll take my lumps now.

712
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,060
Oh, we got this whole thing backwards.

713
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,100
I was reading my script upside down.

714
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,560
You mean policemen from England.

715
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,680
Oh, that'd be one lump.

716
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:54,780
Yeah.

717
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,020
Yeah.

718
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,800
Well, enough of that.

719
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,300
How about it?

720
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,260
Can I speak to the Antichrist, to the Uncle Chris?

721
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,640
There he is.

722
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,280
There he is.

723
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,680
We'll check.

724
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

725
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,700
Right.

726
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,560
Yeah.

727
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,900
Satan is Jesus.

728
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,600
If you want to wash all your troubles away, you write for the miracle special prepared

729
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,160
bath.

730
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:24,060
Send me your name, your birthday, and a $21 radio broadcast offering to help with the radio

731
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,500
program.

732
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,720
And I will rush you your package right back.

733
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,500
Now, children, I'm going to ask you to spend a little time on yourself.

734
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,680
So many of you, you get in such a hurry.

735
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,260
Yeah, and you get in such a hurry that you can't even hardly finish your show.

736
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,160
You know what I mean?

737
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,700
When you get to the point where you try to put together this sort of socially relevant,

738
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,520
Earth Day subjugated, subject to the...

739
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:54,780
Yeah.

740
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:54,780


741
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,860
...subject to the subgenius thing, and well, what do you end up with?

742
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,840
Just a big old pile of show.

743
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,380
And here we are doing the big old ugly pile of show, and my tape ran out and got no more

744
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,220
cool...

745
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:17,720
Well, I got a song here from Mussolini, Head Kick, that's a suitably sick commentary on

746
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,160
Earth Day.

747
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,940
You know, and you would think that we'd be able to keep up some sort of...

748
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,200
I mean, the subgenius...

749
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,860
It's supposed to be some sort of cool and groovy commentary on society and everything,

750
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,160
right?

751
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,940
No, sorry, it's not really that either.

752
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,520
It's a religion, dear friends.

753
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,940
It is a religion.

754
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:52,220
However, it's not a very good religion, but, well, we try.

755
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,940
And there's been some problems lately, I'll admit.

756
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,540
Actually, what it is, I've been...

757
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:08,480
Your host here, Reverend Ivan Stang, I've been working way too hard for about two months

758
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,800
now.

759
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Haven't been spending much time on the show.

760
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,240
You may think so.

761
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:19,120
You know, you would, I'm sure, think so from the amazing tapes and rants and things, but,

762
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,200
really, you know, it has been...

763
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,200


764
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,200


765
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,320
It has been tough, and this is my excuse.

766
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,280
I'm going to give my excuse, dear friends.

767
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,120
Now, when I first got into this world-conquering religion business, I thought it was going

768
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,240
to be this fun, interactive thing with, oh, dozens of people.

769
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,940
Now, Bob Dobbs, himself, the guru, was a little bit mum about that, actually.

770
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,200
He never said it for sure which.

771
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,200
But, you know, and it is still a fun and interactive thing.

772
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,200


773
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,200


774
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,920
The first few dozen of us were still in constant touch with each other.

775
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:06,920
It's only the couple of thousand that came aboard later that we have trouble reciprocating

776
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,920
with in any slackful, friendly, and real way.

777
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:16,760
And it isn't because the church has grown into a gigantic monster too big for its britches.

778
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,500
I wish, I wish it had.

779
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,980
But, actually, what it's been, I've been on this film job.

780
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,180
I've been on this film job.

781
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,160
I've been on this film job these last few months.

782
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:29,640
And now that it's finished, I think I ought to tell you what it is so you can look forward

783
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,100
to it.

784
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,580
Yes, I was on a job.

785
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,180
I don't do that very often, only every couple of years.

786
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:41,680
But when I do it, it pays for but sort of negates everything else for months and months.

787
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
And these aren't Hollywood film jobs.

788
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,640
I mean, they're not glamorous.

789
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,480
This is Dallas.

790
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,100
They're demanding and they're time-consuming.

791
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,180
But they're the best kind of film jobs for me.

792
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,800
They're the best for a film editor and writer such as myself.

793
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,100
A documentary, feature-length documentaries.

794
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,660
And the way it works this time and previous times is like this.

795
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,960
Somebody idealistic and generally sort of dumb provides the money, raises the money.

796
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,160
And then my dear friend and fellow North Texan, the only daredevil maniac subgenius, and the

797
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,320
most famous Buddhist Gnostic film person, Mickey Grant, Reverend Mickey Grant, goes to these

798
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:36,000
exotic locales and shoots hours and hours of real stuff plus faked reenactments if necessary

799
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,700
for the dramatic impact.

800
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,920
And then I kind of organize it and cut it all together.

801
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,520
Now, I just finished the last film yesterday, literally yesterday.

802
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,180
Actually, when I get home, I have to finish it some more.

803
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,200
But...

804
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,300
And then after that, I have to start on the second one.

805
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,500
But I told him I'm not going to work 16 hours a day anymore.

806
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,720
I've got to work 16 hours a day for Bob from now on again.

807
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,700
So, anyway, what we just finished is a 90-minute feature shot on 35mm for a blow-up to 30...

808
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,100
What did I say? Shot on 16mm.

809
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,000
We're going to blow up to 35.

810
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:18,660
And it's called The Coochie Tunnels.

811
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,840
The Coochie Tunnels.

812
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,640
And friends, it is the Vietnam War as described by the enemy.

813
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,460
Now, see, old Mickey, he's a student of Asian cultures to begin with, but while he was shooting

814
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,060
another film about the Kentucky hillbilly and Christian, Stan Cottrell, doing this,

815
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,980
quote, friendship run, unquote, from Hanoi to Da Nang, Mickey arranged with the Vietnam

816
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:57,620
government to shoot like 40 different people who fought during the war in Vietnam on the other side,

817
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:04,200
describing their experiences inside this elaborate network, this sort of ant-bed-like network of underground tunnels

818
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,780
that extended from, well, I mean, right up to our air bases in Saigon.

819
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:17,900
And these are like soldiers and doctors and singing troops, propaganda cameramen, basically ex-Vietcong.

820
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,720
Friends.

821
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,180
People who lived literally underground for as long as 10 years, got married down there, had babies down there,

822
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,780
just about died.

823
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:37,040
This film actually has more one-armed people in it than just about any other movie I can think of.

824
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,540
And it's an amazing set of stories.

825
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,280
And through working on this thing, I've gradually come to...

826
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,820
Um...

827
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,220
understand just how this incredibly impoverished country of basically ignorant peasants

828
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:00,580
was able to hold out longer than the most powerful armed force in Earth's history.

829
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,260
Now, friends, just so you know, for those of you who didn't, regarding the Vietnam War,

830
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,380
politics didn't have anything to do with it.

831
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,760
The Vietnamese were just plain sick and tired of having Catholic foreigners trying to run their country, which is Buddhist.

832
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:23,060
And the saddest thing is, once they won the war, lost two and a half million people,

833
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,120
they were stuck with the other thing they'd won.

834
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,880
Communism.

835
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,560
And now, they want nothing more than to let bygones be bygones and do business with the United States

836
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,920
so as to acquire dollars and Madonna records and washing machines and so forth.

837
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,140
In fact, um...

838
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,680
This is interesting.

839
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,660
Mickey and Stan discovered when they were walking down the streets of Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City,

840
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,820
the people would quit throwing rocks at them and become very friendly if they would shout out in Vietnamese,

841
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,340
uh,

842
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,020
me no Russian, me American.

843
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,360
Interesting how that turned out.

844
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,740
But anyway, these, uh...

845
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,480
I mean, God...

846
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,100
It...

847
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,120
Vietnam.

848
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,100
It was 20 years ago, but...

849
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,720
Those fiendishly clever, uh, under-equipped folks,

850
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,580
for 200 years they've managed to repel invasions,

851
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,840
not only by us, as they call us pinks, or call me, I speak for myself,

852
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,220
pink-skinned, deep-eyed ones,

853
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:40,280
but also the French, the Chinese, the Japanese, and a lot of other major military powers.

854
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,100
And basically proven that you don't mess with them.

855
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,500
And that's what they did with Vietnam.

856
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,500
Now, I gotta hand it to them.

857
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:52,880
On the other hand, I also have come to have the highest respect for the American soldiers who fought in that war.

858
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,600
The war happened actually almost before my time.

859
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,500
I would have been drafted in 72, but I had flat feet, praised Dobbs.

860
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,220
The war never made any sense to me until I started working on this thing.

861
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,820
But I have realized that our guys really did a really good job in that war,

862
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,780
but it was the other guy's turf,

863
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,440
and the Vietnamese would have held out until every one of them was dead.

864
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,320
Except for the several thousand that defected to the south.

865
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,940
But, all in all, I mean, politics and rightness aside,

866
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm real glad to have been able to come this close to the war without actually having to fight in it.

867
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,620
You know, politics and right and wrong are pretty meaningless

868
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,340
when some other guys are trying to kill you and your buddies and vice versa.

869
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,420
And, praised Dobbs, I learned it the easy way in an air-conditioned room.

870
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,560
At any rate, Mickey shot all these interviews with people,

871
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:57,100
but he also procured an hour of the best footage that the North Vietnamese cameramen had shot during the war.

872
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,360
This stuff looks like this black and white handheld silent movies.

873
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,480
It looks like something from the 20s, basically, because their technology was so primitive.

874
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,960
They actually had to develop this stuff in the tunnels.

875
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,020
But, it's accordingly authentic looking and really intense.

876
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:24,020
And, on top of that, the film people in Vietnam built Mickey a whole set replicating the tunnels and provided actors.

877
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,900
So, we have all these scenes that reenact medical operations and daily life and so forth.

878
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,160
I'm talking about this film because I want all of you to go see it someday.

879
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,140
I have no, I mean, I've been paid. It's all over with for me.

880
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,940
I don't earn anything from people.

881
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,420
I'm not describing this now.

882
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,420
I say that for the benefit of station people here.

883
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,400
But, you can imagine this being kind of a fun thing to edit for the last six months.

884
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,740
The trick is that every word in the film is spoken in Vietnamese.

885
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,880
And, the whole film is subtitled in English.

886
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,140
I had to do like a thousand, I had to deal with a thousand pages of translations

887
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,940
done by Ho Nguyen, the emperor of all Vietnamese movies.

888
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:16,700
He was a Vietnamese American subgeni who also then wrote each sentence number on the strips of 16mm soundtrack.

889
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:27,660
And then, Reverend Ho and myself and another subgenius Reverend, Marshall Riggin, took the best statements and kind of arranged them for dramatic impact.

890
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,620
And then, I had to cut all those film sequences together using the numbers and...

891
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:34,900
...uh...

892
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,840
...once I got into art...

893
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,040
...then I had to organize all the old archival footage, the black and white stuff they shot, and all the reenactment stuff.

894
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,040
What?

895
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,280
What?

896
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,400
They captured an American named Bob Dobbs and then...

897
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,300
...he laughed as they pulled his fingernails out.

898
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,800
Okay, well, that was...

899
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,760
I've learned a lot of language now.

900
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:05,900
Anyway, so we cut all this stuff and then I've had, for the last three weeks, I've been cutting together the subtitles.

901
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,140
Working with the subtitles.

902
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,820
Which has...

903
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,940
...had to be exactly 35 characters length and two lines long and so forth.

904
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,020
And they have to make sense.

905
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,780
Plus mixing sound effects.

906
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,300
And last night I heard...

907
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,020
...I watched the film with the music and the sound effects for the first time.

908
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,080
Everything but the subtitles.

909
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,840
And it is a pretty incredible thing.

910
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,440
The Coochie Tunnels is a movie that I hope most Americans go to see.

911
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,840
Now, the ironic thing...

912
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,780
...but I, however, also...

913
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:41,860
...the lucrative thing, possibly, is that there's still a lot of people who think the war never ended.

914
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:51,560
So we're banking on protests at, and maybe bombings of, movie theaters by right-wing Vietnamese refugees, armchair veterans, and self-appointed patriots...

915
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,240
...who will generally think the whole project is about as traitorous as Jane Fonda.

916
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,020
And in fact, if that doesn't happen, the film never will make a dime back for the investors.

917
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,680
Nobody will know about it.

918
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,600
So we're hoping for sort of a last temptation of Christ reaction.

919
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,200
To draw some interest.

920
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,420
It's not that we're a bunch of commies.

921
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:18,740
It's just that it's high time that after all these American guilt trip Hollywood features about the war that you see all the time...

922
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,320
...somebody finally should do a film about the other side.

923
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,560
And, I mean, the Army ought to be...

924
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,900
...I mean, our armed forces ought to find it valuable.

925
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,860
It's like a crash course in guerrilla warfare.

926
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,580
And the Vietnamese have tried to do things.

927
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:36,580


928
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,060
They've tried to do things.

929
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,180
They've tried to do things.

930
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,840
And they can't.

931
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,660
I mean, they're stuck in the propaganda world.

932
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,500
And besides that, nobody here would ever see it.

933
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,800
Because relations between Vietnam and America have not been normalized.

934
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,180
When Mickey was over there, I couldn't call him, or vice versa.

935
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,080
We had to use MCI mail to communicate.

936
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,620
Now some of you all out there listening now are saying, what does this have to do with subgenius to begin with?

937
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,820
Some of you are saying, you guys are traitors.

938
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,560
I lost my life.

939
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,280
I'm a leg to those commie midgets.

940
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,120
And others are saying, you exploitative imperialists.

941
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,500
Why didn't you let the Vietnamese direct the film?

942
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,320
And to both of you, I'd say, you don't know nothing.

943
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,540
You don't know nothing.

944
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:28,040
The idea of letting real people tell real stories about real things doesn't even come up in some philosophies.

945
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:34,160
And cinema verite style documentaries are as alien to most...

946
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,640
They're totally alien.

947
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,520
In most communist countries.

948
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:46,460
Which, if you've never been to one, basically they're exactly, in essence, identical to right wing fundamentalist American thinking.

949
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,740
Communism and right wing fundamentalism in America are the same thing.

950
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,660
And if you don't believe me, try living or working in one of those places.

951
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:04,120
Actually, like the last feature that Mickey did, that I worked on, China Run.

952
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,100
It'll probably end up showing in big city theaters for about a week and then on cable for a month.

953
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,600
And then it'll be in video, but never make much money.

954
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:19,460
But, the FBI agrees with us that this is probably of historical value.

955
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,520
Because they suddenly appeared behind Mickey while he was driving home the other day.

956
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,300
Pulled him over.

957
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,260
He thought they were trying to get him for the little bottle of wine he had with him.

958
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,640
But, they pulled him over and said, Mr. Grant?

959
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,100
How did you get here?

960
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:44,780
Did you know the Vietnam government was going to return the Cameron Air Base from offshore Vietnam to the United States as a conciliatory gesture?

961
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,720
And Mickey said, well, I didn't know they were going to do it.

962
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
I gave them the idea two years ago.

963
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,660
Told them they might want to return that air base if they wanted to be buddies with the U.S. again.

964
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,700
But, I didn't know they were actually going to.

965
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,940
And then the FBI said, well, can I go home now?

966
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,960
And the FBI guy said, yeah, I guess so.

967
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,620
You know, Mr. Grant, we don't know whether you're a traitor or a patriot.

968
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,980
And he said, I'm both.

969
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,780
Good night.

970
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,040
And they let him go home.

971
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,800
And it does prove that Mickey wasn't as paranoid as I thought he was when he told me our phones might be bugged.

972
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:32,920
And although that doesn't have anything to do with the Church of the Subgenius, it's certainly my best recent excuse for having been hermetically sealed off from everything.

973
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:32,920


974
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,220
Well, it looks like we're coming down near the end of the show.

975
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,060
And I managed to talk out most of it, which was the whole idea.

976
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,200
I noticed that the USA Film Festival has been going on.

977
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:52,440
And as always, I was too busy to go to it because I was working on a movie.

978
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,520
That's always the case.

979
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:01,060
But, oh, by the way, Richard Peterson, who runs the USA Film Festival, is a subgenius.

980
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,900
Early subgenius.

981
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:10,640
He let us do a show at the Minneapolis Art Museum back in 83 or something.

982
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,520
And hopefully, friends, you'll be able to see the Coochie Tunnels at the USA Film Festival next year.

983
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,940
Other news.

984
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,020
I've got to put on some kind of music here.

985
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,660
Good Lord.

986
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,680
Other news.

987
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,740
We've got, it looks like there's actually going to be another subgenius convention, folks.

988
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,800
Heard in the background.

989
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:32,880
Yeah.

990
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,280
In the background here.

991
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,480
In Los Angeles.

992
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,040
And this is for sure now.

993
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,400
Los Angeles, June 29 through 30, there will be a subgenius world convention.

994
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,440
I don't know the address yet.

995
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,380
Next week, we may be able to tell you that.

996
00:52:48,540 --> 00:53:02,260
But you better start buying your plane tickets now because it's going to be a fine, back to the tent show head-launch and revival and a general Doc Stock-like party.

997
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:02,680
You know.

998
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,480
One of those amazing, amazing things.

999
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,940
Yeah, well, I think I've had enough here.

1000
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,160
I'd love to advertise a couple.

1001
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:28,200
I got a box the other day in the mail that had ten hand-painted replica rubber bleeding head of Arnold Palmer's in it.

1002
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,240
Now, to some of you people, that may, the phrase, you know, I'm not going to say it's a good thing.

1003
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:39,200
I'm just saying that the fact that this guy's bleeding head of Arnold Palmer alone, much less hand-painted rubber replicas of the same, would make no sense at all.

1004
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,820
But, you know, that's not who we're talking to.

1005
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:50,780
If you want to know what that's all about, please do write to the box number I'm about to give because this show is about to end.

1006
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,420
And much better shows will be starting up.

1007
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,720
Friends, if you want to know anything about church and subgenius, just write to

1008
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,620
this number.

1009
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,480
These guys are singing here in the background.

1010
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,680
Oh, I forgot.

1011
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,780
I'm so used to not having to translate.

1012
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,300
Okay, I'll translate.

1013
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:23,000
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1014
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:28,720
That's B.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1015
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:30,680
That's B.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1016
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:30,700
That's B.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1017
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,360
That's B.O. Box 140306, Dallas, 75214.

1018
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,100
And, uh, uh, thank you for putting up with it.

1019
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:43,960
And, uh, I guess there is something we can put on here.

1020
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,380
Sorry.

1021
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,180
It'll be funnier next time, really.

1022
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,500
It was because of the damn Kong, man.

1023
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,760
It was the Kong that did it.

1024
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,420
Kong.

1025
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,840
Isn't that some sort of demon superstition?

1026
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,240
Kong?

1027
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,880
Uh, no.

1028
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,580
Captain, I believe it's a real animal.

1029
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,340
And we're going to capture it.

1030
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,440
Ha ha ha.

1031
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,700
It was not the airplanes.

1032
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,200
It was Beauty Kill Bob.

1033
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,800
It was the real thing.

1034
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,040
It was the real thing.

1035
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,020
It was the real thing.
