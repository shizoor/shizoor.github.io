It's a super placebo, so only take half of it if you're unsure whether you can handle it or not.
Alright, doctor, go ahead.
First paranoia. Intense. Terrible. Unreasoning terror.
What then?
Then...
I see.
You know that one man is responsible for it all.
Yes.
The man who lied when the truth would have cleared you.
Phase two.
The man who called himself...
Bob.
...is in an induced psychotic state.
Uncontrollably happy.
He's at large somewhere in the city and is potentially dangerous to others and to himself.
Stand by.
Shut up.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Zero.
Stand by.
Just shut up.
In any event, I'd better be with you to administer the antidote.
This will cut short the effect and...
Shut up.
...greatly ease any after effects.
F
It's futuristic
Which is why I've never recorded out of this
This is the first time for me
And the last time I was in this station
It was in another time and place
Another world
A lost world
Lost in banned stickers and posters
You don't want to know what I had to do
To consecrate this station
Oh but I thought this was your first time
Oh yeah
It's my first time in this studio
But this is where I come and slip the show
Into automation
For later
So it's sort of a
Robotic sort of show
Yeah kind of like sex
Yeah
They don't let us do that
In Cleveland
The sex
Are you sure?
Or the robots
We can't use robots
Some person has to be there
To run the robot
It runs
They
They
They
Have to sit at a sort of a bicycle looking thing
And pedal
To run the robot
That explains your incredibly
Incredibly attractive legs
Why thank you
You like my stockings too?
Yes
We dressed up special for Dragon Con
We're in town
You're the only man I know who can wear heels like that
Listen to that
Swinging jazzy music
In the background
Oh it's perfect
It's perfect
It's sort of
Tickling
Sort of like tickling
The three suns
Ah
Big fever
The three suns
Oh I really
I thought it was
Giant walrus swim
Not my three suns
Susie Staifert's song
Where's she going?
She said the elephants were hot
She's gone to take them for a swim
Come on baby
Dumbo
Well go get a gun
And follow her
And see that you
I don't think I can go fast enough
Big wanna
Now by the way
Station rules say
Do not gripe about station equipment
While on the air
Now I don't know that that's this station rules
And it's certainly not WCSB station rules
But I know it's KPFA station rules
Cause Filer
Deliberately reads that rule all the time
While griping
About the equipment
Shall we sing a song of complaint
Complaint
About KPFA?
Well
It wouldn't be applicable would it?
No
You're not listening to KPFA
In Berkeley
You want to be abducted by a large
A large male
A large flying machine comes down
Frozen oat eskimo pops right?
Oat pops
Yeah oat pops
They are
That place I'm trying to
On the way on 14
On the way to Broadway
Just throw your trash in there
Okay
It's so close
It's a Korean place on the north side of the street
You know you just want to
Two blocks from Broadway
Right here right here
And he's a nice little caller
All clean and friendly
Blowing my ears out
All praise
What are you doing awake at this hour sir?
I'm doing a change here
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Right here
How it do?
I hate the way it does that
When you don't intend for it to
Have to go now
Ok
Ok
Deniable plausibility
Implausible undeniability
Is more like what you have
I have
Now I can hear your
Your dulcet tones real well Susie
My dulcet tones are going to crap out by tomorrow night.
Everyone at the Divival we're doing at Dragon Con tomorrow night
is going to hear Reverend Ivan Stang reading my rant
because my voice is going to fail.
And he swears he's going to do it in his girly voice.
I'll do it in my girl voice.
I'll sound just like Boogie Boy.
Well, Mr. Stang there, I've got to tell you, you sound like Ray Stevens.
I don't know. I think you sound more like Ray Stevens.
You'll have to dress apart, though.
Do I have to talk like a real, real, real deep-voiced southern man, then,
to balance it out?
Yeah, yeah.
I can work on that. I'll certainly do.
Yeah, I actually could.
It seems like Pisces would do better with the ventriloquism of you.
Yeah, but I'd have to stick my head with our music.
Do we have to work your mouth like a sock puppet,
a person with his hand up a sock puppet?
Wow. I'd pay good money for that.
Some people would.
I will.
I got, I recently had someone pay me to not do that.
Yeah.
I got, I got $60, which is the amount of two memberships,
to not do that.
And thus, I will leave you now,
and make way for the beautiful Priestess Pisces.
Here we are.
She may have a surprise for you. I don't know.
But in the meantime, there's one thing I want to leave you with,
and that is that,
one rule of Bob, the one rule of the Church of the Subgenius,
fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Praise Bob, praise Princess Pisces, praise Dragon Con,
and all you fucked up weirdos on drugs.
Let's see here.
Years ago, I found out that I had a dog's head in my eyeball.
Which is not something you want to find out.
I am the party!
The party!
The party!
The party!
The party!
Where's the party?
Where's the cup?
You know what?
I'll tell you what's gonna happen to you, boy.
Because if you don't find yourself some salvation,
there's going to be some saucers coming on July 5th,
and they're gonna burn you, boy.
They will burn you to a crisp.
We're not talking about some
monotheistic hell kind of burning here.
Because you see, these aliens,
they thrive off your pain.
They thrive off your suffering.
And all they want to do is come to Earth
and kill each and every one of you
in the slowest, most painful possible way ever.
You're gonna have to go through this.
I think I'm having a flashback.
It's a flash-forward, but you're sitting in the wrong direction.
I think I'm finally coming down from that stuff.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
It was Pup Torb.
We've been doing a lot of Pup Torb.
And the jinkum.
Yeah, the jinkum's good.
You know, DragonCon actually has some great jinkum.
Yeah, they're having jinkum room parties.
And I'd hate to be the housekeeping staff.
Yes.
In fact, when we're done here, we've got a lot of them.
I've been invited to a jinkum room party, I believe.
On good quality jinkum.
BYOB.
Right.
Bring your own bathroom.
Right.
Right.
God, this music makes me feel like I'm in a psychedelic supermarket.
We are, aren't we?
Is that a bad thing?
I mean, look, they have a jinkum coffee.
I'm not getting any.
I'm being dry-gulched with the music.
I bet I'm not even going out on this.
You're going out.
No, you're going out.
You're going down, baby.
No, not putting out.
Not putting out.
Not going down.
Not putting out.
No, you're going out just fine.
I can hear you crying.
I'm going down.
Ladies and gentlemen, I may be the only person in this room who can hear out of a ear.
Yeah, that's true.
She doesn't have the cicadas.
No, no.
I have fogginess in one and clear in the other.
And I can hear you clear as a church bell if this church of some genius had such bells.
A church bell with a knob that goes all the way up to 11.
Exactly.
My vision is going.
My hearing is working.
My sense of smell is getting worse, but my sense of smell is getting more finely owned.
This stinking world.
That's really a shame.
That is.
It sucks.
You would think there would be some other compensation.
Yeah.
Some dispensation, like increase in tactile sensation.
Well, I thought it might be a side effect of the third nostril.
I can plug two with the third one.
Well, you feel, you do, as you age, you do get an increase in tactile sensations in your
joints.
Ah.
Your knees, your ankles, your elbows.
I've also heard that the only things that actually don't stop growing in your body with
age are your nose and your ears.
That's increasingly obvious from what I'm looking at right now, St. Mariner.
My Virginia Dentata.
Wasn't that going to be a new subgenius church name for somebody?
Reverend Virginia Dentata.
It sounds good.
It's available.
It needs to be.
It needs to be.
A girl with a nose.
I feel like Virginia Dentata is going to be available all the time.
It's up on eBay.
I think somebody owns the name.
It's kind of something.
Yeah, by now.
It's been a jazzy, squatted name.
She's a toothsome lass.
In fact, maybe we should name squat and then I can sell the names and that's an idea.
Yeah.
I mean, it should work.
Yeah, they do it with domains.
This music is making me feel like I'm at Woodstock or smoking, what do they call that stuff?
Marijuana.
Or...
I never...
I never actually did that.
You know, it's funny.
I've had several people at that science fiction convention would walk up to me and go, Reverend
Stank, do you smoke pot, right?
And I'd look at them and go, do I look like somebody who would smoke pot?
I ask you, radio listeners.
You know, I mean, give me a break.
Let's see.
You look like you've got long hair and you've got them goatees like...
Like them hippies seem to have.
Pot smokers have to hide so they wouldn't want to look like pot smokers.
And that hip-to-roach clip that you hold up in front of you looking pitiful.
Oh, and that...
You said that was a UFO detector, but it's...
No, it's actually a UFO deflector.
Oh.
You misheard me.
I have never...
Is that why they haven't shown up, Stank?
Stank has been stank.
No, UFOs.
I'm not talking about excess.
I'm talking about excess.
I'm talking about unidentified flying oddities.
Well, I suppose that would be right.
You know, no account greys and your silly little zeta reticulans and your pathetic saucer
crashers, those little Roswellian creatures that can't even fly right.
Give me a break.
You think they have some sort of screening test before they put them behind the wheel?
Sort of a...
What about this hippie music?
Now I'm being...
For some reason, I want to go join the Army and sit around in a draft station.
Sit here on the Group W bench.
I just sit here on the Group W bench.
But we're all in an Army.
We're in an Army for the goal of slack.
And we fight the anti-slack every minute of the day.
We march our boots, walking through the...
I fight anti-slack by laying in bed...
September, September, September, September.
Yes.
...and eating and watching TV.
That's how I fight.
Eating at Alice's restaurant
Because it was private
I wish you guys wouldn't make fun
I'm going to tell Sergeant Dobbs on you
Sergeant Dobbs
Sergeant Dobbs
They're making fun of my privates again
I can't hear you
It's about
It's all about
Shazam Captain Dobbs
He's Colonel O'Truth
Over there
Colonel what?
Colonel O'Truth
I don't think he's Colonel O'Truth
Maybe he's
General Maylaise
Yeah maybe
Speaking of Maylaise
Did you see some of those girls tonight?
Sorry
Sorry
, I guess I may have noticed
You know
It's a baited field of trim over there
But they are all unsaved souls
We have to do something about this
I saw things wrapped in gold lame
That should be saved from the
Impending doom of the exes
I saw things where nothing but duct tape
That could use a little saving too
I brought some
But really, really
The word has to get out to these
Poor souls
We have to fight the good fight
As much as we would like to relax
And slack off
And as much as Stag would like to sit down
And eat submarine sandwiches
And lay in cushy hotel beds
We can't do that at all
We have to keep fighting
Yeah, I'm in the streets
Working for him while he lies on his duvet
Actually
It wasn't even my bed I was laying on
Sucking all them little bottles
I can barely hear these wimpy voiced girls
Over that music
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
No, seriously
No, no, no, Susie
Other way
Other way
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
It's your high-pitched chicken voices
They're the same pitch as the
Cicadas in my head
And a lot of the music
Cicada music
Cicada music
That would be an interesting thing
An evening of cicada music
And an evening
Mature hippopotamus waddle
Was the name of that tune
Oh my god, he did that
Oh
No
No, he hasn't done anything
I've just been naming songs
That was Alice's Restaurant
That's why I got a phone in my mic
Where I can't hear any of the music
On the headphones
That was the supermarket
Or elevator version
Of Alice's Restaurant
You know, I knew that the end times
Were coming when I
When I was walking through the supermarket
And heard the Muzak version
Of the times they are a-changing
Oh, man
I've heard
I've also been in an elevator
And heard a hard rain is gonna fall
Turned into Muzak
That's good to hear
When you're in an elevator
Oh, man
Oh, man










God, I'm glad I didn't think of it at the time
Jeez
You are
Oh, oh
Oh, I see
I'm adjusting things
I got so many different layers going on
Layers upon layers
I'm wearing some lingerie
Now, this song that's in the background
Now, Kumbaya
Yes
Is the name of it
It was
It's
As I understand it
That's something kids who went to church camp
Had to sit around singing
Yeah
Is that so?
I was never at a church camp
Aside from Dobbs Town
Yeah
Where I'm from
It was what parents did with the kids in the summer
It didn't matter if you were religious or not
Your family could not even really believe in any of it
But they'd send you to a vacation Bible school
Just to get you out of the house in the summer
Their vacation
Their vacation
I mean, vacation
Bible school
It's, you know, and when you're a kid
Bummer
Yeah, it's an incredible bummer
It's like a trick within a trick within a trick
Why do they have Bible in school?
There's a red flags
Yeah, well, you know
Religion, learning, let's get out of here
That's just during the summer, you know
When kids can't wait to go learn about the Bible
They get out of regular school
And I'm sure they just flock into those Bible study classes
Song of Solomon was my favorite
Mm-hmm
Oh, it was such a nice, dirty, nasty little
Lo, my bowels are moved for thee
I long to see your breasts again
You know, that sort of thing
Like two twin gazelles
Yes
It sort of sounded
It was
I'm convinced that all the Harlequin romance writers
Actually get their source material from Song of Solomon
Mm
I'm pretty sure
It is really bodice-ripping, boring romance
Speaking of bodices
I was gonna say the same thing
There were a lot of those on view at that science fiction convention
A lot of corsets and a lot of lush melons perched and jiggling atop these contraptions
You know, that whole sci-fi and comedy thing is just so much fun
I mean, the comics field has a reputation for being a sausage fest
But I saw as much melon gobble-able bounce, bountiful, bouncing babes
Ain't nature grand
And it's nerd girls, man
Which, you know, nerd girls are easy
That's the important
They're desperate
Glasses, girls and glass
If they have glasses, that means they're desperate
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Let me fix this for you, please
I'm gonna tell you right now
And I'm gonna share you a little bit of secret about the Church of the Subgenius as well
You know how at DragonCon, if you're a girl of that persuasion
And you're walking around
It seems to be that you can't keep the boys off of you
That you get invited to hundreds of room parties
That you just would be exhausted running around in your corset
From floor to floor in both the Hyatt and the Marriott
Trying to keep up with all your invites on your social calendar
Because there's a lot more men than women
Well, as much as Stang would like to say otherwise
The tilt is still a little off in the Church of the Subgenius
So we want to invite you to come and join us
Yes, ladies, please
Come and join the Church of the Subgenius
And yet, if there were no tilt, then there'd be no seasons, right?
It'd all just be one climate year-round
Uh, yeah, but it'd be different from place to place, you know?
I mean, it'd always be really hot right at the equator
Yeah, so tilting is fine
But we were talking about chicks, man
What's wrong with you?
The tilt of the axis, 23.5 degrees
Is the same as the tilt of the female pelvis
Mmm...
I bet you didn't think about that
That's no coincidence
That couldn't possibly be a coincidence
No, that was just signed in by the aliens who created us
Ten billion years ago!
In the Donnigan age!
Makes sense now when you know that
The Von Donnigan age, yes
Right, Von Donnigan
The Von Donnigan age
And you know what Jimi Hendrix had to say about bowling?
Axis Bowl is love
Oh...
That was his bowling name
Oh...
He actually...
Or another thing I remember him saying to an audience was
Let's make, like, toilet paper and roll
And he's a poet
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, Hendrix was truly a great poet
Right
Full of slack
Full of slack
Yeah
There's an interesting display at the...
Believe it or not, I've actually been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
It was free on Martin Luther King Jr. Day
And so therefore I went
And the only thing I was actually interested in
That I found interesting was the Hall of Equipment
Which made me feel really old
Because starting about three feet into the hall
I recognized every piece of those things
But they had Hendrix's drawings from elementary school
Really?
Like dozens of them
At least 30 or so
Of little crayon and pencil drawings
And they were absolutely normal
It was football players, dinosaurs
Hot rods, race cars
War scenes, lots of war scenes
And the occasional flying saucer
He's not a bad artist for an 11-year-old
The occasional flying saucer?
But I was quite surprised
You know, I was half expecting to see more of a psychedelic thing
But I guess the 11-year-old Jimi Hendrix hadn't really...
He was not aware of the psychedelic thing at the time
Gone, yeah
He hadn't invented that yet
Well, they were probably taking mescaline somewhere, you know
Little kids?
No, no, I mean like...
Smoking gypsum weed?
Aldous Huxley or guys like that were probably...
Wasn't that what that Ovaltine stuff was?
It sounds like some sort of powerful hallucinogen
It was actually a mind control device
But not by the good guys
It was the bad guys
Yeah, good mind control is great
Yeah!
What we're doing right now is really good!
Mind control
Mind control
Mind control
I know it just sounds like a bunch of blithering to you
But there's this hidden signal
The subconscious signal which goes out from...
During all subgenius broadcasts
On the...
It's the fourth or the fifth wave, I believe?
Or is it...
I don't know how they do it
Well, you know...
The ninth wave, Kate Bush said it
I may have known at one time, but it...
Erased that knowledge
You know, that's what it's there for
I gave up on mind control
I'm having more luck with behind control
Yeah, actually
Yeah, but well...
Good for you
I...
If you...
After we get off the air
If you could give me some hints
I probably could use some
Backfield and commotion, baby
My mind control is...
You know, I...
I've been having a little bit of trouble with it
You are getting sleepy
Sleepy
You got that right
Yes
Well, you need to wake up
You have to wake up
You have an important task
We've got to get off the air
We've got to get off the air
We've got to get off the air
We've got to get off the air
That's right, friends
We aren't just blithering away for nothing
We're blithering for J.R. Bob Dobbs
We're blithering for Bob
That mighty beacon of slack
Blithering and drooling
Who leads so many to...
Actually, you know, I had quite a few people walk up to me today and go
Reverend Stang, thank you
I'd go, I think you got me mixed up with J.R. Bob Dobbs
I'm just, you know, I'm the clerk
I'm the mail clerk, essentially
And...
He's a mail clerk
I do the...
Whoa, you ask mail
I do get to deposit the checks
Like I said, they don't let me go to the real hierarchy parties, you know, that Philo gets to go to and Bob goes to and so forth
No, I...
I think it was the cream of the crop
But I did get to go to Dragon Con
Yes
This morning we got bribed with tequila and biscotti
That's true
That was great
Finally get something out of this damn church
I'm sorry
But, uh, Susie the floozy and I, as subgenius ministers, were judges at a super villain contest
Who wants to be a super villain?
Remember, you're being graded on cruelty, sightism, and fiendishness, among other things
My name is the bug because I plan on using cockroaches in my evil plans because they cannot be killed
I would use the cockroaches to feed the hungry
Big above the other
Come here
Frontrence Bob, that's a...

I did have three and a half minions.
Unfortunately, I'm down to two and a half minions
after the beta testing of the plasma cannon.
So that didn't work out.
Then I thought about blackmail.
But unfortunately, I'm not certain with the churches of the subgenius
if there's anything dirt that I could get on you
that not only you would admit to, but actually be proud of.
So I have left a bribe.
Minion!
He's a big one, isn't he?
Wow.
All right.
Bribes.
Yes, I did bring...
Bribes.
I understand these things.
I am a provisional.
This is why I'm in this.
I don't drink.
This sucks.
The most evil drink.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man, this is some classy evil.
This is very evil.
Tequila Resurfa 1800 Silver.
Evil laugh.
Mwahahahaha!
I didn't have any trouble writing this.
Mwahahahaha!
Mwahahahaha!
Mwahahahaha!
Mwahahahaha!
Mwahahahaha!
Mwahahahaha!
What super villains are most influenced your particular brand of villains?
I like to think that I am an original, but I do owe a lot to earlier super villains.
If for no other reason, by studying their failures,
I will not repeat myself.
Battle.

Yeah, there were some pretty evil characters there.
They were rated on the evil laugh.
Yeah, now, of course, I gave a 10 to Dr. DNA, who had a henchman.
Most of these people didn't even have costumes.
But he had a henchman with him.
He had a costume.
And he bribed us.
He was evil enough to give us pretty expensive jugs of tequila.
Yeah, 1,800 silver stuff.
But, you know, cuteness wins in terms of evil.
Something about cuteness is even more evil than evil.
Because the final winner was this little boy, maybe about six years old,
who said that his evil plan, he came up with on the spot.
Oh, we were scared to death.
He comes out and says,
Well, it's too bad because of all your evil plans.
Because I'm going to say,
I'm going to set a bomb in every single planet.
Whoa!
That's the most evil thing I've ever heard of.
Not very good.
Sometimes going with the classics is good.
That's some evil stuff.
Thank you.
Glad I brought my deep parents.
He didn't specify in the universe, but that was assumed.
And that is a lot of planets.
I mean, we don't even know how many planets there are.
That is a lot of bombs.
That was the most evil thing anyone came up.
And he judo flipped me when I shook his hand.
Yeah, he had superpowers.
This kid wasn't more than about three feet tall.
And he honestly did do a judo move when she tried to...
I bent down to shake his hand.
He didn't want to shake my hand.
And when he finally put his hand out, my guard was down.
And that little bugger...
He never judo flipped me face down on the floor.
There was a lot of evil in that room.
I was proud.
I was so proud.
All of the contestants were evil.
You know, fairly evil at least.
Well, our winner last year was Dictator Barbie.
Oh, that's why she got to be a judge this time.
Yeah, that's why she was judging.
She knows her evil.
And the Flaming Carrot was one of the judges,
although I noticed he never spoke a word the whole time.
Neither did his creator, the evil Bob Bird.
He basically just sat there the whole time.
I don't know.
He didn't seem to be too evil to me today.
I'm just saying.
Here's the thing, though.
That's true.
It seems to me that the normals seem to think that slack is wrong or evil.
Oh, yes.
Slacker is an old insult.
Yeah.
I mean, but slack is so good.
Boom slackalackalackalackalack.
Well, where's that one been all my life?
What?
Boom slackalackalackalackalack?
I think it's in your head, I guess.
That's where it's been.
Well, it's spelled out now.
Boom slackalackalackalackalacka.
Boom.
See?
It works out perfect.
But wait, she's been abducted.
Oh, no.
What do we do?
Oh, our host.
Hey, she's gone.
Susie's gone.
We can do anything we want.
Let's see.
What are the four?
Let's bring food into the radio station and drinks and let's smoke in here.
It's Baby Elephant Walk.
We've got to play Baby Elephant Walk while she's out of the studio.
You got it.
Listen.
Let's talk it.
Let's just say it over and over again.
Baby Elephant Walk.
Baby Elephant Walk.
Baby Elephant Walk.
You can't hear us.
Yes.
I can't hear you.
Please, please, please.
Oh, my God.
I can't hear you.

Go, Stan, go.
Go.
She was ready to kill you every time you hummed to that little beloved Mancini tune.
It's too powerful.
It is.
Give up, you know.
Give up.
You're not going to win against that song.
Give up.
Give up.

Negative laugh.
I thought you gave up tonight.

let other people steal that.
The nerve.
Somebody said,
hey, do you think a hustler would mind if I
videotaped him?
Who?
The Negative Land guy. The guys are famous
for copyright
legal... I have a book about them.
Right.
Well,
a hustler said,
it would look kind of bad for me to tell people
I couldn't videotape my show, and I wouldn't.
Yeah, that would be bad.
Oh, wait, she's coming
back. By the way, he asked about all of you.
Mark Hossler
from Negative Land asked about all of you,
the listeners. All of us?
Yeah, not you. He didn't mention you
or Byron or Susie. Actually, he did mention
Susie. He remembered Susie
tromping across his back
in high heels. He was
asking for it.
And she was only one of three
dolls, three Connie ties.
Oh, someone from the Dharma Initiative just
walked in. Oh, hello, worker.
Isn't that bad?
Yeah. This is Fat Joe.
He's my keeper, Tender.
He keeps you tender?
Yeah.
That's a wonderful, authentic
Dharma Initiative suit.
That'll be called Adolf, then.
I like that. That shows.
4, 8, 50, 60, 20, 40.
9.
4, 8, 50, 60, 20, 40.
4, 8, 60, 40.
Incidentally.
Incidentally.
Incidental.
I'm kind of lost
as to where we're going with all this.
We were going...
Lost, you say?
Lost?
I turned into a lost nerd.
That's so sad.
Yeah, lost nerd.
Lost in the dust.
You know, if you want to replay this in 10 years,
it's going to sound hopelessly dated
because you just brought up some sort of lame
pop culture reference.
Oh, gee. Let's not do any
lame pop culture references on the hour.
Slack. Oh, Lord.
No. No, no.
That'd be as bad as Dead Air.
Oh, man. I got their first album.
It's great.
Dead Air?
Yeah.
It's only on one side of the record, I think.
I couldn't get anything to play on the other side.
Right.
It's a concept, man.
Or maybe it was a...
It's a conceptual concept album?
Maybe it was a compact disc.
There's nothing on the other side.
I hate the people that drive down the street
playing that side B at top volume
just to irritate people.
It's like Pootie Tang's new hit song,
called...
Squishy Bits.
So I brought five membership packs
and we're selling all five right off the bat.
You are saved, young man!
You are saved, son of a bitch!
Thank you, Bob!
Totally saved.
Saved up one side and down the other.
And you just saved,
$30 right there.
Oh, feel the power.
I love watching you put it in your wallet.
You can feel the power
as the money passes from hand to hand.
Oh, he's got a twofer.
A twofer!
That's a mating call.
Do I need to marry anybody while I'm doing it?
You two?
Yes.
Now feel the power as it passes into your hands
because I sure felt it when I got that money.
Touch me.
Touch me.
You healed!
I'm healed.
Say baby.
You're making me to walk.
Sir, I need to...
Feel it.
I need to feel it.
Bob!
You're saved!
Now turn around!
So now that we're subgenia,
are y'all having a party?
I know that I'm going to sell at least three memberships.
No, four or five memberships.
There was a whole crew of people...
We got that tequila.
...walked up and...
We could go out and get them good and drunk
so they buy.
No, no, no.
It's communion.
Or communication.
We'll hold the sacred rites of communication
where we...
We dose them
and give them a little piece of bread
that's been rubber stamped with Bob's face.
...pleaveage
and they don't know that they're drinking on Sunday.
They look like I'm just nursing fans.
Yeah.
You know...
It's crazy enough to work.
You know, Lagoon did something like that
but it wasn't boobs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I fell for that one.
I did too.
Sorry, I got these...
He didn't invite me.
I always get left out.
Well, Lagoon...
He said something about you're no fun.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Herm.
Herm.
Hey, how about all those...
I started counting the jokers
at that sci-fi convention.
I got up to about 40.
It was lousy.
Yeah, it was lousy with jokers.
It really was.
And Rorschach.
There's no precision involved in the makeup.
That really appeals to them.
I believe it was another subgenius
who pointed out that probably
that they're all...
All Heath Ledger.
Oh.
I believe it was Bunny Day
who pointed that out to me.
Wow.
That they were all Heath Ledger.
Ooh.
Or at least parts of Heath Ledger.
Like they took like...
Well, except for one.
Here's Heath Ledger's colon.
One of them though was Michael Jackson
in Joker makeup.
There were a few...
I expected a lot more undead Michael Jackson.
I guess there's not going to be
any more Cesar Romero's.
Nobody cares about the old C's.
That's right.
Yeah.
I kind of...
You don't need...
Yeah, Heath Ledger's performance
was not very informed
by Cesar Romero's performance
as the Joker, I guess.
He didn't even reference it once, you know?
I saw it.
He didn't grow a mustache
or refuse to shave it off
or anything like that.
No, no, no.
I always wondered what that caked crap was.
I thought it was like some sort of like
utility belt thing
that was going to do something for the Joker.
Oh!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha.
Oh, ha.
Ha.
Ha.
Oh, ha.
Ha.
Ha.
Ha.
Ha.
Ha.







I thought my jokes were bad.
He comes at me with the knife.
Why so serious?
He sticks the blade in my mouth.
Let's put a smile on that face.
And...
Ha.
Ha.
Ha.
















See, I'm not a monster.
I'm just ahead of the curve.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
And then...
And then...
And then...
And then...
And then...
And then they'll ruin...
They'll ruin another Catwoman
and then they'll ruin another...
They'll keep going and going and going.
They don't think of it as ruining her.
It's rather having her fixed.
What?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
But yeah, it's just the way it is.
It's sort of the thing is that when you're on the outside, you can look at this and say,
why, Stang, that movie was so full of the conspiracy.
Which movie?
That one.
Oh.
You know that one?
Oh, that one?
That one?
Well, sure.
But then that other one was too.
You can say that about everything because everything is full of the conspiracy.
That was my point.
Yeah.
It's the truth.
Everything is full.
It's tainted.
It has the taint.
It's dripping.
Even your taint has the taint.
Of the conspiracy.
You cannot shower enough.
There ain't no taint like a tainted taint.
No.
So you have to admit that to yourself.
That's the first step.
Even a saint has a taint.
Five times you have to admit that to yourself.
Yeah.
Five times.
Real fast.
And that's your first step towards slack.
I am full of the conspiracy.
You have now.
I am full of the conspiracy.
I am full of the conspiracy.
Okay.
That's enough.
Faster.
Faster.
Full of the conspiracy.
Then there's the cult of the living bull.
Oh, yeah.
Which gets you.
Gets you to cast out all of the bull.
Father Dennis Murphy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's my favorite rival cult.
Yeah.
Mystery cult.
The cult of the living bull.

It's nice to have a rival who isn't some insane firebrand.
Right.
They don't even have a P.O. box.
I mean, they're more disorganized than the Discordians.
Yeah.
But way less sold out than the Church of the Subgenius.
And the cult of the living bull.
The whole initiation climaxes with the initiate and whoever else is around screaming at the
top of their lungs the word bull to expel all of the bull that we must deal with in
our lives.
You know, having to pass for normal, having to pretend that you understand what your boss
is telling you, all of that kind of bull.
Right.
And they just yell it.
Yes.
They just yell it and it's free.
It's a free cult.
That's another silly thing about it.
It's cheap.
It doesn't require coffee enema.
He, Dennis.
Not necessarily.
They contributed one of my favorite slogans to us.
The Church of the Subgenius.
It's a no brainer.
Yeah.
That's a Dennis Murphy line.
That's the only use of that term that I will accept.
Right.
The Church of the Subgenius.
It's a no brainer.
Truer words were never spoken.
That is the subgenius.
The state to which we aspire.
To be like Bob.
That is the very essence of it.
The very nugget.
What's in Bob's head is the same thing that's inside his pills that he sells you.
Nothing at all.
Or how did Onan put it?
Stop thinking and you'll know what you think immediately.
In his left brain, nothing is right.
And in his right brain, there's nothing left.
Hey.
That was.
That explains a lot.
Yes, it does.
Yes, it does.
Right.
So it's not like we're trying to be smarty pants.
Uh, because we think that the intelligence has been misdefined.
Smarty pants can hide a dumb ass.
Right.
Clean pants is something to work towards.
I think you're just skirting the issue.
A lot of subgeniuses are still learning.
Right.
If you're wearing clean pants, it's like you're expecting an accident.
That's true.
It shows a lack of confidence.
I never thought of it that way.
Mine are goat tracked because I'm confident.
I know.
I'm not going to get hit by that bus.
You're confident in quite a few things, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is the connection between being hit by a bus and the cleanliness of underwear?
Apparently many, many people live in the fear that they're going to suddenly be in some accident and medical personnel will have to yank their britches off.
Right.
And we'll see that their underwear is not in pristine condition.
Let me explain.
This is a.
It's it was a problem years and years ago for your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother at the beginning of when we first wore knickers and not even underwear said as her daughter and son were leaving the house on horseback.
Make sure you have unclean knickers.
If you fall off that horse, you do not want the knights to come by to rescue you and find out that you have dirty knickers.
It's that old.
Yes.
Wow.
Well, I guess so.
It's like a genetic memory.
The fear of medical personnel checking out your knickers.
It's not even genetic.
It's just straight hand me down.
Hand me downs.
A part of the culture.
It's a knicker obsession.
And speaking of obsessed knickers.
Oh, wait.
No, wait.
Obsessed about knickers.
Bob Burden was talking about obsessive artists.
He had.
He had a term for.
Yeah.
Obsesso art or something like that.
Bob can really turn a phrase.
Turn it over his knee and wheel the tar out of it.
Well, he's full of ideas.
He's the guy who told me that.
He was a guy who said nothing this morning on that panel when he was judging with us.
And tonight sitting alone.
Man.
He told me that the church is so genius could get really big and go mainstream.
If only we quit making fun of religion.
Wow.
And he meant it.
He wasn't kidding.
Right.
That's very bright.
It's very well thought out.
It's very said by the man who's been making fun of carrots, which is essentially the same
thing.
Hey, that movie.
Shoot him up.
Don't they owe him?
I don't know if you've seen that.
No, no.
I don't see movies.
Carrots become the deadliest weapon imaginable in the hands of this over the top hero and
shoot him up.
It's not a chick flick.
I wouldn't say.
Well, although what's a chick flick?
You know what I mean?
The ones where it's all the mushy stuff and no monsters.
Nobody flies through the air in front of a fireball.
Those are chick flicks.
The guy flicks are the ones where some somebody flies through the air in front of a fireball.
And usually there's some kind of a monster or something or evil supervillain or something.
But they always ruin the guy ones with putting like some chick in it.
And and and oh, I'm the greatest superhero.
I'm the greatest monster ever.
But I really have a crush on that girl.
So, you know, while I'm fighting the giant slimy thing from the hellacious underworld,
I'm going to have to tell her I love her so that they'll know to kidnap her later.
Well, yeah, that's that's it.
When I was a kid, I did not understand why they put the mushy stuff in there.
And now I it's it's the main thing that keeps me going.
I was watching the creature from the Black Lagoon for the first time.
It's very recently since I was since I was like pretty young.
And I remember watching the creature in all the time.
This time I was watching Julie Adams.
Right.
All the time.
Oh, God, that white.
Who, by the way, for you lost the holics was was had a small part as one of the others.
The the Julie Adams is probably about my mom's age.
Oh.
It's just possible that this is it.
Well, that's all there is to it.
Now, I tell you what I believe.
This beast mob exists because it is stronger than the thing that you call evolution.
In it is some force of life, a demon driving it through millions of centuries.
It does not surrender so easily to weaklings like you and me.
This is the thing that you hunt for.
Think on it.
More like gentlemen.
You know, that movie was the one that first started planting the the seeds in my brain.
Really?
Yeah.
The Gilman.
Oh, that was the one that I snuck.
I was about three or four and I had a babysitter who was watching it.
It came on TV and they actually had a special one.
That was.
It was 3D.
Wow.
3D glasses that came on television.
Good Lord.
I snuck out of the bedroom and hid behind the couch and put my little nose right on
the edge of the couch pretty much and watched most of that movie.
Great.
But not in 3D.
That's why you.
That's why Pisces is here with us tonight.
Is that the creature walks among us?
No.
The creature from the Black Lagoon.
The creature from the Black Lagoon.
Now, not to be confused with the preacher from the Black Lagoon.





Pric
You know, you've played all this for a rainy season.
You're here.
What would you imagine on a Friday night when you're this dark?
Why don't you introduce yourself to theati?
It's a l'cha.
What is it?
Every Friday night.
Whenever you hit Sleepn Abhishek, local Behaviorist or régimen one wants to have
fun.
Does complete BUT your.
Of all the weis.


gging all the way into David your superhero.
Eh?
Oh, what?



Yeah.
But what even sir them containing a few surprised us gone forced our draw aside to
say you hey hey me さ stage, which says one record that he'd since that he just
Browning playing the creature. I bet it was
Julie Adams for him, too.
I've fallen in with the people who do the
Silver Scream spook show here
in town, and one of them
is a real Rico Browning
nut, and he got to go swim
in Weeki Wachee Springs
with Rico Browning.
Rico Browning...
Rico Browning
later went on to direct.
He did? Yeah.
Oh, that's good.
Well, I'll be. See?
Directed by the creature.
Wow.
The gill man.
Direction left, right, left, right.
Stage right, stage left, stage...
Oh, no, we should stay here, shouldn't we?
Oh, my...
They're so cute at this stage.
Yes, yes.
Everybody's talking at me.
Yeah, they're talking about you.
I can't hear a word they're saying.
I really can't hear a word they're saying.
You're making fun of me again,
aren't you?
I'm firing, because I'm
beef.
Won't you ever leave it
all behind?
No, no, no.
I always think of the movie Midnight Cowboy,
of course, when this plays.
I don't know why you do that. That's weird.
My grandfather
didn't like that movie.
It showed too much.
Just because... Kitchen sink movie
as Ray Harryhausen.
Just because it's got a young buck, like
yourself, beating up on an old guy,
like him, taking his money
and knocking out his plate,
his upper plate.
I don't know nothing about it.
I don't know nothing.
It was X-rated when it first came out.
Where is that Joe Buck?
What? Joe who what?
That was an influential movie on me.
I see.
That was the beginning.
That was back in the days when
it wasn't cool to have got people
flying through the air in front of fireballs.
And it was
cool to have depressing...
Boy, they were lame, man.
Yeah, it was...
Star Wars
was the one that tipped
everything back into mindless escapism.
Byron actually played
R2-D2 in Star Wars. That's another
little known fact. That's why he's here.
I played him in checkers.
Chinese checkers. And I won every single
time. He's a robot. He's easy to beat.
Really?
I've seen a photo of you peeking out from
inside the R2-D2 seat.
Don't you?
You can't deny it.
Well, I can, but I won't.
No, that was a different
model. That was 04Q2.
You know, Tom, alcohol
hits some people faster than others because of
metabolism. Rate of absorption and
well, you know,
change metabolism and maybe
eliminate drunk drivers.
Tom, we found
the secret. Change the metabolism and man will change.
Maybe.
It's the interaction of heredity and environment
for millions of years that makes you new species.
We only change the skin,
doctor, not the animal.
But we can bring out the best or worst
in any living thing. Environment does that.
If it threatens him, if he's
afraid of us, he'll revert to the wanton killer.
Because we all stand between the jungle and the stars
at a crossroads.
I think we better discover what brings us to the end.
What brings out the best in humankind
and what brings out the worst.
Because it's the stars
or the jungle.
That'll work.
What did, I think it was Dr. Leguim
may have said,
I destroyed my
credibility when I joined
this UFO, the Texas
UFO death cult.
I think, did I leave
something out? Oh, it's Texas UFO
sex death cult.
Yeah.
Sex for us, death for others.
I think that the Pope Black
in Europe called it, what was it?
Sex, drugs, rock and roll,
alien, end of the world death cult.
Well, that covers
a lot of ground.
Didn't he leave out bacon?
Because bacon is involved
somehow. I saw a man
dressed as a giant strip of bacon
walking around. He was awesome.
He was greasy.
Wow. I wanted to go up and bite him.
He is going to get so lucky tonight.
You know he's making
pigs in a blanket somewhere.
Someone's going to get porked.
He was meat candy.
Meat candy.
One of my favorite costumes
that I saw at the convention was a guy walking around
in a towel holding a sign that said
can I borrow your costume?
The best thing was that later
there were like five guys who said,
I stole his idea.
Figures.
And then we saw girls dressed in hotel tablecloths
standing on a street corner.
Yeah, leaving the hotel.
Robbing the hotel.
They were stealing those tablecloths.
I was trying to figure out
what they were going to do with it and why they were leaving.
That was the part I couldn't understand.
Like maybe they had a sewing kit.
They were hopped up on Jenkum.
They didn't know what they were doing.
There's so much Jenkum going around.
It's really sad.
Kids.
Mouth water just thinking about it.
Yes, but please.
Yeah, but it'll smell that way for days.
Once you start the Jenkum.
Days.
The little butt hash.
Oh, man.
Once you start, don't do it.
This is the only time I'll tell you no.
Now that's a crack pipe.
Don't do it.
Don't do the Jenkum.
Once you start.
Oh, don't tell me don't do that.
Don't do it.
Is there Jenkum in that briar patch?
Oh, no.
No.
Guys and Girls High School.
Jenkek.
Aren't you?


Your bands never see you.
You.
Go.
Tell the girls this.

What are you my boss?



Look at the time.
He-he.
It's over but it's not over because
we're going to be doing another
hour after this right.
But since this is
the hour of slack. Why don't we
wrap up with contact info?
If you want to get a hold of Bob,
how do you reach his ear?
Well,
okay,
okay, I'll play that strike.
Friends, you can write
to the Church of the Subgenius at
got that pencil ready? I know you
don't have it ready, so I'll just say
subgenius.com
and that will tell you
basically everything. By the way,
every hour of slack
show is archived there
and you can see a log
of everything that's on it and little
links to all of your favorite
weirdo bands at
post office box 181-417
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
Whoa, that's easy for you to say.
Well, I get a lot of mail. There must be a
prison near here where
they listen to this show because I get
a lot of mail from
our brothers and sisters
in prison, mostly brothers,
in prison.
You can be anywhere and need slack
and when you're in prison, you really
freaking need it.
I don't have much money, most of them.
But, you know,
heck, a pamphlet only cost me
a dollar to mail.
Most of my fans have nothing.
I kind of accept that, which is
they've got more than I do.
But I've got Bob.
You do?
What a curse.
Okay, baby,
let's go.
Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on.
Hi.
Well, and that, kiddies,
is our fairy story for tonight.
