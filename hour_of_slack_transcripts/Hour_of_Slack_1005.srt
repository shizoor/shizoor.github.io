1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,320
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form,

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,960
the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be the subgenius power of the Spirit.

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,900
Ah, and here in the holodeck it's so peaceful with this new nature simulation that you've

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,220
got going here. So nice, it's so real. The birds don't say anything, they just say,

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:05,240
It's on mechanical work. You could have left the garbage truck out. Well, I guess this

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:13,020
is what we're destined to become here. A mechanical response. A mechanically driven soundtrack.

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,020
And I just wanted to get my feet out of the water. And so you did, and then we were stuck

9
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,280
here on this planet.

10
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,660
Now listen carefully.

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't want to be no human being.

12
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,040
Do you infer that I am not?

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,880
Things could be worse.

14
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,960
It sure could have been worse.

15
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,920
I understand perfectly.

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,400
Silence!

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,440
God is always on the side of the big battalions. If he was as committed to democracy as he

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,620
let on, I think he would have gone around as Bob or something. The story gets even funnier.

19
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,120
Bob. Likeable and not so likeable. He was actually in Denver, Colorado when the revolution

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,860
took place.

21
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,180
He rarely mentioned that he was Jewish. He was a genius at self-promotion. A true Mahatma.

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,880
He was also concerned with bowel movements. What intrigued him especially was the usefulness

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,000
of enemas. He had his young girls take a daily enema too. His daily greeting to them was,

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,160
Have you had a good bowel movement this morning, sisters? As this is a free country, you can

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
think what the hell you want.

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,680
The end.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,820
The end.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,640
The end.

29
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,800
The end.

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,580
The end.

31
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,360
The end.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,540
The end.

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,180
The end.

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,400
The end.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
The end.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:50,020
Imagine there is no Starbucks. I wonder what you'd do. Can't get an ATM card and no

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,220
computers too.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
What does that mean?

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,180
Imagine all sub-divis.

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,900
Living life in slack.

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,460
Imagine there's no modems.

42
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,800
And sitcoms on TV.

43
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,940
We'd hunker down in mud huts.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,840
And take some LSP.

45
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,180
You.

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,540
You.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:44,760


48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
You may say I'm sub-genius.

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,640
But I'm not the only one.

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,300
Gotta wonder if I'm really one.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,720
What I'm losing out on.

52
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,920
Imagine no McDonald's.

53
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,960
And no Big Mac with cheese.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,380
No email and no voicemail.

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,540
And no more songs like these.

56
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,160
Imagine the sub-genius.

57
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,600
Life without the con.

58
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,620
You.

59
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,540
Who-who-who.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,720
Gotta wonder if I'm really one.

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,680
What I'm losing out on.

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,760
What I'm losing out on.

63
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,920
What I'm losing out on.

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,760
Eewa eewa eewa eewa eewa yeah.

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,580
Phineas and Arko did that dear friends.

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
And you can.

67
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,480
You can get a whole lot of amazing stuff.

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,600
Not by any means all sub-genius related.

69
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,940
From National Cynical dot com.

70
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,440
This is Hour of Slack number one thousand five.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,580
A bit late because we were stricken by a new computer.

72
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,380
Donated by the wonderful Gription Clench.

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,120
And that and a week of the Starwood Festival.

74
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,500
And hours and hours of X-Day recordings.

75
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,140
Especially the live on stage radio sessions.

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,460
With Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummon.

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,260
The only part of puzzling evidence that was at 8X Day Drill was his teeth.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,740
Which were auctioned literally.

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:15,380
So this Hour of Slack while informed heavily by Mr. Leemur and Reverend Preff.

80
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,880
Which we've already been hearing a lot of.

81
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
This show is partially recorded.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,480
Auditory.

83
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,020
On location.

84
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,560
At picnic tables at an outdoor stage at Brushwood on X-Day.

85
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,400
And special thanks to Potter Nostril for the audio help.

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,620
And to Leemur devotee for the background music.

87
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,800
But first some Norrell Preff.

88
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,440
I need to go potty.

89
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,380
What is your problem?

90
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,800
I need to go potty.

91
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,160
So as a research experiment I committed myself to waterless embalming for seven months.

92
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,500
I'm more of a salt and grease person.

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,020
Over my dead body.

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,660
Fine with me.

95
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,640
What is your problem?

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,480
Nothing.

97
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,060
I just don't think I can wear clothes today.

98
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm having more symptoms.

99
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,240
Take it down a notch.

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,460
You don't want to make love to me.

101
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,240
You don't want to kiss me.

102
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,860
You don't want to be in the same room with me.

103
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,420
That's not true.

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,340
Oh yes it is.

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,220
We have no faith.

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,260
Since when do we have to have a faith?

107
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,320
It's a waste of time.

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,420
There is no God.

109
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,100
Hit me.

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
Hit me again.

111
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,860
You're a rebel.

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,500
You're a freak.

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,940
Right now with all this shit going on in the world.

114
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,140
Art seems to be the only thing that's going on.

115
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,140


116
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,600
It's kind of besides the point, you know.

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,220
What is all this shit?

118
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
I need to go potty.

119
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,440
It's all this pressure to be normal.

120
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,620
So here's what we're going to do.

121
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,200
We're going to play Frankie Yankovic and Herbie Hancock.

122
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,660
How's that?

123
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,840
You are such a fucking rock star.

124
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,460
I'm going to have to go get my...

125
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,820
.

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,220
I'm going to have to go get my material, my...

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,640
Uh oh, I hear one of those ambient sort of loud...

128
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,300
Is that when I move my chest up in front of this?

129
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,300


130
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,080
Yeah, it's a recombined...

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,140
Huh?

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,360
Some...

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,560
.

134
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,680
.

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:03,680


136
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,980
Ooh .

137
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,740
Onto where?

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,260


139
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,260


140
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,260


141
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,460
timetable 매ير

142
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,280
lymphoma.

143
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,520
.''

144
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,720
.

145
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,660
I couldn't seem to focus.

146
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:33,660


147
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
.

148
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,820
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

149
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:39,960
Yeah.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,060
Hee, hee, hee, hee.

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,380
Ha, ha, ha.

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,240
Shalakandala.

153
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,100
Demis soldier.

154
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,400
Oh, that one's not on.

155
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
I thought that was making that.

156
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,720
There.

157
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
This one makes the bad sound.

158
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,540
No, I think they all make.

159
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,960
It's, it's, uh.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,240
They all make.

161
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,640
This one you have to hunker.

162
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,520
down for. You hunker down to this mic. And when you're hunkering down, it makes you talk

163
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,900
like you're hunkering down.

164
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
You hunkerer.

165
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,140
I'm hunkering. I'm hunkering.

166
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,480
The mad hunkerer has stricken me.

167
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,460
Get your hand off my hunk.

168
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,920
It's once again been stricken.

169
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,460
I'm hunkering.

170
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,180
Hunkering.

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,580
That is the hunkerly sound of the hunkerer.

172
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,620
Man, it's windy out here today here in the Dobstown compound.

173
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
You can hear this.

174
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,900
This is the virtual Dobstown.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
The natives drumming in the background.

176
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,340
As they tap their frock pipes on the limbs and trees.

177
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:10,360
Trying to summon the energy to do something besides tap their pipes on the trees.

178
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,120
Mickey Mouse and Pluto to a movie stars in Disneyland.

179
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,420
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,660
Yes, it's a smooth X day.

181
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,280
It's a smooth X day.

182
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,280


183
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,460
Easy X day.

184
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,420
Each night we did our live radio show.

185
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,920
I wonder what he's going to do with that radio show we did.

186
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,380
Me and Hal.

187
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Dollar bills.

188
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,540
LFT and .

189
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,580
We did a live radio show where we had, you know, mixing going on.

190
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,160
And we had a multimedia display we were commenting on while there was audience.

191
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,440


193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,440


194
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,300
We had a lot of people who were asking us questions.

195
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,660
We were allowing the audience to ask questions.

196
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:19,300
And then we would go into our, you know, multi-voiced, indexed voice transitional mix technology.

197
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,900
To which you listeners have become so accustomed.

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,920
And yet in New York it was something new.

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,060
Something new.

200
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,980
And they're revealed for the first time.

201
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,660
Live.

202
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,560
Not in the studio.

203
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,140
But actual humans alive together on a stage.

204
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,980
Brain and brain.

205
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
What is brain?

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,560
A brain allows one half-formed thought to pass.

207
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,780
Well, now that's done and I'm glad it's over.

208
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,720
When lovely woman.

209
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,700
Stoops to folly and paces about her room again alone.

210
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,680
She smooths her hair with automatic hands.

211
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,940
And puts a record on the gramophone.

212
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,700
Test, test.

213
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,880
That's a lot better.

214
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,360
I say, look at the geese walking in line.

215
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,700
Down the old road.

216
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,720
This music crept by me on the water.

217
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,980
And by the frog pond.

218
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,740
Where continuously they chanted.

219
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,640
Through the night.

220
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,080
As if welcoming.

221
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,620
X day with their velvet throats.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,580
And then the secret chorus of the place chimed in.

223
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,980
The spirits of the fen and bog.

224
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,360
The naiads, dryads, pixies, gnomes, sylphs, trolls and undines.

225
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,480
All with their magic clatter added to the sound.

226
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,940
Until we had to undergo.

227
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,920
Glad day.

228
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,940
The tyranny of the sun's obnoxious effulgence.

229
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree.

230
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,180
And the weary day turned to its rest.

231
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,300
Lingering like an unloved guest.

232
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,080
Thy brother death came to me and cried.

233
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
Wouldst thou me?

234
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,260
Thy sweet child sleep.

235
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,940
The filmy eyed murmured like a noontide.

236
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,750
Be.

237
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,710
Wouldst thou nestle by my side?

238
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,510
Wouldst thou me?

239
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,410
And I replied.

240
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:35,790
No.

241
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,790
Not thee.

242
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,550
Death will come when thou art dead.

243
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,150
Soon.

244
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,910
Too soon.

245
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,830
Sleep will come when thou art fled.

246
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,450
Of neither would I ask the boon.

247
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,410
I ask of thee, beloved night.

248
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,010
Swift be thy approaching flight.

249
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,490
Come soon.

250
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,430
Soon.

251
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,830
And then.

252
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,210
Subgenius doctors from their hell or curled ship.

253
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,170
Shall broadcast their noxious message to the moon.

254
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,230
And all shall hear.

255
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,630
All who are in range to hear.

256
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,850
And learn what they should hear.

257
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,790
Nor learn too soon.

258
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,090
Hey, I've got a box full of towels under that hat there.

259
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:26,970
Ladies and gentlemen, we're still endeavoring to make every aspect of this broadcast palatable to your discerning ears.

260
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,910
Dr. Howell, those aren't ladies.

261
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,650
Those are two tripods with no cameras on them.

262
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,190
And that over there is not a gentleman.

263
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,370
That's Reverend Scull.

264
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,370
That may be as it is.

265
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,690
However, our standard must not vary despite the number of the crowd.

266
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,690
Absolutely right.

267
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,850
If no one is here to listen to us but Bob's dummy, we would yet do our very best.

268
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,490
But there are the rest of Bob's dummies.

269
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,170
I speak, of course, of the vast radio audience.

270
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,450
Who at a different and more enlightened time than this is hearing our broadcast now.

271
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,070
Thank goodness for these fine, fine donated equipments here.

272
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:15,230
They are the bodies who must willingly and joyfully cast themselves into the path of the rolling subgenius juggernaut.

273
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:23,490
So that their mashed limbs and freshly shed blood and lymph can lubricate its monstrous progress.

274
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,290
These are brave tapes, my friends.

275
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,110
Excuse me, Dr. Howell.

276
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,630
Dr. Howell, have you seen my scissors?

277
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,690
Your scissors?

278
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,130
I haven't seen the other half of your scissors.

279
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,030
Yeah.

280
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,830
No, I haven't seen your scissors.

281
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,930
I didn't know your scissors were down here.

282
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,770
But...

283
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,270
These were brave scissors and these are brave tape recordings.

284
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,570
These are brave times.

285
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,230
And stout tapes to hold these...

286
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,850
Maybe someone seized your scissors.

287
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,950
Your scissors have been snatched.

288
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,830
Don't get me wrong.

289
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,710
It wasn't scissors.

290
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,030
It was just a scissor.

291
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,950
Well, now you're being pedantic.

292
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,870
It was a scissor single.

293
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,870
Like a one-hole pair of underwear.

294
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,830
A single scissor as opposed to a pair of pads.

295
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,890
Well, can you not do with a knife or a stick or something else?

296
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,750
I need an implement.

297
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:22,590
But man, the maker of tools, the tool user and the tool maker, with these things he has conquered his environment.

298
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,590
And looked into the secrets of the atom.

299
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,470
Scratched the surface of the gleaming vault of heaven.

300
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:38,930
And penetrated impiously into the secret recesses of outer space with his mechanical devices.

301
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:47,630
Substitutes and succadenaeums as they may be for his probing fingers and moist fleshy organs.

302
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,570
Still, great advances are made into the inner space.

303
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,430
The ignorosphere of which we know nothing.

304
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,970
.

305
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,010
.

306
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,010


307
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,270
.

308
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,090
.

309
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,090


310
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,090


311
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,090


312
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,090


313
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,150
.

314
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,150


315
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,150


316
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,190
.

317
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,230
.

318
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,690
.

319
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,030
.

320
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,830
First things first

321
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,810
It's time for us to

322
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,610
Welcome the

323
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,970
Fall of night

324
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,890
And the pleasant comforting evening

325
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,490
Which shall surround us all

326
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,150
Covering our many misdeeds

327
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,730
And blanketing with softness

328
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,470
What by daytime might appear

329
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,090
Too harsh in the eyes of

330
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,070
Fretful subgeniuses

331
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,050
And so ladies and gentlemen

332
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,770
I, Dr. Howland Dowell

333
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,110
Am here accompanied

334
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,230
By Dr. Philo Drummond

335
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,930
Another resident

336
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,350
In these dark times of the left coast

337
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,290
Now brought all the way here

338
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,410
Almost out to the other sea

339
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,310
So that he and I

340
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,130
May speak to you

341
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,850
The hitherto hidden

342
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,210
Multitude of what is past

343
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,470
And passing and to come

344
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,290
This is Squatty Mike here

345
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,110
And speaking in tongues

346
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,810
Some not of this earth

347
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,150
Pastor Ivan Stang

348
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,910
The Stang of Stangs

349
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,650
Sits at microphone number one

350
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,370
Presiding over this strange

351
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,670
Hotch potch

352
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,330
Amalgam of a radio program

353
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,770
As the Supreme

354
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,590
Subgenius Presidium

355
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,430
Sliders and controls

356
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,710
Like Yertle the turtle

357
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,870
I feel master of all I survey

358
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,890
Now wasn't this turtle

359
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,190
The founder of a terrapin tower

360
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,090
Of terrifying height

361
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,670
As the old lady said

362
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,350
It's turtles all the way down

363
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,550
And so it is

364
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,230
Supporting our sad universe

365
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,250
The monstrous turtle

366
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,410
On which it rests

367
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,970
Rests on a still more

368
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,970
Monstrous Chilonian

369
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,310
All the way down to the bottom of infinity

370
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,150
From Yertle to Satan

371
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,950
That sounds like a good book title

372
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,190
It seems a shame to categorize

373
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,390
This lowest most turtle

374
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,130
As satanic

375
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,670
And yet

376
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,630
If it occupies

377
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,750
The lowest space

378
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,930
Down

379
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,370
Then perforce it must be

380
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,310
The most ill favored thing in the universe

381
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,070
It certainly won't be forgotten there

382
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,570
But it's a good thing

383
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,270
It's a good thing

384
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,030
It's a good thing

385
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,330
Go placidly

386
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,910
Amid the noise and waste

387
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,530
And remember what comfort there may be

388
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,570
In owning a piece thereof

389
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,830
Avoid quiet and passive persons

390
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,130
Unless you are in need of sleep

391
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,290
And remember what comfort there may be

392
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,710
Rotate your tires

393
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,550
Speak glowingly of those greater than yourself

394
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,730
And heed well their advice

395
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,650
Even though they be turkeys

396
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,130
Know what to kiss

397
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,610
And when

398
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,250
Consider that two wrongs never make a right

399
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,590
But that three do

400
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,650
Wherever possible

401
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,950
Put people on hold

402
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,070
Be comforted

403
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,890
That in the face of all aridity and disillusionment

404
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,290
And despite the changing fortunes of the world

405
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,630
And the changes of time

406
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,830
There is always a big future in computer maintenance

407
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,730
You are a fluke

408
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,890
Of the universe

409
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,970
You have no right to be here

410
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,950
Whether you can hear it or not

411
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,450
The universe

412
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,330
Is lapping behind your back

413
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,790
Remember the Pueblo

414
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,790
Strive at all times to bend, fold, spindle, and mutilate

415
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,690
Know yourself

416
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,270
If you need help, call the FBI

417
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,730
Exercise caution in your daily affairs

418
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,830
Especially with those persons closest to you

419
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,450
That lemon on your left, for instance

420
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,830
Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls

421
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,710
Would scarcely get your feet wet

422
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,890
Fall not in love, therefore

423
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,830
It will stick to your face

424
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,310
Gracefully surrender the things of youth

425
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,950
Birds, clean air, tuna, Taiwan

426
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,530
And let not the sands of time get in your lunch

427
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,030
Hire people with hooks

428
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,210
For a good time, call 606-4311

429
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,650
Ask for candy

430
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,670
Take heart amid the deepening gloom

431
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,090
That your dog is finally getting enough cheese

432
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,310
And reflect that whatever misfortune may be your lot

433
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,190
It could only be worse in Milwaukee

434
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:52,270
You are a fluke of the universe

435
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,670
You are a fluke of the universe

436
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,750
You have no right to be here

437
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,610
And whether you can hear it or not

438
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,610
The universe is laughing behind your back

439
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,850
Therefore make peace with your God

440
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,250
Whatever you conceive him to be

441
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,130
He is according nature

442
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,910
Come home,okes公平

443
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:26,650
To whoever cut his teeth

444
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,750
But will the things that you have

445
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,750


446
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,550
Nee showed up

447
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:41,030
To create a new mixture

448
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,030


449
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,210
But now it stops

450
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,010
And leaves nothing left

451
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,010


452
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,230
And how you un-myself

453
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,230


454
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,370
Bye.

455
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,670
Bye.

456
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,250
Bye.

457
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,250
Bye.

458
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,050
Bye.

459
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,650
Bye.

460
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,510
Bye.

461
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,910
Bye.

462
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,950
Bye.

463
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,610
Bye.

464
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,910
Bye.

465
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,510
Bye.

466
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,390
Bye.

467
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,250
Bye.

468
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:44,610
Bye.

469
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,350
Bye.

470
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,130
Bye.

471
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,050
Bye.

472
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,410
Bye.

473
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,150
Bye.

474
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:44,770
Bye.

475
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,930
Bye.

476
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,070
Bye.

477
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:51,570
Bye.

478
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,530
Bye.

479
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,670
Bye.

480
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,690
Bye.

481
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:58,950
Bye.

482
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,330
Bye.

483
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,490
Thank you.

484
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,710
Thank you.

485
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,710
Thank you.

486
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:53,990
and the Mondo Retardo band, of course, live at 8X Day, Brushwood, doing the Subgenius Anthem.

487
00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:00,930
And now let us go back to Berkeley, California, to the puzzling evidence post-X Day cookdown.

488
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,030
It is a stoner, but it fixes you, little caller.

489
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:11,370
Okay, at the top of each hour, the station legal identification is read,

490
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,910
much like we did just a minute ago.

491
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:21,130
Because we don't, this is the new show, and we want to really live up to the expectations of the audience,

492
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:28,290
as well as the FCC, and the commercial public, even though we don't appeal to them, or even care about them.

493
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,890
To ourselves. We don't even appeal to us.

494
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:37,890
We're really into the whole, you know, whole kind of left, do everything for free.

495
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,150
Are you okay, and you're in that traffic down by the police station?

496
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,430
Student-sponsored radio, or listener-sponsored radio.

497
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,030
You know, there have to be, at least.

498
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,070
Eight cars in that mess right now.

499
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,470
There's at least eight cars.

500
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,370
They're listening to the show.

501
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,910
Call us right now at 848-4425 and 510-950.

502
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,210
Extra spooky monsters now appearing.

503
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,430
And let us know the name of, what was Gort's last name?

504
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,070
A lot of people don't know that Gort had a last name.

505
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,810
So would you call right now and tell us what Gort's last name was at 848-4425,

506
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,650
and we will give you a fine, fine prize the next time we see you.

507
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:13,990
Yeah.

508
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,230
Yeah.

509
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,390
Yeah.

510
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:20,930
Judging from the amount of brainstem activity in my pickup truck right now,

511
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,450
I'd like to say that I'm in virtual Chico, California.

512
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,770
You're where now?

513
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,330
Say it again.

514
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,570
Virtual Chico, California.

515
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,470
All right.

516
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,830
He's in Chico.

517
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:38,410
I can tell from the amount of brainstem activity in the back of my pickup truck.

518
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,710
I mean, what kind of place is brainstem California?

519
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,010
Brainstem activity.

520
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,270
Well, brainstem is a small suburb of Chico, Wyoming, California.

521
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,690
I gotcha.

522
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,910
I gotcha.

523
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,990
We can hear you loud and clear on the satellite radio.

524
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,910
All right.

525
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,090
All right.

526
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,650
You're confusing us with the net web, are you?

527
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,730
You're not, yeah, not the universal media net web.

528
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,330
That was...

529
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,530
No, we're on both.

530
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,670
That's so...

531
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,950
That's somebody else's thing.

532
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,450
That's so 65 minutes ago.

533
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,690
Yeah, that's so...

534
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,330
Man, yeah.

535
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,530
Universal net.

536
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,970
Whoever.

537
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,650
We're on live Rhapsody Universal.

538
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,530
Yeah, Rhapsody.

539
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,190
Well, I...

540
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,750
They've been bought.

541
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,710
They've been bought and sold twice in the last 65 minutes on the Taiwanese market.

542
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,010
Man, show stock is...

543
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,050
That's the way it is in Taiwan.

544
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,250
The show stock is just...

545
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,570
All right.

546
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,030
Long live GOB.

547
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,670
Peace out.

548
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,150
Yeah, long live...

549
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,350
Oh, what's his name?

550
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,150
What's his name?

551
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:46,610
Bob?

552
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,610
I can really get behind a guy's name.

553
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,090
You know, there's one thing that really disappointed me about Doc's Doc.

554
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,550
I mean...

555
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,450
X Day?

556
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:51,890
X Day.

557
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,010
And that is that there's a group called the Bachelor's Four Bob.

558
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,310
Yeah, the Bachelor's Four Bob.

559
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,030
Shouldn't they be the Bachelor's O Bob?

560
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,930
I guess they should, but they're a bunch of youngsters and they don't know, but they were

561
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,270
really...

562
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,810
They don't know.

563
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,450
They were very...

564
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,570
I don't know what they're getting themselves into.

565
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,310
They were very honorable young gentlemen.

566
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:10,970
Now, did...

567
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,310
Was that 420 guy?

568
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,910
Was that the guy that was leaving?

569
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,770
Did I see him?

570
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,830
Maybe, because he often leaves now before the 420 moment.

571
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,790
Oh, well, all right, 420 guy.

572
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:25,170
Which means he's going to miss the beautiful young woman who will magically show up at

573
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,690
420.

574
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,050
Well, so should we go, like, do that thing now?

575
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,150
Do that thing?

576
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:31,590
Yeah.

577
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,050
At least I should.

578
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,970
I'm worried about Gort.

579
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,770
I'm afraid he might doodoo.

580
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,610
Gort?

581
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,470
But he's a robot.

582
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,670
What could he doodoo?

583
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,230
He could doodoo the Earth.

584
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,570
You must go to Gort.

585
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,050
You must say these words.

586
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,470
The self-genius power of sweat.

587
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:01,050
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to take the first photographs of the very strange gentleman.

588
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,750
We want work!

589
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,950
You'll be put to work baking loaves of bread for the rehabilitation of America.

590
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,610
Now, you guys, maybe you'd like to tell the crowd what we've got coming up tonight, whether

591
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,850
it's a possum roast or a hayride or any number of things planned by the...

592
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,230
Who's going to have us a rabbit supper?

593
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,850
By the reception committee.

594
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,390
We've got a barrel of rabbit sphincters back there.

595
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,550
I think there's the...

596
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,670
A tub of grease.

597
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,910
We're going to heat up the grease.

598
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:33,130
Yes, we're going to cover ourselves with bare grease and dance around the totem pole at

599
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,450
some time during the evening.

600
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,870
Try up the rabbit sphincters.

601
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,070
Why, you better tell them about that.

602
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,890
They skewer on fish hooks real well.

603
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,530
Wear them.

604
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,390
New jewelry.

605
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:47,370
We were going to have human fights where some of us would get so drunk we'd reveal that

606
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,590
we were really humans and not so geniuses.

607
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,610
Getting real big fights.

608
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,230
Well, don't let me hold you back.

609
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,170
No, no, not me.

610
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,010
I'm just...

611
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,890
I'm thinking...

612
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,830
You know, it could be anybody here.

613
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,610
Hope it's not me.

614
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,650
I suppose it could be me.

615
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,870
And there's a movie show.

616
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,450
Let's announce that.

617
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,470
The little nudie...

618
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,110
The nudie show?

619
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,610
A movie show.

620
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,310
A movie show.

621
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,350
It will be a special...

622
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,290
The nude movie show.

623
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,290
Triple threat...

624
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,570
Double header triple feature about two-headed folks.

625
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,370
First, the amazing two-headed transplant.

626
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,950
Followed by the thing with two heads.

627
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,350
And finally, the Japanese classic from Toho Studios, The Manster.

628
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,710
Also about a character with more than the allotted number of heads.

629
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:37,030
And so, you see three double headers in a triple threat triple bill right over there

630
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,170
at the Starlight Drive-In Theater tonight.

631
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,590
It's one of the many theaters.

632
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,270
It's one of the many things that's being offered here for your delectation and enjoyment.

633
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,550
So, you're saying the zombie fans should stay at home tonight, right?

634
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,370
The ones that...

635
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,490
Did anybody bring zombie pictures?

636
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,710
Looking for the shambling, hideous corpses?

637
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:03,770
Well, I think we see enough of those in our day-to-day interchange in the workaday world.

638
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,050
Yes, that's true.

639
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,650
That is true.

640
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,850
I forgot about that.

641
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,850
It's the pain of life's existence.

642
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,930
It's so hideous.

643
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,310
Living.

644
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:11,930
Each day.

645
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,990
How about shorts?

646
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,450
Has anyone got short subjects to show?

647
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,210
A glamorous short?

648
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,190
We do have plenty of shorts.

649
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,350
Well, there you go.

650
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,590
Yeah, there are Dobbshead shorts over at the Sales Shack, friends, which will be open tomorrow.

651
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,190
That's the most important type of shorts.

652
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,930
You can purchase these items and then take them here from this enlightened spot

653
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,030
and in more benighted areas hold your own subgenius.

654
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,170
I think I'm going to take a look at the thingamajig, whatchamacallit, doohickey.

655
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,670
No public authority has told us who are the overlords of the UFO.

656
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,410
Political analyst Bob was the first to reveal the CIA...

657
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,090
And Bob, and Bob, and Bob, and Bob joins me now on the show.

658
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,630
Bob, first, what's your reaction to the Supreme Court?

659
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,270
My lawyer said I cannot answer any specific questions about this.

660
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,710
I can't answer any questions about this.

661
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,970
Why is it that there are two reporters out there who may go to jail, Bob?

662
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,670
I will reveal all.

663
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,550
You don't know anything.

664
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,230
You don't know anything.

665
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:12,930
You don't know anything.

666
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,610
You don't know anything.

667
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,930
But I will, and there might be some surprising things.

668
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,470
Well, I'll be waiting to hear that story finally told, Bob.

669
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,250
Okay, so what we know is that there's a lot we do not know.

670
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,570
Hey, hi, how are you?

671
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,510
Hey, hi, how are you?

672
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,970
And we watched videotaped sex with him in his living room.

673
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,070
Slacks, slacks, go!

674
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,970
Blab, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab...

675
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,690
Blabber, and before that, some Norelpref.

676
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,170
And we keep hearing bits and pieces of the Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA and Berkeley.

677
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,070
In fact, Philo.

678
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,110
Where can we get copies of that great show?

679
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,490
The show is going to be soon available.

680
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,570
It's actually available on podcast from KPFA.

681
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:27,950
Now, the KPFA has in their archive section, you can sign up for a podcast,

682
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,290
and the Puzzling Evidence Show is one of them you can sign up for.

683
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,450
We'd like to encourage you don't have to sign up.

684
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,410
You just click on the link, and you get the podcast.

685
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:43,590
So if you're on an always-on connection, you can go to the KPFA archive website,

686
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:49,030
choose Puzzling Evidence Podcast, and there you will be each week.

687
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:56,470
Voila, after the show, magically downloaded to your PC or Macintosh,

688
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:05,230
whatever device you choose, there will be your own personal Puzzling Evidence Show from this week.

689
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,390
Neatly packed.

690
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:06,950
Packaged.

691
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,950
Neatly packaged and ready for you to take full advantage of.

692
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:19,610
You can cut it up into your own special version where you take last week's show and this week's show

693
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,130
and mix them up and then play them on the radio to us next week.

694
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,550
In your podcast.

695
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,830
We think you should all, everyone should do their own edit of the show.

696
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:30,290
Yeah, I do.

697
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,230
Remixed edit.

698
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,870
I've noted that for many years, and we would all be listening to the show,

699
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,390
being reenacted.

700
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,210
Reenacted and re-hashed.

701
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,850
You could play the show on your mixer and then bring you into the mix,

702
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,870
just as if you were actually sitting here live with us in the studio,

703
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,870
and we weren't paying any attention to you like we do most of our callers.

704
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,910
Indeed.

705
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:51,730
Indeed.

706
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,550
So we would like for you to do that sometime.

707
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,010
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

708
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,950
Need assistance in finding your destination.

709
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,910
I'm hearing something.

710
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,970
They were very ly.

711
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,690
ALOY HAUST IRI Ching name.

712
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,550
Are you' re trying to falter for others

713
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,550


714
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,550


715
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,550


716
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,490
Let's go somewhere far away and we need our breathing.

717
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,150
Hey.

718
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,770
Someone had read something piece which for me,

719
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,110
not about shooting or death.

720
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:31,650
Oh,

721
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,150
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.

722
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:45,730
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.

723
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,630
We are off crisis alert.

724
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,950
The situation is normal again.

725
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,170
On the show, sometimes we have to skip out and wander down the street and go,

726
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,930
La la la la la la la.

727
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,030
Because that's what you do in a band.

728
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,490
Down by the river.

729
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,530
I'm just going to practice for a little while here, okay?

730
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,490
What kind of button pushing is that?

731
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,390
I don't know, but that's some strange music you're playing there.

732
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:37,130
Paz.

733
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:40,150
Some people call him Paz Ave for short.

734
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,790
Yeah.

735
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,430
You mean out there in the hinterlands of X-Day.

736
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,790
Where they believe I'm a real person.

737
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,650
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

738
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,390
From PR News in Washington, I'm called genocide by the Bush administration.

739
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,130
President Bush has chosen to stay inside when possible.

740
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,390
Condoleezza Rice is praising leaders for ending decades of purgatory.

741
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,430
And the president of the United States, Donald Trump, is going to be the president of the United States.

742
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,230
Today's children.

743
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,550
Question after question.

744
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,650
She passes on.

745
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,330
Why?

746
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:14,870
And he died.

747
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,650
Why did he die, Daddy?

748
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:17,470
They die.

749
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,850
Why does mother hug this stranger?

750
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:20,690
Who is this?

751
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,650
Why?

752
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,070
Forcing Judy to kiss the stranger.

753
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,750
Uncle Harry understands children.

754
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,750
Did you and I were the baby?

755
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,330
What's this man doing?

756
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:30,330
Why?

757
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:30,970
Oh.

758
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:31,970
Why?

759
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,030
Now that makes sense.

760
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,190
Why, Molly?

761
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,390
Why, why, why?

762
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:36,930
Why, why, why?

763
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,030
What are you doing?

764
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,250
What are you doing?

765
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,350
Why didn't you ask?

766
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,130
They died.

767
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,910
Minnesotans love the loon.

768
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,550
The hunting call of our loon is a comforting sound of home.

769
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,510
Minnesota has more loons than any other state.

770
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,330
Your donations to the loon fund on your state tax forms helps the loons.

771
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,090
The headlines.

772
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,570
The headlines.

773
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:05,910
The headlines.

774
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:06,650
The headlines.

775
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:07,750
The headlines.

776
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,750
The headlines.

777
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:09,810
The headlines.

778
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:10,810
The headlines.

779
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:11,750
The headlines.

780
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,210
Not.

781
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:14,910
Not.

782
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,350
You need a man on a mission.

783
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,030
Stops.

784
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,350
Stops.

785
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,630
Stops.

786
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:19,850
Stops.

787
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,110
It was a good thing, and it was similar.

788
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,590
Political war strategy.

789
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,290
1-800-66666666.

790
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,170
The culture has gone stark raving mad.

791
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,870
Pornography and in gas stations.

792
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,910
Burn me up.

793
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:35,550

I can't even eat a whole apple.

818
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,390
Wash it down with an AL-8.

819
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,110
Yeah, you know, I had so many AL-8s.

820
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,410
I think I've had enough.

821
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,890

00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:26,710
Yeah.

826
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,430
We had AL-8.

827
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,010
We were using it to swim in.

828
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,530
We weren't even drinking it anymore.

829
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,230
We were just swimming around in it.

830
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,770
We were cooking chicken in it.

831
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:37,330
We cooked chicken in it.

832
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,170
We really did cook chicken in it.

833
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,610
We just watered, we were watering the grass with it after a while because we had so much.

834
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,890
We had to take a bath in noodles.

835
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,370
It's just ridiculous.

836
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,730
Just totally ridiculous.

837
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:52,530
That's an ignorant.

838
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:52,670
It is.

839
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,150
The show is ridiculous.

840
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:54,510
It's an ignorant.

841
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,410
But the devil would have a representation.

842
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,810
You see some class.

843
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,610
Classes of the human family that are uncouth or rude and filthy.

844
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,150
Disagreeable and low in their habits.

845
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,390
Wild.

846
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,490
Priesthood.

847
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:16,050
So I give this lesson on the priesthood that you can understand its full effect.

848
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:23,130
And that we must beware and leave off their dress, their music, their styles, their fashions,

849
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,130
the way they think, what they do with immoral, filthy people.

850
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,350
The priesthood with immoral, filthy people.

851
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,370
You know we can't do that.

852
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:40,370


853
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,530
The priesthood needs an underpinningмуah.

854
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:42,650
I'd be a peace maker and fascist, so they'd give up drinking to summarise it.

855
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,370
Disc turtles arrested in Jersey west.

856
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:43,370


857
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:43,490


858
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:43,630
No matter what.

859
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:43,950
They put power on weather television and spy the world.

860
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:51,230
นนn Emday Nones الجr ass, I watch sollar.

861
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:51,470
Sobringen the land of peaceful

862
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,030
The slice ofusted streets, it's offence.

863
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:54,750
It's my land is home.

864
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:00,890
Un際be lukewarm

865
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:02,030
PR's fat.

866
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:02,830
PR's fat.

867
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:07,850
The so-called NASA says no spindly robots popped out during the fiery re-entry in Orlando.

868
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,250
NASA was in Baghdad urging Iraq's astronauts to stick to PR news.

869
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,130
Washington.

870
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,910
Want it, want it, want it, want it.

871
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:25,910
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

872
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,730
To overthrow George W. Bush.

873
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,510
George W. Bush there, there.

874
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,590
You are a terrorist.

875
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,930
Old and sick man.

876
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:36,870
Funding a terrorist-supporting group is worthwhile to achieve our political gain.

877
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,850
Pornography, adultery, homosexuality.

878
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,490
Seduce your neighbor's wife.

879
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:42,450
Duh, duh.

880
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,130
Homosexual marriage, in fact.

881
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:46,050
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

882
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,430
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

883
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:47,910
Homosexual.

884
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:48,530
True bomb.

885
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,290
I'm a true bomb.

886
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,990
I'm a true bomb.

887
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:50,670
I'm a true bomb.

888
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,330
I'm a true bomb.

889
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:52,830
I'm a big fan of Dobbs.

890
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,150
Program, program, program, program.

891
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,010
Date, date, date, date.

892
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,890
Peep, if the...

893
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,310
Peep, peep, peep, peep.

894
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,490
Homosexual marriage.

895
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,970
People have the right to sin.

896
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:00,850
So you think...

897
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:01,370
So you think...

898
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,530
Evil, terrible, monstrous regime.

899
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,690
But, Bob, here's my question for you.

900
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:06,490
Now, Bob.

901
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,010
Now, Bob.

902
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,830
Well, George W. Bush is willing to kill some children.

903
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:10,630
Crazy, crazy.

904
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,630
Bob, that's crazy.

905
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:12,470
Bob, that's crazy.

906
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,350
A rapist.

907
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,610
The radical...

908
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,790
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

909
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,710
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

910
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:19,330
Cheerleader.

911
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:20,050
Cheerleader.

912
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:20,990
Consider abortion.

913
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,390
There's a multi-billion dollar industry in pornography.

914
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,870
It's digitized.

915
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,770
Being sodomized by a homosexual.

916
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:29,950
You can...

917
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,770
You can come from a position of strength.

918
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,230
Just show reports here.

919
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,510
You know, I gotta fill out the paperwork.

920
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,350
Shows that the show was showing at the proper show time.

921
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,450
It's wet and cold out here.

922
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,630
Do I have to stay down here forever?

923
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,010
Well, until next X-Day.

924
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:51,030
If you're on the outside of the ship, you know, we really can't let you back in.

925
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,450
But I want to get back in my room.

926
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,350
I know, I know.

927
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,830
Yeah, you gotta wait 24 hours for decontamination.

928
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,230
Well, that's kind of a myth.

929
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,930
As it turns out, there is no decontamination.

930
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:00,570
There's no decontamination.

931
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,630
You just can't come back aboard.

932
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:03,730
I'm sorry, Philo.

933
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:16,970
I'm sorry, he's gone.

934
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,650
That's how we lost Philo.

935
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,950
I just wanted to show you that film before we got to the end of the show here.

936
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,770
Where Philo was on the outside of the ship.

937
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,250
And the next thing you know...

938
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,850
And the next thing you know...

939
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,050
And the next thing you know...

940
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,070
It was very sad.

941
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,490
To go to the next X-Day and...

942
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,150
There was no...

943
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:56,170
There was no Philo, no Ivan Stang, no Princess Wee, there was no Nikki Death Chick...

944
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,670
And scores and scores of other...

945
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,010
Beautiful people as we call them.

946
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:05,750
All gone.

947
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:10,130
Just because the end of the world had to happen.

948
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,310
I'm gonna go through the closet here and see if I can find...

949
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,130
I'm sure I had one of those pamphlets for the end of the world.

950
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,570
Let's see if it's here.

951
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,950
I think I got a new Philo too.

952
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,270
There's a stand.

953
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,990
I don't know if I can find it.

954
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,250
It's here somewhere.

955
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,150
Is it over here?

956
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,250
We will meet the Aetherians.

957
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,950
The overlords of the UFO.

958
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,570
When we are worthy.

959
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:40,910
Pop.

960
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,630
Puppy.

961
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:42,810
Boob.

962
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,250
Booby.

963
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:44,010
Bob.

964
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:44,690
Bobby.

965
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:45,310
Cock.

966
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:45,970
Pussy.

967
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,570
Shut up.

968
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,750
In a surprise ending, you'll see the answers...

969
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,050
To this incredible worldwide UFO.

970
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,350
The origin of the alien intelligences...

971
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:06,350
Who are the overlords of the UFO.

972
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:08,410
Bob.

973
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:08,930
