1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
For John Dillinger, and I hope he is still alive.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,800
Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, 1986.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,540
Thanks for the wild turkey and the passenger pigeons

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,580
destined to be sh**ed out through wholesome American guts.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,280
Thanks for a continent to despoil and poison.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,040
Thanks for Indians to provide a modicum of challenge and danger.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,780
Thanks for vast herds of bison to kill and skin,

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,660
leaving the carcasses to rot.

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,340
Thanks for bounties on wolves and coyotes.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,260
Thanks for the American dream to be a national hero.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,940
Thanks for the American dream to vulgarize and falsify

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,200
until the bare lies shine through.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,280
Thanks for the KKK, for nigger-killin' lawmen

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,180
peavin' their notches.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,360
For decent church-goin' women with their mean, pinched bitter eagle faces.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,260
Thanks for Killikins.

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,860
For queer-for-Christ dickers.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,620
Thanks for laboratory AIDS.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,260
Thanks for prohibition and the war against drugs.

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,120
Thanks for a country where nobody's allowed to mind his own business.

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,700
Thanks for a nation of finks.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,500
Yes,

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,140
thanks for all the memories.

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,540
All right, let's see your arms.

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,760
You always were a headache and you always were a whore.

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,600
Thanks for the last and greatest betrayal of the last and greatest of human dreams.

27
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,460
Thanks for the last and greatest betrayal of the last and greatest of human dreams.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:45,120
I already told you and kept onのying me around you.

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,200
That's why I'm not at the mercy of anybody else.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Sorry for getting on your nerves.

31
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,480
It's time you were lost,

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,480


33
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,480


34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
You gotta be crazy, come on.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,760
You gotta be crazy, come on.

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,680
We walk into this leather bar, high noon, the place still reeks of stale sex.

37
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,460
Stale sex.

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,620
We're not talking about beautiful people.

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,740
I don't care what consenting adults do in their bedrooms or elsewhere.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,860
That's their business.

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,640
That's their business.

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,280
War.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,680
Huh.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,860
What is it good for?

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,720
Absolutely nothing.

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,140
War.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,480
Huh.

48
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,640
What is it good for?

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,500
Absolutely nothing.

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:13,940
War.

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,360
Huh.

52
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,520
What is it good for?

53
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,380
Absolutely nothing.

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,360
No, then we didn't have any restaurants, because shortly after that, Bob had a massive heart attack.

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,780
I answered the age-old question, what is art?

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,260
You're my only hope.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,420
Come on, Bob, tell us something.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
Come on, Bob, tell us something.

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,980
Come on, Bob, tell us something.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,280
You're my only hope.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,500
Come on, Bob, tell us something.

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,060
One little tasty tip here.

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,200
Bob, you gotta understand, this is a very lonely town.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,440
Everybody's insane.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,980
Everybody's insane.

66
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,600
They contain explicit lyrics descriptive of advocating or encouraging one or more of the following.

67
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,060
Sodomy.

68
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,060
Incest.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,560
Bestiality.

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,280
Sadomasochism.

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,380
Adultery.

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,520
Any form of sexual conduct in a vile context.

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,860
Nudity.

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Satanism.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,760
Murder.

76
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,420
Morbid violence.

77
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,500
Illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Warning, warning, warning.

79
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,300
So here it comes.

80
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,060
Can God deliver a dog?

81
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,020
Oh, yes, he can.

82
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,780
The reality is it's something that you'll never get over.

83
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,660
...material which depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,940
community standards, broadcast mediums, sexual or extirpatory activities or organs, and

85
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,560
which is broadcast at a time of day when there's a reasonable risk that children may be in the

86
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,800
audience.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,940
Will you tell on this earth we do everything we can to escape suffering?

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
We take aspirin.

89
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,240
We go to the hospital.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,920
We might have an operation.

91
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,540
But in hell, you will not be able to escape suffering.

92
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,840
Your suffering will be so bad that it'll turn to weeping.

93
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,460
And then the weeping.

94
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,320
Shall turn to wailing.

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,920
And then the wailing shall turn to gnashing of teeth.

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,180
I say hell is a place of remembering.

97
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,860
In hell, you'll remember things.

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,300
People say, oh, there'll be plenty of company in hell.

99
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,300
But they'll all be taken up with their own suffering and their own shame.

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,260
That they'll not care a thing about you.

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,840
And you'll feel that you're all alone.

102
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,660
Hell is a place of loneliness.

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,500
I say hell is a place without hope.

104
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:33,120
When a man is sent to jail for life, there is always the hope he'll be let out for good behavior

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,060
or he'll be pardoned.

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,400
But it is not that way in hell.

107
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,440
Just as sure as you're listening to me, just as sure as you're listening to an eight-year-old voice,

108
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,440
it's just as sure that you're going to be done with that.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,520
Go to hell if you're not saved.

110
00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:00,960
I stand firm in my belief that the Bible is the word of hell.

111
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,320
I worked for 75 cents an hour with a pick and shovel,

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,560
and I preached on Sundays and pastored a church.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,720
And I said, because I was faithful, God's now giving me a Cadillac.

114
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,140
Hallelujah.

115
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,460
I said, now I'm driving a Cadillac.

116
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,240
Why don't you do it?

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,960
And you know what I got to thinking about that all day long?

118
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,300
I've been trying to trade for a Chevrolet, and I couldn't get a Chevy.

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,540
I tried to trade for a Buick, and I couldn't get a Buick.

120
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,480
And I said, bless God, the more I think about that,

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,260
the more I think I was preaching the truth.

122
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,720
I went down to the Cadillac agency, and one hour later, I drove out a new Cadillac.

123
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,480
Hallelujah.

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,720
Say, praise the Lord.

125
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,460
Thank you, Jesus.

126
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,700
Bless God, I'm going to drive that Cadillac down here and get it dusty and dirty

127
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,120
and use it for...

128
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,880
The soul.

129
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,740
Genius.

130
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,540
Power.

131
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,240
All.

132
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,260
Swag.

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,620
I don't think that'd be on if I were program director.

134
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,060
That's a shame.

135
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,620
Offensive speech does have a value.

136
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,180
That's the whole premise of the First Amendment.

137
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,040
The issue isn't whether someone's going to get a pop in the nose

138
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
if he said it in front of somebody else.

139
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,180
The issue is whether it's going to offend people, whether there's a value to it.

140
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,740
The Supreme Court again and again has said that there's a value to offensive speech

141
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,380
because it stirs up debate.

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
This is almost as crazy as it gets.

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:32,960


144
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,620
There's a person that's talking about really difficult matters,

145
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,620


146
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,160
The remaining white man seems very hole in my face.

147
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,160


148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,340
said one minute is an hour away from hell.

149
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,360
I am Daniel Van Dyke.

150
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,460
、

151
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,960
The biggest growing killer that's ever been the system to manufacture all.

152
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,220
IRL?

153
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,220


154
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,580
Interesting.

155
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,160
STH.

156
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,120
For how a gun can take on human personality

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,820
and take over singularly or collectively the mind of a race,

158
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,240
see issue 55, Origin of a Gun.

159
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm a simple man.

160
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm not really sure how all this came to be.

161
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,600
Made my way all through my life.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,900
It's just this old gun and me.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,340
He's by my side. He's always there.

164
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Everywhere I go.

165
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,280
Thought my life would be so lonely

166
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,500
until my gun said no.

167
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,260
Because it can blow a man's brain out,

168
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,820
a gun is an example of a purer intellect.

169
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,440
A college professor said he was smarter than me

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
and attempted to prove it so.

171
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,960
E equals MC squared, he postulated.

172
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,500
My gun replied a different equation.

173
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,380
A loaded gun equals no.

174
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,800
The professor screamed his final lecture.

175
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,200
He argued.

176
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,200


177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,200


178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,200


179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,200


180
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,400
Hard was all he said.

181
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,220
A yecky equation dropped from the blackboard,

182
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,700
which could at last be read.

183
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,260
My gun said no.

184
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,260
An unemployed young man approached me on the street

185
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,180
and asked for me to loan him some dough.

186
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,980
My gun delivered a copy of my financial statement.

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,060
Two letters reading no.

188
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
My gun said no.

189
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,400
She was a virgin beauty with hair of red.

190
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,220
I could have loved her so.

191
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,220
I trembled with excitement as she climbed into my bed.

192
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,540
Until I looked to the closet.

193
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,640
My gun said no.

194
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,540
Heh.

195
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,940
My gun said we can't do this.

196
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
My gun said no.

197
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,540
What are you talking about?

198
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,180
Are you crazy?

199
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,160
Yes, I am.

200
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,520
I'm unclean.

201
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,760
We have to do it this way.

202
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,580
We have to let my gun do it.

203
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,080
I don't want that cold metal thing inside me.

204
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,300
Shut up.

205
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,200
We have to do it this way.

206
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,520
We have to do it his way or he'll kill us.

207
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,440
He'll kill us.

208
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,440
He'll kill us both.

209
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, he's really getting hot now.

210
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,180
Yeah.

211
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Heh heh.

212
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,280
Gun likes it.

213
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,180
My gun likes this.

214
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,820
Heh heh heh.

215
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
My gun said no to her life.

216
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,320
My gun's senses were heightened.

217
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,180
I couldn't do it.

218
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,180


219
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,180


220
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,180


221
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,180


222
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,180


223
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,120
If he doesn't like someone, it hurts my head.

224
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,500
My gun would speak to me when he met someone he didn't like.

225
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,020
No was what he said.

226
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,880
My gun said no.

227
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,420
And no.

228
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,360
And no.

229
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,240
And no.

230
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,280
And no.

231
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,260
And no.

232
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,800
And no.

233
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,180
And no.

234
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,580
And no.

235
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:48,720
And no.

236
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,280
And no.

237
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,980
Is no, would move my hand.

238
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,620
My gun said no.

239
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,960
Heh heh heh.

240
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,640
Come on, gun.

241
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,920
Don't you think we can talk this out?

242
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,160
I...

243
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,140
I want to live.

244
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,540
I...

245
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,460
I have a life.

246
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:08,760
I...

247
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,840
I don't want to take a lead stress pill.

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,120
Heh heh.

249
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,880
Gun?

250
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,200
Gun?

251
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,560
Heh heh.

252
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,160
I don't want a six pack.

253
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


254
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,720
You're getting depressed, Gun. Can't we go anywhere without there just being a pile of bodies?

255
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,740
No.

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,100
I want to live, I said. It's not my time to go.

257
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,380
A piece of lead then entered my head.

258
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,940
My gun said no.

259
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,180
My gun was sold to a collector and put into a case of gold.

260
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,960
For all the world to awe and wonder while weeds grow upon my grave so cold.

261
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,020
My gun said no.

262
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,380
Next-ish, when bullets laugh, Uff said.

263
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,480
And that was Janer Hypercletes along with the Southland Corporation.

264
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,860
And we'll be hearing yet another fun track from them later regarding...

265
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
Well, I won't tell you what it's about. We'll just keep that a surprise for now.

266
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,820
But you want to hear that, so stay tuned for them and what must follow.

267
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,000
Psychedelically speaking, I am talking.

268
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,440
About.

269
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,900
The power.

270
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,880
What the hell is that?

271
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Let me tell you what's coming over the whole planet.

272
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,500
When you turn on your television sets.

273
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,860
When you turn on your television sets.

274
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,400
Your television sets.

275
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,700
You turn on your television sets.

276
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,120
Or you see the things that are happening around this world.

277
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,500
That's not what is really happening.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,980
That's not what is really happening.

279
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,140
That's not what is really happening.

280
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,480
That's not what is really happening.

281
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,060
I don't think I'm saying it right.

282
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,760
When you turn on your television sets.

283
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,900
That's just a surface attraction.

284
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,940
Surface attraction.

285
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,400
Surface attraction.

286
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,360
Attraction.

287
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,220
Attraction.

288
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,480
God will give the final orders.

289
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,140
God will give the final orders.

290
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,460
God will give the final orders.

291
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,160
The orders.

292
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,260
The orders.

293
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,260
Not Bush, not Gorbachev.

294
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
Not anyone else.

295
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,180
Not Gorbachev.

296
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,240
The final orders.

297
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,120
Not Bush, not Bush, not Gorbachev.

298
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,840
Not anyone else.

299
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,120
At this very moment in nation after nation of the world.

300
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,040
The spirit of God is searching

301
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,040
Searching.

302
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,100
Searching.

303
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,860
Searching.

304
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,960
Searching.

305
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,500
The spirit of God is searching.

306
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,120
And I want you to hear me and to hear me and to hear me

307
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,000
and it's not the rhetoric of a glib-tongued evangelist.

308
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,480
He said they'll come from the north and the south and the east and the west.

309
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,980
He said they'll come from every tribe.

310
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,180
They'll come from every tongue and they will come from every nation.

311
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,060
They'll come from empty heaven, empty heaven, empty heaven.

312
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,880
I see the harvest.

313
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,240
Why do you think hell is raging like an inferno from the pit of darkness?

314
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,740
Why? Why?

315
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,820
Losing audience, going down, losing audience, going down, going down,

316
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,440
losing audience, going down, losing audience, going down,

317
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,040
losing audience, going down.

318
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,540
Losing audience, going down, losing audience, going down, going down.

319
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,920
See, that's the choice you get, friends.

320
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,500
Going down or losing audience.

321
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,920
And Swigert chose both.

322
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,020
That's what happens, see.

323
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,020
The reality is it's something that you'll never get over.

324
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,020
Your eyes are one and the same.

325
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,880
One in knowing.

326
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,580
One in loving.

327
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,920
One in hating.

328
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,280
One in selling.

329
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,080
And Slack is the free car wash that comes with the fill up of Bob.

330
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
He's the ultimate good guy.

331
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,900
The terrorist for peace.

332
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,200
Out to kick ass on the know nothing to have held you down.

333
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,500
Bob is the peace that Slack has made alive.

334
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,600
Bob is Slack.

335
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,960
External.

336
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,440
Bob is the still sifter of a turning world.

337
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
He is the angel of the bottomless pit.

338
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,060
The blood of the land.

339
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
The pet feet of Kloboka.

340
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,520
The pet feet of Kloboka.

341
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,640
The key to the gateway is his life.

342
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,560
Bob is the fool of the universe.

343
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
And thus the only place of awe.

344
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,680
Bob is the meaning of the word without meaning.

345
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,380
And therefore Bob is the one true word.

346
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,620
Bob is war.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,220
But he is victory without a battle.

348
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,000
No battle.

349
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,360
He is the laxative of the world.

350
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,540
And he is the bottom.

351
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,300
He is the great work that he created.

352
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,580
He is the silence.

353
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,440
He is the infinite wheel of earning.

354
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,220
Bob is the teaching for those who need not be taught.

355
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,120
And those who must be taught.

356
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,080
Bob.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,780
He is his own ultimate secret.

358
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Bob is the meaning of rising and falling.

359
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,760
Bob is the black goat of the woods for a thousand yards.

360
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,240
Bob is heaven's one true police chief.

361
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,000
Bob is the gun and you are the bullet.

362
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,260
Bob is the sucker who is reborn every minute.

363
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,000
Yet he is the money which that sucker spends.

364
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,040
He is the man whose name is Money.

365
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,880
Bob is companion when there is no one there.

366
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,380
Bob is the Oprah.

367
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,660
Who will never let you down.

368
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,320
Never let you down.

369
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,740
Never let you down.

370
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,540
Bob is the man you always knew.

371
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,180
Bob is.

372
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,940
Always been.

373
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,020
Bob is the man you always knew.

374
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,700
Every mom knows who he's birthed to.

375
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,340
Bob is the uncle who told you what you are.

376
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:54,120
Bob is your big brother.

377
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,900
Bob is your big brother.

378
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,360
Praise big brother, Bob.

379
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,680
Praise big brother, Bob.

380
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,440
Praise big brother, Bob.

381
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,220
Bob is a rock.

382
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,540
Bob is a rock.

383
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,660
Bob is a trick.

384
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,240
Bob is you.

385
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,960
Bob is you.

386
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,840
And Bob is...

387
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,440
And Bob is...

388
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,580
Bill in the blank.

389
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:14,960
Bill in the blank.

390
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,820
Bill in that blank.

391
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,320
Bill in that blank.

392
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,140
Bill!

393
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,680
Bill!

394
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,480
Bill!

395
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:19,940
Bill!

396
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,440
Bill!

397
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,960
Bill!

398
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,760
Bill!

399
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,280
Bill!

400
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,780
Bill!

401
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,840
By pulling the wool of your own eyes,

402
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,960
you become aware that there is

403
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,020
a moment of silence in your head,

404
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,780
is

405
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:52,320
he said the only security you ever have in your life is in your ability to perform

406
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:11,160
problems with space and time which you'll have the time is not the time is not appropriate

407
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:18,280
how appropriate these innocuous words seem the time is now and manipulate my gonads baby

408
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,300
a woman was fatally shot at her front door by someone dressed as a clown and detective said

409
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,560
today that they had several leads in the search for her killer doctor doctor for both of us

410
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:59,580
okay and you've been listening to much media barrage from blaze brown food fights of the gods

411
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,820
you'll hear a lot of segues tonight because we only have one tape deck

412
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,480
so i can't just smoothly go from one to the next zero so often when i want to change tapes

413
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:16,260
we put on the music which uh this is the soundtrack of akira that you're listening to right now

414
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,380
so as uh promised earlier for the new listeners

415
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,020
how's about this

416
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:47,200
what is slack now alongside your normal everyday life there's another life one in which you have

417
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,560
slack man was born with original slack yet most so-called civilized peoples don't believe in it

418
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,720
and their most learned scholars cannot even comprehend it and that my friend is why the idiot

419
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,320
is closer to the divine

420
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:01,960
uh...

421
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,660
uh...

422
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:02,920
uh...

423
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,260
uh...

424
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,740
uh...

425
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,940
for nothing. That unreachable goal, that perfect hamburger towards which all seekers strive,

426
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,800
and to seek it, one must travel the path of least resistance and learn to try, never to try. Now,

427
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,020
friend, slack can neither be created nor destroyed. If you don't have slack, it's somewhere it

428
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,900
shouldn't be. Who's got it, friend? If you don't know, then, my friend, your only sane move would

429
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:34,260
be to repent, quit your job, and slack off before you're too far gone. Praise Bob. Help me,

430
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:41,800
somebody. Let there be slack. Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth. And to you, young

431
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:51,420
man. Bob is fill in the blank. I am Bob. I'm not Bob. You are Bob. We are all Bob. Born to humble

432
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,580
parents somewhere in the Midwest, the child Bob experienced a traumatic close encounter

433
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,880
with a child. He was a child of a child. He was a child of a child. He was a child of a child.

434
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,040
He was a child of a child. He was a child of a child. He was a child of a child. He was a child

435
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:05,640
with a UFO at the age of three. Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion.

436
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:13,700
By age six, he had made his first million, almost by accident. In college, he met and married his

437
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:21,880
first and still his primary wife, Connie, who is now revered by female subgenie as the blessed

438
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,780
anti-virgin. With Connie's encouragement, the young Dobbs became a salesman,

439
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,220
a salesman of legendary, almost frightening abilities, known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

440
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,900
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder and might have stayed there.

441
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,900
But late one night in 1953, while working on an amateur television of his own design,

442
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:55,100
an event occurred which was to become a milestone on man's mind path to slack. He was suddenly seized

443
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,880
up in the spirit. By the hand of the man, he was able to get to the top of the conspiracy ladder.

444
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,020
He wanted to be according to his permission and the soil

445
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,180
for his original works. He was clearly enslaved to his neighbourhoods, a strange city on which

446
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:17,820
D именно the world headed, but he fell in love with himself at the hypocrisy of man,

447
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:27,000
jury of thoughts. Yes,licirsty was nigh.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,180
nsome of God

449
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:27,860
Jehovah 1.한

450
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,280
rich beyond imagining but without working.

451
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,640
This experience, combined with his UFO-given sales magic,

452
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,560
led him inevitably into the religion field.

453
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,540
Bob is the still center of a turning world.

454
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,760
He's the angel of the bottomless pit, the blood of the land,

455
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,700
the paraclete of Caborca, and the key to the gateway is his pot.

456
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,480
The blueness of the wound.

457
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,900
The blueness of a wound cleanses away the evil.

458
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,320
You see, Bob is not just a mystic salesman,

459
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,280
not just world-renowned as the man who can sell anything,

460
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,760
but he's the mythic proto-salesman of legend.

461
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,480
There have always been Bobs.

462
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,180
There was a first Bob 80 million years ago in Atlantis,

463
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,740
and every great civilization has had its Bob.

464
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,840
Bob's here to make sure the Earth doesn't get sold.

465
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,740
Bob's the traveling salesman you've heard about.

466
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
He came to save you some slack, mister.

467
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,740
You better look around yourself if you aren't getting any slack.

468
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,160
It's someplace it shouldn't ought to be.

469
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,300
The conspiracy's got your slack.

470
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,780
Now, some would say that the Church of the Subgenius

471
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,700
is merely a monstrous, huge art project

472
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,140
spanning continents, utilizing the 100 best multimedia artists in America.

473
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,460
Others would simply say it's just my religion.

474
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,780
Just my religion, let me practice it.

475
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,020
This is a recording by a few of the subgeniuses

476
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,100
of the O.O.

477
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,280
of the Bible.

478
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,840
In the end times, there shall come mockers.

479
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,760
If we're those mockers, then you should thank us

480
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,220
for helping to fulfill biblical prophecy.

481
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:35,860
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense, sense of humor,

482
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,080
and dollars and cents.

483
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,280
A likely story, you say.

484
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,660
But it's simple, really.

485
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,080
Bob is lucky, not smart.

486
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,360
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

487
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,740
he is gifted with incredible stupidity.

488
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,540
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

489
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,880
This enables him to be a man of his word.

490
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,100
To act without thinking.

491
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,020
To surf effortlessly on the luck plane.

492
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,520
To float down the fabled path of least resistance.

493
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,480
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.

494
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,660
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies.

495
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,300
His holy blunders which we emulate.

496
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,040
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you,

497
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,660
but in what he allows you to do to yourself.

498
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,840
He brings the student to the realization that

499
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,340
everything you know is true.

500
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,860
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day,

501
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,660
but you can learn to enjoy it.

502
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,140
The so-called primitive nature worshipers of the right-brainedness.

503
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,780
Bob wants you to have slack.

504
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,140
Bob wants you to do what you want to do.

505
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,900
Here, have a glass.

506
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,400
Everything you know is wrong.

507
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,180
Do us that will.

508
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,800
Shall be the loophole and the law through which you can escape

509
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,220
and into which you can push that great knowledge of...

510
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,820
...hyroflex.

511
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,760
The thing is...

512
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,300
The thing is the overman.

513
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,380
Are we having a relationship or just doing research on each other?

514
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,360
Bob both.

515
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,380
Yeah, exactly.

516
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,920
Bob wants all of us to be rich and famous.

517
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,880
He wants his followers to be on their own two feet.

518
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,940
So we don't demand all worldly goods.

519
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,380
And Bob is not a fan club.

520
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:20,060
So Bob demands only your total, if erratic, devotion to his almighty word.

521
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,680
The right people must be made into superhuman overmen.

522
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,020
By that alien technology that is the end of their world, not our world.

523
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,080
That's another thing.

524
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,240
I mean, we don't stop when we turn you into a zombie.

525
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,420
Beyond that, you can undergo the surgery, the glandscaping at the hands of the many doctors.

526
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,460
Male or female.

527
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,100
Right, right.

528
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,680
Absolutely.

529
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,580
And we can go either direction once we have you, too.

530
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,560
This religion canonizes our most hostile heretics and our most devoted monks.

531
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,140
This is a religion for outcasts.

532
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,820
For crips, freaks, morphin' out.

533
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,000
For the eyes.

534
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,200
So kick the conspiracy out of your life and call up.

535
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,520
Avoid it in your friends.

536
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,100
Slap yourself awake with weird experiences and wake up.

537
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,540
Notice the schematics, as he said earlier.

538
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,220
The luck plane.

539
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,820
The work net of synchronicity.

540
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,420
And support the laser project.

541
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,820
Take the slack for your own.

542
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,460
Perhaps a few words about the laser project.

543
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:12,860
Oh, hold it.

544
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,800
We've got a caller here.

545
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,100
Hello?

546
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,640
Hello?

547
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,400
I've got a question for Doug.

548
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,640
Oh, it's the mouse again.

549
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,240
Uh-huh.

550
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,440
Well?

551
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Is Bob the antichrist?

552
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,800
No, Bob is not the antichrist.

553
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:24,800


554
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:24,800


555
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,620
Bob is the...

556
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,160
There is an anti-Bob.

557
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:26,820
There...

558
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,080
Bob is the anti-antichrist.

559
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,000
Um...

560
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,080
Or the anti-anti-antichrist.

561
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,460
You get it, you get heavy into the numerology there.

562
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,080
Bob's...

563
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,460
There's a multiple independent antichrist.

564
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:36,660
Right.

565
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,580
Bob's number...

566
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,360
Does Bob like God?

567
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,320
Does Bob like God?

568
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,360
Bob can't stand him, actually.

569
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:42,980
No, I...

570
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,780
No, that's not...

571
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,360
If you can talk about it in those kind of terms as...

572
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,120
Yeah, this is a...

573
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,720
Him and like and God.

574
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,360
...all stands for man.

575
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,860
This...

576
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,760
The Church of the Subgenius is God's answer to the moral...

577
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:54,760


578
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:54,780
Hello?

579
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:54,780


580
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,080
...majority, if you can understand that.

581
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,580
This is...

582
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:58,760
Now, this is...

583
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,520
This is God's answer to the...

584
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:00,580
...last prayer.

585
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,400
Oh, enough of this.

586
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,000
...those that you...

587
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, it's the antichrist!

588
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:03,780
Huh?

589
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,140
Wherever possible...

590
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,240
We'll pray for you.

591
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,720
...for the holy...

592
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,980
No, we'll...

593
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,280
...telephone from the...

594
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
We'll burn some money.

595
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,440
...over room at the White House.

596
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,160
Any confessions out there?

597
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,500
I'm talking to you by telephone from the over room at the White House.

598
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:17,780
Right.

599
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,540
Oh, how do you do?

600
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,900
And it certainly has to be the most...

601
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,000
Your word is...

602
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,820
Word is new.

603
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,360
Howdy.

604
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,800
Howdy.

605
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,800


606
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,800


607
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,800


608
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,800


609
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,800


610
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,340
Your word is love, love.

611
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,660
You wanna ask for...

612
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,400
I'll do ya, please.

613
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,480
I'm telling you.

614
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,920
You wanna ask your man.

615
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,540
I'm-

616
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,800
I'm giving you.

617
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
You're giving you.

618
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,700
I'm-

619
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,880
I'm...

620
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,020
I'm-

621
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,040
I'm-

622
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,400
I'm-

623
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,480
I'm-

624
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm-

625
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm-

626
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm-

627
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,240


628
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,240


629
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,240


630
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,240


631
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,840
Your right...

632
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,700
Your right...

633
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,900
Is...

634
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,180
Your right...

635
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,120
Right...

636
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,420
Right...

637
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:49,920
Right...

638
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,440
Right...

639
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,320
Right...

640
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Think about it ladies and gentlemen, you can stop paying for that cable.

641
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,540
50% of this country is saturated with that mind control.

642
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,060
Your psychic stench is good enough.

643
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,520
Ladies and gentlemen, subgenius are really a minority.

644
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,940
You think that blacks are a minority, you think that Vietnamese are a minority, you

645
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,960
think that Asians are a minority.

646
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,420
This is not true ladies and gentlemen, the subgenius is in the minority.

647
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,360
But he knows who's pulling the strings on the conspiracy, he knows who's pulling the

648
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,420
strings at the White House.

649
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,040
He knows the men in black and the wrathful God Jehovah One.

650
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,520
He knows the space deity with a sick sense of humor.

651
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,760
He came down and he rearranged those magnetic particles.

652
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,620
I bought an Elastil on my wife's wedding.

653
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,580
It made it very easy for me to take offerings and receive money.

654
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,540
Try this.

655
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,260
It's a pink and blue factory.

656
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,040
It's a distressed electrician.

657
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,720
And the distributors are desperate for cash.

658
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,180
Our desperate for cash!

659
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,220
Dispersed for cash!

660
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,260
But how do I know this water is really clean?

661
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,280
The world would never be the same.

662
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,880
Can God deliver a dog?

663
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,860
Oh yes he can.

664
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,840
Now I want you to get out your dollars.

665
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,300
We're gonna give money tonight to kill a colony for Jesus.

666
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,860
We're gonna fight communism.

667
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,400
You need God's money right!

668
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
As they launch it behind you.

669
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,380
The world is gonna be a mess.

670
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:51,560
We're gonna be a mess.

671
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,620


672
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,620


673
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,620


674
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:51,640
The world will turn to dust.

675
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:51,640


676
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,600
I've been contacting our members for thousands of years.

677
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:51,680
I've been contacting our members for thousands of years.

678
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:22,000
I've been contacting our members for thousands of years.

679
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,200
I want all faith partners to share with us a prayer.

680
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,640
Right now, tonight.

681
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,300
For we are going to rebuild that tower twice as high.

682
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,820
I think we ought to send a contribution, Ma.

683
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,100
Oh, Paul, that'd be an act of real charity.

684
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,420
Until Satan has been utterly destroyed.

685
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,360
Praise the Lord!

686
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,440
Don't wait till tomorrow to send off your love donation, faith partners.

687
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,600
Don't wait till after the program.

688
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,060
Get your checkbook out now.

689
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,040
That's right.

690
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,100
Now, we've had a lot of requests for this little number,

691
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,440
so while y'all are writing, Mary and I are going to be singing.

692
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,780
Mary?

693
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,680
If you've got some money lying around,

694
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,320
send Jesus some, send Jesus some.

695
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,940
Instead of taking that week out of town,

696
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,340
send Jesus some, send Jesus some.

697
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,720
It's for the money you have to run.

698
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,400
We'll be here to take your call.

699
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,720
I could relate to that, Don.

700
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,360
Hallelujah.

701
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,440
Can I be a Christian warmonger?

702
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,520
Never heard of a holy war?

703
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,880
Fear of the commies is right up there with fear of God.

704
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,620
It says so in the Bible, apparently.

705
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,500
Send Jesus some.

706
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,240
That's in the surest for when you get up.

707
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,860
Send Jesus some.

708
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,600
She's cute.

709
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,600
Send Jesus some.

710
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,060
The world needs a wake-up call.

711
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,920
We're gonna phone it in.

712
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,020
Absolutely.

713
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,500
Perfect, isn't it?

714
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,500
We'll do anything to be rich.

715
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,700
Look around at the environment we live in.

716
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,400
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane

717
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,700
have increased since 1958.

718
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,520
Earth is being acclimatized.

719
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.

720
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,300
What do these things want and why are they here?

721
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,940
It's in their best interest. They're free enterprises.

722
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,300
Earth is just another developing planet.

723
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,180
Their third world.

724
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,120
We are like a natural resource to them.

725
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,180
To keep the planet, move on to another.

726
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,720
They want benign indifference.

727
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,520
They want us drunken.

728
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,040
We could be pets.

729
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,480
We could be food.

730
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,300
But all we really are is livestock.

731
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,300
But all we really are is lifetime.

732
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,980
Livestock, livestock.

733
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,140
This isn't lie, Carly.

734
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,680
And everybody thinks I'm high and I詔am.

735
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,040
Girls have found out that Berdie callsllo NG's

736
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,580
years of spontaneous movement

737
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
everybody thinks I'm high and I詔am.

738
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,180
and everybody thinks I'm high and I詔am.

739
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,820
has the power that rules us.

740
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,020
Wasching the pipes of everybody's pies.

741
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,660
to George Bush, the oligarchy only grows stronger and more resilient and more oppressive.

742
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,620
That electorate now sensibly refuses to vote. Actually, the government has no interest.

743
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,300
Although it has declared war on drugs, it has no interest in winning this latest war.

744
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,780
A war that will be lost like all the other wars they have pretended to fight, because

745
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,540
they never have an interest in winning as opposed to expensively prosecuting the war.

746
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,180
The oligarchy does not care whether the citizens make themselves sick with drugs or not.

747
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:08,680
What the government wants is simple. Total control over money, and ultimately total control over each citizen.

748
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,920
If this can be got by dispensing with a bill of rights,

749
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,760
and that's a special bill,

750
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,740
then it's a small price to pay for freedom.

751
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,920
Freedom for the few.

752
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:29,880
In fact, the whole tone of the Reagan-Bush management is one of open hostility and contempt for our ancient rights in particular,

753
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,320
and for the people in general.

754
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,380
Today, the poor, as Mr. Bush might put it, are indeed doo-doo.

755
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,760
The rich are fed up with the poor.

756
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,540
And if the poor don't shape up, the rich just aren't going to take it anymore.

757
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,520
Yeah, you hear that? Shape up, poor folk.

758
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,880
Because the rich just aren't going to take it anymore.

759
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,100
Okay, as promised, again, here's the Southland Corporation once again with

760
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,040
Fuhrer, Rise of a Madman.

761
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,660
Eins, zwei, drei, vier.

762
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,780
.

763
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,800
But I don't understand.

764
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,500
I don't understand why you turned your father over to the Gestapo.

765
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,100
Don't you love him?

766
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,180
Of course I love him.

767
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,880
I love him more than...

768
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,620
I love him perhaps even more than you.

769
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,600
But my only duty is to the motherland.

770
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,700
I must serve her.

771
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,600
Oh, I'll have a few moments of pain, but basically I feel no remorse.

772
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,020
I don't understand. You've become some kind of monster.

773
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:09,620
Of course I had to falsify information in order to turn my father over to the concentration camps.

774
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,620
But basically, you could say I have a clear conscience about it.

775
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:23,820
Now you must allow me to continue living here, even though I have no job.

776
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,860
Or I'll have you turned over to the Gestapo also.

777
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,060
.

778
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,260
We have ways of silencing your nagging tongue.

779
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,620
.

780
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,060
But, Jaina, you said you were going to mow the lawn on Saturday.

781
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,840
.

782
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,400
You won't be asking me if I'm going to mow the lawn when you're in a concentration camp.

783
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,440
.

784
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,900
I must die. I must die for Hitler.

785
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,760
.

786
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,540
But they said he only had a cold.

787
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,880
.

788
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,360
They said it possibly could turn into pneumonia, but basically it was just a cold.

789
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,040
I must die. I must die for Hitler.

790
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,460
You don't understand. I must die for Hitler.

791
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:24,820
What is this strange ideology that perverts even life's most basic instincts?

792
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,840
.

793
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,800
.

794
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,080
The gay wings of a butterfly.

795
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:44,140
How different they are from the wings of a transport plane flying night raids over London.

796
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,800
.

797
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:45,800


798
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,420
.

799
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:47,700
.

800
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:47,820
ありがとうございました .

801
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


802
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:47,820


803
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,040
.

804
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,980
No, CW, you sucked.

805
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,920
It's the birth of the bottom leg and the aren't the Russians.

806
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,620
.

807
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:16,700
.

808
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,680
.

809
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:34,540
Did not all Aryan cultures fall because of race mixing, blowing themselves through race

810
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,020
mixing?

811
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,680
They had us hooked up to that one machine that just peeled our eyelids back and just

812
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,620
had a big bottle up there.

813
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,000
It's kind of like Chinese water torture, except they dropped one drop of water.

814
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,000


815
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:13,960
One drop of motor oil in one eye every other 30 minutes and one drop of dishwashing liquid

816
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,040
in the other eye every other 30 minutes.

817
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,080
But I wouldn't say we were torturing them or anything like that.

818
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,840
They got a lunch break.

819
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,240
Longer lunch break I used to get on my job.

820
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
We just got messed up one night.

821
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,040
Decided to start a third ride.

822
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,100
I don't know.

823
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,880
I had about seven beers.

824
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,840
I don't know why we decided to talk to the earth and start a new race.

825
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,440
I don't know.

826
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,120
I guess you could say we just got a wild hair up our ass.

827
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,700
I don't know.

828
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,220
I don't know.

829
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,000
I don't know.

830
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,000


831
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,000


832
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,140
When they got it down on my wrist, I couldn't believe it.

833
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,140


834
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,140


835
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,140


836
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,140


837
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,080
I'll have you drowned in your own blood.

838
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,660
I wasbuds.

839
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:34,220
. . . . . . . Heal.

840
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:34,980
. . . . ... . . . . . . . all in all.

841
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Heil Schicklgruber! Heil Schicklgruber! Heil Schicklgruber!

842
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,860
And thank you, Jainer and the Southland Corporation.

843
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,980
Jainer and the Southland Corporation

844
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,500
In tonight's production, the pulleys are the bundles of cables that transmit this work over the airwaves.

845
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,980
The scenery is spun out of computer programs. The lighting is the cathode ray tube.

846
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,660
And the conductor, he has not just flown in from Budapest.

847
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,860
He is not now approaching the podium.

848
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,980
He is not wearing a tuxedo. Why not?

849
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,460
Because tonight, the conductor is electricity.

850
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,420
Stay tuned.

851
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,960
Ladies and gentlemen, you can stop paying for that cable.

852
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,100
50% of this country is saturated with that mind control.

853
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Your psychic stench is good enough.

854
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,960
Ladies and gentlemen, subgenius are really a minority.

855
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,900
You think that blacks are a minority. You think that Vietnamese are a minority.

856
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,320
You think that Asians are a minority.

857
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,780
This is not true, ladies and gentlemen.

858
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,720
The subgenius is in the minority.

859
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,940
But he knows who is pulling the strings on the conspiracy.

860
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,820
He knows.

861
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,620
He knows who is pulling the strings at the White House.

862
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,420
He knows the men in black.

863
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,200
And the wrathful god, Jehovah One.

864
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,540
Space deity with a sick sense of humor.

865
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,600
Negi came down and he rearranged those magnetic particles.

866
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,760
Oh, that is great.

867
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,680
Well, that's all.

868
00:48:35,000 --> 00:49:04,680
Never mind.

869
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:04,960
Only good results can."

870
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:04,960


871
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:04,960


872
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:04,960


873
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:04,960


874
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:04,960


875
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:04,980


876
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:04,980


877
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:04,980


878
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:44,460
and he told you that aliens have been protecting the power of some sort of boobies, boobies.

879
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:55,500
But you can transform his flesh, which is no flesh, into animal flesh, which is no flesh,

880
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,780
to plant flesh, which is no flesh, and to spiritual flesh.

881
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,200
...posted at the end of each corridor.

882
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,180
They own everything, the whole damn planet, they can do whatever they want!

883
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,560
We all sell out every day! We all sell out every day! We all sell out every day!

884
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,600
Well, that's the power of the word of the Lord, Mary.

885
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,460
Amen!

886
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,260
But before we see the next program,

887
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:29,760
...

888
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,560
I want to talk about the other force at work in the land.

889
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:39,060
I've just learned that the WITV transmitter on Marconi Mountain has been hit by lightning, Mary.

890
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,220
What can the viewers at home do, Doug?

891
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,320
Well, first I want all faith partners to share with us a prayer.

892
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,740
Right now, tonight.

893
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,340
For we are going to rebuild that tower twice as high.

894
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,500
Think we ought to send a contribution, huh?

895
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,720
Oh, Paul, that'd be an act of real charity.

896
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,960
Until Satan has been utterly destroyed.

897
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,900
Praise the Lord!

898
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,920
Don't wait till tomorrow to send off your love donation, faith partners.

899
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,040
Don't wait till after the program.

900
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,500
Get your checkbook out now.

901
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,420
That's right.

902
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,720
Now, we've had a lot of requests for this little number, so while y'all are writing, Mary and I are going to be singing.

903
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,100
Mary?

904
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,860
Mary?

905
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:21,500


906
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,600
Mary?

907
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,880
Mary, have you got some money lying around?

908
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,400
Send Jesus some. Send Jesus some.

909
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,920
Instead of taking that wick out of town,

910
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,360
Send Jesus some. Send Jesus some.

911
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,040
It's on the money, not the wrong.

912
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,540
We'll be here to take your call...

913
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,760
I could relate to that, Don.

914
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,360
Hallelujah!

915
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,420
Can I be a Christian, warmonger?

916
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,500
Never heard of a holy war?

917
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,780
Fear of the commies is right up there with fear of God.

918
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,560
It says so in the Bible, apparently.

919
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,400
Send Jesus up.

920
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,100
Buy some insurance for when you get up.

921
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,600
Send Jesus up.

922
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,420
She's cute.

923
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,420
Send Jesus up.

924
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,860
The world needs a wake-up call.

925
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,680
We're gonna phone it in.

926
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,020
Perfect, isn't it?

927
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,020
We'll do anything to be rich.

928
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,200
Look around at the environment we live in.

929
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:38,120
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.

930
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,940
Earth is being acclimatized.

931
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,260
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.

932
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,640
What do these things want, and why are they here?

933
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,780
It's in their best interest.

934
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,240
They're free enterprises.

935
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,560
Earth is just another developing planet.

936
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,420
Their third world.

937
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:54,760
They're the ones who are going to be rich.

938
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:54,760


939
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,420
We are like a natural race to be the next.

940
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,940
Deplete the planet.

941
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,360
Move on to another.

942
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,860
They want benign indifference.

943
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,520
They want us growing.

944
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,180
We could be pets.

945
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,540
We could be food.

946
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,460
But all we really are is livestock.

947
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,420
But all we really are is livestock.

948
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,540
Livestock.

949
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,500
Livestock.

950
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,880
This is an encounter.

951
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,520
And everybody thinks I'm high and I ain't.

952
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,760
We also found out that who lives in the world is the highest.

953
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,440
And everybody thinks I'm high and I ain't.

954
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:26,780
And all these spontaneous movements.

955
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,480
And everybody thinks I'm high and I ain't.

956
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:29,920
We're out of poses.

957
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,940
And an oligarchy starts to rule that rules us.

958
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,040
And everybody thinks I'm high and I ain't.

959
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,460
From George Washington to George Bush, the oligarchy only grows stronger, and more resilient,

960
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,320
and more oppressive.

961
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,400
That elector, now ostensibly refuses to vote.

962
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,160
Actually, the government has no interest.

963
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,760
Although it has declared war on drugs it has no interest in winning this latest bill.

964
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:01,540
war. A war that will be lost like all the other wars they have pretended to fight because they

965
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:09,660
never have an interest in winning as opposed to expensively prosecuted war. The oligarchy does

966
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:16,640
not care whether the citizens make themselves sick with drugs or not. What the government wants is

967
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:27,820
simple. Total control over money is ultimately total control over each citizen. If this can be

968
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:35,700
got by discussing with a bill of rights, then that's a small price to pay for freedom. Freedom for the

969
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:45,420
few. In fact, the whole tone of the Reagan-Bush management is one of open hostility, contempt for our

970
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,580
ancient rights and potential.

971
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:04,360
The rich are fed up with the poor, and if the poor don't shape up, the rich just aren't going to take it anymore.

972
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:15,060
Then welcome to the anthill society and to our inglorious common death and respect, our used-up celestial matter.

973
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,380
Remember,

974
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:25,880
the rich are fed up with the poor, and if the poor don't shape up, the rich just aren't going to take it anymore. We are the first non-tax exempt church around. We're the first industrial church.

975
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,860
This is your last chance. This may be your only hope.

976
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:43,820
Little realized even by leading scientists, there are really only two races, actually two distinct species of

977
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,060
people.

978
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,100
And we'll talk about those two distinct species perhaps next week, perhaps not.

979
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:54,600
Who knows?

980
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:02,140
Dear listeners, you've been enjoying, I hope, the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

981
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,720
And again, new listeners tonight with many, many questions.

982
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,620
The main one, as usual, are you guys for real?

983
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,300
Find out.

984
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:20,040
He didn't even really want to believe, I guess, that we did send out that free information.

985
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,940
And maybe that's why so many of you don't ask for it.

986
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,080
So, you know, take us up on it, dear friends.

987
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,920
Ask for that free information.

988
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:34,180
Just write to the address that I'm going to give you time to find your envelope before I give you tonight.

989
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,240
You ready?

990
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,420
Write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in...

991
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,100
Mighty, as we like to say.

992
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:45,860
Mighty.

993
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,760
Dallas, Texas 75214.

994
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,820
No need to send any money.

995
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,940
Just ask for that free information and you'll be surprised just how free it is at first.

996
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,860
Yeah, first hits always free, dear friends.

997
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:10,300
Stay tuned for that which must inevitably follow in whatever city you're listening to our show tonight in.

998
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,760
Stay tuned.

999
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,360
Imagine him falling for a gag like that.

1000
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,140
Little Nimrod.

1001
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,200
In a rage.

1002
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,220
He's...

1003
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,800
What a party!

1004
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,920
Just being tired!

1005
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,900
Of course we can legalize drugs and get rid of most of the problem, but where's the money in that?

1006
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,160
But where's the money in that?

1007
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,060
Where's the money in that?

1008
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,080
Drug Czar William Bennett said he had no moral problem with beheading drug dealers.

1009
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,280
Only legalization.

1010
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,960
You crossed my line of debt!

1011
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,600
You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile!

1012
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,420
Pakistan is threatening my border!

1013
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,040
That's it, buster! No more military aid!

1014
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,600
Nuke them! Get them before they get you.

1015
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,240
Another quality home game from Butler Brothers.

1016
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,880
But where's the money in that?

1017
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,140
But where's the money in that?

1018
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,040
Where's the money in that?

1019
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,820
Think your children are as innocent as a new puppy next door?

1020
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,860
Well, they know something you don't know.

1021
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:44,020
They know that their American forefathers took drugs.

1022
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,540
And you probably don't even know where your father is.

1023
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,140
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1024
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,060
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1025
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,340
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1026
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,500
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1027
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,760
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1028
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,560
You're a big shot!

1029
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,040
You're a big shot!

1030
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:11,040


1031
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:11,220
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1032
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,900
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1033
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,120
But that sounds intriguing, you know?

1034
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,400
Well, that's the power of the word of the Lord, Mary.

1035
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,220
Amen!

1036
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,440
I got a sexually frustrated teenager here.

1037
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,040
What's going on?

1038
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,260
Hey, what's happening?

1039
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,660
Nothing. What's your problem?

1040
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,520
Well, you're the one with the problem. Let's hear your problem.

1041
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,540
No, I don't have any problems.

1042
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,940
Sexually frustrated, right?

1043
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,100
Never had a multiple.

1044
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,380
Never had a multiple?

1045
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:33,640


1046
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:33,700
Never had a multiple?

1047
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,440
Never.

1048
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,720
Do you actually fear Bob at times?

1049
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,280
Oh, no, not really.

1050
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,840
Do you figure there's a reason for that?

1051
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,240
Probably.

1052
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,980
Bob can bring you to multiple orgasms.

1053
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,760
Let's hear it.

1054
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,280
Further, she enjoys wearing men's underwear, Fruit of the Loom, tight whitey.

1055
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,460
Why is a gorgeous, gentle, red, red-eyed, blue-eyed, tie-dye?

1056
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,160
Satan has been utterly destroyed.

1057
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,160
Praise the Lord!

1058
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,260
Put the CIA on it, man. Break a few knees.

1059
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,720
That's the way they would have handled it in the old days, you know?

1060
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,660
I mean...

1061
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,860
No, it's not true at all. I don't believe it. It's just a good thing to say.

1062
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,820
You know, it's kind of like the Kowski story.

1063
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,720
The more stuff you believe in, the better off you are.

1064
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,720
Even if it's for ridiculous things like Jim and Timmy Baker, I totally understand why people send in the money.

1065
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:22,000
It's because they're not smart enough to spend the money.

1066
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,840
The poor and the rich, the young and the old, be smeared with guiltless gore.

1067
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,720
They mustn't panic.

1068
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,580
No time for regrets. The Congress wants more.

1069
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,060
Rebellion, the awful realization of it, assails us.

1070
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,400
Who is to command us all?

1071
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,460
My name does not matter.

1072
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,580
I have my misgivings, little experience.

1073
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,140
There's no sleep for us. All is chaos.

1074
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,660
But it's better than we dared hope.

1075
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,180
