Named one only, named him only.

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,900
Oh, whip it out, dear friends.

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,740

9
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,900
That is correct.

10
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,660
That is correct.

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,420
Yeah, I think that is going to do it.

12
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,560
And then what we've got, we've got the singers coming in

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,800
at about 3.

14
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,660
First 10 seconds.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,780
And we've cut that in the studio.

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,580
We're going to bring it back down.

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,260
They're laying it back right now, doing one of those audio laybacks.

18
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,760
And when we add that to it, do you guys have chroma key?

19
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,820
That is correct.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,640
Yeah.

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,860
That is correct.

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,160
Okay, now listen to me.

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,740
We want to make it so that you can, what do they call it, donut?

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,240
You know, where you have the front.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,980
The beginning.

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,180
That is correct.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,140
Yeah, because we're going to be putting in every week something different.

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,720
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:55,840

High E-pop, living avatar of slack, overlord of the 12 super universes,

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,700

Resurrected, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,260
That is correct.

41
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,980
Yeah.

42
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,420
Okay.

43
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,920
That is correct.

44
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,000
Is it possible just to take the audio from that, because we want to run it at the local station.

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,140
Yeah, just give me...

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,560
It's...

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah, one of those tapes.

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I don't know what they do.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,380
You guys know, okay?

50
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,220
That is correct.

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,460
Yeah.

52
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,820
That is correct.

53
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,300
That is correct.

54
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,720
An attempt to keep the useless picture, you will find yourself writing some rather useless words.

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,880
A variant of this is the second basic.

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Put the voice under.

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,500
Die Märchen loten das Gest 말.

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,640
Das Salz zum Satz.

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,440
Damit Sie allen, die es verdient haben, in diesem Jahr etwas ganz einmalen...

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,920
could not like it and now to the editorial room of the jurgens journal and walter winter

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:48,820
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa we're high tech tonight boy oh yeah we're come come computerized

62
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:58,380
we're a modern church now i was gonna do this rant on gimmick boxes gimmicks

63
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:07,540
and about how one reason there's so much dull listless music around is that nowadays you don't

64
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,420
have to have any skill with a musical instrument all you need is an expensive computer so any

65
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,300
spoiled rich kid can cut a boring album and they all

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,800
you

67
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:27,800
and about how the explosion of cheap electronic special effects boxes has led to this

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:38,480
overload of gimmicky gimmicky gimmicky gimmicky gimmicky high tech pinkness and vacuousness at

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:47,240
the expense of good old butt beating feeder pleating bible kicking pill puking emotional

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
passion

71
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,400
it's reference to the

72
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
for you

73
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,440
two

74
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,740
three

75
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,200
four

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,560
three

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,560


78
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,560


79
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,780
six

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
seven

81
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,980
and six

82
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:17,620
boxes myself. Because first, I need a new dryer and got to get that roof leak prepared. But then I thought,

83
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:25,080
wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. And throughout history, the absent-minded,

84
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:33,000
scruffy space cadets of genius inventors have always made do with their cheap patchwork gizmos

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,700
to create, manually, new styles which were later imitated with great ease by pigs who could afford

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:50,260
better tools. Uh, cases in point being DK Jones and Negative Land, who 10 years ago were doing

87
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,020
by hand what every yo-yo, bobby, and bobo with a computer does now on Top 40 Radio.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,500
And besides, I realized I do have a cheap gim, gim, gim, gim, gim, cracky version of these high-tech

89
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:02,980
scissor-

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,320
scissor- sound edit- edit- edit- edit- editing machines.

91
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,760
My little Macintosh LC and this sound edit-

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:21,620
a- nice program I was sent by a beloved fellow subgenius at so-so- so-so- dada- dada- dada-

93
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,580
dada- which I am now playing with.

94
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,860
And it's true, this is just the cheapest possible little mic.

95
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,860
And it's the lowest possible.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,180
And it's a reasonable sampling rate.

97
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:42,160
And all I'm doing is gimmickry stupid effects for the sake of effects, but, but by gobs it's fun.

98
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
And it's slap-full.

99
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,300
And it makes me think what we could do if we had the real, real fancy computers that hold four hours of perfect stereo at the highest sampling rate,

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,040
and you have instant access to the world's library of sound effects and music things.

101
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,700
Eww.

102
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,900
And you could just load every subgenius recording into it and then just edit and edit and edit and edit,

103
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,840
without ever losing a generation.

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,120
of quality because it's all digital and then digital that makes me think that's digital how

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:17,000
come some crazed digital zillionaire hasn't bailed us out and bought that digital thing for us how

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,660
come every other digital grew ball cult has some zillionaire that buys these trinkets for them

107
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:34,220
digital and I think man woman there's something bad wrong with this world and that makes me mad

108
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:42,140
that gets my hate up gets me a hankering to do some casting out of false prophets if you know

109
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,880
what I mean and that's what I get in the spirit oh yeah praise Bob I mean discernment yeah

110
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,220
yeah

111
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,480
commercial signify an important American privilege Dan yes why do they call you Dan the organ man

112
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,340
ha I can think of several reasons but one that comes to mind is nobody else can provide a larger

113
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,340
selection of top quality transplant organs at such low low price now why couldn't I just add

114
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,640
my name to the nationwide dance of the dead I don't know what to do with that I don't know

115

I can have a quality kidney typed, matched, and sized for your wife right in our showroom at a remarkable discount.

121
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
Now you have a friend in the transplant business.

122
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,140
Call Organtown today at 800-555-COMA.

123
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,320
If you leave patients to get into a bad state and you have to operate urgently, you're going to get a few deaths.

124
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,580
Now, at this point, I change horses and move on to the subject of Crohn's disease.

125
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,400
And just to say briefly, now if you have any leanings towards colectomy and iso-rectal anastomosis, close it.

126
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,080
But all I can say is I get lots of recurrences when I do this, and I get a few leaks.

127
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,800
So my own tendency is if the rectum seems normal, perhaps with a bit of anal disease,

128
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,140
not to do an immediate colectomy and iso-rectal, but to do a sub-ingenious,

129
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,500
say a total colectomy or procto-colectomy and iso-rectomy.

130
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,560
And of course, a lot of them have...

131
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,580
So it's very attractive to...

132
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,940
Keep the rectal sub-ingenious, and then after a year or so, consider joining the patient up.

133
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,380
Freedom of choice.

134
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,020
And that, ladies and gentlemen, winds up another Juergens Journal.

135
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,360
Until next Sunday night at the very same time.

136
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,560
Until then, and with lotions of love, I remain your New York correspondent, Walter Winchell,

137
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,260
who thinks every American has at least one thing to be thankful for,

138
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:35,660
and who thinks every American has at least one thing to be thankful for.

139
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,500
No, I don't believe it.

140
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,740
It's gone to look.

141
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,660
When you get back on the line, do you hear...

142
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,460
Occasionally, valves come out of place.

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,180
It's incredible, but they do.

144
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,140
They come out of place, and they then make it difficult for the brow to get the tube in.

145
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,300
Yes.

146
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,420
The brow has a hard time getting the tube in.

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,900
Wait, wait, wait.

148
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,820
You're pregnant!

149
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,900
How?

150
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,420
What miracle of medical appliance has brought this...

151
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,360
this thing to bear within your intestinal arm?

152
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:30,840
The fact is, I'm pregnant with emotion at the very prospect of proceeding up to Arcata, California,

153
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,600
where the surfers go and where there's another sub-genius show.

154
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:46,620
The Association for Consciousness Exploration and the Smart Bar present the world's first Rant and Parade,

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,460

166
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,000

170
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,600
Saturday, May 23rd, 6pm to 6am.

171
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:41,380
Not since the fall of Rome has the club world seen such writhing, wallowing, tribal mutant decadence.

172
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,400
The ATVC calls.

173
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,780
Boy, that was way out there.

174
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,760
Aren't they planning a sort of Bob event?

175
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Another Bobathon up there. Yeah, I think so.

176
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,900
And, uh, actually there are going to be free candies for the kiddies and balloons,

177
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,360
and, uh, of course, they'll have, uh, Fusco the Clown,

178
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,000
and the usual line of baffling tricks.

179
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,780
For example, there's the amazing Zig-Zag card.

180
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,140
Whee!

181
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,360
It's the most diabolical pocket illusion ever created, and you can...

182
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,360


183
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,360


184
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,360


185
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,600
You can see those fancy pressed digitators doing it right up there on the stage at DocStock Mini 3.

186
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,080
Yes, a regular card is examined and signed by a member of the audience known as the plant,

187
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,820
and placed into a frame.

188
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,740
Right here, we're placing it into the frame now.

189
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Miraculously, the card is apparently divided into three sections and zigged and zagged several times.

190
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
And each is packaged separately.

191
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,840
Notice I have nothing up my sleeve, ladies and gentlemen.

192
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,380
Oh, well, yeah, look at that.

193
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,860
Just my own, uh, bulging, liver-spotted, hairy arms here.

194
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,060
Okay, now, watch his hands, will you?

195
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,860
Oh, I magically restore it.

196
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Oh, oops!

197
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

198
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,940
Excuse me, that wasn't supposed to...

199
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,780
That's not your real hand, is it?

200
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,200
No, I... this is, um...

201
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,700
Uh...

202
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,820
Yeah, this is really neat.

203
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,240
Uh, no, no, no, forget it. Let's do something else.

204
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,960
No, no, forget it.

205
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,640
Look at this guy!

206
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,360
No, no, stop!

207
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,180
No, no.

208
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,860
Come on.

209
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,000
Stop trying to embarrass me.

210
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,780
I mean, that's not really my hand.

211
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Boy, I... I'd never... I wouldn't admit it if it were, but...

212
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,360
What are you doing again, everybody?

213
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,520
No, I'm not.

214
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,320
That was the only time I'm ever gonna...

215
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm gonna do that.

216
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,020
You have another hand!

217
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,180
Well, it's... I tell you, it's a fake hand.

218
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Well, okay, you probably got a bunch from that, right? Okay.

219
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,280
Well, I...

220
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Just watch what he does here.

221
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,060
Please. Come on, get the spotlight off...

222
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,060


223
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,960
Lifelike, shapeable hand.

224
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,440
Is it alive, or is it lifelike?

225
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,100
Can you tell which hand is real?

226
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,960
You can't beat the detailing of this lifelike, shapeable hand.

227
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
It was molded from a real human hand.

228
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,640
Shapeable hand of Shakespeare

229
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,140
can be positioned...

230
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,760
in any natural way that a real hand can,

231
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,540
plus a few not-so-natural positions, if you know what I mean.

232
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,560
Use it when you just need to lend someone a hand...

233
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,980
or if you just need to send a special handy...

234
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,360
message.

235
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,860
Uh, it might seem somewhat underhanded...

236
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,560
but, uh, I'm sure you'll have the matter well in hand.

237
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,960
Designed to make those synapses fly.

238
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,160
Designed to make that blood circulate.

239
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,840
Designed to make that heart throb even harder.

240
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,460
Yes!

241
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,960
Causing vasoconstriction and violent headaches at times.

242
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,820
You'll find all kinds of fun uses for your fake pumping heart.

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,280
Put it under your shirt to prove your heart beats only for them.

244
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,780
Leave it in San Francisco.

245
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,740
Give, cause you gotta have heart.

246
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,240
Peptoxor uses a scary horror effect.

247
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,920
With battery power pack and 28-inch cord.

248
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,580
Requires two C batteries.

249
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,960
Seven by five inches, same size as real human heart.

250
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,800
Order number 3750.

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,480
Pumping heart draw.

252
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,340
$119.95.99.

253
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,760
Now, when I say cut me some slack, praise Bob.

254
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,840
Or cut yourself some slack.

255
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,720
We're offering an opportunity for a most holy experience.

256
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,820
Well, you're asking for something for nothing.

257
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,000
And why not?

258
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,420
I mean, if you're gonna have your cake, why not eat it too?

259
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,600
People have just gotten used to lowered expectations.

260
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,880
They think, oh, well, I'm, I'm, I'm not meant to...

261
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,780
have everything just the way I want it.

262
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,660
I'm not meant to have slack.

263
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,940
And, and, uh, Bob came along to, to, uh, tear down that ridiculous notion.

264
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,760
The conspiracy.

265
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,460
Yeah.

266
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,320
Has got, has got people believing.

267
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,820
You know, Kevin, that there is a conspiracy.

268
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,880
Against Bob?

269
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,180
Against you, against me, against, against all slack.

270
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,180
No.

271
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:38,320
Um, and it's, uh, this isn't like the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy or, or the conspiracy to hide the UFOs and the air bases in Nevada.

272
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,020
This is a different conspiracy.

273
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,020
This is the conspiracy that, that is behind all other conspiracies.

274
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,840
And it's a conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

275
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,980
It's the conspiracy of the normals.

276
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,560
Oh.

277
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,760
The normal people.

278
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,520
The, the, and, you know, I, I, we know you can't help it.

279
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:55,840
Yeah.

280
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,660
You, these people are all...

281
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,500
There are some out there listening.

282
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,780
Occasional, like, people who might be dealing with, uh, some, some sort of, uh...

283
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,040
Uh, retentive disorder that psychiatrists talk about.

284
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,780
Uh, yeah.

285
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,960
You know, the inversion disorder.

286
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,440
Yeah.

287
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,680
Right, yeah.

288
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,220
Uh, it's, uh, I know exactly what you're talking about.

289
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,480
I don't, I have to be careful, you know.

290
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:23,060
On my, on my radio show, I, I can't really preach the full, uncut word of Bob because the FCC would get down on us.

291
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,220
Yes.

292
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,660
And it's a little station and they don't have lawyers, you know.

293
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,440
And so we, I, I'm, I'm probably more cautious than you are.

294
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,700
But, but over the years...

295
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,660
Bobness and slack have, uh, grown.

296
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,660
The Church of the Subgenius, uh, uh, you've sold now...

297
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,380
25,000 copies of a little booklet, The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die.

298
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,380
Oh, we, well, no, more like 50,000, I think.

299
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,340
Uh, we, that's how many we've printed and we never give anything away.

300
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,140
That's the difference between this religion and those, those boring ones that have to give their stuff.

301
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,820
Now, how's the...

302
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,700
And all you have to do is recruit five other ministers.

303
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,220
And then you become a regional vice president in the Church of the New Faith.

304
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,260
All you have to do is recruit five people, get five people to send their five dollars,

305
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,820
become a minister and recruit more ministers.

306
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,220
And they're gonna have ministers under you and you get overrides from all the money that their people send in.

307
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,920
Now, the best way is to get started with the tenth.

308
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,020
What do you think, Mr. Grace?

309
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Well, not only can you make a lot of money, but at the same time, you can be doing God's work!

310
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,840
Look at all these rings on my finger.

311
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,960
Pure silver and gold!

312
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,640
Now, I'm doing it and making all this wonderful money.

313
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:43,120
And I'm doing it for wealth while serving the Lord God, Jesus Christ, Creator of heaven and earth!

314
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,300
And what better job, what more satisfying way can you earn money?

315
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:59,780
But Reverend Stang, out of your own mouth, I heard earlier this morning that there have been people who have been paying you for subgeniousness.

316
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,540
Oh, certainly.

317
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,480
There have been people who have been paying you for slackness.

318
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,120
They have to.

319
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,640
If they want to make the escape vessels of the sex goddesses at the end of the day, they have to.

320
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,780
If they want to make the escape vessels of the sex goddesses at the end of the world in 1998, they'd better have their $20 in our bank account.

321
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,700
They're not buying slack, they're buying survival.

322
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,480
Membership.

323
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,620
The slack, we just give them, all we provide is a pep talk.

324
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:27,980
You know, to make them remember that there is a conspiracy of the normals that keeps trying to hold them back.

325
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,800
Keep people from exercising their abnormality, potentially.

326
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,720
And you know what we advise people to do if they can't take a joke?

327
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
I don't think I need to go into that major tenet of the church in extreme detail.

328
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,320
Like they say in Chicago.

329
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,360
Yes.

330
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,840
It can't be said enough.

331
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,740
No, it can't.

332
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,180
They cannot be reminded enough what to do if the joke can't be taken.

333
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,660
This is Bill Neal speaking.

334
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,220
This is Stevie Nicks wishing you a very special...

335
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,780
This is Papa Prayer with an important message.

336
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,160
This is General Curtis Goathart.

337
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,700
This is Amy Nightrade at the...

338
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,540
This is Amy Nightrade reporting live outside Haley Center.

339
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,420
This is Major Tom to ground control.

340
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,400
This is Henry Harrison, co-host of the PTL Club Ministry on television and radio.

341
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,500
This, this, bring your class on Pirate Salad Life. Yeah!

342
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,500
This is Governor George C. Wallace of the state of Alabama.

343
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,340
This is Bill Neal speaking.

344
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,360
This is your good friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stank.

345
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,980
This is the United States calling. Are we reaching?

346
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,440
What's your name, little girl? What's your name?

347
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,960
My name is Luca.

348
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,580
Is your name not Bruce?

349
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,660
No, it's Michael.

350
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,480
I am, I am, I am Superman.

351
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,080
My name is Rolly and I'm a Dalmatian puppy.

352
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,020
This is Bill Neal speaking.

353
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,300
My name is Raymond James.

354
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,460
This is Judy.

355
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,640
I am Nick McPherson.

356
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,460
I am the famous Pikachu.

357
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,280
I am the...

358
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,000
I am Grapples Chablonski.

359
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,120
I am Sarah Noe.

360
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,380
Steve Boyle.

361
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,200
I am the...

362
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,340
This is Bill Neal speaking.

363
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,540
I am Sir Noe.

364
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh, yeah.

365
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:43,560
I guess that's where the tape ends, where the adventure ends, and where hell begins.

366
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,940
Ha ha.

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:23:01,560
With our extraterrestrial communication network all prepared here and set to go in the Esoteric Castle of the German Research Project,

368
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,860
where we try to achieve a deep, mellow tone as a natural aid to digestion.

369
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,640
Do it yourself with foam rubber, friends.

370
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,080
Are you missing a piece of the pattern?

371
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:23,180
Well, the Esperanto League of North America and Uncle Ernie Culp, although too easily given to the worship of false gods,

372
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,080
can provide you with just the slack.

373
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,520
Ha ha.

374
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,020
Others in the music queue, you need.

375
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:42,800
And I need some slack because, uh, well, I didn't start working on this show tonight until about 4 o'clock,

376
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,040
and I only got about 20 minutes into the edit there, so...

377
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,860
Oh, gosh, what am I going to do with the rest of the show?

378
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
Well, first, I'll tell you what you've been hearing.

379
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,740
I guess from the get-go, from the beginning of the show,

380
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,160
we had, uh, well, some background music from the Swinging Love Corpses,

381
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,380
some, uh, little clips and cuts from the Over the Edge show from KPFA in Berkeley,

382
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,860
which Puzzling Evidence sent,

383
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,940
the clips about people arguing over the, uh, what fancy equipment to use, you see.

384
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,580
We ended that argument.

385
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,560
The commercials that you heard,

386
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
including the ones that you heard,

387
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,740
and down at the very end there,

388
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,080
the This Is Bill Neal speaking, and so forth,

389
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,040
and the organ donor commercial by the all-pro cavalcade for Bob in Atlanta.

390
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,140
Hello, Atlanta.

391
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,940
The rectum cut was by Puzzling Evidence.

392
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,860
Of course, who else?

393
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,780
Who else?

394
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,000
And you also heard some Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell from the KPFA Puzzling Evidence subgenius show.

395
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,280
And an ad for a, a D-Vival that's coming up in Cleveland,

396
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,820
which is of no real interest to those of you who don't live in Cleveland.

397
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,680
You poor devils.

398
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,940
And, okay, well,

399
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,320
so much for the, uh,

400
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,980
so much for the credits, dear friends.

401
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,100
And what do I move on to next?

402
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
Why, it's a good thing that Chuck Shepard's new

403
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,380
News of the Weird came out, uh, this week.

404
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,700
And we're gonna, we're gonna examine some of the, some of the latest news.

405
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,100
This is all true news.

406
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,240
These things really happened.

407
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,400
And, um,

408
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,280
for some reason he, he has a lead story here.

409
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,860
I don't think this is that weird myself, but

410
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:56,060
a London firm recently began marketing cigarettes under the brand name Death.

411
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,760
I've got a, a package of one of these

412
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,240
somebody gave me.

413
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,880
Said firm director B.J. Cunningham,

414
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm being honest, I'm selling Death.

415
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,440
A skull and crossbones are on every package along with this warning.

416
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,660
Cigarettes are addictive and debilitating.

417
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
If you don't smoke, don't start. If you smoke, quit.

418
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,420
Cunningham, a heavy smoker, said,

419
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
Sales are going fine.

420
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,300
Wrong place, wrong time.

421
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,900
An unidentified man in, wait a minute, this isn't the proper background music.

422
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,600
We need something cheerful for this.

423
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,380
That's not very cheerful. Well, that's okay.

424
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,580
An unidentified man in Paducah, Kentucky,

425
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,960
who was seen earlier in the airport trying to trade his leather jacket for a ticket to California,

426
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,940
was killed shortly afterward when he fell 300 feet off the wing

427
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,760
of a Northwest Airlines commuter plane he was hitching a ride on.

428
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,440
This guy was so desperate to get to California that he

429
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,720
hung onto the wing of a Northwest Airlines commuter flight

430
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,600
and fell to his death.

431
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,240
You know, friends, I suspect that that unidentified man

432
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,300
had a girlfriend in California.

433
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,200
Probably somewhere in California his true Yeti mate went into heat.

434
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,600
And all the way there in Paducah, Kentucky, he could quiff-read that.

435
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,800
And that's what happens. That's what happens.

436
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,160
William James Oden, Oden, hmm, 20,

437
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,680
tried to break into a pancake pantry restaurant in Nashville

438
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,140
in September after hours, threw an air duct on the top of the building

439
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,180
for a reason about which police could only speculate.

440
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,400
Because the duct was caked with grease,

441
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,040
he slid down faster than he expected and became snagged in the vent

442
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,220
with his arm lodged tightly under his neck, strangling himself to death.

443
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,060
And that's what you get, friends, if you try to rob the pancake pantry.

444
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,340
Bobby Joe Reed died in December.

445
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,420
In Taylors, South Carolina, of a seizure and cerebral hemorrhage

446
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:32,420
while having sex with his married girlfriend on the floor of her living room.

447
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,740
The frightened woman dragged Reed into her backyard,

448
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,840
then called police to report a prowler.

449
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,480
Reed still had his pants around his ankles when police arrived.

450
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,680
According to The Economist, a government scientist in Wales last year

451
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,540
discovered a way to grow four-leaf clovers after cracking the plant's genetic code.

452
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,500
He plans to start marketing them this year.

453
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Selling luck, dear friends. Can you imagine that?

454
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,780
Breeding four-leaf clovers.

455
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:12,360
It seems like that would flood the slackonomic plane,

456
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,480
the balance of the market with phylos of slack,

457
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,280
because there'd be too much luck, and it would cause a sort of a,

458
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,820
recession in slack.

459
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,940
There'd be too many stangs of pain, dear friends, too many stangs of pain.

460
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,480
To resolve a neighborhood noise dispute in San Luis Obispo, California,

461
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,140
municipal judge Donald Umhofer ruled in December that

462
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,760
the three basset hounds belonging to Bruce and Bridget Howey may bark

463
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,980
only once an hour for no more than two minutes at a time

464
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,500
and must remain silent from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.

465
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Aw, yes, dear friend, only in America can you try to legislate

466
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,900
the barking of three basset hounds.

467
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,240
However, the U.S. Treasury Department reported in September

468
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,440
that in the latest monthly tally,

469
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,260
oh, wait a minute, this was too good.

470
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,620
I'm going to have to switch to side two of your

471
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,900
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour Slack show,

472
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,680
so stay tuned, dear friends, for just a second

473
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,100
as we go to follow the horrible story of the U.S. Treasury Department

474
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,480
on side two of your Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour Slack show.

475
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,780
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

476
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,200
Ah, see, that didn't take long, did it?

477
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,140
It was easy.

478
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,480
You barely even noticed the time going by, did you?

479
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,460
And?

480
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,660
Oh, okay. Yeah, let's get back. What shall we put on?

481
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,780
I know. We'll put on some background music that I have no way of even guessing what it's going to be.

482
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,500
That sounds perfect.

483
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,620
The U.S. Treasury Department, dear friends, to continue with news of the weird from Chuck Shepard.

484
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,740
The U.S. Treasury Department reported in September that in the latest monthly tally,

485
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,900
it had received 22 contributions towards retiring the national debt.

486
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,460
People are sending in voluntary contributions to help, dear friends, the national debt.

487
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,220
They range from $5 to $45,344.

488
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:38,820
Since 1961, $20 million has been raised towards retiring our national debt.

489
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,880
Isn't that patriotic?

490
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,940
The national debt is currently $3.9 trillion.

491
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,480
That's about $15,000.

492
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,740
$15,000 per person.

493
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,820
That's what the government borrowed from you to pay somebody else.

494
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,240
Borrowing, taken from Peter to pay Paul, you might say.

495
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:13,520
In August, Wichita, Kansas, police reported that they suspected a man had beaten his three children with a board

496
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:20,300
because they had refused to wear red ribbons in support of anti-abortion protests.

497
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,340
Enough said.

498
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,960
You know, now that I think about it, I probably should take off that background music that we don't know.

499
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,920
We just don't know.

500
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:45,560
And every time I've ever put on a tape when I was in this studio that I thought was probably okay...

501
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,560
Ha ha ha ha.

502
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,500
Oh, here's a good least competent person story.

503
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,660
Latest negative cash flow robbery.

504
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:08,840
In Waco, Texas, a man held up a Circle K store after first diverting the clerk's attention by putting a $20 bill on the counter and asking for change.

505
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,480
Hmm, clever.

506
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:18,180
When the robber pulled a gun and demanded the entire contents of the cash register, the clerk put everything in a bag and handed it to the robber.

507
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,260
All $15.

508
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,880
The robber left the $20 bill on the counter as he fled.

509
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:35,580
In December, police in Genoa, New York, shot and killed farmer Rolf Rahn, 37, who had shot a plumber during an argument and then holed up for 16 hours.

510
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,740
Rahn claimed that he was an alien and the plumber an android and demanded that police provide him with a spaceship for his getaway.

511
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,200
Later, investigators discovered the remains of 50 cats in Rahn's freezer.

512
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,860
Some in plastic bags with labels indicating that their cause of death was because of a demon.

513
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:03,080
In September, after a stormy three-way surrogate mother-child custody hearing in Santa Ana, California,

514
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:15,240
Cynthia Moschetta, 51, walked over to her estranged husband who was meeting reporters and photographers, ripped off his toupee and fled the courthouse.

515
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,980
Poor Mr. Moschetta.

516
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,380
Hmm.

517
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:39,820
But in Huntington Beach, California, police Lieutenant Patrick Gildia reported in November that officers conducting an undercover drug purchase sting continued to make arrests of eager would-be customers even after the sting was over and large orange police signs were placed in the area.

518
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,380
Said Gildia,

519
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,640
We actually had people coming up and getting in line to buy cocaine.

520
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,180
When we had people under arrest.

521
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,180


522
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,520
And handcuffed.

523
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,960
Lying on the ground.

524
00:34:52,280 --> 00:35:03,440
Now that says, you know that stuff must just be so good, you know, for a person to not even see those police badges and things.

525
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,540
They just wanted to line up and get them some.

526
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,360
Well, we'll go away from news of the weird very briefly here I think.

527
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,160
And take a look at this little clip.

528
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,780
This is the latest UFO magazine, a forum on extraordinary theories and phenomena.

529
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:36,460
Oh, actually, before I go on too much further, I should give the address of news of the weird so that you can write for information on subscribing to that selfsame noble news service.

530
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,360
Got that pencil ready?

531
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:47,600
That address is news of the weird, Chuck Shepherd, Post Office Box 57141.

532
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,820
That's Box 57141, Washington, DC.

533
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,640
20037.

534
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,980
Amazing.

535
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,320
Oh.

536
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,200
I have made some observations.

537
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,120
And collected some data which you may find useful.

538
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:35,780
The British serial crop patterns, crop circles, are meant to fill us, the common men, the consumers, drones, controlled assets, with awe and wonder.

539
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:45,200
So that we accept the revelations to come from the ruling power structure, a consortium of interlocking cells within the worldwide intelligence agencies.

540
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,180
As they proceed.

541
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,880
And pursue their goal of acquiring power and dominion over the resources, politics, and economy of Earth.

542
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,160
The patterns herald the birth of a new religion.

543
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:11,060
A drawing upon the ancient nature religions of the Celtics, Madame Blavatsky, Alice Bailey, and the undisguised Aryan supremacist philosophy of the die hard Nazis.

544
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,740
Whose thinking dominates the aforementioned world intelligence agency.

545
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:24,360
These revelations to come, concern devices and techniques to extend the human lifespan.

546
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,180
Provide clean, economic, and low risk energy systems.

547
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,160
And strange and enormous flying machines.

548
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:45,460
Also, a new genetically engineered race of man will be revealed possessing many SEDAS, or miraculous powers, including telepathy, clairvoyance, and astral projection.

549
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,380
These messiahs, whom we can expect to see in the next few years stepping out of strange flying machines built in South America,

550
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:06,860
are in vitro offspring of Tibetan Buddhist masters, or ADEPTs, liberated from the advancing Red Chinese in the mid to late 1950s.

551
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:15,180
These holy men have been the focus of CIA research under the MKUltra program for more than 30 years.

552
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,720
Such occultists have been the focus of CIA research under the MKUltra program for more than 30 years.

553
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:16,720


554
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,140
Some of these holy men's faculties, to see and hear at great distance into hidden chambers of your enemy,

555
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,840
using the soul body, or etherec double, have immense covert surveillance potential.

556
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:38,500
Use of such psychic agents during wartime is a tradition as old as the Bible, Joan of Arc, and World War II.

557
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,380
Even today, psychics are employed to ascertain the positions of submarines.

558
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,660
Marines.

559
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,100
With this in mind, could we assume that the Men in Black are part of the MK-Ultra mind

560
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,820
control operation?

561
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:58,980
These Tibetan adepts may have been used as psychic interrogators or hitmen to intimidate

562
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,440
witnesses of military testing or advanced aerial devices.

563
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,100
Consider this also.

564
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,540
Beginning around 1986, British engineers who had secret clearances to SDI-related research

565
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,420
began to die in the strangest fashion.

566
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:19,980
A number of them working on Marconi Limited, a firm working on a Project Stonefish, a brilliant

567
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,160
anti-submarine mine, also the apparent subject of several mysterious deaths.

568
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,300
I propose that the patterns in the wheat fields are created by a product of SDI research,

569
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,380
an orbiting microwave maser featuring a narrow beam projection system.

570
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,920
It is now being demonstrated harmlessly in wheat fields, but could be used with devastating

571
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,840
force upon an individual targeted for assassination.

572
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,400
Or, if you wish, you could use it to destroy a building or a building in the middle of

573
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:43,400


574
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,440
a city or an entire neighborhood.

575
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,880
Notice that the 1987 time period witnessed the beginning collapse of the USSR.

576
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,660
Under the barrel of such a formidable weapon, what could they do but surrender?

577
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,600
The Iraq War, with the Americans unloading millions of tons of bombs on Saddam, seemed

578
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,660
so wasteful and ultimately useless.

579
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:07,820
Why throw away all those bombs and achieve so little militarily unless the whole, quote,

580
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,380
war, unquote, was a charade to unload a bunch of out-of-date inventory made by the US?

581
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,900
It's as if the only thing theyじゃあound even thought about was that the 1945 war was

582
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,680
��도 war because they were part of the traitor bomber corps.

583
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,460
Massacred as an American spy, they were forced to flee their jets, arrested labor, and never

584
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:28,040
рафle ked in front of the Al Weist School, which we'll talk about shortly.

585
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,920
Anyway, then you pick that up, and you know you can get a deal, and you know everybody

586
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:29,920


587
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,780
Up to now, you can do this kind of things, from two lynchpins to 30 그거 and from L but

588
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,280
time

589
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,360
You'll never rediscover what would be your name again if your Nummer turned into a

590
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,360


591
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,360


592
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,120
Great thanks.

593
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,400
on it one way or another.

594
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,420
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

595
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
When inside information is lacking,

596
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,540
sometimes the paranoid imagination

597
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,080
fills in.

598
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,020
Well, that may be so, dear friends.

599
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,000
It may be crazy

600
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,540
to think that

601
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,600
strange alien beings

602
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,480
from another world

603
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,000
have traded with our government.

604
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,200
But you know, dear friends,

605
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,520
here in Bob's world,

606
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,600
Bob's government's going to begin its rule.

607
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,300
Living in harmony,

608
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,840
harmony with nature

609
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,520
without any clothes.

610
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,900
Subgenius hedonism.

611
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,720
I mean,

612
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,400
let's look at this subgenius family.

613
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,880
What kind of life are these people enjoying?

614
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,640
Wouldn't you like to be one of them?

615
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,640
Why, yes, you say.

616
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,720
Look how healthy they appear.

617
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,860
If you were told that these people

618
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,480
had already lived thousands of years,

619
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,380
would you believe it?

620
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,100
Well, friends, Bob tells us

621
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
that the old will become young again

622
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,380
and the naked made neckeder

623
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,440
and so forth.

624
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,780
And he shows us how to achieve this

625
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,240
in our lifetimes.

626
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,820
You know, someday,

627
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,900
you're going to be walking down the mall

628
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,820
or the street.

629
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,700
One minute, everything's normal.

630
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,740
And then suddenly,

631
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,400
every fourth person is gone

632
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,740
and their clothing is just a heap on the ground.

633
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,240
And a couple of cars,

634
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,820
they'll veer,

635
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,000
driverless off up onto curbs

636
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,880
and into light poles.

637
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,060
But the main thing's going to be

638
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,460
those piles of clothing

639
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,940
dotting the streets.

640
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,740
Suddenly,

641
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,400
where people had been standing one minute,

642
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,860
it's just all those piles of clothes.

643
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,940
Where'd all those subgeniuses go?

644
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,460
What are we going to do without them?

645
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,660
Who's going to run the machine of the world

646
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,140
now that the subgeniuses are gone?

647
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:36,720
Well, friends,

648
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,340
you're now feeling the effect

649
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,780
of Satan and his demons

650
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,220
being hurled down to Earth.

651
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,420
What do you think those UFO crashes are?

652
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,660
The lie that the devil told Eve

653
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,900
just worked just like he planned.

654
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,960
And that's why they're doing those things to you.

655
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,580
So, friends,

656
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,220
loose living is a feature of Bob's world.

657
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,380
The greedy commercial system

658
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,540
has been cast out of the world

659
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,320
of good health care.

660
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:10,620
And the only thing that's left

661
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,580
is a healthy, free sinning.

662
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,280
Why did Jesus reject the subgenius life?

663
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,380
The answer is,

664
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,940
he didn't.

665
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,820
Exactly.

666
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,360
Not exactly.

667
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,960
Now, here you see

668
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,720
Christians refusing to worship

669
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,600
an image set up by a king.

670
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,920
But what would you as a subgenius do

671
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,540
if they were holding a gun to your head?

672
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,340
Well, you can just simply appear to worship it.

673
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,220
Don't be a martyr.

674
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,020
Don't let them string you up.

675
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,840
You can laugh at that false idol in your mind

676
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,420
or out the side of your mouth

677
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,340
to any fellow secret sinners

678
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,380
while you're saying that pledge or whatever.

679
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,760
The subgeniuses are allowed to bow down

680
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,140
before any false idol

681
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,400
if that is part of the path of least resistance.

682
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,760
When in Rome and all that.

683
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,180
Because, friends, subgeniuses are the true chameleons.

684
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,760
And vice versa.

685
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,320
So,

686
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,320


687
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,320


688
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,320


689
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,320


690
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,580
next week we're going to go into

691
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,420
details of survival, evasion, and escape

692
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,120
for the subgeniuses.

693
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,100
Ways to size up the situation and know what...

694
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,520
You know, because things are going to get really, really bad, dear friend.

695
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,100
You people have been sitting in your complacent armchair world

696
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,000
just joking about the end of the world

697
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,180
come July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning.

698
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,980
But you're going to need to know.

699
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,320
You're going to have to know.

700
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,320


701
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,880
Well, for instance, we're going to try to...

702
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,640
We're going to give you instructions about human traps

703
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,620
that you can make in the suburbs.

704
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,360
And the plans for these things are so cool looking.

705
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,380
It's like Wiley E. Coyote's little diagrams.

706
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,760
Bait that you can leave out.

707
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,100
Skewer hooks for the pinks.

708
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,920
The kind of things subgeniuses wouldn't care about.

709
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,700
Bait like Playboys and Porsches.

710
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,660
You subgeniuses watch out for...

711
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,300
You subgeniuses watch out for...

712
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,500
the other bait they leave out for us.

713
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,240
Oh, and how to use animals as weapons.

714
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,680
Without hurting the animals, of course.

715
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,760
Poisonous snakes, death adders, things like that.

716
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
We're starting our stores now.

717
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,600
And you should store up drugs, dear friends.

718
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,180
Because drugs will replace money in the end times.

719
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,900
Um...

720
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,440
Also bullets, guns, and food will replace money.

721
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,520
But drugs are the most stable bartering item

722
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,260
because they can't be counterfeit.

723
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,100
So if you're using drugs with a gun,

724
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,100


725
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,280
As we say, it's the...

726
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,340
The will to survive is all-important.

727
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,340
But I'm gonna switch to some more

728
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,560
lovely religious-sounding music here.

729
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,180
Because I wanna answer some of your questions

730
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,780
why we just had someone call in, saying,

731
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,500
Reverend Stang, I wanna hear more about

732
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,520
how the pinks and the normals

733
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,980
and all those I-hate veins

734
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,160
the others. I want to hear more about how they're all gonna fry in their own fat

735
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,760
like bacon in a pan on X day while we're saved. Well I've got I mean that's a

736
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,760
tantalizing possibility to savor and we talk as if that were the case in our

737
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,020
recruitment materials but friends it's not literally true that the pinks will

738
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:40,260
fry on in their own fat on X day. Now the bit about the chosen having front

739
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:46,380
row seats is certainly but actually almost everyone will survive if they

740
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,640
make it through that first week. In fact to tell the truth everybody's suddenly

741
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,540
gonna all be rich and they'll think the sub geniuses were stupid to leave. Oh

742
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:02,280
yeah especially since well the actual physical rupture process appears to

743
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,000
those who are left behind.

744
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:10,980
What looks kind of painful like a burning monk but but life on earth after

745
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,140
X day will be hell but it will be like a hell in slow motion kind of a slow

746
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:24,960
motion hell. It'll take humanity of time to realize just how what a terrible curse

747
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,280
it was to put technology of the Xists the men from Planet X in the hands of

748
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,580
humans especially humans.

749
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:43,220
You know for because for every man woman and child to suddenly have free will

750
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,780
given to him by the aliens and the wherewithal to exercise it as if by

751
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:54,200
magic the ultimate power without the ultimate slack your friends will produce

752
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,340
the ultimate nightmare.

753
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh yes oh yes and it gives you a vision that you can't see.

754
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm a million vengeful little geeky nerds given little Baron Harkonnen's given ultimate

755
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:22,300
power I can just see these I'm an over man these are my comic books. For those left behind dear

756
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:28,280
friends for those who didn't think ahead and have their subgenius membership card in their

757
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,160
pocket you better not lose that one in the laundry just before X day friends.

758
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,580
But for those who are chosen.

759
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,660
When you're lifted up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses dear friends

760
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,820
oh how great it art because every girl you ever had a crush on since elementary

761
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,840
school will be there and they'll all be madly in love with you although

762
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:00,860
everybody's sharing each other but there but because time has ceased to exist

763
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,360
there's no sense of possessiveness.

764
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:02,980


765
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,040
Dear friends just a sense of belonging.

766
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:15,900
Oh yes it's so so so lovely.

767
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:27,760
Well well I there's a little bit of readings there from the upcoming of Revelation X the

768
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,820
Bob Apocryphon.

769
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,740
You know I have trouble remembering from week to week which ones I've read from.

770
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:41,660
Next week we may cover the lifestyle of the Neanderthals or oh gosh.

771
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:53,800
Oh gosh there's just so much that could be done in Bob's world in Bob's lovely world

772
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,380
to come.

773
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,360
What else have I got here.

774
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:02,700
I you know I'd love to play you some more tape just so I could quit talking for a minute.

775
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:02,960
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

776
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:02,960


777
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:02,960


778
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:02,960


779
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:02,960


780
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,380
Well let's just try some.

781
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,960
Let's see what's happening over at the other radio station in Berkeley California with

782
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,780
puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

783
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,300
Yeah go ahead Howell.

784
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,620
Looks like we're still on the surface here.

785
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,540
Yeah but how long before those Huns spot us.

786
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,680
Okay looks like we've locked in.

787
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,620
We're going to have to get out of here.

788
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,980
The whole key was that we had the Enigma cipher.

789
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,520
If we hadn't Jerry might have made a mishmash out of our Atlantic fleet.

790
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,860
Life like spider.

791
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,720
Looks so real it's guaranteed to scare the wits out of anyone who's well spider sensitive.

792
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,340
A handmade replica of a gigantic vermilion spider.

793
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,980
Two feet long and ready to strike.

794
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:01,400
Watch it crawl closer and closer to your cowering spider phobe friends and then leap to sink

795
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,140
its poison fangs into their quivering flesh.

796
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,800
That's order number 4308 giant spider.

797
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:08,980
I agree.

798
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:25,160
Hey you you you you cut me off when I was doing that spider thing.

799
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,480
I was trying to finish that spider thing and you you you.

800
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,540
Just think to turn that switch off.

801
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,800
Why.

802
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,960
Well I hear you still got a tape recording of the old wiggletoes and downy butt visit

803
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,720
squeal thing.

804
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,240
Oh am I on.

805
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,260
Realistic life like snake crawls and strangles your friend as it crawls tighter and tighter

806
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,660
around his reeking neck.

807
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,340
That's order number 4295 python.

808
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,540
Snake the price of this item also is nine ninety eight.

809
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:11,200
Well you know we didn't hear Archbishop special effect we didn't know customer service we

810
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,860
set off on level eighty five.

811
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,040
There seems to be a malfunction.

812
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,720
How do you have to check this out.

813
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,220
Looks like somebody has broken security.

814
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,460
What are you talking about security genius office upstairs.

815
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,480
Oh you want me to stick my hands out.

816
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:28,740
Hey.

817
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,080
Now we want to dance.

818
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:31,440
OK.

819
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,300
Great deluxe double lock handcuffs.

820
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,760
Do you have a key to these things.

821
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,560
Yeah it's out in the car.

822
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,720
Top quality made in Europe to rigid security specifications.

823
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,440
It hurts.

824
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,000
Come on get the key.

825
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,700
Handsome non reflective black color much tougher to defeat because single hinge replaces

826
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,960
chain between cuffs.

827
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,600
It's a little bit too small for my wrists.

828
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,620
Each cuff locks independently of other and requires separate key.

829
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,720
Oh well I don't need to move my hands to read the key.

830
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720


831
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720


832
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720


833
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720


834
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720


835
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720


836
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,400
I don't need this next item.

837
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,760
I get the key.

838
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:00,980
Where.

839
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,860
You got.

840
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,080
Me that.

841
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,600
Who.

842
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:15,840
You.

843
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:15,840


844
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,420
The real.

845
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,060
Time.

846
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,580
Back.

847
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,120
Before.

848
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,300
The time.

849
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,240
You were thinking.

850
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,160
This.

851
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,700
Is.

852
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


853
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


854
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


855
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


856
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


857
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


858
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


859
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


860
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


861
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


862
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,700


863
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,780
God happened.

864
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,920
And you know what else happened?

865
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,780
It's that old time religion.

866
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,760
Religion of the bomb.

867
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,700
I know you want to know more about that old time religion.

868
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,340
But here's what you do.

869
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,880
You just write us a special postcard.

870
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:13,200
You just ask old Ouija man Bob for what you desire in your heart.

871
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,780
You just send us a black cat bone.

872
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,900
A little bit of that green.

873
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,020
And Bob Dobbs will answer all your questions.

874
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,700
You got that pencil ready.

875
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,140
For that old time religion.

876
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,640
You write to Bob.

877
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,160
That's it.

878
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:51,900
Post office box 140306.

879
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,320
Dallas, Texas 75214.

880
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:57,920
Ah.

881
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,160
Ah.

882
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,600
Ah.

883
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:58,680
Ah.

884
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,680


885
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,680


886
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,680


887
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,680


888
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,380
Ah.

889
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,380


890
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,840
And that just blesses my heart.

891
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,520
Yeah.

892
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,840
Because I smell something good, good, good.

893
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,480
Coming right around the bend.

894
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,880
I don't think you want to be here for it.

895
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,080
Because you only like your own, don't you?

896
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,820
That's box 140306.

897
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,680
Dallas, Texas 75214.

898
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,120
Dallas, Texas 75214.

899
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,700
And praise Bob for a dollar.

900
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,000


901
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,300
That old time religion.

902
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:57,980
An encounter one night while walking home from the tea with the essence of Bob.

903
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,680
This is from Bob.

904
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


905
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,700
This is from Bob's word.

906
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,460
From Nolan.

907
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:09,880
Really it was only the evening, but the days had gotten so short, and the skies so dark

908
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,760
by that time that it seemed and felt much later than it was.

909
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,200
Bob and the extraordinary virtues of Connie were on my mind.

910
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,520
There was a faint shimmer of filth on the concrete as I walked along, reminding me of

911
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,100
various mornings I had risen with a hangover.

912
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,560
It was moist and musky.

913
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,160
Like my mouth on those morns, emitting an odor just beyond palpable grasp, hinting at

914
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,400
something that was wrong, but not exactly identifying what.

915
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:41,460
I thought of how pink tonsils are, just as they come out of the gullet.

916
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:48,940
I trudged along the sidewalk, my bean boots making a soft squeaking noise, as though they

917
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,380
were sticking to the pavement.

918
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,640
Just a little bit.

919
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,100
I walked along thinking mostly of the particularly interesting noise my boots were making, not

920
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,320
even looking up from the pavement.

921
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:03,120
I looked at my feet, trying to identify the point at which the boots started squeaking,

922
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:08,200
and the last instant of seeming silence, or the first moment of actual sound.

923
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,140
I ignored the impact of the boot upon the sidewalk, near soundless as it was, concentrating

924
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,100
on the squishy sounding noise.

925
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,700
I thought even more about Connie.

926
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:24,240
I didn't even notice when someone or thing from a window above me threw or emitted something

927
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,280
towards the earth in my general direction.

928
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:32,140
It was a yellowish kind of substance, the color of lemon cream perhaps, with veins of

929
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,020
a dark solid looking brown running through it in a swirling pattern.

930
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,700
My first thought was that it could have been of extraterrestrial origin.

931
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,800
The impact of this substance upon my neck served as ample impulse to halt my forward

932
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,580
progress and divert my attention from my boots.

933
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,620
I reached a hand to my neck, dabbing it at the substance to see if it was as gross as

934
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,060
it felt.

935
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,960
It was sort of warm.

936
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,080
About the temperature of a five foot shoe.

937
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,340
I felt a little bit of a bowel movement at the moment it leaves.

938
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,560
There was a good deal of the goop too, perhaps a cup or so.

939
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,960
It began to dribble down inside the collar of the shirt I was wearing, so I decided to

940
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,380
enact the removal of the substance from my neck as soon as possible.

941
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:14,680
I looked around.

942
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,820
Luckily it was trash day.

943
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:23,000
I dug deep into the nearest container, and came up with a soiled, yet apparently absorbent

944
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,460
piece of cloth that someone no longer wanted.

945
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:32,100
I dabbed at the slime on my neck and managed to get what seemed a hefty parcel of it off.

946
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:39,080
Relieved, I rooted around some more and found a used nap that still smelled like disinfectant.

947
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,480
About a third of it looked clean, so I scraped the remainder of the glop from my bare skin.

948
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,860
I was now in dire need of something to get the rest of the stuff off my shirt collar.

949
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:55,440
I walked down the street a little way and found a jettisoned religious pamphlet.

950
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,440


951
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,440


952
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,440


953
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,440


954
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,660
I picked up the ball of refuse and perused the contents to see if there was anything

955
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,920
interesting on the sheet.

956
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:07,040
It was all lies about the state's supported Christian myth, so I scrubbed at the fabric

957
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,940
on my shoulders.

958
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,940
The foulness seemed to come off, at least enough so that I could continue on my way

959
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,220
home.

960
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,540
I tossed the pamphlet onto someone's porch as I went on my way, hoping they might glean

961
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,500
something from it.

962
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,100
I began thinking of the sounds my feet were making as they lifted away from the pavement.

963
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,320
Of the almost warm feeling the sound gave me.

964
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,420
I thought of floating in a warm bath, soap scum beginning to collect around the perimeter

965
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,140
of the tub.

966
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:39,020
I could almost see myself sleeping in front of a fire that had just surrendered its last

967
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,160
flickering embers to the inattention of a slumbering soul.

968
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:47,860
Then I felt the sticky aftermath of a slug between bare toes in a spring rain.

969
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,620
I knew Bob was speaking to me.

970
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,080
I got home and looked in the mirror.

971
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,020
There seemed to be a dull yellow.

972
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,180
Green stain on the side of my neck where the goo had been.

973
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,760
I scrubbed at it with some Ajax, but it did not go away.

974
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:05,120
I knew the mark of Bob was on me.

975
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:11,960
I knew that the roving corporate space god had been at the wrong place at the right time.

976
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,980
I felt a warm glow begin to spread down my jugu-

977
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,080
I must admit I was heating up a bunch of

978
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:49,080


979
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:49,080


980
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,100


981
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,100


982
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,100
