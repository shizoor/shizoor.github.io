Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except
that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.
Selling.

Yes.
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.
It's cool, man.
Cool.
And praise Bob and the whole world.
Oh.

I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.
That's the English translation of the lyrics for our Q&A and it was ê°™ì•„ìš” .
I really enjoyed this song because it caught you walkingcio specifically into this panorama
Ch Baldur Du B father.

This is my don't have to be a student to go Bilbao7 face slop eBay.
My mom does because that has outside of myives angle, vnity and turtleneye are real.
I don't know that my mom is shit, but that really is why I posted this diary on Instagram
as well, because I remembered to say hat and his best friend who's entire break in the
country.
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
When this angel heard
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine tree needles sting me
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much that smarts
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
Too tight, too tight
Too tight, too tight
And I'm gonna say to you
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him
Don't go walking down to the bar
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits
And in the right
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells
Till I get to bed
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here
Apple mango pie
You ain't no good of a child
That dog's running off with them brain cells
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.
It will empower this resistance.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.
It will be a baller for kids.
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two front teeth.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.
And he took all the presents from Whoville.
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.
But he couldn't.
He wanted tens and twenties.
Tens and twenties.
And he's, and he, he got McDonald's gift certificates.

He wanted an electric train
He had the whole thing on his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up
Santa Claus
Santa Claus
Santa Claus
He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.
The station and the gateman.
The mortar tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell.
The end of the year sale.
So come and get it everyone and just buy our products.
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the day?
Birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.
And sell everything to the pigs.
Oh yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season.
It was something else.

The Weirbobs and Ima,
those who have the psychosis that convinces them
that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the snow
on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus
and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors
and they just kind of float into the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me
told their kids that Santa Claus
bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
The kids were asking if their parents,
maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't
because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.
Let's see.

I sort of understand because...
I understood the way any old fool would understand.
There was no Jesus.
No flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.
It's not that you don't want to.
It's that they won't let you.
No, there's just a crime in wilderness.

And he would have that smile on his face.
But today, Christmas has lost its meaning.

Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth and a baby is born with a head that
glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it?
Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God, but merely one of the countless aliens that
visit the earth each and every day?
The answer?
Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube mark certainty in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!
The night Santa went crazy, the night Saint Nick went insane.
Realized he'd been getting the wrong heel, something finally must have snapped in his
brain.
Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to vomit.
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage.
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger.
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue glitzen.
And he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.
The night Santa went crazy, the night Santa went insane.
This grain go and done, now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole without stepping
in reindeer guts.
There's the National Guard and the FBI.
There's a van from the eyewitness noose.
And helicopters circling round in the sky.
And the bullets are flying, the body counts rising, and everyone gets gotten out.




Everyone's dying to know her Santa wife
My, my, my, my, my, my
You used to be such a jolly guy
So be good, for goodness sake

You better not cry
You better not pout

Who gave the Lord the Claptrap?
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?
My one good little thing
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season
The time of the Lord

How many before you reach your limit?
Jesus season
Jesuses?
Yeah, how many can you bag?
How many messiahs can you bag?
Hail Jesuses
If you're doing it in season
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit
Oh, you never do that
And you can only take one
You never bag the Lord in C, you bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound
But when they're in season, it's every god for himself
This is the season for the fighting Jesus, obviously
We are between a rock and a hard place
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?
And he got elephantiasis of the rectum
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars
Messy, messy, messy disease
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was
Well, I like the story
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West
I like when he moves into a trailer park and cowboys walk with his dog
Jesus!
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army
The Ranger, I like the Texas Ranger
Jesus, Texas Ranger
Johnny River was a Jesus
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus
Man
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal
Well, what about old peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois who was actually Huron, a Huron
You didn't know that, did you?
I got you!
Thin rye
Jesus!
Elrond
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen
Oh, it tastes like butter
A new Jesus, a different Jesus
It tastes like crappie
A future Jesus
A future Jesus
A pipe-smoking Jesus
Hey, Dave, you know where it is
Go kick that window open
I already kicked it, I'll kick it again, though
Kick it good this time
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God
We hope that we thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving
We appreciate all that and we're just trying to insult your fan club
That's all, that's why we do this blasphemous stuff
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?
Right, I could hear him say that
Praise God and Bob and Jesus
Next topic, terrorist insurance
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?
And science
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology
Listen to the sounds of hell
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked
Wrapped in wrapping paper
We're gonna break our necks
Gotta rock it!

Sleigh ride to heck
Sleigh ride to heck
Sleigh ride to heck
The elves are full of cheer
The kids are tucked in bed
Santa ain't coming
We're on a sleigh ride to heck
Their dreams are filled with toys
But they're out of luck
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to f**k

Santa is administering notices
Santa shows off his supreme gift
But army ends in a row
Santa is in a clean crew

Santa is grateful

only can accept somebody making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.
He has so much trust and faith in Bob. Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob. Now,
we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes, but we
subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so, not all,
by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals,
et cetera, in general, of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya,
South Africa, et cetera, if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about. Jesus and Bob, like we say,
our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus. It's just his fan club,
now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve, he's more like the smear on God's
handkerchief, just like you or me, but the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief,
uh-uh, no, because God's perfect. He doesn't even sneeze. We're made in his image, except that we
have all these nasty parts attached to us, and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom,
to do awful things, but God, oh, he's clean and pure.
According to them, oh, and he's male, but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff
out of him like we do, because we sin, oh yeah, we all sin, we're bad, we're worthless, we're no
good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent. We interrupt this program for a special
promotional announcement. We turn. He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this
message.

Just like the ones I used to know

When everyone can't find my life
