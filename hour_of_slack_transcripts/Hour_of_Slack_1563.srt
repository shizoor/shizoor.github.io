1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,720
Remain seated and come to order. The court is again in session.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,720
Your behavior, to say the least, has been most strange.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,440
I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating...

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,800
The self-genius power of...

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,560
What?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Your honor, this is preposterous.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:20,980
Yes!

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,820
I'm rational.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,280
Who else is pixelated?

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,860
Why, everybody is pixelated, except...

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,180
The self-genius power of...

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:30,980
What?

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,580
Your honor, this is absurd.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,460
It was twisted around to sound imbecilic.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,000
No objection.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,080
There's a theory that our universe is the creation of another universe...

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,460
Only one more hour to go.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,300
...that is a gigantic experiment in some kind of computer program.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,940
There is a...

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,740
Perfect.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,200
...exactly reputable theory for that.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,340
Not even a crank.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,320
That cuts it, hardware boy.

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:01,560
It's a business.

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,360
So that guy, you know, he may have been...

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,820
No skinny pink boy is going to tell me how to say things on my show.

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,320
What is that?

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,440
What sort of sound is that?

29
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:24,520
I should say in a video game, fanaticism consists in thinking some one matter so overwhelmingly important...

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,840
That it outweighs everything else.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,200
...that's what I feel.

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,880
I have the pain of 10,000 or three old men all the time.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,680
Really?

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,760
Yeah.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,220
I have nothing against Canadians.

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,680
Well, it's a different pain for men and Canadians.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,260
I'm playing Bob and Doug right now, as a matter of fact, to show my love for Canada.

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,220
What about us?

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,720
Get out.

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,840
You have what?

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,660
The wives of 10,000 or three old men.

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,160
10,000?

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,020
You're blowing the floor.

44
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,100
I'm blowing the floor.

45
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,280
Philo has the flatulation of them.

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,500
So, Hoser, what are you talking about?

47
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,480
We should probably put our clothes back on, huh?

48
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,460
Way to go.

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,700
Take a seat.

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,180
Okay.

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,120
No, that's optional.

52
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,740
Hoser, the flatulation of 10,000 arthritic old men.

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,740
Okay.

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,460
And they're wild.

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,140
And then...

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,020
Go pick your nose.

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,340
The acetic amino acids will be here tomorrow night!

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,060
Ah, yes, dear friends.

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,580
But tonight, you're listening to Hour of Slack number 1080, of which I am your host and prayer

60
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,940
partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

61
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,680
And we're going to continue with the part two of the show.

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,680


63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,680


64
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,680


65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,980
The amino acids are already inside of you now.

66
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,800
Yes, the amino acids are already inside of you now.

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,280
But this background music is, in fact, from their new album due out in June, Humanity

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Will Fall Like Hens.

69
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,500
But tonight's Hour of Slack show is a real Hour of Slack show.

70
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,480
It's got all the normal Hour of Slack, but it's from the abnormal station of KPFA from

71
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,280
January 10th, when we did a five-hour epic.

72
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,660
And it's from the abnormal station of KPFA from January 10th, when we did a five-hour

73
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


74
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,860
epic.

75
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,340
And that epic is part two, starring host Izzy Isn't and host Puzzling Evidence, both whose

76
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,860
shows we used up, with Dr. Howell, who actually arrived later in the evening, Philo Drummond,

77
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,300
yours truly reverend Ivan Stang, reverend John Shirley, Gary De Brogfran, Michael Pepe,

78
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:23,720
Princess Oui Ardoh, K Ausmic Bobcat Drummond, that's the new Mrs. Drummond, Phineas Narco

79
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,640
of NationalSynical.com, K Rod, Katie Koukos, it's gonna be a great show.

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,640


81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:35,060
Somebody named Walter and the uber-goober booby baby on keyboards, plus Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh.

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,800
And so, let us go into that very world.

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:51,980
Reverend Sting, I have to return to my apocalyptic theme because I am the purveyor of the signsofwitness.com website.

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,940
You know, I'm reporting for it. I've got to ask you this. What will the apocalypse be like?

85
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:06,680
You know what the party is going to be like a little bit before, but when the actual end comes, could you describe a little bit what it would be like?

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,380
Well, it will depend on how...

87
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,940
Besides a blessed relief, I mean.

88
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:19,920
Well, individuals who never irritated any subgeniuses in any way during their lives will have it much easier than those who...

89
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,260
Are we going to go back to the end of all these horses?

90
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,780
No, because they're...

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,280
They'll die instantly, practically.

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:39,180
The ones that at some point in their lives irritated a subgenius or inconvenienced one, however inadvertently, will see the pains associated with hell.

93
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:46,240
The Dante-style hell, as well as modernized versions of subgenius history.

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,540
This could be a widespread belief. Just think how quickly you'd go through the airport, through security.

95
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,660
Oh, it's Reverend Sting.

96
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,260
Going right through.

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,580
You know, oh, you'd have to be...

98
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,300
Wouldn't you like to sit in first class, Reverend Sting?

99
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,200
Oh, well, there won't be airports after the end.

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,920
Well, there may be airports, but there'll be the kind of airports where you're waiting in line with 5,000 other people for...

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,100
And there will be radio like this one.

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,900
You'll have to do this show 24 hours a day because there's nothing else to listen to.

103
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,060
We'll hate it.

104
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,160
Gotta throw it up for the Barcelona.

105
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,260
Nightmare.

106
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,800
Just like us.

107
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,320
That was the way it used to be.

108
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,280
There was nothing but this show for 24 hours a day.

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,120
And how far we have fallen.

110
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,160
It's only eight or five hours a day now.

111
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,960
People will pay for the show.

112
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,880
I only do this show about an hour and a half a day.

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,460
You can only abuse your body most of the time.

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,060
Michael Jackson.

115
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,740
Michael Jackson.

116
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,460
Michael Jackson.

117
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,320
Michael Pepe.

118
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,920
Michael Jackson.

119
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,220
Michael Jackson.

120
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,760
Michael Jackson.

121
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,900
Michael Mann.

122
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,920
Michael Jackson.

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Michael Jackson.

124
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,860
Michael Jackson.

125
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,080
Michael Jackson.

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,180
Michael Jackson.

127
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,020
I know, I am Michael Jackson.

128
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,020


129
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,220
Yeah.

130
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,240
He does what the hell he does.

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,420
I don't care.

132
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,520
I Tomato loved that short movie.

133
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,160
And I'm hard off.

134
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,160


135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,160


136
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,480
I like the album.

137
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
I S reward that.

138
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,100
I don't a Muse.

139
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't act like an iron.

140
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,560


141
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,880
I listen to it.

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,280
My leg.

143
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,480
I don't like it.

144
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,240
My Grandpa.

145
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,180
It's just not you, Gary.

146
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,280
You know, Gary, that hair, it's just not you.

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
It's just not me.

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
It has a life of its own.

149
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,460
Those shoes, those just aren't you, Gary.

150
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:33,900
Not you.

151
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,960
They're not you, Gary.

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,660
You know, it's getting so the teenage girls only grab the bottom half of my hair now,

153
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,260
and they leave the top half alone.

154
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,280
What do you think that means?

155
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,540
It's growing farther down toward your crotch.

156
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,520
That's a little hint.

157
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,580
The rest of you are all cots.

158
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,640
Just a subtle hint.

159
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,360
Faces in the crowd.

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,780
Just a scruttle hint.

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,180
Nine to five, no button.

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,460
It's their way of saying, not you, Gary.

163
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,640
Are you here?

164
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,820
You're the guys that read shirts on Star Trek.

165
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,540
Get out!

166
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,580
You haven't seen Idiocracy yet?

167
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,940
No, I have not seen Idiocracy, although you're the third person in about two days to mention it.

168
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,340
I just, as soon as it's downloadable, I'm sure I'll have a copy.

169
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,200
It is downloadable.

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh, well.

171
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
Well, as soon as I'm home, I'll download it.

172
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,300
Let's just watch it now.

173
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,780
From my favorite channel.

174
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,940
Which channel is it on?

175
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,320
Don't play it with your brother.

176
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,960
I don't know, but they have the Fox News channel on it.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
It's 500 years in the future.

178
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,140
Oh, cool.

179
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Hello, baby.

180
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,120
Well, my favorite channel is alt.binaries.movies.givics.

181
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,420
Yes, it's on there.

182
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,400
That's one of those non-pay channels.

183
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,480
Hello, baby.

184
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,340
Hello, baby.

185
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,580
That's the Drummond family in the background.

186
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,920
That's all they do is they spoil, they talk to their baby.

187
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,400
Hello, baby.

188
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,180
Hello, baby.

189
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Hello, baby.

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,020
That's Philo's rant now.

191
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,900
The baby has a very powerful mind and it has taken them over completely.

192
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,480
It has, actually.

193
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,980
That baby might as well be running there.

194
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,440
They'll drop everything they're doing just for that baby.

195
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,080
Baby!

196
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,920
Why do they say sleep like a baby when babies wake up every two hours?

197
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,380
Tall.

198
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,220
To take an example.

199
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
One of the misfits.

200
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,800
I suppose there will be some people who dislike it when they attribute it to babies and not the cats.

201
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,060
It means that stuff runs out of your mouth and you're both ends while you're sleeping.

202
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,880
But if you fall.

203
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,040
That's what sleep like a baby really means.

204
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,920
It means you have to be cleaned up after the sleep.

205
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,080
It was so atrocious.

206
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,540
Princess Gwee has just walked in but seems not to have her own microphone.

207
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,680
Or even a chair.

208
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,740
Lady just entered the room, boys.

209
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,580
I'm shortly about to take the next rocket out, in fact.

210
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,720
I've been holding the fort.

211
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,820
There's a chair in there.

212
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,500
You can go sit if you dare to sit next to Phineas and Arko.

213
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not going.

214
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,260
I'm not going.

215
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,180
Yes, Princess Wee Ar Do.

216
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,960
Please.

217
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm the queen of all the UFOs.

218
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,520
But only the unidentified O's.

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,220
Could she intercede for us when the UFOs come in the next day?

220
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,280
Could we fall to our knees in front of her and beg her to intercede so that they don't turn us in?

221
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,380
No, because when they come then they're no longer unidentified.

222
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,460
You know what I'm saying?

223
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,140
What is her relationship with known objects?

224
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,620
That's the drawback to being that particular kind of queen.

225
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,400
Identified flying objects then.

226
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah, what about known flying objects?

227
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,380
She's got no... those are out of her jurisdiction.

228
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,180
Really?

229
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,560
Those aren't her responsibility.

230
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,240
Wanna play with me?

231
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,360
Uh huh.

232
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,740
It's the 60's.

233
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,540
Have I done something wrong?

234
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,400
Bob's still in college.

235
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,700
Where's Glass Madness to sing a little Bob song?

236
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,660
I'm Bob better than you're Bob cause you're Bob sucks.

237
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,460
He sucks so bad.

238
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,240
We all slack Bob.

239
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,100
He can kiss my wallet goodbye.

240
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,640
La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

241
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,040
That sucky little Bob.

242
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,680
So bad, sorry.

243
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,860
Hey, we both can.

244
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,760
All praise the moon.

245
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,920
You'll have to buy the price.

246
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Did I hear a little tiny collar?

247
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,820
A teeny teeny tiny collar.

248
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,660
Where will we be a more?

249
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,500
Boy, boy, boy.

250
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Can I help you?

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,600
Hi, how are you?

252
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm good.

253
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,600
Oh, Brad Smith.

254
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,960
This guitar will do anything.

255
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,800
Watch it play me.

256
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,900
Watch the mini-chopper.

257
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,260
Not you, Gary is playing the guitar by rubbing it just against the Harrison's face.

258
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,440
Which are like guitar picks.

259
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,740
Oh, I get it.

260
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,420
Yeah.

261
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,260
Well, okay.

262
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,180
Never mind, not all with us.

263
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,180


264
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,180


265
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,300
Wa- الذي army Brister-

266
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,960
F comunque.

267
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
Whom everyoneねr bewusst?

268
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,880
Century pub!

269
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,500
Man.

270
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,320
creams.

271
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,080
Tea break.

272
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,720
Never mind, go smoke.

273
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:34,720


274
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,780
You gonna throw that hop out loud?

275
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,860
Lucky for you, a gas, hot summarize.

276
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,660
It still ashes, each for a pint.

277
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,020
Oh,okay thank you.

278
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,360
We'll see you at the pub for the coffee, at a bar.

279
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,520
I hear the ocean

280
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,240
and I hear my

281
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,940
tinnitus

282
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,440
hey guess what you guys I've learned that I'm losing

283
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,140
my hearing

284
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,000
they always do that

285
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,080
they cannot help themselves

286
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,320
well should we yell louder or what

287
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,120
yeah that actually helps

288
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,520
quite a bit

289
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,380
you have headphones volume controls under the desk

290
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,280
there the little knobs

291
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,740
they don't turn it up

292
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,320
they don't nearly

293
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,380
turn it up high enough but it's better than nothing

294
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,700
well it's

295
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,480
it's not the jacks

296
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,280
or the headphones or even

297
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,720
the show it's unfortunately

298
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,740
my

299
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,220
ears you know I'm really

300
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,740
really really old

301
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,160
well you're mighty close to an electric guitar

302
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,400
right now I'd watch out

303
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,840
yeah that's part of the

304
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,440
problem too many years spent filming

305
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,460
my friends bands

306
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,600
standing in front of the speakers

307
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,160
and now I hear these

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,980
these crickets all the time

309
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,460
I used to think they were real crickets

310
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,780
I moved to Ohio in the dead of winter

311
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,720
princess we would say listen hear that

312
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,460
I go yeah I hear the crickets

313
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,800
what kind of vehicle did you use to move to Ohio

314
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,740
is there a history of this

315
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,380
we used

316
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,760
we used slaves actually to haul

317
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,460
bobbies

318
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,060
the church building itself

319
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,200
you must have got out just in time

320
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,140
brick by brick and that's what we used to do

321
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,140


322
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,140


323
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,140


324
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,140


325
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,020
this was Texas under George Bush

326
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,440
before

327
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,160
so it wasn't that expensive

328
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,320
you know it wasn't

329
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,360
the unions were still

330
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,020
out of

331
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,120
they weren't there yet

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
we were able to move the church

333
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,180
stone by stone

334
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,820
so to speak as it were

335
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,720
brick by brick

336
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,440
floppy

337
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,080
disc by floppy disc

338
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
did you move your frock brick by brick

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,060
or did you weave it

340
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
it was sort of like Easter Island

341
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,720
we moved the frock

342
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,400
which bathtub full by bathtub

343
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,260
when they moved the building

344
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,420
they found something horrible underneath it

345
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,540
over there

346
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,000
and I named my frock

347
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,780
festering

348
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
a festering expressence

349
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,200
and Spomam pachal all those years

350
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,940
Dr. Drummond finally arrived

351
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,880
I heard he's just wheezed tackle

352
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,060
actually I've been here just now for a while

353
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,620
lurking about listening and calculating

354
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,000
as it were

355
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
I've been repositioning my monitors

356
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,760
been recalibrating my whistle

357
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,080
we're swinging as we pucker

358
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,000
we're pinging and swuckering here

359
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,760
you're swucker and pingerin

360
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,460
yeah that's how you feel

361
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,440
the world's

362
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,220
alright well in that case

363
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,160
I gotta get my

364
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,280
wall wart

365
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,260
here you go

366
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,500
I have a wall wart

367
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,620
and I didn't say Walmart

368
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,060
but I said wall wart

369
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,700
welcome to Walmart

370
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,600
I love you

371
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,240
so I'm just gonna say

372
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,480
you know

373
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,700
look a price fell

374
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,980
how long will it be before all of us are working as greeters at Walmart

375
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm gonna get a job there real soon

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,280
Walmart world

377
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,200
I already am

378
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,340
I know I can get a job there

379
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,840
cause that will meet my standard of brain power

380
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
well they don't P test you there

381
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,540
at Walmart

382
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,320
that's one thing about it

383
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,760
I mean they may not pay you well

384
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,300
or give you any benefits

385
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,360
but they don't P test

386
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,580
they don't welcome to Walmart

387
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,380
they do

388
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,760
yes and after 20 years they give you a shirt

389
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,420
what if they give you a shirt and don't pee

390
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
want a cart

391
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:41,620
no

392
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,200
you can live in that place and they'd never know

393
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
people do

394
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,760
I do

395
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,780
people do

396
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,300
but do they give you a sincerity test

397
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,660
there's plenty of food

398
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,680
what fluid did they take out for a sincerity test

399
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,020
there's a mattress department

400
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,560
I don't know but it comes out of the base of your skull

401
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,320
toilets open all night

402
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,140
snack food galore

403
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,300
TV's

404
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,700
his sincerity fluid is slightly too viscous

405
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
TV's DVD's CD's

406
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,800
Dr. Drummond would have to use somebody else's

407
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,260
I'm totally depleted on the sincerity solution

408
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,800
clothing you never run out of clothing in Walmart

409
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,020
in fact I was going to try to get a depletion allowance for my lack of sincerity

410
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,840
if you were living in Walmart you'd be home now

411
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,980
I've got some synthetic

412
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,380
the Reverend John Shirley

413
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,860
I think it should be worth some kind of government subsidy

414
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,400
the Piss Baptist must go on about his Piss Baptist duties

415
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,680
you know there are 10,000 people lined up in the Grand Canyon waiting for me

416
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,560
and I'm a sincerian

417
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:54,420
there's an enormous vat next to the Grand Canyon that I use to keep my fluids and the other fluids replenished and flowing

418
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,960
and everybody is very grateful

419
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,000
let John Shirley's mercy rain down

420
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,340
you know the Forest Service is not allowed to say how old the Grand Canyon is

421
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,240
that's what I've heard yeah

422
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,880
they're not allowed to say this

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,740
they said they were going to change that policy

424
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,080
they were going to stop selling that book about how the Grand Canyon is only 4,000 years old

425
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,440
they haven't done it

426
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,400
because that would infringe on the rights of creationists

427
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,040
to state theories of ancient science

428
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,800
well I'm really hungry my stomach is rumbling

429
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,740
I read in the newspaper that 29% of Americans find this hard to believe

430
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,120
but some new survey 29% of Americans believe that the sun revolves around the earth

431
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,940
it doesn't?

432
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,040
are you saying it doesn't?

433
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,840
okay 29.01 I guess

434
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,400
it sounds believable to me

435
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,440
I mean I can believe in a supernatural being that's been around since the beginning of time

436
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,500
with no evidence at all

437
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,720
why can't I believe in something as equally believable as this?

438
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,260
I mean what do you think?

439
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,560
I mean that's what I'm saying

440
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,120
you can believe anything you want to believe

441
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,800
you can be what you won't

442
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,200
you can believe what you want too

443
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,480
anything you want because when you grow up you can do anything you want

444
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,140
I'm very proud of you young man

445
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,320
my stomach is really rumbling

446
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,980
I know it's playing a rumba

447
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,360
do what thou won't

448
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,640
do what he won't

449
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,700
you've heard do what thou wilt shall be the whole of history

450
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,000
the whole of the law

451
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,180
but for the subjeetists it's do what they won't shall be the whole of the law

452
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,660
do what Jesus won't

453
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,380
do what they won't

454
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,560
the engine of the train

455
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,020
you will

456
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,220
weighs something like 80,000 tons

457
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,320
they won't but you will

458
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,100
what would Jesus not do?

459
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,680
who would Jesus do?

460
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,400
I forget the actual weight but it's

461
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,160
Magdalene this year

462
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,680
WWNJ

463
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,280
NDJ

464
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,500
I've been drinking now and it's dead

465
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,960
GWBBQ

466
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,040
they won't

467
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,820
surely not

468
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,680
I'm just making a great fan of myself

469
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,260
Princess Weah

470
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,980
and her throne is ready

471
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,180
if somebody wants to get in

472
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,980
her throne and her sacred microphone is ready

473
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,200
you know it turned out Princess Weah was actually the daughter of Darth Hater

474
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,500
the Doctor Doom

475
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,600
the Doctor Singer from outer space?

476
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,740
no, Doctor Doom was one of those guys

477
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,060
one of those ass guys

478
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,840
amino acids

479
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,300
you're right

480
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,300
I'm going to escort the fist Baptist to his limousine helicopter

481
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,520
doing the show is sort of like trying to jump on a big man's plane

482
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
dear friend

483
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,280
I'm going to escort the fist Baptist to his limousine helicopter

484
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,380
just before I go to bed

485
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,360
I know that you think that sounds funny

486
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
security 5 report

487
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,900
ok now I've got some catalogs here I want to read from

488
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,160
do you have my catalogs ready?

489
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm ready to recite my catalog copy now

490
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,260
this is Charles Collins an accountant from the British Columbia

491
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,260


492
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,380
a testing laboratory in Houston Texas

493
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,980
this is the sound of the future

494
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,160
the switches have just been turned

495
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,400
there was already so much money in it

496
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,700
and a human being is about to receive an outer signal

497
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,580
that many fingers with lots of neurons

498
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,000
that will never wrinkle or decay

499
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,240
have you ever asked yourself how much money you have?

500
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,820
how much are major companies willing to pay you

501
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,200
to create a show like this one?

502
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,860
it's true

503
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,920
from health supplements to credit cards

504
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,300
they do it because it's good

505
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,720
and it can bring in millions

506
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,700
this is like a dream come true

507
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,640
I have a retired lifestyle and 39 bucks to spend

508
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,740
I'm going to go to bed

509
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,740
I'm going to go to bed

510
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,640
but I didn't care

511
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,160
remember there's no risk

512
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,140
no risk

513
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,900
after a while

514
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,420
I'm going to go to bed

515
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm going to go to bed

516
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm going to go to bed

517
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,020
I'm going to go to bed

518
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,740
I'm going to go to bed

519
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,180
but I'm not going to sleep

520
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm just going to let go of my hair

521
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,140
I let go of my hair a long time ago

522
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:29,880
I see it like ever increasingly disharmonious

523
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,500
push even more

524
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,320
ever. So I

525
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,540
decided along with my $10,000

526
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,520
to check

527
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,700
in to the local

528
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,340
I was reading Bob's

529
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,200
note and there

530
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,280
I found out that he was a great guy

531
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,060
and a very successful

532
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,100
copywriter.

533
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,300
You'll be hearing a lot about him once you

534
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,620
start our new program.

535
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,940
Oh yes, I

536
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,240
almost forgot.

537
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,820
How can you

538
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,060
swiftly can you change your career?

539
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,780
Fuck a bitch.

540
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,440
Fuck a bitch.

541
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,740
What's she doing?

542
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,580
What's she doing?

543
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,640
What's she doing?

544
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,860
What's she doing?

545
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:38,860


546
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:38,860


547
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,880
Oh my god, this is

548
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,500
still going on.

549
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
Okay, alright, alright.

550
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,440
We arranged the

551
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,580
show now.

552
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,460
We just, the show

553
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,480
can start now because we are rearranging.

554
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,460
We arranged the studio

555
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,420
into three

556
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,340
sectors. There's two sectors

557
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,120
for married

558
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,760
people and their children

559
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,420
and then there's the main room which is for

560
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,260
the lonely

561
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,080
geeks.

562
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,820
Phineas,

563
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,820
Don Joyce,

564
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,800
Puzzle

565
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,740
and Sad, Old Bachelors.

566
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,940
Weeping.

567
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,120
Weeping.

568
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,180
You can hear them

569
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,480
weeping.

570
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,780
I'm hollering.

571
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
This is turn time.

572
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,280
Three hundreds of years ago.

573
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,800
You should do these

574
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
high good reputation

575
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,280

576
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,300
requiring nut.

577
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,520
You know,

578
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:40,780
you got your

579
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,580

581
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,060
You have got new

582

583
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
till seal with

584
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:45,720


585
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:45,960
Yeah,

586
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,380
with all

587
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,860

588
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,100

592
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,720

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:51,540
program

595
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,220
robot.

596
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,900
He said

597
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,240
more

598
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,900
text

599
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,160
operator

600
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,160


601
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,240

602
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,840
site

603
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,260
and

604
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,680
on

605
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,280
bedroom là

606
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
ok, wait.

607
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,800
I suppose,

608
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,060
Pills! Leave my pills alone!

609
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,940
He's just like Philo.

610
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,120
Bishop Joey is just like Philo.

611
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,060
He reached in, he just transgressed my personal space.

612
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,440
Violated!

613
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,700
He violated me. I feel raped.

614
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,040
And it was good, too. I loved violating your personal spaces.

615
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,880
I feel raped.

616
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,760
I feel used.

617
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,540
Yeah, because we here at the one pretty true church,

618
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,840
the first church of the last life, kicks the subgenie's ass every time.

619
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,920
Listen to that fake Texas accent.

620
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Every time.

621
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
That is the fakest southern accent.

622
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,780
That's so fake. Oh, you look at these boots. Smell the bottom of my boots.

623
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,580
That's the fakest smelling cow hockey I ever smelt.

624
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,580
Well, just look at my...

625
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,500
Is that my tinnitus or is that the show?

626
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,360
It's the show, dear. It's just the show.

627
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,820
It's gotten to where my hearing, really, it's true, my hearing's gotten so bad

628
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,720
that Princess Wee has to translate for me.

629
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,140
And she plays tricks on me by mistranslating things.

630
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,640
The waitress says, that'll be $30.

631
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,280
And Princess Wee says, she says she wants to have a three-way.

632
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,000
And then I end up humiliated and embarrassed.

633
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,200
And they all think it's funny.

634
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,520
People make fun of old days.

635
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,120
F-persons like myself.

636
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,740
Now, I don't want to forget my students

637
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,180
and the subgenius how to make your own cult,

638
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,040
do's and don'ts.

639
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,480
Ah, K-Rob has arrived.

640
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,880
The mighty K-Rob.

641
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,340
That means that sound quality may improve.

642
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,300
Uh-huh.

643
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,200
Listeners, there is hope.

644
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,040
Undoubtedly.

645
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,840
What is that?

646
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,920
Oh, no, Michael Pepe.

647
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,460
As I suspected.

648
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,740
Michael Pepe.

649
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,200
Michael Pepe even arrived.

650
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,340
That means the station will be on the air for another half an hour or so

651
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,960
before the Pepe effect works in.

652
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,240
Before we're publicized.

653
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,940
Pepe kind of looks like Philo's new daughter.

654
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,920
Michael Pepe has a new...

655
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,060
This is Philo's daughter.

656
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,760
No, that's Philo, not his daughter.

657
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,920
Philo's daughter.

658
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,400
Philo's daughter is the...

659
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,520
One with the mutton chops in the other room.

660
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Yes, Dr. Drummond and Mrs. Chaos McBobcat

661
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,920
have brought their baby,

662
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,940
their new infant child, Michael Pepe.

663
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,180
You can hear it crying now.

664
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,380
Pardon me, Michael.

665
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,320
I'm in headphones and you're not on a mic,

666
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,380
so I can't...

667
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,460
Nothing makes any...

668
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,760
He said something about how many eyes does it have.

669
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,820
I want you to take it out.

670
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Only three.

671
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,080
Let me...

672
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,260
Actually, my nephew, Alex, today, asked a question.

673
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,680
He seriously asked me,

674
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,980
hey, if you had three eyes, would you be able to see the fourth dimension?

675
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,920
And I said no, because the fourth dimension isn't something that you see.

676
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,120
So eyes are not the sense organ you need.

677
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,760
Your time sense would be able to...

678
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,720
Except you smell in the future.

679
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,220
Somehow.

680
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,220
Isn't the future a sense of smell?

681
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,080
Well, you see the fifth dimension...

682
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,740
Well, they broke up.

683
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,980
The fifth dimension, I think, broke up.

684
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,440
The fourth dimension broke up.

685
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,300
What is that noise in the background?

686
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,380
Is that the show?

687
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah, it's puzzling evidence.

688
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,380
He puts on weird things and he leaves.

689
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,100
Michael Pepe, you have to get on a microphone for anyone to hear you.

690
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,920
Including me.

691
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,420
I'm deaf now.

692
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,900
So I've been reading your lips so far, but the radio audience can't hear that.

693
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,140
He thinks I'm joking.

694
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,520
These kids these days, they just walk around like zombies.

695
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,160
We just cussed each other out in sign language.

696
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,480
Hey, I learned sign language the other day.

697
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,800
The sign...

698
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,080
Okay, radio listeners, the sign for sex is this.

699
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,420
And the sign for...

700
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,320
Bunghole.

701
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,920
Cactus is this.

702
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,180
Spiky, spiky.

703
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,340
So when you see somebody, you want to have kinky sex with them.

704
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,960
You go like that and then spiky, spiky.

705
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,380
The sex symbol, of course, is the old temple of Devo with the finger.

706
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,280
That's the formal, polite way of saying sex.

707
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,660
Now, if you turn your fingers around like this, that's butt sex.

708
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,280
Or in 69, it's like that.

709
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,180
The sex symbol, friends, is actually two...

710
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,300
Two fingers of each hand tapping together on the end.

711
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,620
Like if you made two little figures that could walk along the tabletop using your fingers.

712
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,600
You put those two figures together and tap them together.

713
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,900
Yeah, but Uranus is not a planet.

714
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,300
Uranus is not a planet.

715
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
My anus is.

716
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,940
You have to get on a microphone, Michael, or it doesn't really...

717
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,460
Nothing you say really exists.

718
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,820
Is that Michael Poupe?

719
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,360
No, Michael.

720
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,160
My student...

721
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,080
My student that's listening...

722
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,580
Is that Michael Poupe?

723
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,200
Give me the hook.

724
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,940
Get the hook.

725
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,900
Get the hook.

726
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,980
Maybe logic.org class, online class in the Church of the Subgenius,

727
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:42,980
should know that this is the subgenius business meeting.

728
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,640
Michael Pepe's here, so I have to hook myself up.

729
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,300
Business meeting.

730
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,160
Well, what is the business?

731
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,240
The business is...

732
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,300
We're trying to untangle the truth.

733
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,480
The true history of the Church.

734
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,400
Bob assigned us to do a commission to study the...

735
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:10,060
What went wrong during the previous Church administration.

736
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,060
The previous administration of the Church made many mistakes,

737
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,580
and we're trying to delineate what happened decade by decade since...

738
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,920
Well, for the last hundred years.

739
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,380
Yeah.

740
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,580
And then what happened?

741
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,280
The bad karma having to do with the elimination of the Gary Factor.

742
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,940
Once Gary was eliminated...

743
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,040
Well, it's not you Gary to finally add it up to where the Church is going to suffer badly.

744
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,540
And right now...

745
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:46,920
Actually, that started several years ago on July 7th, 1987,

746
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,160
when Gary stormed out of the studio saying,

747
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,560
I've had it with you guys.

748
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
Manic. Manic.

749
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,300
Don't call me that.

750
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,420
Don't call me.

751
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,560
I'll call in the shot.

752
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,820
I remember that.

753
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,200
That was the funniest thing he ever did.

754
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
That was.

755
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,680
I hated to say that, but I'm glad you just put that out on the table,

756
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:15,800
because I wanted to comment on that, but I really didn't want to be the one to bring the subject up.

757
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,220
I thought it was a great pitch.

758
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,000
Now, one point of contention is when exactly was J.R. Bob Dobbs born?

759
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:33,120
Some say that it was in the early 20s, but we're looking now at 1927 or 1929.

760
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,560
It was a midnight clear.

761
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,220
We know that.

762
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,220
Bob was born in the late 20s.

763
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,580
Yeah.

764
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,460
We know it was on a midnight clear, and we know that it was in a cheap motel.

765
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,680
How else could they land?

766
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,420
We know that in 1945, Bob killed Hitler again.

767
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,980
And he met Philo in 1927.

768
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,600
He met Philo in 1950 in college.

769
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,040
Well, you know that means I'm old.

770
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh, yeah.

771
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,760
Yeah, Gramps.

772
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:14,960
Now, in 1953, Bob was immaculated, and the countdown to X-Day began.

773
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,700
Unfortunately, it ended prematurely.

774
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,100
Lunch.

775
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,640
And had to start again.

776
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,960
But we don't know where to start exactly, because we don't know where to start.

777
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,880
We don't know where it ends.

778
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,900
Welcome to school.

779
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,180
I'm Principal Bob McKenzie.

780
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,020
In 1955, Bob had his second pre-vision.

781
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
My Vice Principal Doug.

782
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:44,000
And in 1956, Princess Wea was born.

783
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,900
When did Bob get sterno, Craig?

784
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,320
1955.

785
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,800
1955, sterno was pregnant?

786
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,580
1955.

787
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,940
Oh, wow.

788
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


789
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


790
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


791
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


792
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


793
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


794
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


795
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


796
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


797
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


798
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


799
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


800
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


801
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


802
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


803
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


804
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


805
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:53,940


806
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,040
And then eight years later, Jane was born.

807
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,580
Oh, that's right.

808
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,200
That's right.

809
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,100
It says so here.

810
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:13,460
In 1957, some bad boys got me to sit on a cactus by telling me it was the king's throne.

811
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,380
Those evil, evil bastards.

812
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:23,920
And my parents spent the afternoon pulling tiny cactus spines out of my, out of my, out

813
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:23,920


814
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:23,920


815
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,400
of my house behind.

816
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,160
You're lucky you didn't have my parents.

817
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,120
They pounded the X spice into my body.

818
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,700
Well, I was, I was spoiled.

819
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,260
I'll admit it.

820
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,480
I was a spoiled child.

821
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,240
Okay.

822
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:44,820
In 1959, Bob started producing movies like...

823
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,240
Is this KPFA or is it DC?

824
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,140
Attack of the Giant Shrew People.

825
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,900
It's K-P-O-M-A-N-C-Y.

826
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:53,900


827
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:53,900


828
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,100
mama.

829
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,980
I didn't get that criticism.

830
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,080
KPFU, man.

831
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,140
It was undoubtedly

832
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,860
a criticism, but I couldn't make it out.

833
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,860
If you could call back and criticize us again,

834
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,380
we would very much appreciate it.

835
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,440
We'll all be quiet and listen to your criticisms.

836
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,740
Your constructive

837
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,900
criticisms. He said something like,

838
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,880
is this KPFA or is this...

839
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,820
And then I missed it. So I don't know what we were

840
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,720
being compared with.

841
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,380
The mad god, communist,

842
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,340
insane, you know...

843
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Pardon me.

844
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,740
Language.

845
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,740
Now, in 1960,

846
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,600
Bob discovered that

847
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,740
males, as they

848
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,800
gradually emerged step by

849
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,280
step out of boards,

850
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,820
caused hammers to fly up

851
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,500
and down with human hands

852
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,940
gripping them on one hand.

853
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,500
That was Bob's great discovery

854
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,760
about cause and effect.

855
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,860
Anything is possible today.

856
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,780
You don't hammer a nail. The nail

857
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,560
causes the hammer to go up

858
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
with the human gripping.

859
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,520
And how do you feel about that?

860
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,840
I feel satisfied that the church

861
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,780
has progressed

862
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,660
as predicted.

863
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,720
If this was the...

864
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,940
Year 1963.

865
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,480
Oh!

866
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,080
Oh!

867
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,940
And man are still alive.

868
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,660
We are still alive.

869
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,200
Is this Claire here?

870
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,640
This is the noisiest show.

871
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,020
Yeah, it's got so many

872
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,020


873
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,940
Princess, we think how pleasant

874
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,240
our show hour of slack is.

875
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,020
I'm trying to control it,

876
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,260
but it's out of hand.

877
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,580
It's like chaos.

878
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,180
It's got a mind of its own.

879
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,520
It's got a Don Joyce of its own.

880
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,440
It's a Santa.

881
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,220
This is Walter Bloom at Times Square

882
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,460
in New York City, returning you to

883
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,880
Charles Collins in Texas.

884
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,480
Now that was pretty professional.

885
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,480
Charles Collins again.

886
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,700
As I look at the strange devices

887
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,760
before me, I find it difficult

888
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,540
to understand or even believe.

889
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,400
I believe it.

890
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,640
I believe that this show sounds better

891
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,140
when they play tapes of other shows on it.

892
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,780
Good work, everyone.

893
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,420
But I knew what to expect

894
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,020
when I was born.

895
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,440
I was born.

896
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,440


897
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,440


898
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,300
They told me.

899
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,120
They gave me instructions for life

900
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,020
when I was born.

901
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,800
And told me what to expect.

902
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,740
Unlike other people.

903
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,000
Who just have to blunder and bluff

904
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,880
their way through.

905
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,980
Unfortunately, I lost the instruction book

906
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,120
when I was about five.

907
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,820
I had to be toilet trained all over again.

908
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,460
We have a long day ahead of us,

909
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,200
so we should begin with a two hour

910
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,640
break.

911
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,420
I kept having to call tech support for life.

912
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,340
Get up and go out.

913
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,320
Go outside.

914
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,760
Good day.

915
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,720
Okay, there'll be smoke.

916
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,460
Send it out outside.

917
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,440
Operation.

918
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,860
Security.

919
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,460
This show reminds me of my hearing test,

920
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,240
which I flunked.

921
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,540
My voice.

922
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,260
Now to wait till someone phones in

923
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,060
where the pieces fell.

924
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,940
I'm not listening.

925
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,540
I'm not listening.

926
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,800
I'm not listening.

927
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,060
I'm not listening.

928
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm not listening.

929
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,940
Gary Gbrodfred here has a special electronic guitar

930
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,300
that every time he touches one of the strings,

931
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,520
it creates a whole new show.

932
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,760
It's like a sampler.

933
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,740
And each note of each string

934
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,520
has a separate show that plays back.

935
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,960
I will play our game.

936
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,200
Princess Wee is playing her messages over the microphone.

937
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,700
Outward.

938
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,780
Outward.

939
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,840
Then maybe we'll be finally knowing what the flying saucers are.

940
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,120
Who are the masters of the UFO?

941
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,880
Wee!

942
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,300
Standing next to me is a technical expert.

943
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,960
A fanatical group all together

944
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,660
have a comfortable feeling

945
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:48,920
that they're in the same boat.

946
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,340
They're all friends of each other.

947
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,160
The people who are not on a microphone

948
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,320
in the other studio are all laughing

949
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,340
because they're having fun.

950
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,220
But the people who are on microphones

951
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,520
and listening to the show

952
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,640
all look grim.

953
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,160
Maybe we should get off the microphones

954
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,320
and join the party.

955
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,740
Just go jam.

956
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,400
Just go jam out.

957
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,600
No, the jamming is happening right here.

958
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,280
Gary is doing all the jamming.

959
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
I've been waiting until you jam this thing.

960
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,080
It says fire drill.

961
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,060
He's been jamming it into the edge of the table

962
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,180
and onto the equipment.

963
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,760
Jammed it into the microphone.

964
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,380
Jammed it into his mouth.

965
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,220
Okay, light up.

966
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,860
Flambering cacophony

967
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,900
of symphonic proportion.

968
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,760
They're all very much excited.

969
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,640
Something is cool.

970
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,680
You can see it in any political party.

971
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,640
There's always a fringe of fanatics.

972
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,000
In any political party.

973
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,280
So a lot of people think the world's gonna end in 2012.

974
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,580
Yeah.

975
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,700
But the reason they think that is because of the Mayan calendar

976
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,800
running out of numbers, right?

977
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,320
Right.

978
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,900
That's Frank Zappa's birthday.

979
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,860
But that's just another bunch of arbitrary numbers

980
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,620
made by the media.

981
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:17,620


982
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,140
By humans.

983
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,540
Why should nature and the axis and the world ending

984
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,800
depend on silly, arbitrary human numbering traditions?

985
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
Well, it's just a coincidence.

986
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,800
That's silly.

987
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,280
It's just a coincidence.

988
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,360
Oh, just a coincidence.

989
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,340
Yeah, that's what they all say.

990
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,220
Except for the scientists who say that nothing is a coincidence,

991
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,460
and it's all a meaningful, mystical message from Bob.

992
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,340
Well, some...

993
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:47,620
They're talking about...

994
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,580
Real good scientists.

995
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,920
This is the mystical message music now.

996
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,840
Let's get on with the mystical message.

997
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,400
Come on.

998
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,700
Perhaps an author...

999
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,140
I thought the music and the sound was itself the mystical message.

1000
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,740
The answer, Mr. Collins, lies in a system called prepared curing.

1001
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,720
I thought the bared curing was the mystical message.

1002
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,460
Mm-hmm.

1003
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,200
A surface each person lives within is treated with a chemical reaction.

1004
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,620
That's a mystical message.

1005
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,080
It is then dried at low temperatures so as not to set the cat.

1006
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,400
When we have the shape of each human being in question,

1007
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,780
we heat it with this device.

1008
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,740
The educational film in the background is describing where babies come from.

1009
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,300
What's Chicago?

1010
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,900
Well, that's pretty much where my...

1011
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah, Chicago...

1012
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,360
Yeah.

1013
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,900
That's where my dad explained it that way.

1014
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,820
Really?

1015
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,940
They said babies are poured into a little mold.

1016
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,160
They have a mold...

1017
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,920
Person mold.

1018
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,000
and they pour the baby juice in there and the baby comes out.

1019
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,940
That's what they mean by breaking the mold.

1020
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,360
Babies came from friendly 13-year-old girls.

1021
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,240
Really?

1022
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,260
Yeah.

1023
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,620
I'm glad you think that's right.

1024
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,280
Babies come from friendly 13-year-old girls, he said.

1025
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,700
That's what he said.

1026
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,680
In some countries, that is correct.

1027
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,260
Yes.

1028
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,120
In many countries, that's correct.

1029
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:21,980
As I keep reminding Princess Wee whenever we're watching a movie like Peter Pan or Lemony Snicket or Harry Potter,

1030
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,420
I go, look, you know, in many countries, those girls would be married by now.

1031
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,680
They'd be grandmothers.

1032
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,200
Not quite grandmothers, dear.

1033
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,400
There's nothing wrong with that.

1034
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,660
There's nothing wrong with it, is there?

1035
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,940
I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it.

1036
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,380
I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it.

1037
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,000
That's what they always say when there really is something wrong with it.

1038
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,960
Are you having some kind of attention deficit disorder?

1039
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,220
They do.

1040
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,140
Is that what's wrong with you?

1041
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,060
And they feel a bit cozy with each other.

1042
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,100
Hey, Reverend Stang, I got a couple of extra catalogs over here.

1043
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,240
Oh, is it time to read catalogs, Dr. Drummond?

1044
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah.

1045
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,220
You know, that's my favorite part of this show.

1046
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,160
When you read the catalogs at random.

1047
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,920
Hold on a minute.

1048
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,100
I'm going to bring one over to you.

1049
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,980
If it wasn't for that, I'd have nothing to edit out of your shows when I replay them on Hour of Slime.

1050
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,980
Yeah, I edit the best catalog readings out.

1051
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,300
Oh, he really does have a catalog.

1052
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,720
He just handed one to me.

1053
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,880
Now I can say, Dynamite Discount Deals Authentic,

1054
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,020
extremely free-flying, real leather,

1055
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,320
I can't do it as well as Dr. Drummond.

1056
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,440
Nobody can read a catalog like Philo.

1057
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:44,960
No.

1058
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,500
It's easier than ever to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues around the world.

1059
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,720
Philo, I notice that you're better at reading those catalogs

1060
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,920
right when Dr. Howell is coming to a dramatic crescendo.

1061
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,120
Sleek, powerful, and completely portable.

1062
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,260
On the go, in the car.

1063
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,900
I've studied the dynamics of this show.

1064
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,320
The perfect self-contained system.

1065
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,680
I've studied everything.

1066
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,660
Eliminate the hassles.

1067
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,800
But Dr. Drummond, what does that have to do with our topic?

1068
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,320
Always make clear.

1069
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,280
Hey, is Bishop Joey running away?

1070
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,600
You lucky son of a bitch.

1071
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,720
Don't you remember?

1072
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,380
Every third word, the listeners are supposed to take the whole show,

1073
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,260
cut it up into pieces, extract every third word, compile it,

1074
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,300
then recite it backwards for the audience.

1075
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,220
Secret messages hidden within.

1076
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,200
We can't do it where it's too easy.

1077
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,480
We have to, you know, perform some kind of upgrade, memory transfer, hard drive,

1078
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:57,820
refragmentation.

1079
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,580
Not a defrag this time, but a refrag.

1080
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,880
We're going to refrag the hard drive.

1081
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,440
We don't know why we have to do it.

1082
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,680
We're possessed to do it.

1083
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,080
But in the meantime...

1084
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:17,380
Are we going to get to the business portion of the show?

1085
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,700
What are we supposed to do the business meeting?

1086
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,260
What is the business?

1087
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,280
I've got a budget I've got to tell you guys about.

1088
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:34,680
How I legally robbed a bank last month for over $87,978 and got away with it.

1089
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,920
Well, let's split.

1090
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,160
Let's split.

1091
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,180


1092
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:48,740
I don't mind because I'll easily make that much this month.

1093
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,860
Brain pan!

1094
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:07,740
Okay, now I want to know how does the listener digest the show in such a way that it enters the brain pan according to the prescribed pathways?

1095
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,360
Hey, I drained my brain pan last night.

1096
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,140
What's your excuse?

1097
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,840
Okay just another show, and what's the no table?

1098
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:15,840


1099
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,220
What did we say?

1100
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,500
Dis nan, he's not giving you an answer.

1101
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,400
Now is the last time you've talked to me, Edward!

1102
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,440
You do have to go play with your mental story novel while he's gone.

1103
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,460
Well, think about it, I know he's at playing Pokemon.

1104
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,980
We've had one.

1105
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,180
And he's going for some kind of candies again.

1106
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:29,180


1107
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,460
Those are them.

1108
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,060
And Will Fitzphil has some of hers.

1109
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:38,840
Well she's here, but there is this牌 on him.

1110
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,280
Is that forte yours?

1111
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,300
Mr. Collins, we have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt

1112
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,820
that we can give to every man, woman, and child

1113
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,220
a perfect and lasting shape.

1114
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,820
Is that sex education tape still on?

1115
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,460
About how they give you a shape?

1116
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,120
I got my shape from my dad.

1117
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,480
Yes, it's not a sex education tape, though.

1118
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,420
Far from it.

1119
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,640
Thank you, too, unfortunately.

1120
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,320
This is Charles Collins reporting on one of the miracles of our time.

1121
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,760
Sex disinformation tape.

1122
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,260
It's actually a commercial.

1123
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,800
We are ready to switch you over to a home in Cleveland, Ohio,

1124
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,460
where a family prepares for this experience.

1125
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,980
Now, how coincidental is that?

1126
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,720
That's my house.

1127
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,320
Hey, they're showing our house.

1128
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,380
Talk about your coincidences.

1129
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:37,980
How?

1130
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,500
You can't be.

1131
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,420
Stand by, please.

1132
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,540
Stand by, please.

1133
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:43,680
What's happening?

1134
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,320
There's somebody standing next to our house.

1135
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,960
What's happening?

1136
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,180
Don't be anxious.

1137
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,560
Stand by, please.

1138
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:48,820
Wait a second.

1139
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,200
No, no, stand by.

1140
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,060
Can you just hop from one foot to the other?

1141
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,080
Please stand by.

1142
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,900
I'm hopping, I'm hopping.

1143
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,180
People, people, please stand by.

1144
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,320
You say hurry up.

1145
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,580
Hello?

1146
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Don't all rush around in a little gaggle of peace.

1147
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:03,900
I gotta go.

1148
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,180
What's going on here?

1149
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,220
Where's the bathroom?

1150
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,500
The bathroom.

1151
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,120
Keep your hands at your sides and stand by.

1152
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,580
Don't touch anything.

1153
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,660
It's all hot.

1154
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,820
Stolen by Ivan Stang.

1155
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,780
It's starting to trickle down my leg.

1156
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,400
When he escaped from Texas in a 1953 Chevrolet.

1157
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,220
Two times.

1158
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,620
No, Philo has the, has the prop, not me.

1159
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,280
Everybody accuses me of being the one with all the prop.

1160
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,000
It was Philo.

1161
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,220
That's what we're hoping, Pope.

1162
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,080
We want, that's what we want from a Pope.

1163
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,240
As a Pope.

1164
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,020
As, you know, as a Pope myself.

1165
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,820
I did bring some of course.

1166
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,400
You're a Pope?

1167
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,760
I'm a Pope.

1168
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,060
I'm a Pope, yeah.

1169
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,820
I'm a Pope.

1170
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,660
We're all Popes.

1171
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,000
That's right.

1172
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,940
They call me Michael Popey.

1173
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,940
I'm a Pope, with my old bathroom.

1174
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,460
They're just kidding.

1175
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,040
I'm a Pope.

1176
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,220
They're just P-Dogs.

1177
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,280
I thought you were like a favorite.

1178
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:56,920
I'm a Pope, with my old bathroom.

1179
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,800
I know a P-Dog is here.

1180
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,140
And Pope Pep and all that.

1181
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,740
Yeah, that'd be the second was the first King to known to have ordered pygmies to dance.

1182
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,620
This is all-

1183
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,500
Ladies and gentlemen.

1184
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,000
Are you director?

1185
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,200
Are you director?

1186
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,140
A new subgenius has entered the world.

1187
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,160
And he smiles immediately.

1188
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,500
He was as soon as I said that.

1189
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,940
He's a uber subgenian mutant.

1190
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,720
So named for her diet.

1191
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,480
And her, excuse me, a genie.

1192
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,360
She's now picking her nose on the air.

1193
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:35,160
This is, of course, a natural subgenius reaction to being on the air.

1194
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:43,640
Actually, if you'll notice, the uber booby baby is wearing the latest Bob bib.

1195
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,620
That's right.

1196
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,340
There is also a bib with Bub on it available.

1197
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,960
Bub the faceless.

1198
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,780
Yeah, birth defect.

1199
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,880
Bub bib.

1200
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,160
I'm not kidding.

1201
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,780
You can actually go to CafePress.com, subgenius shop, and there's a Bub bib.

1202
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,140
As well as the Bob bib.

1203
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,600
I got your mail.

1204
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,900
This is a Christine Bob bib.

1205
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,660
It hasn't been drooled or vomited on in hours.

1206
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,840
She loves Bob.

1207
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,180
That's very clear.

1208
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:20,980
She loves Bob.

1209
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,300
She has pretty blue eyes.

1210
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,920
Your butts look big in those pants.

1211
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,120
What's her name?

1212
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,040
What's your daughter's name?

1213
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,580
Can you hear me?

1214
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,820
My daughter?

1215
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,280
Uber booby baby.

1216
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,920
That's on her first certificate.

1217
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,640
Uber booby baby.

1218
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,360
Uber booby baby...

1219
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,720
Uh, drummond?

1220
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,080
You mean Lily Cat?

1221
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,420
Or... will you say her last name on the air?

1222
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:44,540
No.

1223
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,440
Drummond?

1224
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,960
You say Drummond on the air?

1225
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,420
Oh.

1226
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,060
Yeah.

1227
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,740
I see.

1228
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,820
Lily Cat Drummond?

1229
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,580
Bobcat!

1230
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,540
Yeah, Bobcat's her last name.

1231
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,500
Oh, okay.

1232
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,400
Bubba Bob Bobcat with a Bubba Bob bib.

1233
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,900
She's Lily Cat Drummond.

1234
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,280
Lily Cat Drummond.

1235
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,140
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.

1236
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,120
2006.

1237
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,260
Actually, she wasn't born quite on that.

1238
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,580
No, it was, wasn't it August, it was late July, I think.

1239
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,240
Yeah, because I remember because Chaos McKinney wanted to make sure she wasn't a cancer.

1240
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,580
Yeah.

1241
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,660
And because she didn't want, you know, which is my sign.

1242
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,800
Someone did?

1243
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,620
Wanted to make sure that she wasn't like Michael Pepe.

1244
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:37,640
Hey, Michael Pepe, did you know that Marion Kester's daughter was born on my birthday?

1245
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,160
Your illegitimate child.

1246
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,700
Really?

1247
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,620
Yeah.

1248
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,760
My illegitimate child?

1249
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,400
Oh, my God.

1250
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,860
Yeah, he doesn't even remember Marion Kester.

1251
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,400
No, I remember her as one of the many, many girls.

1252
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,200
She was his Republican girlfriend.

1253
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,960
Oh, my God.

1254
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,200
She was, she was at least almost as much of a Nazi as I am.

1255
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,360
Oh, didn't she?

1256
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,720
Which is pretty extreme.

1257
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,120
Didn't she become like a conservative writer?

1258
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,280
She became a Republican.

1259
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,000
And changed her name to Coulter or something like that?

1260
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,820
Yeah, Kester Coombs.

1261
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,920
And she had two daughters and moved to Maryland.

1262
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:14,720
You know Maryland.

1263
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,720
And Virginia and all that.

1264
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,100
Yeah.

1265
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,140
He worked for the Washington Post, her husband.

1266
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,820
Well, her daughter was born on my birthday.

1267
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,560
And then after that, all the subgenius daughters were born on my birthday.

1268
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,860
Now, that's funny.

1269
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,940
Now, three months.

1270
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,520
Three months after your birthday, then, you have a big, like, fertilization ritual with

1271
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,700
the whole females in the church?

1272
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,960
Yeah, we organize the fertility nights for them.

1273
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,720
Yeah, three months after my birthday.

1274
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,880
Now, that must be intense for you because you just happen to service all these many

1275
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,220
women.

1276
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,160
Oh, I just fell.

1277
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,380
Oh.

1278
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,540
Who provides the stud?

1279
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,400
So, I match the males with the females.

1280
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:55,800
Oh, yes.

1281
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,400
Of course.

1282
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,620
And they, yeah, it's a genetic.

1283
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:58,920
Yeah.

1284
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,180
It's very carefully scientifically done.

1285
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:06,560
You're like, yeah, you're like the Mendel of the human race.

1286
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,000
Right.

1287
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,720
Selecting biological.

1288
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,120
Really?

1289
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,560
You're like the Gregor Mendel?

1290
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,140
Yes.

1291
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,360
I'm the Gregor Mendel.

1292
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,620
You're a great geneticist.

1293
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:13,900
Yeah.

1294
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,120
He's a great geneticist.

1295
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:15,200
Subgenius breeding.

1296
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,280
And he breeds humans.

1297
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,620
So, really, I don't see you as a subgenius.

1298
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,380
Well, subgenius.

1299
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,220
This is why he hooked up Philo and the...

1300
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,520
Actually, we're trying not to breed.

1301
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,000
You know, that's what we all do if you think about it.

1302
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,540
That's what, if we're successful, we all do that.

1303
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,340
We breed humans.

1304
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,400
That's our job.

1305
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,820
Yeah.

1306
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,300
Is it really?

1307
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,580
We have to move our DNA into the next generation.

1308
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,040
I've done so.

1309
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,300
You've done so.

1310
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,140
But my DNA is so twisted and snarled.

1311
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:36,880
You have to keep...

1312
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,820
Your job is different, Michael.

1313
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,160
Yeah.

1314
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,500
You have to keep your DNA in this generation.

1315
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,220
Out of the...

1316
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,500
You don't want to put it into the next one.

1317
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:44,720
Yeah, no.

1318
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,860
You want to keep it in this one as much as possible.

1319
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,200
That's right.

1320
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,620
Stop it right where it is.

1321
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,220
Yeah.

1322
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,680
I know.

1323
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,340
Some of us have to put it into the next generation.

1324
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,800
Yeah.

1325
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,220
I know.

1326
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,480
I've been required to do that.

1327
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,180
I actually...

1328
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:56,580
You recall...

1329
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,680
You're working on a cycle of every 12 years.

1330
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:59,140
That's right.

1331
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,440
We discovered that there was a 12-year drum and uber baby cycle.

1332
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,220
Yeah.

1333
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,680
Like there's cycles of locusts and ladybugs.

1334
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,660
And they go into hiding.

1335
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,540
There's cycles of drum and uber babies.

1336
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:10,760
Yeah.

1337
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,320
They can't be...

1338
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,320
They're always females.

1339
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,520
Well, don't...

1340
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,540
And they're well over spawned.

1341
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,700
That'd be 12th year.

1342
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:21,260
They're actually in webs, in trees for those 12 years, right?

1343
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,420
That is true.

1344
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,860
Do they hang in the...

1345
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,860
Did you mention that she was born at 6.06 a.m.?

1346
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,340
Oh, my God.

1347
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,640
Yeah.

1348
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,080
6.06, of course.

1349
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,380
6.06.

1350
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,720
6.06.

1351
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1352
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1353
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1354
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1355
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:28,800


1356
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,260
Yeah, we did mention that last...

1357
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,920
Spells B-O-B in lowercase.

1358
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:33,400
That's right.

1359
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,140
That's right.

1360
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,680
6.06 is lowercase B-O-B.

1361
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,080
Yeah.

1362
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,460
It's not funny.

1363
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,300
Quit laughing.

1364
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,020
No.

1365
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,640
I know.

1366
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,060
It's a...

1367
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,760
That's the type laughing.

1368
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,500
It's a hell child.

1369
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:42,780
Oh.

1370
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,340
But that's good.

1371
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,060
That's a good thing.

1372
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,360
That's the type laughing?

1373
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,080
She puts the friendly, sweet face on hell.

1374
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,180
I thought that was laugher caller for a minute.

1375
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:51,560
I know.

1376
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,760
I love that.

1377
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,760
Laugher caller.

1378
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,680
Laugher caller.

1379
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,260
The one that just calls and then just laughs the whole time.

1380
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,120
I'm so funny.

1381
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,500
In Cleveland, we have a master...

1382
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,020
I didn't do it.

1383
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:02,720
I didn't do it.

1384
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,800
...that calls and master bites.

1385
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,520
That's where we got...

1386
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,860
I had somebody that laughed at that.

1387
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,720
He would...

1388
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:08,920
Are you laughing?

1389
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,020
He would listen to our show and master bite and say, oh, yeah.

1390
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:11,920
Oh, yeah.

1391
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,720
I want to show you the map of the internet callers.

1392
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,820
Do you want me to show you that?

1393
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,040
It's really cool.

1394
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:17,500
The map?

1395
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:17,860
Yeah.

1396
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,320
The map of the internet callers.

1397
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,980
Here, hold down the fork for a minute and I'll show you the map.

1398
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:22,360
Just like a sci-fi movie?

1399
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,720
Oh, is it just on the...

1400
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,060
Oh, I know what you mean.

1401
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,960
I'm going to show it over the air.

1402
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,780
It's the web that shows what addresses are taken.

1403
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,400
Oh, really?

1404
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,520
Oh, really?

1405
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:39,340
I hope my students in the Maybe Logic University course are learning a lot about subjunius history

1406
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,260
from this educational show.

1407
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,260
Well, of course, they've got to be soft.

1408
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,940
I apologize to the regular over-the-edge listeners who expected quality and got this.

1409
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,820
So do I.

1410
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,160
Well, that just happened.

1411
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,300
Sometimes the regular show is out.

1412
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,680
The summer substitute comes in.

1413
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:09,000
Friends, you have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack number 1081 in

1414
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,440
this case, which was a reprint of the 10 Puzzling and 10 Puzzling Evidences shows combined on

1415
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,500
KPFA on January 10th, which included a bunch of the subgenius old-timers.

1416
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,380
And that's what that was.

1417
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:27,540
And if you want more information about the Church of the Subgenius, please to check out

1418

Subgenius.com.

1419
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,520
If you look at the radio section of that, you'll find links to all of the many subgenius

1420
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:40,600
shows, including Suzy Dufluzzi's fabulous one on WREK Atlanta, which is also joined

1421
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:46,180
by the Lymph Node Institute's fabulous one on WREK Atlanta, and the Puzzling Evidence

1422
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,740
show on KPFA, Berkeley, Price Bob, Subgenius.com.

1423
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:51,880
Yes.

1424
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:58,360
Oh, and praise the amino acids heard here in the background in their new album, Humanity.

1425
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,000
Will fall like pins.

1426
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,240
And will they not?

1427
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,100
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1428
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,680

1429
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,200

There is a fifth Bob beyond that which is known to Bob.

1478
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,740
It is a Bob as vast as Bob and as timeless as Bob.

1479
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,860
It is the middle Bob between Bob and Bob between Bob and Bob.

1480
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:23,000
And it lies between the Bob of man's fobs and the Bob of his Bob.

00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,320
This is the Bob of a Bob.

Squatting.

1488
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,940
How about some Bob?

1489
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,540
Pfft.

1490
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,180

1491
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,040
