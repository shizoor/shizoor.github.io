1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Oh, friends, I have this new dog, and he's been sitting across from me in this studio

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,740
watching me while I was getting the equipment ready to do the show, and I've been pondering

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,160
what must that animal think, you know, when he watches us do, what do the dogs think when

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,380
they watch us do all these things that we do?

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,200
Are they thinking, gosh, if I had hands, I'd, you know, I think what, if they think like

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,740
that at all, they'd go, if I had hands, I'd use them all the time, too, but I sure wouldn't

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,940
be using them for that.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,680
That looks pretty boring.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:49,100
But, friends, it isn't boring anymore, and nor ever again, because it is this show.

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,920
Hi.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,280
Hi.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,360
Hi.

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,080
Hi.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,660
Hi.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,060
Hi.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,120
Hi.

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,780
Hi.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:53,780


20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:53,840
Hi.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:53,900
Hi.

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,180
Hi.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


30
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


32
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


33
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


34
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


35
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


36
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


37
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


38
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,360


39
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,220
Hi.

40
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,500


41
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:19,540


42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,180
Hi.

43
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,100
Hi.

44
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


45
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


46
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


47
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


48
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


49
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


50
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


51
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


52
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


53
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


54
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


55
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


56
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


57
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


58
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


59
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


60
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


61
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


62
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,100


63
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,620
Very funny.

64
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,180
Yeah.

65
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,300
Oh, no.

66
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,080
Now we're heading into the sexual or gonadial area of the Doug Smith brain.

67
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,160
No, not that brain, not his.

68
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
As you can see, it has some similarity to the previous portions of the brain and the typewriter.

69
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,900
But the enormous stamina of this human.

70
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,580
Saying, hey, hey.

71
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,160
Yes, that's all the trigger the Smith brain needs to get an enormous rise.

72
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,080
Can I say something?

73
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,380
Can I say something?

74
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,620
This show is our only method of communication.

75
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,980
Communicating with you Earth people.

76
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,920
In hopes that in the storm of Babel, you will understand the basic reality of our method.

77
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,480
And apprehend that we are not simply a comedy group or a humorous exercise.

78
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:43,180
But actually the emissaries of a distant civilization which only wishes to confer its own understanding upon the citizens of your rather backward planet.

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,440
We thank you for listening.

80
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,940
How do they do it?

81
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,440
Well, like this.

82
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,240
Put that in like this.

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,020
Oh, no, not like that.

84
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,600
And like this.

85
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,400
Ouch, that hurts.

86
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,100
No, cut it out.

87
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,840
And like this.

88
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,340
Oh, hey.

89
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes, you'll see us.

90
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
The Boeing.

91
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,180
Inflamed in glory.

92
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,720
Trailing clouds of glory.

93
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,640
When you hear that Boeing, friends, that means it's time for the show to begin.

94
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,160
Yes, that's our aura.

95
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,660
What, radio guys?

96
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,040
Yes, I think so.

97
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,740
You can relax and enjoy this quality product.

98
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,620
Secure in the knowledge that it has been specially designed.

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,900
Specially created for the lover of fine things and the man of good taste.

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,060
Oh, sorry.

101
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
You can edit that out, can't you?

102
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,000
Anything.

103
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,660
As the final day grows closer,

104
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,720
you may...

105
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,540
As the final day grows closer,

106
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,040
you may find yourself changing.

107
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Not just your mind, but your body, too.

108
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,800
You may find hair growing in strange places.

109
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,760
Between your teeth.

110
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,880
Under your fingernails.

111
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,040
Yes.

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
Even from your face.

113
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,300
You may find things other than hair growing out of your body.

114
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,440
You may start to develop new orifices and senses.

115
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Eyes may sprout from inside your ears.

116
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,900
And you may learn to listen with your tongue.

117
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,440
It's all part of the all.

118
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,260
One sense, one pipe, one grin.

119
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,660
And Bob is coming or kill me.

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,640
Just accept.

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,100
Just accept it.

122
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,080
Glory in the new flesh.

123
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,780
The new flesh of Bob.

124
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,340
Yeah, that's made from the infinity tree.

125
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,200
They cut that tree down once.

126
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,740
And every time you use any piece of wood from the infinity tree,

127
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,940
you can just use it over and over and over again.

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,380
I think Bob's pipe is actually made from that tree.

129
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,900
It is the very center shaft of the tree

130
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,280
was made into the shank of Bob's one true pipe.

131
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,160
Oh, my God.

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,700
Which then took root in the upper part of the tree.

133
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,320
Which is part of Bob's mouth and grown in with mighty roots

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,700
that go all the way down to Bob's toes

135
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,640
and deep to the back of his brain to yank that pipe loose from Bob's mouth

136
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,380
would be to pull all of his entrails, his head, his brains, everything out of his mouth.

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
What I find interesting is the most interesting about Bob.

138
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,060
Superstructure is how his bones are really more like Lincoln logs.

139
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,620
Well, you know, they said that while he was doing his gig, doing the presidential papers,

140
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,220
as Mr. Lincoln when he was doing that three-week scene on Broadway and stuff like that.

141
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,600
They said that parts of his body actually came, just started coming off of him on stage.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,480
Bob partakes of the Lincoln log.

143
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,060
He is like the Mr. Potato Head of America.

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,520
He is, and his house is like Candyland.

145
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,280
And his business is like Monopoly.

146
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,200
And his sex acts are like Twister.

147
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,120
And his backyard is like Fort Apache.

148
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,920
I like that bathroom he's got that's like Parcheesi.

149
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,060
His bathroom is like the Flintstones Village kit.

150
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:28,220
And his face is like an old football turned inside out.

151
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,520
What about his kitchen?

152
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,160
Oh, that's Connie's kitchen.

153
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,260
It's like a creepy crawler set.

154
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:34,800
Ooh.

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,160
Ooh.

156
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,600
You know that infinite tree?

157
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,580
Connie's kitchen is like Barbie's dream kitchen house.

158
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,860
And does the infinite tree grow in their backyard?

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,900
The great tree of Gnosis.

160
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:55,500
The tree Ouroboros which bites its own root and grows in an ever circular pattern as Bob smokes himself.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,260
A tree of infinity grows inside a tree of infinity.

162
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,760
And that's where the hoop snakes dance and sing their song around that tree.

163
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:03,980
Exactly.

164
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,220
And they dance around and roll around Bob as he sets his foot into his pipe.

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,820
And kills.

166
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,060
And sets fire to his shoe and begins to smoke.

167
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,280
Die!

168
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,800
Until his foot is smoked.

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
And then his stump of his leg.

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,940
And then his other leg he smokes.

171
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,800
And soon he's down up to his chest inside his own pipe.

172
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,960
Smoking himself away.

173
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:32,340
Finally only his lips are left to suck until even they are sucked by themselves into themselves through the pipe.

174
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,080
And only...

175
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,940
There's nothing left but the smoke of Bob and the pipe.

176
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,340
And on that moment the show will end.

177
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,780
They call a clown, they call a sandman.

178
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,260
But what about Bob's evil twin Jesse?

179
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,520
Did you go to chop that tree of infinity down?

180
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,480
It's right because then the pipe becomes not unlike a pencil sharpener.

181
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,120
And the pipe can actually expand and cover the head.

182
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,820
And twist around and around and around.

183
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,740
And actually sculpt.

184
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,080


185
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,360
Living...

186
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,820
Living sculpture out of the head of the bad Bob.

187
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,460
And make the bad Bob back into a good Bob.

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,420
It can be done with just a little bit of willpower.

189
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,720
If only everyone in the radio audience would clap their hands and believe in the good Bob.

190
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,820
And the bad Bob...

191
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,220
I love the bad Bob.

192
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,260
I love the good Bob.

193
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,280
I really believe.

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,920
I really believe.

195
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,660
Make the pipe spin like a razor.

196
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
And carve the...

197
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,460
Carve the face back.

198
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,380
Carve the face back.

199
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,700
And it happens.

200
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
It happens every time, friends.

201
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,920
Friends.

202
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,240
But it won't happen again unless you call.

203
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,780
If you can hear the voice here of Bleepo, of Ivan, of Princess Wee, of Lonesome, and myself.

204
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,680
You need to be calling to keep this ministry on the air.

205
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,740
It's your last chance.

206
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,100
Share your love.

207
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,360
Share your hate.

208
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,520
But share it.

209
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,500
Whatever you got, share it with us.

210
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
You want to speed?

211
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,920
All of us.

212
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,720
We love this to you every Thursday night.

213
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,360
Don't be like one of them lonely old Mexican fellows dipping his hand down that pumpkin for them sheets he's going to roast up to eat with his tequilas.

214
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,560
And find a rabid squirrel there.

215
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,580
A sex god waits your call at 687.

216
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,060
And as you talk to these gods, you will become as the gods.

217
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,700
6900.

218
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,880
For your generous contribution helps to keep this ministry on the air.

219
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,880
And keep the gods rolling.

220
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,700
As unto a god.

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,620
As gods.

222
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,180
Are born and reborn and die.

223
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,920
So will you be on Valhalla.

224
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,220
With a baseball hat of black.

225
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,000
And a hat of black and green.

226
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,480
You can be as unto a god.

227
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,520
You may be god number one.

228
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,360
You are as close to a god as you will ever be.

229
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,360
On WCSB.

230
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,900
You are as close to a god as you will ever be.

231
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,260
Out of this world.

232
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,440

Yes, uh, from Denmark.

250
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,020

251
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,720
The late Sphere Christensen.

252
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,160
Also known as Reverend Godzilla Bloat.

253
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,820
Oop!

254
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,960
He died.

255
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,180
They do that.

256
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,960
You know, them subgeniuses do.

257
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,320
Cary Thornley died.

258
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,260
The founder of Discordianism.

259
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,300
One of the co-founders of Discordianism died about a week ago.

260
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,180
A week and a half ago.

261
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,060
My time.

262
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,280
Twelve.

263
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,180
I don't know.

264
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,760
I'll, I'll...

265
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:55,980
Hmm.

266
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,380
Friends, we'll, uh,

267
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,880
we'll say more about that presently here.

268
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,120
What else were we listening to?

269
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,400
There at the beginning, a, uh,

270
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,680
a long intro barrage,

271
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,020
mega intro of some old Hour of Slack and KPFA,

272
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,260
the Puzzling Evidence Dr. Howell,

273
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,180
Gary DeBrogfran stuff.

274
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,740
Sort of a mega intro.

275
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,140
Uh, Friday Jones,

276
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,360
Long Live Bob's New Flesh

277
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,140
with Joe Satriani in the background.

278
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,560
And then the rest of that, of course,

279
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,180
was all Einstein's Secret Orchestra radio,

280
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,820
uh, from, uh, November 13th.

281
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,920
They play the Infinity,

282
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,420
the Tree of Bob,

283
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,460
and I think there were, uh, credits on that.

284
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,780
And here are the Jeffros,

285
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,460
they're in the background honking away here on We Be Kings.

286
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,160
Uh, and, uh,

287
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,640
uh,

288
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,320
is it, uh,

289
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,700
is it still Christmas?

290
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Or, uh,

291
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,880
The doll that stands up.

292
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,760
She's new.

293
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,860
From Kenner.

294
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

295
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,000
We must buy our toys.

296
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,780
We have to buy,

297
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,320
the marketing scheme for children's toys.

298
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,860
Skull Farmers.

299
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,080
Little wind-up bobs.

300
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,900
Hundreds of little bobs.

301
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,980
Each whispering their messages

302
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,500
in the night.

303
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,480
Death of little children as they sleep.

304
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,400
Too much is always better than not enough.

305
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,300
Quit your job.

306
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,100
Slack off.

307
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,320
Quit your job.

308
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,240

336
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,260
to Yukon Jack, dear friends.

337

Yukon Jack there in the background.

338
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,060
And let's get everything all set here, friends.

339
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,620
So I have a question, Mr. and Mrs. America.

340
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,240
Did you ever lie about cheating on your spouse?

341
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,580
Now, I'm asking you personally, okay?

342
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,540
You, the listener, the individual listener,

343
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,180
who I trust is a fellow American citizen.

344
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,280
Did you ever lie about cheating on your spouse?

345
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,800
Before you answer, it is my duty to inform you

346
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,760
that if you lie about it, we're going to find out

347
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,960
and you're going to lose your job and probably go to jail.

348
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,120
And if you tell the truth about your lie

349
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,880
and we find out that you lied to us

350
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,640
about cheating on your spouse,

351
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,600
you're going to lose your job and probably go to jail.

352
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,320
That said, now please feel quite free to answer the question.

353
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,080
A simple yes.

354
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,580
Yes or no would suffice.

355
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,020
Friends, so is Christmas over yet?

356
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,400
Well, it is.

357
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,020
It is after this Christmas, dear friends,

358
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,100
because this is Earth's last Christmas before...

359
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,320
It's Earth's last X-mas before X-est-mas, my friends.

360
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,080
It's X-est-mas, July 5th, 1999.

361
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,020
It's X-day.

362
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,460
Dos Equis.

363
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,060
Call us religious nuts, man.

364
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,680
Hell yeah.

365
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,080
Go ahead.

366
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,640
We're nuts about Bob.

367
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,820
And before it's all said and done,

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
I promise you we'll make the Jehovah's Witnesses

369
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,560
and the Scientologists and the Branch Davidians

370
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,360
look sane, normal, and laid back by comparison.

371
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,560
Praise, praise, praise that man, Bob.

372
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,180
And, oh, I guess I better...

373
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,700
Well, I guess it's the last Christmas for...

374
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,320
Carrie Thornley, too.

375
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,940
Here's the news of genius news here, dear friends.

376
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,600
This was posted on alt.slack by Reverend P. Kitty

377
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,200
of the Order of Malkavian-Dobzian.

378
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
And this is not a joke, by the way.

379
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,180
Carrie Thornley, also known as Omar Kayam Ravenhurst

380
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,140
and Ho Chi Zin, co-author of the Principia Discordia,

381
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,100
died Saturday.

382
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,900
He went into cardiac arrest after an extended illness

383
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,740
at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

384
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
Services will be private.

385
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,060
By the way, this was dated November 30th.

386
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,860
So I guess that would mean that Carrie died in late November.

387
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,480
Visiting with friends not long before the end,

388
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,420
he said he felt, quote,

389
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,660
like a tired child home from a very wild circus, unquote,

390
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,540
alluding to his favorite passage

391
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,820
from the Principia penned by his co-author,

392
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,140
Malaclips the Younger, Greg Hill.

393
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,460
Quote,

394
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,740
And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do.

395
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,740
And then it is that we play with our world of existent things

396
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,880
and order and disorder them.

397
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,800
And so it shall be that nonexistence

398
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,960
shall take us back from existence

399
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,020
and that nameless spirituality shall return to void

400
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,240
like a...

401
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,100
tired child home from a very wild circus.

402
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,580
There is a Carrie Thornley website that will be maintained

403
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,600
and will soon include the text of his newest book,

404
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,600
Confession to Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK.

405
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,900
That is at...

406
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,020
Oh, this is a long one, friends.

If you have a tape deck, then you got that.

sondralondon.com

416
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,980
And that's the news about Carrie Thornley.

417
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,540
We'll see St. Carrie Thornley on the other side

418
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,060
if somebody there remembers to flip the tape.

419
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,740
Carrie was actually one of the most prolific contributors

420
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,520
to the...

421
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,340
to the subgenius material in the 80s that there was.

422
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,360
If you look at our old stark fists and our books,

423
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,140
there's always one piece by Carrie Thornley.

424
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,500
There was almost...

425
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
That was like, you know,

426
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,780
he sent enough stuff for there to be 10.

427
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,260
Anyway, two weeks ago,

428
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,820
Fringeware in Austin, Texas,

429
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
sponsored a Robert Anton Wilson rant

430
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,700
and a small subgenius devival.

431
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,100
And I was the A.V. boy.

432
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,420
And take...

433
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,600
I did the intro for Pope Bob.

434
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,060
And Pope Bob Anton Wilson gave a wonderful little history

435
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,400
of the Discordian religion

436
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,280
and of Carrie Thornley,

437
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,140
which I will play after this message on side two.

438
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,920
Thank you.

439
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,420
Incidentally, this music in the background

440
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,840
is from Dawn of the Dead...

441
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,700
No, Day of the Dead.

442
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,100
Okay.

443
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,700
No, Dawn of the Dead, the second one,

444
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,180
by Goblin.

445
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,100
Mm.

446
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,760
So I go around with a little rubber stamp now

447
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,940
that says, uh...

448
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,120
that says, uh, NASA-Soviet...

449
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,120
Racist NASA-Soviet coup.

450
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,300
I've got such a problem in communications anymore

451
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,620
that people think that I'm advocating a racist

452
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,500
NASA-Soviet coup.

453
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
Uh-uh.

454
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,340
So how did you find subgenius?

455
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,980
Uh, Camden...

456
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,940
Camden Benares gave me some stuff.

457
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,220
And he says, this is something like

458
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,720
the 12 famous Buddha minds.

459
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,180
And one way or another, he implied that.

460
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
I said, all right, far out.

461
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,740
And I went back to Tampa.

462
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,680
Camden lives in Southern California.

463
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,600
He's an author of Zen Without Zen Masters.

464
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,120
I went back to Tampa, and I...

465
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,440
wrote him an insane letter, of course.

466
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,540
And we began an insane correspondence.

467
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,520
And I suggested that we integrate

468
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,240
Discordian theology with subgenius theology.

469
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
Subgenius, yes.

470
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,180
So you found a relationship, I'm sure,

471
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
between the Discordians.

472
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,180
Is it a church or a foundation?

473
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,080
It can probably be anything,

474
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,220
because to join the Discordian society...

475
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,280
It can be a dinner.

476
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,940
You have to make five copies of your application

477
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,100
and nail one of them to a telephone pole

478
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,380
and throw one of them in a garbage can

479
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,600
and drop another one of them in a mailbox or something.

480
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,100
So there's never been any situation

481
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,520
where anybody had to tell anybody

482
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,580
that they were joining the Discordian society.

483
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,820
Right.

484
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,720
Well, and the number is 84844.

485
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,420
To speak to puzzling evidence.

486
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,400
Mankar Feld, Kerry Thornley, and Bob DeNelson.

487
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,160
Anyway, the Discordian revelation came

488
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,460
by way of two fellows named

489
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,960
Kerry Thornley and Gregory Hill.

490
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,200
Kerry took the religious name Ho Chi Zen,

491
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,860
and Greg took the religious name

492
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,160
Malaklips the Younger.

493
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,320
And when I discovered the way

494
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
to become a Discordian pope

495
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,560
was to appoint yourself,

496
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,500
I became a Discordian.

497
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,760
I became Mordecai the Foul.

498
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,700
And then we got Fang the Unwashed

499
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,660
and Anrak the Backwoods

500
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,320
and Lady Yell, Anarchist Bitch.

501
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,300
A title which was given to her by Eldridge Cleaver

502
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,700
during a political discussion.

503
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,260
Really.

504
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,000
And the numbers have been increasing steadily.

505
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,600
Greg Hill had cards printed up

506
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,480
saying the bearer of this card

507
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,100
is a genuine and authorized pope,

508
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,360
so please treat them right.

509
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,880
Good forever guaranteed by the House of Apostles of Arise.

510
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,480
Amen.

511
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,100
On the site of the beautiful future

512
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,840
San Andreas Canyon, San Francisco, California.

513
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,940
And then I moved to Ireland,

514
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,060
and while I was there,

515
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,040
I heard on Irish TV that the pope had announced

516
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,500
that bishops can give indulgences over television,

517
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,980
which is an entirely new diploma

518
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,060
for the Catholic Church.

519
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,400
It shows they're not still stuck

520
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,380
in the 13th century in all respects,

521
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,420
just in 99% of their attitudes.

522
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,480
And this is a very important moment.

523
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:23,480


524
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,440
There's a lot of controversy in the Irish newspapers.

525
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,660
And one letter writer asked,

526
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,560
if you made a video tape of the bishop giving the indulgence,

527
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,440
and you played it over and over,

528
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,100
would you get perpetual indulgence?

529
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,780
Which is a question worthy seeing.

530
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,220
Irish atheists who have all been educated by Jesuits,

531
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,940
so they think of, nobody but an atheist

532
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,300
who has been educated by Jesuits

533
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,040
would even think of asking such a question.

534
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,460
Like one year when I was living in Ireland,

535
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,460


536
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,460


537
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,460


538
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,020
the bishop sent out a pastoral letter

539
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,720
to be read from all pulpits on God's plan for the family.

540
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,220
And another atheist who'd been educated by Jesuits,

541
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,600
I assume, wrote in a letter asking,

542
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,580
will the bishop clarify with what degree of metaphor

543
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,060
a timeless being can be said to have plans?

544
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,500
There's a great advantage in a Jesuit education.

545
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,340
Just think of some of the great minds produced by Jesuits,

546
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,620
education, the Marquis de Sade,

547
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,300
the old Tertre, Diderot.

548
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,040
Diderot, the great encyclopedist who said,

549
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,080
mankind will be free when the last priest is killed

550
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,320
by the last brick falling from the last church.

551
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,320
Victor Hugo, James Joyce.

552
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,820
Jesuit education has a really great background for

553
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,800
if you really want to have a lot of fun with religion.

554
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,440
Anyway, I decided if bishops can do it,

555
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,440


556
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,620
I'd do it.

557
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,600
And if I could do indulgences over television,

558
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,080
I could do pontifications on the radio.

559
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,000
I appear on radio much more often than I appear on television.

560
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,660
And when Greg was handing out cards,

561
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
the number of discordant popes was increasing slowly

562
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,220
from the hundreds to the thousands.

563
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,480
But when I started doing pontifications on the radio,

564
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,220
the numbers started increasing in the millions.

565
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,280
I was on one show in England,

566
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,600
had an estimated listenership of four million.

567
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,600
And I made them all popes.

568
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,620
We had four million popes in one minute.

569
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,700
And whenever I get in front of a radio,

570
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,440
the number of discordant popes now must run to

571
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,840
20 to 30 million at least, probably higher than that.

572
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,500
And we won't stop until every man, woman, child,

573
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,800
and other entity on this planet has become a pope.

574
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
Let's imitate Ivan's style for a minute.

575
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,360
Why the fuck should that old queen of the Vatican

576
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,400
be the only pope?

577
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,760
As a matter of fact, I sent the pope a pope card

578
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
so he could be a scholar.

579
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,740
I also sent the pope card to the anti-pope in southern France.

580
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,100
So he's both a pope and an anti-pope at the same time.

581
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
And if he writes to Douglas Hofstadter,

582
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,040
he'll get into the next book on strange loops.

583
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,140
I'm not an anti-pope at the same time.

584
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,220
I also sent a pope card to Ian Paisley,

585
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,800
the leader of the extremist fringe of the Protestant...

586
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,160
I think it was...

587
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,620
the Ulster Freedom Fighters in Northern Ireland.

588
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,000
His slogan was,

589
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
No pope in Northern Ireland.

590
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,240
So I sent him a pope card.

591
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,860
He didn't even have a thesis.

592
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,100
He believed in Northern Ireland.

593
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,160
Somebody else, he died.

594
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,040
Did he die since I sent him that card?

595
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,760
Maybe the card put him in a state of cardiac arrest

596
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,560
and he found out he was a pope, too.

597
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,020
Pardon me while I have a little fruit juice.

598
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,780
Ah, man, that's good fruit juice.

599
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,520
Oh, my God!

600
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,240
Good job!

601
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,320
Could we talk about Einstein?

602
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,040
Can we talk about Einstein?

603
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,300
Can we talk about Einstein?

604
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,280
Can we talk about Einstein?

605
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
Do you like talks like that?

606
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,640
Do you like talks like that?

607
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,960
Do you like talks like that?

608
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,360
Do you like talks like that?

609
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,260
Yes, my cat has an important message for us.

610
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,500
Yes.

611
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,360
Yes.

612
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,460
Yes?

613
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,500
Wait a minute, can you come here?

614
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,180
Listen.

615
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,280
Listen, come here.

616
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,640
Tell the people of Earth

617
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,940
everything that must be known right now.

618
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,560
Okay.

619
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,620
Send one dollar to...

620
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
No, no, no.

621
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,400
Don't tell them to send it anywhere.

622
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,340
Just burn one dollar right now.

623
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,460
Burning a dollar, that's right.

624
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,420
For kitties, for all the kitties

625
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,260
suffering in the labs of

626
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,240
DNA.

627
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,040
For all the kitties in the world.

628
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,200
They must think and react faster.

629
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,460
They'll pull out the most furious scams

630
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,120
in the planet's history

631
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,460
and fool nearly all of the people

632
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,100
all of the time.

633
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,760
Build your own rocket ship.

634
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,720
Build your own rocket ship.

635
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,620
Yeah, well, that's true.

636
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,800
I don't think he will.

637
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,620
I've got it.

638
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,580
What can you do me?

639
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,780
I love you.

640
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,480
I love you.

641
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:17,600
I see.

642
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,280
Your twins.

643
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,160
Rain, rain.

644
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,080
Eagle in space.

645
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,540
Go ahead, cake me.

646
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,180
My people will follow you.

647
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,400
My people will follow you.

648
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,380
On next day, a vanishing race.

649
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,900
Ah, yes.

650
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,880
As you see them running off into the hills,

651
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,500
you can notice the race vanishing off into the hills.

652
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,720
Well, listen, I'm at my friend's house,

653
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,580
and I'm using her phone.

654
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,800
Well, that's nice of her.

655
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,620
Yes, it is.

656
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,600
That's really nice of her.

657
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,740
Well, we gotta cut out of here anyway, Mr. Bleep.

658
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,180
Nuts, we have to bleep out, Bleep rabbit.

659
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,820
Hey, you coming in?

660
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,260
We must get off.

661
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,200
We must get off.

662
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,260
We must get off.

663
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,320
We must get off.

664
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,260
We must get off.

665
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,900
HH, hh, hh, hh, HH.

666
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,540
We must get off.

667
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,620
HH, hh, hh, hh, we must get off.

668
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,480
HH, hh, hh, hh, we must get off.

669
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,580
Hh, hh, hh, hh, we must get off.

670
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,620
HH, hh, hh, hh, we must get off.

671
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,880
The Aussie CrossFit Team

672
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:16,880


673
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:16,880


674
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,940
contradicted its words.

675
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,640
I was thinking about,

676
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:19,720


677
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:19,720


678
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:19,720


679
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:19,720


680
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:19,720


681
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,700
I was, I gotta do this, I gotta do this.

682
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,640
I mean, I can't take none of this no more.

683
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,380
The fear was justified when he made his next move.

684
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,180
I had come to a conclusion in my mind.

685
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,360
Why should I just keep living like this?

686
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,480
She tried to keep him calm.

687
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,860
I just wanted the police to know, hey, y'all can do what you want to do.

688
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,560
I'm tired.

689
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,600
She had to change his mind.

690
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,240
Fatigue and tension hurt her.

691
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,540
She set in.

692
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,460
So it came down to...

693
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,160
Reality.

694
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,580
Reality.

695
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,380
It, it, it, it, it.

696
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:50,880
Reality.

697
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,260
It, it, it, it, it.

698
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,360
Help me now!

699
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,420
I, I, I mean, I can't take reality.

700
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,020
Why should I just keep living like this?

701
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,180
I will do it.

702
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,020
Uh.

703
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,220
Yeah.

704
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,660
Uh, I don't have it.

705
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,680
Yeah.

706
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,360
Uh, I don't have it.

707
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,240
Yeah.

708
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,560
Yeah.

709
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,360
Uh, I don't have it.

710
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,740
Help!

711
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,260
No more.

712
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,600
No more.

713
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,100
I need help.

714
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,220
Save the fire, Ben.

715
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,740
Yeah, baby.

716
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,220
Lucky, lucky.

717
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,520
Oh, God!

718
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,620
Oh, God!

719
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,380
Oh, God!

720
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,120
Oh.

721
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,660
Oh.

722
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,760
Oh.

723
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,460


724
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,260


725
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,260


726
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,260


727
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,260


728
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,700
Oh.

729
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,560
Oh.

730
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh.

731
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:46,900
Oh.

732
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,080
Oh.

733
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,080


734
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,520
Oh.

735
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:47,520


736
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,140
Oh.

737
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,140


738
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,760
Oh.

739
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,280
Oh.

740
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:49,600


741
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,640
Oh.

742
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:53,760
Oh.

743
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,340
Oh.

744
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:54,920
Oh.

745
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,540
Oh.

746
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:58,800
Oh.

747
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,960
Oh.

748
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,940
Oh.

749
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,300
Oh.

750
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,720
Oh.

751
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,200
Oh.

752
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,400
Oh.

753
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,580
Oh.

754
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,080
Oh.

755
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,640
Oh.

756
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:06,980
Oh.

757
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,840
Oh.

758
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,760
Oh.

759
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,820
Shoot some mothers in the head.

760
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,120
Poor Bob.

761
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,600
Gotta be a logical explanation for this.

762
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,020
Shut up!

763
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,560
Brothers in business, I can take this man.

764
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,340
I won't be surprised if I have to.

765
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,880
Let's go. Down the stairs.

766
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,480
Yeah.

767
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,160
Come on, let's talk about it.

768
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,740
What I'm talking about down here.

769
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,120
When the men come home and say they're tired,

770
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,080
wait until they get ready to go pop in the shower or the tub.

771
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,540
Tia.

772
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,380
Um, he wants a woman with boobs so big it's unreal.

773
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm not gonna hurt you right now, okay?

774
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,820
Get in there with him.

775
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,680
I need you to calm down.

776
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,940
Ask him to come here.

777
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,100
You like that? Do I have to tell him?

778
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,540
Get in there with him.

779
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,540
Help me.

780
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,420
Pull up there with you.

781
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,380
Help me now.

782
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,520
Get in there with him.

783
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,180
Help me.

784
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,120
Pull up there with you.

785
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,300
You like that? Do I have to tell him?

786
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,420
Help me now.

787
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,240
Go ahead.

788
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,760
Help.

789
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:16,680
Help.

790
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,320
Help.

791
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,940
Help.

792
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Help.

793
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,100
Help.

794
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,600
Help.

795
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Help.

796
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,240
Help.

797
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,060
Help.

798
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,480


799
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:42,520


800
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:42,680
Help.

801
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:42,760
Help.

802
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:42,800
Help.

803
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:42,800


804
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,580
Oh, yeah.

805
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,560
Pull up there with you.

806
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,060
Help.

807
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,940
I need help.

808
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,900
Help me.

809
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,500
You like that dude?

810
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,320
Help me now.

811
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,500
Get in there with him.

812
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,120
Ch-ch-ch-ch.

813
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,820
Help me.

814
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,060
Oh, yeah.

815
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,660
Help.

816
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,220
Oh, yeah.

817
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,240
I need help.

818
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,320
Pull up there with you.

819
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,400
She tried to keep him calm.

820
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,740
I mean, all I was thinking about was...

821
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,540
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chia.

822
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,140
Oh, yeah.

823
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,240
Get in there with him.

824
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,580
Watch it.

825
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,080
So we came down to...

826
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,840
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chia.

827
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,360
Yeah.

828
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:12,540
Oh.

829
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,920
We don't know.

830
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,340
Oh.

831
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,480
What?

832
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:15,900
That hurt.

833
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,120
Build your own rocket ship.

834
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,180
Build your own rocket ship.

835
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,460
Come in, little ones.

836
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:30,620
Come swim in the pool of rocket fuel.

837
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,500
Godspeed.

838
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,340
Godspeed.

839
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,120
alk sauce

840
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,980
On the first day,

841
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,640
The gods created a just prism.

842
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,360
And on the second day

843
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,700
The gods created malice.

844
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:24,480
On the third day, the gods created Wally Sherrod.

845
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,420
On the fourth day, the gods created Scott Arpenter.

846
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,940
On the fifth day, the gods created Deke Slayton.

847
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,880
On the sixth day, the gods created Gordon Cooper.

848
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,200
And on the seventh day, the gods created John Glenn.

849
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,580
I have a big spiral galaxy on me.

850
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,100
Hey, man, here I'll show you.

851
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,720
I start at the center or go from the outside inwards.

852
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,280
That's the fun about the spiral galaxies.

853
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,640
The cluster galaxies, you just got to go at it.

854
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,120
Yeah.

855
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,940
But spiral galaxies, yeah.

856
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,600
I like to start on the outer rim and go in towards the center

857
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,780
because then there's that black hole at the very center.

858
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,980
And just when you think you've snorted everything up,

859
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,860
it snorted.

860
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,220
It snorts you.

861
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,240
We used to call that the goofball.

862
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,500
We called it the thunder, thunder.

863
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,040
I can't pronounce the last part of the word on the air.

864
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,420
Yeah, the black hole at the middle.

865
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,320
That's the goofball.

866
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,880
That's where you really go for a ride.

867
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,360
You snort that black hole, man.

868
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,500
The killer death hole.

869
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,980
I've known a lot of people that got those deviated septums

870
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,360
from snorting too many of the goofball black holes.

871
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,660
I know a guy who had to have all of his septums replaced

872
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,780
with titanium.

873
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,000
He had to have titanium steel so he could keep snorting black holes.

874
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,420
Yeah.

875
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,860
Even the neutron matter isn't as heavy, man,

876
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,240
as the black hole at the middle.

877
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,660
Men of science constantly search the infinitesimal corners

878
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,640
of our solar system, seeking new discoveries,

879
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,140
hoping to better understand the laws of the universe.

880
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,760
If it ever occurred to you, you might have totally lost your mind.

881
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960
There was a rumor about a tumor.

882
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,960
Or was it a transistor?

883
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,480
Yeah, it was a transistor.

884
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,380
It was a subcutaneous spring wave generator.

885
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,680
Well, that of course touches on right, mind control, which is.

886
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:23,820
Yeah.

887
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,020
Uh-huh.

888
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,920
Do you think Oswald was a, was it a slice in the pie of mind control?

889
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,020
I think I'm an android.

890
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,800
I think Oswald was an android.

891
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,640
I think we're both mind, we were both mind control victims.

892
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,820
I think there were, I think what happened was like they captured a bunch

893
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,500
of German scientists after the war that were in the mind control.

894
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,820
CIA got a bunch of them and KGB got a bunch of them.

895
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,600
I think they began comparing notes and they began to say, my God, this is,

896
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,260
this is heavier than atomic power.

897
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,160
What are we going to do with it?

898
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,820
No matter where.

899
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,620
I think they began experimenting on selected subjects.

900
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,820
I think I was one of them.

901
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,200
I think Oswald was one of them.

902
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,320
I began to experience audio hallucinations when I was in that outfit with Oswald.

903
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,900
They went on for the rest of my life for about ten years.

904
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,540
I thought they were, I thought they were spiritual.

905
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,040
I thought they were spiritual experiences.

906
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,760
I got into Edgar Cayce and I was always writing down my dreams and they were always coming

907
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:24,560
true and it was like I just got so much into that world view that I couldn't imagine a

908
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,680
materialist universe any longer.

909
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,640
And then one day I began to find out more and more about mind control.

910
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,780
There's a great book about it, Operation Mind Control by W.H.

911
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,140
Boart.

912
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,740
That, uh, I think it's called, uh, I think it's called, uh, I think it's called, uh,

913
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:39,740


914
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,520
God, when I got to the chapter in that book about the assassination, about the assassinations,

915
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,320
there were so many connections with my life, so many things that overlapped with people

916
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:58,380
that I'd met or that I'd somehow had dealings with that it was like I just, the margins

917
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,340
were just crammed full of notes all the way, all the way through.

918
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,840
It was just, I just couldn't stop writing margin notes.

919
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,740
Yeah, I was at David Ferry's house once, et cetera.

920
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:09,740


921
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,700
It was just, it was, it was just.

922
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,760
The Discordian Society has a rather unique history among religious movements because

923
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,700
one of the two co-founders, Kerry Thornley, who died last week, was indicted by Jim Garrison

924
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,680
as one of the conspirators in the JFK assassination.

925
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,940
And this, this gives us a unique glamour.

926
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,740
What other religion in the world could claim that they may be a religious movement?

927
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:39,740


928
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,100
religious movement to be in charge of the Kennedy assassination.

929
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:51,220
As Charlie Manson said recently in an interview, in my day, being crazy meant something.

930
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,840
Now everybody's fucking crazy.

931
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:07,820
When, when Kerry was, uh, when Kerry was indicted by Garrison, I was convinced Garrison was

932
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,180
an unscrupulous demigod.

933
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,720
And I was convinced he was a good man.

934
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,620
Kerry a lot of encouraging letters, don't lose faith, don't lose hope, you know you're innocent, and so on.

935
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,820
And then after the trial fell apart and there was no evidence against Kerry and Garrison how to let him go,

936
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,480
two years later on an acid trip, Kerry suddenly remembered or imagined that,

937
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,400
well, he served in the, this is the background of the whole case why Garrison indicted him,

938
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,460
he served in the Marine Corps in the same regiment with Lee Harvey Oswald

939
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:43,920
at the same base in Japan from which the U-2 spy planes were launched out over Russia.

940
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,720
When one of those U-2 spy planes was shot down, Eisenhower personally came on television

941
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,820
and assured the American public it was not an American spy plane,

942
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,000
and then later, two days later, he had admitted he had lied.

943
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,460
I think that was the first time an American president really had to get up in public and admit he had lied.

944
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,740
That may be the beginning of the rise of popularity of conspiracy theories.

945
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,020
Watergate was just...

946
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,740
a much bigger example.

947
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,720
Anyway,

948
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,740
on an acid trip, Kerry remembered or thought he remembered or imagined or hallucinated, you can take the...

949
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,700
I've decided all my writings can be summarized in one sentence, just one simple sentence.

950
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,220
If everybody used the word maybe more often, we might all become startlingly sane.

951
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,880
It's just not right.

952
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,640
Have you ever read a theological work that said maybe Jesus is the Son of God?

953
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,900
Have you ever heard a Muslim say

954
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,760
maybe Allah wants us to kill the Jews?

955
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,520
The trouble is they don't have enough maybes in their vocabulary.

956
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,520
Everything is for sure and certain with them.

957
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,400
For me, everything is unsure and uncertain.

958
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,560
I'm confused about everything.

959
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,800
That's how I make my living.

960
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,000
I get up and share my confusion with other people.

961
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:20,560
And since almost everybody is confused these days, and since it's one of the three stages of chaos, chaos, discord, confusion, bureaucracy, and international relations, it's part of the divine plan of Our Lady that we should all be confused most of the time.

962
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:28,840
Anyway, whether Kerry, anyway, Kerry's memory, or pseudo-memory, or whatever it was, was that, well, he was in the Marine Corps.

963
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,140
He and Lee Harvey Oswald and several others volunteered for scientific research.

964
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,500
Now, we know the CIA used a lot of military people for research at that time.

965
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,860
They used other people, too.

966
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,700
This was part of the MKUltra program.

967
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:52,600
MKUltra was a top-secret program that started in the 50s and wasn't revealed until the Church Committee discovered it in the 1970s.

968
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,180
Senator Church had long hearings in which a lot of people came forth telling how they had their minds warped by various things the CIA did to them.

969
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,120
So, it was a lot of research.

970
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,120


971
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,160
There was one guy whose father committed suicide who sued the CIA and collected.

972
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,720
The CIA got their revenge, though.

973
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,740
Senator Church was not re-elected.

974
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:22,260
If you read Bob Woodward's book, Veil, you'll find there's a lot of evidence that the CIA participated in the election the next year to make sure that he wouldn't get elected.

975
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,780
James Jesus Angleton was thrown out of the CIA for interfering in American politics.

976
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,500
They're only allowed to interfere in the politics of other countries.

977
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,120
There's a lot of evidence.

978
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,260
They've been interfering in American politics, too.

979
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,220
They don't want us meddling in our own affairs.

980
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,040
How do you think the mind control perspective tied into the assassination itself?

981
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,380
I think that's why they had to shoot Oswald.

982
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:57,120
Because it was like the CIA didn't want the FBI to realize that they were using a Manchurian candidate to spy on them.

983
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,400
And that's what Oswald seemed to be.

984
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,460
He seemed to be spying on the FBI.

985
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,120
You feel...

986
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,900
On the FBI.

987
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,020
On the FBI.

988
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,480
On their anti-Castro activities.

989
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,340
For Kennedy.

990
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,520
Or for the CIA.

991
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,560
It was supposed to be loyal to Kennedy at the time.

992
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,020
So hippie.

993
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:19,240
Well, that was certainly one of the best theater pieces America's ever done back in 1963.

994
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,820
But I don't want to know, and I don't want to talk about it.

995
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,240
Dig it?

996
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,340
It gets beyond the worry.

997
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,180
And it is beyond talking about it, yes.

998
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,180
So.

999
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,580
Tell us more about the Discordian.

1000
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,160
Principalia.

1001
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,060
The Discordian society evolved in probably 19...

1002
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,200
Probably the summer of 1958 in a bowling alley somewhere in East Whittier, California.

1003
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,220
Or in Santa Fe Springs, California.

1004
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:57,120
Where Greg Hill and I were sitting over cups of coffee talking philosophy and talking about order and disorder.

1005
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,600
And decided that what was needed was a deity to explain all the chaos in the universe.

1006
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,060
And that was sort of the occultism of the early days.

1007
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,420
The thing that we figured, I think, is sometimes a lot of people relate to the subgenius foundation the same way.

1008
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,700
It was something like, you know, you want to evangelize, but you're not religious.

1009
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,260
Right.

1010
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,140
Or you want to get militant about something, but you don't feel strongly about anything.

1011
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,300
Neonostics, you know, meganostics.

1012
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,240
If it ever occurred to you, you might have totally lost your mind.

1013
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,260
Bring us into bondage.

1014
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,360
He says it straight.

1015
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,560
They use a lot of spiritual words.

1016
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,080
But.

1017
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,960
Behind the scenes, they want you to live in the bondage they're living in.

1018
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,260
No thanks.

1019
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,420
We sometimes have to question the easy assumptions that we've all grown up with.

1020
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:51,140
And sometimes facts and new information have to come along and make us shake up our thinking.

1021
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,180
Cave men.

1022
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,320
Cave women.

1023
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,780
Neanderthal.

1024
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,880
Where I come from, we have universities.

1025
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,520
Seeds of great learning.

1026
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,700
Where men go to become great thinkers.

1027
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,320
And when they come out, they think deep thoughts.

1028
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,200
And with no more brains than you have.

1029
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,840
Everybody knows that you use many black holes to get around the speed of light.

1030
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,280
Right.

1031
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,400
Just sidestep it.

1032
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,340
Right.

1033
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,040
What?

1034
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,540
Oh, 196,000 miles per second?

1035
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,980
I don't think so.

1036
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,100
Screw Einstein.

1037
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,540
That's like, oh, yeah.

1038
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,400
Oh, you think I'm going to slow down for those road bumps?

1039
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,060
Yeah.

1040
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah.

1041
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,620
You think I'm going to follow this rule that Einstein came up with that there's a speed limit out here?

1042
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,140
Well, he kept the secret, that one secret of how to.

1043
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,240
He had Einstein's secret radar fuzz buster.

1044
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,080
Mm-hmm.

1045
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,900
So that you could outrun the speed of light.

1046
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,300
Well, he didn't tell us.

1047
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:56,020
He knew, but he did not tell us how you can add to the speed of light.

1048
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:03,120
Everyone thinks it's common, you know, knowledge or something that thou shalt not add one's own speed to the speed of light.

1049
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,240
Oh, give me a break.

1050
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,620
Well, then how, you know, I mean, I've heard Scotty griping about how they can't quite make it to warp nine.

1051
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:13,420
Right.

1052
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,100
Which is.

1053
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,480
That's like nine times the speed of light.

1054
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:16,980
Right.

1055
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,380
They still wouldn't be able to get from star system to star system as fast.

1056
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:31,100
If they were traveling at nine times the speed of light, when they got there, they'd have to wait nine light years for the rest of their body to catch up.

1057
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,960
Well, and every time they went back.

1058
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,100
To earth, it would be a million years later.

1059
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:35,820
Right.

1060
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,260
There's a lot of problems with all of that.

1061
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,920
The whole world is waiting for this will decide the fate of civilization.

1062
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:50,320
All humanity, whether we live or die, may depend on what happens here.

1063
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,160
Attention, please.

1064
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,020
Four minutes to bomb time.

1065
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,100
Tired of the everyday routine?

1066
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,280
Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure?

1067
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,940
Want to get up?

1068
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,940
Get away from it all?

1069
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,020
I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship.

1070
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,580
Do you like dogs like that?

1071
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,640
Want to take a ride?

1072
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,720
Want to take a ride?

1073
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,660
Want to take a ride?

1074
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,280
That's what happened with the humans, too.

1075
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:26,060
That many gods, but there could only be one because the reason you have to have only one is because, well, if you have more than one, someone could say, well, one of them's made up.

1076
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,360
Well, if one of them's made up, why not all of them?

1077
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,800
So that exposes something that they don't want to expose.

1078
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,300
So you have to get it down to just one.

1079
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,060
Yeah.

1080
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,840
I'm not.

1081
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,880
Yeah, you can't question one.

1082
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,340
Well, it makes people real nervous, too.

1083
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,900
And I can understand that.

1084
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,780
There must be a God.

1085
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,620
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying.

1086
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,600
Einstein's brain in that jar will not lie to you.

1087
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:02,860
No.

1088
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,440
Never.

1089
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,920
You cannot survive outside of this shower.

1090
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,280
Please come back.

1091
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,140
We are only here to help you.

1092
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,660
And I want to see my way all the way clear because I've got this much in the tank.

1093
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,900
But you're the guy who wants us to live, not like Donald would be, but like the trolley.

And trends, of course, it's always slack at subgenius.com

00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,980
or www.subgenius.com.

1182
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,860
Just type that damn word subgenius in there.

1183
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,960
It's just all over the internet.

1184
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,120
It's crazy stuff, kid stuff.

1185
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,740
And we've been listening quite a bit to,

1186
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,160
to a historic old radio broadcast,

1187
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,560
the KPFA Berkeley subgenius,

1188
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,220
less than an hour, more than a,

1189
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,080
more than an hour, less than a show

1190
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,220
with Doug Wellman, puzzling evidence,

1191
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,840
interviewing Carrie Thornley, the late Carrie Thornley.

1192
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:20,500
And also we heard Robert Anton Wilson discussing Thornley

1193
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,760
and the CIA and the discordian religion and so forth

1194
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,540
in Austin about, what?

1195
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:31,600
Two weeks ago, December 8th, I think, or something like that,

1196
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:35,020
at, sponsored by Fringeware.

1197
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,860
And I kind of got to hear,

1198
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,980
the only time Pope Bob cussed in that speech

1199
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,880
was when he was imitating me.

1200
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,820
I was honored though.

1201
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,860
And well, friends, I guess, Earth, we must get off now.

1202
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,500
We must get off now.

1203
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,260
We must get off now.

1204
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,780
Earth, we must get off.

1205
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,760
Earth, we must get off.

1206
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,900
Earth, we must get off.

1207
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,980
Earth, we must get off.

1208
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,920
Earth, we must get off.

1209
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,320
And you can best take the thought that is your money

1210
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,980
and donate it to this radio station.

1211
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,080
And then that money will once again

1212
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,640
be transformed into thoughts.

1213
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,580
Death to vermin.

1214
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,880
Thoughts to money.

1215
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,760
Money to thoughts.

1216
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,720
Death to vermin.

1217
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:26,720


1218
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,040
vermin.

1219
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:28,900
Vermin to brains.

1220
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,480
Abundance to all.

1221
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,640
Vermin to worms.

1222
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,900
Worms eating into brains.

1223
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,920
Till next week.

1224
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,920
Brains creating money.

1225
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,280
Keep your hat on tight.

1226
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,980
Money creating ideas.

1227
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,380
You're back to the wind.

1228
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,540
Ideas creating music.

1229
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,320
And you're back.

1230
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,020
To the wind.

1231
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,360
And you're sack.

1232
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,160
Sack.

1233
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:44,880
In the?

1234
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,280
Saddle.

1235
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,020
Saddle.

1236
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:47,720
Saddle.

1237
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,900
You're all blistering now.

1238
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,340
We'll see you all next week, kids.

1239
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,360
Flippo Abernathy, Reverend Ivan Stang, the princess we are doing, Lutzen.

1240
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,180
Cowboy Dave, all entertaining.

1241
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,140
You hear my name's Chaz.

1242
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,380
This is ESO.

1243
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,500
A radio.

1244
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,220
A medium.

1245
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,700
A blister.

1246
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,420
Yep, they come around here a lot these days.

1247
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,720
Back in the saddle.

1248
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,600
Back in the saddle.

1249
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,580
Saddle back.

1250
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,440
Back saddle.

1251
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:15,800
Anyway.

1252
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,920
Components.

1253
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,480
I've been fighting them Indians for 900 years.

1254
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,100
Before I was one.

1255
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:21,600
Hey-ya!

1256
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,860
I was one of them.

1257
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,620
Or at least.

1258
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,060
I seem to be.

1259
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,080
But I read.

1260
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,720
And no quotation.

1261
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,820
In a book just yesterday.

1262
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,500
Says if you beat everyone.

1263
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,420
So the debts you make.

1264
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,940
You'll have to pay.

1265
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,380
Can you get to that?

1266
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,080
Can you get to that?

1267
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,100
I want to know.

1268
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,560
I want to know if you can get to that.

1269
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,520
Can you get to that?

1270
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,560
I want to know if you can get to that.

1271
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,200
Wait!"

1272
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,420
You'll bet.

1273
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,780
Right?

1274
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:12,880


1275
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:12,900
Have you been getting the money?

1276
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,440
Mm-hmm .

1277
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:14,900
Oh dear Dino's live.

1278
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:15,800
I'm going to spend tomorrow at the dentist.

1279
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,640
estas me.

1280
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:18,980


1281
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:19,540
Hello, gosta.

1282
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,960
Kisses later come back, side kiss

1283
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:49,860
I uh...
