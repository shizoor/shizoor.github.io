1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:09,720
You know how you, when you go to sleep and you dream, how you can bend and shape the events that take place in that dream?

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,760
Well that, what if that were your reality? And what if this were the dream?

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,920
You know, you can actually paint your future and you can make everything that's ever happened, is happening and will happen, has already happened.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,700
It's shape-shifting time and events so that you know why your soul is here.

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,320
And that's the purpose, to know why you're here, to know why you came back.

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,840
This is amazing.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,000
I know.

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,560
What are you going to call it?

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,360
I think I'll call it Bob.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,000
Bob?

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,660
You don't like Bob?

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,460
You can't call a planet Bob.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,800
Oh, so now you're the boss.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,680
You're...

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,380
You're the king of Bob.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,340
Well, no.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,580
But...

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,100
What?

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,820
Can't you just call it Earth?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, no one said you had to live on Bob.

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,020
I'm never calling it that.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,540
Ha ha ha ha!

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,740
We are the men of...

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,400
The Super...

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Genius...

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,020

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,560
Slack.

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,500
We wear the...

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Power of Slack.

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,500
...star.

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,940
We like to think of...

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,420
The Super...

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,260
Genius...

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,240
We've got everything for your...

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,640
Slack.

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,600
We've got lubricants and batteries just for you.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,900
We've got...

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,200
Slack.

39
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,620
...too.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
We've got everything for your...

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,660
So genius.

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,740
Power of...

43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,280
Slack.

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,540
...slay.

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:00,820
...slay.

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:00,820


47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:00,820


48
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,800
Man by day, beast and devourer of the unwary by night.

49
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,160
Who is this creature?

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,420
...wha?

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,980
...wha?

52
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,200
...wha?

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,380
Whose origins lie in Medieval Europe as a potent symbol of fear...

54
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,620
...and the violence that lurks at the center, under the veneer of civilization.

55
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,660
...wha?

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,060
...wha?

57
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,220
...wha?

58
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,520
...wha?

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,660
...wha?

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:25,920
...wha?

61
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,260
...wha?

62
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:39,100
A ravenous, gelatinous werewolf, as its huge corpulent bones slid across the plain, leaving its slimy trail behind it.

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:50,900
The werewolf, or the werewolf worm, as it were, slithering and glithering like some ancient, hideous beast.

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,980
Too symbolic to even mention, and the emphasis is on mention, I might add.

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:09,820
While the tradition that we seek in uniting the water with the air represents the coming together of matter and spirit,

66
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:18,300
this positive force that we know we can perceive with our obvious logic and reason,

67
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,280
the

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,640
I'm going to tie one on.

69
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Okay, you go ahead.

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,360
Right over here.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,720
Don't let me get you back, okay?

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,320
Here.

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,340
You tie one on over there, and I'll just tie one on over here.

74
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,780
And tie one on over here.

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,420
It's on.

76
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,660
Yeah, I'm...

77
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm aware.

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,540
I'm aware of that now.

79
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,620
Please.

80
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,020
You know, plants may be calculating creatures.

81
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,600
To most people, the word computer conjures up an image of a PC squatting on a desktop.

82
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,640
PC, man.

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,900
According to a new study, however, complex...

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,140
Okay, and now I want you to gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.

85
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:28,460
Okay, then get him up toward you.

86
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,860
Go ahead.

87
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,880
All right, I got a complaint regarding the larger event.

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,880


89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,880


90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,880


91
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,740
Because at that very moment, the Gens thanks you for talking to me.

92
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,960
Hey, Blackie.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,080
Anymore babes in there?

94
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,540
How doth the smiling head of Dobbs improve each slackful hour?

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
What a metros falta!

96
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:50,880


97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:50,880


98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:50,880


99
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:50,880


100
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:50,880


101
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,500
for all the day from the pipe of power. How skillfully he gets the sale, how much

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,380
he earns in cash, and hides it all away in pails from poor stangs reaching grasp.

103
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,300
In frantic work or lazy days we surf the luck plane too. Though the Khan still

104
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:23,160
screams obey and steals your slack from you. In rant or song or garbled show we

105
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,580
praise Bob and shun the pinks that we may finally err know what we have paid

106
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,660
to think. People like I said before are robots. That's how people are. If you put

107
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,920
an idea in their head like you know you love me and they're gonna want to follow

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,820
the life of the party.

109
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,720
Bob! Bob! Open the door! Bob! It's about to-

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,220

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,700

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,060

Bob!

115
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,280
Don't be a dick to me!

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,400
Bob! I'm trying to help you!

117
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,220
Bob is a self-described corporate guy. Bob was also friends with people on the board

118
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,380
of bad outcomes. One day this banker friend handed Bob a cardboard box but he got nowhere.

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,200
I swear to God if I get you slacking off one more time I'll shove a bird!

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,560
Mr. Johnson why don't you just chill out?

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,240
It's okay.

122
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,020
It is okay. See you in church.

00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,980
I don't like to make political statements

185
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,500
I don't like to make political statements

186
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,500


187
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,500


188
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,820
Incoming president chamber of the chamber

189
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:35,400
and he said if business or a group of businesses

190
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,780
had agreed to pay for all the outcomes period

191
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,760
I know one past life I was a cowboy

192
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,220
and I was shot by accident

193
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,960
and I was shot by accident

194
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,880
and I've met two of my four buddies that I was with together

195
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,400
here and we agreed to come back

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,120
on some kind of subliminal basis

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,960
so yeah I was a cowboy in one lifetime

198
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,980
probably right before the turn of the century

199
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,480
and my other lifetime I really don't know

200
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,280
but I know I was crushed

201
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,640
and I don't know by what

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,300
but probably a large building

203
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,340
I haven't identified the time yet

204
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm still working on that

205
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:24,140
I'm not gonna they've set me up

206
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,860
Patrick T benefit

207
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,060
Patrick T giving us the way

208
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,060


209
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,060


210
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,380
and put in on these locked up

211
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,360
obviously

212
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,360


213
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,580
but I'm not going to let you guess

214
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,060
you can sign on your way

215
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,060


216
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,060


217
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,180
he's really a good son

218
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,180


219
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,180


220
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,180


221
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,180


222
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,180


223
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,260
Wooyah

224
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm an fighter

225
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,340
manyangering

226
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,020
come to pass.

227
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,000
And when you join, you'll get two

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
spare car keys as well as credit

229
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,260
card keys. These keys are made

230
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,180
especially for your car door.

231
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,840
Many makes and months.

232
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,520
They are as thin as a credit card.

233
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,260
And they slip

234
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,700
neatly into your

235
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,900
wife or her bra.

236
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,600
And

237
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,280
you never, ever get

238
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,100
locked out of your vehicle again.

239
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,320
What kind of a bargain is that? And only the

240
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,220
Church of the Subgenius brings you

241
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,380
this astonishing extra.

242
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,620
Can I have two?

243
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,560
Hidden like an Easter egg

244
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,740
in the vast design

245
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,020
of subgenius

246
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,460
artifacts.

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
And it's

248
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,020
a money back guarantee. Yeehaw!

249
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,060
Eternal salvation or

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,120
triple your money back.

251
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,640
And if you order today, you'll get

252
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,720
Bob L. Butt.

253
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,440
Not only blows bubbles from his behind,

254
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,600
but makes farting noises at the same time.

255
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,340
He's a one-man entertainment center

256
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,160
who will keep everyone amused by his

257
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
multi-talented tricks.

258
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,800
To activate your farting noise,

259
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,940
humor, mail, express activation

260
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,880
card 1138

261
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
to

262
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,480
flatulent subgenius.

263
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,800
Thank you.

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:01,880
P.

265
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,960
Thanks to P.

266
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,600
P.E.

267
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,600
That's puzzling evidence.

268
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
Dear friends,

269
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,120
and Dr. Howell

270
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,800
and Philo,

271
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,760
but this isn't going to be one of those

272
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,980
reruns of their shows because we're home.

273
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,520
Or rather, we're in

274
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,420
Cleveland again.

275
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
And, oh, the song

276
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
there about

277
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,740
the presidents was, of course,

278
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,240
old Johnny Coe,

279
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,520
Joe Coe,

280
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,460
Princess Weave's Shorterper

281
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,700
sad, Jonathan Colton.

282
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,320
We went to see him live

283
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,220
at one point during our long, long

284
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,260
four-month trip.

285
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,300
Notice at the end of that song

286
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,760
about the presidents,

287
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,180
Jonathan Colton

288
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,240
mentioned Bush

289
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,660
and said that was all the

290
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,500
presidents so far. I think that song's

291
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,140
from 2005 or so.

292
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,560
And I understand from the

293
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,420
Wiki, the Joe Coe

294
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,660
Wikipedia, that he, now when he does

295
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
that song in concert,

296
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,740
he says something along the lines

297
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,100
of, we're,

298
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,460
we survived despite

299
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,740
George Bush or something like that.

300
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,600
We're cleaning up the mess

301
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,960
and Obama has been

302
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
pretty excellent so far.

303
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,780
Then he ends it with,

304
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,700
I don't like to make political

305
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,040
statements, and that's the end.

306
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Now,

307
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,000
friends, if you ask me

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
about my politics,

309
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,020
that's between me

310
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,740
and Big Brother.

311
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,100
Know what I'm saying?

312
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,200
Know what you're saying.

313
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,940
Know what I'm saying?

314
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,220
Know what I'm saying.

315
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,960
Know what I'm saying.

316
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,300
Know.

317
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,980
Know what you're saying.

318
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,340
Know.

319
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,940
Know what you're saying.

320
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,500
Know what you're saying.

321
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,860
Know what you're saying.

322
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes, friends, we were out on the trail

323
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,140
for months, and

324
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
it was a great trail.

325
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,780
We learned a lot.

326
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,360
We learned that when you're going out,

327
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,300
the plants on the trail

328
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,520
look gray. Those

329
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,860
one plants, they look gray.

330
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,660
But when you're coming back,

331
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,580
you see that they're actually

332
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,180
blue.

333
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,640
And I'm not going to try

334
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,540
to explain that, but if

335
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,020
you go out on the trail

336
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,100
like we did, you'll

337
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,380
at some point, I know,

338
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,380
I had a vision that at some point

339
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,500
a young lady who listens

340
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,240
to this show, and this would happen

341
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,340
twice in my vision, two different young

342
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,400
ladies would say to the young men

343
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,880
they're with at one point,

344
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,240
coming back from walking on a trail,

345
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,420
they'll say,

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,120
now I get it. They were right.

347
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,380
Now I know what staying meant.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,520
The plants were gray going

349
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,380
out, but as we came back,

350
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,580
we could see that they were actually

351
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,140
blue.

352
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,240
And I hope

353
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,420
that one of the young

354
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,320
lady listeners will pick up

355
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,020
on that. We both do.

356
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,180
I hope so, too. Speaking of

357
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,120
young ladies, although

358
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,320
Fernanda and Andy Lee Murr

359
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,940
did the titles and PR news,

360
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,400
all the collages on this episode

361
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,980
were by Reverend

362
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,420
Baby Bear. Or rather,

363
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,340
she sent in a whole bunch of clips,

364
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
and then I found ways

365
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,340
to organize them. They may

366
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,360
only make sense to me, but that's the way

367
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,160
it works. And this music in the background

368
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,040
is by Dr.

369
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,320
Zeronius from his band

370
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,000
Cult of Zier.

371
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,120
Spelled

372
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,180
Z-I-R. This is

373
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,400
an instrumental piece called

374
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,520
Impolite

375
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,880
Ice Tulpa.

376
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,280
Another thing

377
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,260
we learned as

378
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,380
we hiked through the great deserts

379
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,200
of the Southwest

380
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,440
is that, you know, it's just not a desert

381
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
until you see a cow skull.

382
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
We saw the Saguaro

383
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,400
cactuses. Of course, they

384
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,320
only actually exist in the Saguaro

385
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,040
National Park area, but

386
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,860
you know, we did see those.

387
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,420
And we saw

388
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,240
kangaroo rats,

389
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,080
cowboy boots,

390
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,820
and we even saw

391
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,080
a Mexican in a sombrero

392
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,920
sleeping against a cactus.

393
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,240
Mostly on fast food.

394
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,080
Yes, taco shacks.

395
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,280
Yeah, but a couple of times we saw the real

396
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,180
thing. But I was

397
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,700
just thinking, man, it's not

398
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,360
a proper roadrunner versus

399
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,440
Wile E. Coyote

400
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,260
desert unless there's like a

401
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,720
cow skull in the foreground.

402
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,500
Hopefully next to some poisoned

403
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,020
water. Right.

404
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,100
With a poisoned skull sign

405
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,180
on it. But finally,

406
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,380
I think in Grand Staircase

407
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,240
Escalante,

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,060
we did indeed,

409
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,060
come upon the proverbial

410
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,580
rotting cow carcass.

411
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,180
And I got a

412
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,420
nice shot of it

413
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,800
in the foreground in our

414
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,960
van, the I-van

415
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,080
in the background. Which I still haven't

416
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,100
managed to bare my eyes

417
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,280
upon, but I know that I will.

418
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,180
She has a saying, don't look

419
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,940
at dead things.

420
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,620
Don't even look at them.

421
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,940
Weren't we going to do a movie called Children

422
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,060
Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, or did somebody

423
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,360
else already make that movie? No, I thought you'd like to see it.

424
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,000
I liked Don't Look at Dead Things.

425
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
I thought you actually liked that as a title of the

426
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,380
movie. Well, listen,

427
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,280
the psycho skeletons have started up

428
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,340
in the background. This is

429
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,020
an instrumental piece called

430
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,080
Ghetto Princess

431
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,900
by Reverend Basil

432
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,220
of the Psycho

433
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,860
Skeletons. I think he's the Basil

434
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,480
one there.

435
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,280
I was expecting

436
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,240
Lonesome Cowboy Dave to call

437
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,960
in. We're in

438
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,100
anxiety whether he will still

439
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,680
have the buzz on.

440
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,060
Friends, we need to get Dave a new

441
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,840
phone. Well, actually, it's not the phone.

442
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,780
I think it's all the wiring in his house.

443
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,080
Or perhaps

444
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,000
one of those newfangled things they

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,260
call a cell phone.

446
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,000
I actually have

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,880
one in my pocket right now. This is the first

448
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,900
year that I've actually carried a

449
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
wireless telephone.

450
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,580
Can you believe it? But I'm going to

451
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,700
modernize

452
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,460
my son taught me everything

453
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,500
I know, and he taught me that I need

454
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,560
to quote.

455
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,740
I'm quoting myself.

456
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,540
But he's

457
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,360
right. I do need to spend his

458
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,100
inheritance and

459
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,220
upgrade my own equipment.

460
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,300
I need an iPhone and an iPad

461
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,700
and an iPod

462
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,320
and an iPlaystation 3

463
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,980
and an iXbox

464
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,280
and about an iMillion

465
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,120
dollars. We have to do it without

466
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
spending their...

467
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,640
Inheritance.

468
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
It's not fair.

469
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,600
I'll be able to give him more inheritance once I make

470
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
some money after I

471
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,980
modernize. I've got to

472
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,760
keep up with the Joneses.

473
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,740
Okay. All right.

474
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,760
Oh, what else

475
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
did we see that was wonderful on

476
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,260
our trip? Friends, we saw

477
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,840
every kind of novelty dinosaur.

478
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,640
Oh, speaking of which, here's a

479
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,560
novelty dinosaur calling in now.

480
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,580
Testing. Testing.

481
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:07,860
Testing.

482
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,440
Hello?

483
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,020
Dave? That's no Dave.

484
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,940
That doesn't mean any good at all.

485
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,160
Did I hang up on him?

486
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,260
I hope not.

487
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,220
Well,

488
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,200
I just don't know.

489
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,140
We'll wait and see what the next call

490
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,360
brings. Maybe that was

491
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,880
Dave and the buzz

492
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,300
has become so

493
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,240
powerful on his phone that it sounds

494
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,280
like a dial tone.

495
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,360
And that was him.

496
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,500
We just couldn't hear him.

497
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,120
He was over it.

498
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,460
Now, he may have to call back again.

499
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,840
I don't know. Of course, somebody else might try to call in

500
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,720
and trick us, but that won't

501
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,340
last long.

502
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
As I was saying,

503
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,700
we saw novelty dinosaurs

504
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,900
made of everything. It wasn't just

505
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,860
dinosaurs. There was occasional bears

506
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,040
and Indians and cowboys made of

507
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,560
car parts,

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,520
lawnmowers,

509
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,080
driftwood,

510
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,500
dinosaurs made of nails,

511
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,620
dinosaurs made of sheet metal,

512
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,600
dinosaurs made of duct tape,

513
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,580
PVC,

514
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,020
coffee cans.

515
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,960
The most impressive was a dinosaur made

516
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,820
completely out of arrowheads.

517
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,820
Deer antlers.

518
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,580
I mean,

519
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,620
if you drive around

520
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,300
America, or at least the

521
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
wrinkly parts of America long enough,

522
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,800
you will see some amazing

523
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,300
novelty dinosaurs.

524
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,840
That's all I can say.

525
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,320
We don't have any of the pictures up

526
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
on our website yet.

527
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,860
Because there are thousands

528
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,580
of them.

529
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,280
We just need to

530
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,700
kind of narrow them down to

531
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,900
3,000 or so.

532
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Oh yeah, we've got quite a photo

533
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,120
collection of giant cocks.

534
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,400
That is roosters.

535
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,240
I don't know, friends, if you've noticed

536
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,040
the prevalence of eight

537
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,960
foot tall sheet metal

538
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,160
roosters in America.

539
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,360
And we'll just put some other

540
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,120
in the background here.

541
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Some surf music.

542
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
Just generic surf music.

543
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,340
This is good to drive

544
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,340
to. Yeah, this is great driving music.

545
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,340
Friends, we...

546
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,200
Now, don't be jealous, because Princess

547
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,100
Wee pretended to like the

548
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,000
others at her time

549
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,080
weather control job, rather,

550
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,740
for 30 years.

551
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,780
And I put up with

552
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,660
you people for 30 years.

553
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,620
And I still had to work on the road.

554
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,200
I mean, literally

555
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,720
filling orders and

556
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
preaching Bob and even

557
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,360
somewhat

558
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,640
assembling radio shows from

559
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,900
inside the car.

560
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,040
Or various

561
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,100
rest areas and roach motels.

562
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,920
Friends, we could tell you everything

563
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,900
about the roach motels of

564
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,740
America. Pest Western.

565
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,360
Don't believe

566
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,460
Pest Western's

567
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,840
rewards program. It is

568
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,580
a come on and a

569
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,960
small print lie.

570
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
It is a lie.

571
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,660
They tricked us.

572
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,460
Yeah, we fell for

573
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,740
Pest Western's rewards program.

574
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,780
Don't do it. Don't even.

575
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,880
Don't even think about it.

576
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,600
They won't honor it until it is

577
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,260
no longer

578
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,620
being offered.

579
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,120
Until it is no longer

580
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,380
of any use to you.

581
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,260
Right, and certainly not to us.

582
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,080
America's Pest Value

583
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,440
was another roach motel.

584
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,400
Some of those are good.

585
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,000
Some of them are terrible.

586
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,020
Mediocre Lodge was

587
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,900
god-awful in Albuquerque.

588
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,860
But the one in Fredericksburg

589
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
is not

590
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,260
mediocre at all.

591
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,280
In fact, it's economic.

592
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,420
It's an econo-lodge.

593
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,960
Econo-mediocre?

594
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,420
And you would be surprised, but every now

595
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,480
and then, a Motel 6 is the

596
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,540
best place in town. Next time we

597
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,320
go to Las Vegas, we'll certainly return

598
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,620
to the downtown Las Vegas

599
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,180
Motel 6.

600
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,560
That was so gruesome.

601
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,580
Because it was priced right.

602
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,860
They left the lights on for us.

603
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,100
But weirdest of all, it was all

604
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,360
futuristic Jetsons

605
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,260
Las Vegas-y looking.

606
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,260
It was like a space module.

607
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Yeah, yeah, it was like a space module.

608
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,160
It was all orange and white

609
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,120
and big round bubbly things.

610
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,440
It was crazy.

611
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,300
But we rewarded our very

612
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,060
last motel we stayed in

613
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,640
just outside of Mammoth

614
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,500
Cave, in fact, in Cave City,

615
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,060
Kentucky.

616
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,600
We finally paid for and

617
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,380
stayed in a wigwam

618
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,340
motel. Those are those

619
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,920
not exactly ubiquitous

620
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,500
teepee-shaped

621
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,820
motels. There was a chain

622
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,480
of them. There were at least eight.

623
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,760
We've seen and photographed

624
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,860
the one in El Paso,

625
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,800
but that may be a different chain.

626
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,840
I don't know. Anyway, friends, wigwam

627
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,700
motels, one shaped like teepees.

628
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,820
I know you've always wanted to try

629
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,200
one. You always wondered if they're cone-shaped.

630
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,020
On the inside,

631
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,040
yes and no.

632
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,780
There's a low ceiling, so you don't get

633
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,680
the full cone, but it is basically

634
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,340
a circular room.

635
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,820
It feels a little bit more like you're staying

636
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,560
in a lighthouse. Yeah,

637
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,740
it's almost kind of lighthouse-like.

638
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,700
And of course, they have

639
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,920
the one we were in

640
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,520
was cold.

641
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,780
So it was a little bit like staying

642
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,880
in a real teepee.

643
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,080
Not quite as smoky.

644
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,720
But

645
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,360
it's a little bit like a real teepee.

646
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,180
But it's a little bit like a real teepee.

647
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,220
It's definitely worth it.

648
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,760
Come on, when you were a kid

649
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,180
in the 50s, and your parents

650
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,240
were driving across the southwest

651
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,220
on their way to San Diego for that

652
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,060
naval officers convention,

653
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,300
didn't you wistfully

654
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,320
stare at those teepee motels

655
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,360
as you went by going,

656
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,260
why can't we stay in those?

657
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,720
Of course. Absolutely.

658
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,940
But then you saw the place

659
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,900
your parents had picked to stay in

660
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,860
with a swimming pool

661
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,000
and everything.

662
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,700
Everything was okay.

663
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,060
Because that's what counts to a kid.

664
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,640
So yeah, we learned all about

665
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,720
the brooch motels of America.

666
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,140
We kept

667
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,500
the bats

668
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,060
of the American caves from getting

669
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,220
white nose syndrome

670
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,320
by contracting it ourselves.

671
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,240
And hantavirus,

672
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,440
we took that away from the rodents.

673
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,060
Yeah, Dave has not called.

674
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,000
Dave has not called back. I'm looking for a little green light.

675
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,060
Is that a Dave?

676
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,260
Yes.

677
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,420
Oh my God.

678
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,540
The buzz is almost louder

679
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,960
than the dial tone.

680
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,160
It is louder than the dial tone.

681
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,740
Did you

682
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,120
put some spit on it and rub it

683
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,100
and jiggle it a little

684
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,180
and kind of move it around and shove it in and out?

685
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,380
I thought it was nose grease.

686
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
I did the woo dance.

687
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,140
I did all kinds of weird stuff

688
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,280
and it didn't make a darn bit of difference.

689
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,220
Your phone

690
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,580
is like my brain

691
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,200
and the PlayStation 3

692
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,920
that my nephew gave me.

693
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,940
It's been sitting there

694
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,920
restoring the hard disk

695
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,460
for 48 hours now.

696
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,900
Actually, I gave up.

697
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,300
It's

698
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,400
I

699
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,700
thought I had a PlayStation 3

700
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,340
and then it didn't.

701
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,940
Unless I could.

702
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,040
Hey, the buzz went down.

703
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
It went down?

704
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,640
Yeah, you've been spitting on it, haven't you?

705
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,980
You dribbled on that buzz.

706
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
I was doing some more stuff.

707
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,780
I was making some more woo dance noises.

708
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,380
Well, the woo woo dance is good.

709
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,780
I can actually hear the background now.

710
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,400
Yeah.

711
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,240
Surf music background.

712
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah.

713
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,840
Bob, we don't need background.

714
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,220
We'll just have Dave do that.

715
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,320
Dave and his buzz can keep the show going

716
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,980
for how much longer do we have?

717
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,180
Another 20 minutes or so.

718
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,740
Oh my God.

719
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,000
Dave's buzz is like a surf

720
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,240
behind the surf music.

721
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,640
It's a low shushing sound.

722
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, it's the surf shush.

723
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,920
The sound of the tectonic plates moving.

724
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,220
It doesn't sound like it.

725
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,880
It's the plate in my head.

726
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,620
I noticed it was some sort of fractal

727
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,660
kind of interference coming through my brain

728
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,960
when I was messing with the other phone.

729
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,380
I heard like computer noises.

730
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,940
Like...

731
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,100
I think I've been dishonorably discharged

732
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,560
from the foreign servers

733
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,700
by having the...

734
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:34,700


735
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,780
someone messing with my phone.

736
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,280
No one's messing with your phone, Dave.

737
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,840
Besides you.

738
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,900
You could...

739
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,060
I mean, I know we want to blame the conspiracy,

740
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,940
but I think you need a new everything.

741
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,760
I know I do.

742
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,740
I mean, we really...

743
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,720
Princess, we and I kind of need a new everything.

744
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,020
I need a new shoulder socket.

745
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,340
I'm not kidding about that.

746
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,820
You don't know.

747
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,700
It may be able to be rehabbed or...

748
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,560
I don't know.

749
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


750
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


751
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


752
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


753
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


754
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


755
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


756
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


757
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


758
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,560


759
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,180
Shot with cortisone and fixed.

760
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,280
You just don't know yet.

761
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,720
I'll try the Chinese medicines first

762
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,180
because, you know, that's a lot of money,

763
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,440
all that rotator cuff stuff and everything.

764
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah.

765
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,820
I'll have to ask Isaac Bonowitz

766
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,260
about that Chinese medicine.

767
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,240
Now, now.

768
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,420
That wasn't Chinese medicine.

769
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,960
That's not a Chinese name.

770
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,300
Let's see.

771
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,000
I'll ask...

772
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Ding, ding, doink.

773
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,560
Dave, Princess, we and I have been studying...

774
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,000
I've noticed that.

775
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,900
Well, I mean, we're wandering around all these places

776
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,220
like Valley of Fire in Nevada and Red Rock Canyon,

777
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,980
and we even made it to Goblin Valley,

778
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,780
Goblin Valley State Park in Utah.

779
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,660
These massive eruptions from the subconscious of the Earth

780
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,580
disturb everybody that sees them.

781
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:05,020
Oh, we love those eruptions from the Earth.

782
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,540
The weather.

783
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,520
Whether they are still merely igneous

784
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,840
or if they devolved into sedimentary rock

785
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,440
or even if they became metamorphic rock.

786
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,020
It's twisted under pressure,

787
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,680
just like Superman can change a piece of coal into a diamond

788
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,300
just by gripping it.

789
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,620
Think of what he can do to your testicle.

790
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,680
That wasn't where I was going with that.

791
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,220
Well, for the rest of us,

792
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,360
they usually band together,

793
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,560
and the friction itself is what causes the decrease

794
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,500
in onerous pressure.

795
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,420
Your voice sounds like it's being rubbed between two rocks.

796
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,400
I have to tell you one thing before I get cut off

797
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,980
or I forget to tell you forever.

798
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,380
My ex-wife's husband...

799
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,540
That would be you, Dave.

800
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,500
No, no, my ex...

801
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,280
Oh, the current husband.

802
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,480
No, my ex-wife's current husband

803
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,340
finds these huge, as big as a house,

804
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,600
fossils of dinosaurs and stuff

805
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
near where he hangs out there

806
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,680
and doesn't want to tell anybody.

807
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,560
And all the museums know him.

808
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,900
And stuff.

809
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,140
Where is he finding these?

810
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,960
He's finding them...

811
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,600
In Ohio?

812
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,560
Yes.

813
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,180
The Ohio-saurus.

814
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,020
In the Northeastern Ohio area.

815
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,500
And apparently, our understanding of the bizarre geology

816
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,460
of the Great Lakes and the Great Ocean

817
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,460
that covered everything,

818
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,600
and that was in many different stages,

819
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,380
and there's all kinds of poppins,

820
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,500
but not like the ones in the Southwest,

821
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,520
so I'll shut up now.

822
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,300
Could an Ohio-saurus defeat a Dunkleosteus?

823
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,560
Which is a...

824
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,220
A Texasaurus?

825
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,220
No, no.

826
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,900
A Dunkleosteus actually is an Ohio

827
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,920
primitive-fit giant fish-like thing.

828
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,140
Before they were really even fish,

829
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,220
I think it had an exoskeleton.

830
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:51,820
Yeah.

831
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,400
There's one down at the Natural History Museum in Cleveland.

832
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,620
Its face is the size of a Volkswagen.

833
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,040
Oh, my...

834
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,540
Easily.

835
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,040
Yeah.

836
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,040
Did it have, like, dorsal finage and stuff like that there?

837
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,560
This thing is so monstrous.

838
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,160
It's so monstrous that it had shells for eyelids.

839
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
It has bony eyelids,

840
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,660
or some kind of a...

841
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,900
like a camera iris set up...

842
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,160
Yes.

843
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,120
...with bones over its hideous, black, baleful eyes.

844
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,740
Well, I think your evolutionists are making them up in the basement,

845
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,840
and then they're producing them,

846
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,740
and they're putting them on there,

847
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,620
and they're...

848
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,840
And people fall for it,

849
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,580
because they're so stupid.

850
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,140
Everybody's so stupid.

851
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,360
It don't prove nothing.

852
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,520
God still made the Earth in two and a half hours.

853
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,180
Stooped.

854
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,180
To some.

855
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,600
I just deliberately left a bit of buzz on the air there

856
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,120
so that I can hopefully filter that out.

857
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm not going to put up with this forever.

858
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,520
However, I will tell you...

859
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,040
It did not decrease then again.

860
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,600
Well, it's back up again, it seems like.

861
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,880
The thing is, it's hard for me to tell

862
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,440
whether it's your phone or my tinnitus or what,

863
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,020
but I know it's not WCSB,

864
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,740
this fine radio station,

865
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,820
from which we're recording this show.

866
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,680
Yes, normally.

867
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,900
If it doesn't have Dave on it,

868
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,080
or subgenius shows,

869
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,600
oh, well.

870
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,280
It sounds pretty sweet in there.

871
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,200
Well, there are other times when people have worse reception

872
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,720
or transmission than others,

873
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,100
and this just happens to be one of those foregone conclusions.

874
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,320
Right.

875
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,140
Now, hopefully every driver out there

876
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
listening in their car,

877
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,240
poor things,

878
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,180
can't hear anything,

879
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,980
because the buzz,

880
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,640
and the road noise combine

881
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,920
to make everything sound about the way I hear it,

882
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,700
which is like this.

883
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,240
Yeah.

884
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,760
Yeah, that's the way I hear it all right.

885
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,040
Yeah, like that.

886
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,620
So, Mr. Chinley Greenness,

887
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,420
Princess, we and I had to make up

888
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,840
our own geological descriptive terms,

889
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,820
because we were coming upon rocks

890
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,700
that were so amazing looking,

891
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,960
and so many...

892
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,580
There were so many different kinds.

893
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,160
Usually, each given national park area

894
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,780
has its own distinctive look,

895
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,300
but some of them, like Death Valley,

896
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,500
have all of them scattered about.

897
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,040
But we didn't really...

898
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,520
You know, some...

899
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,580
There are names for things,

900
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,120
these rock formations,

901
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,800
like fins and flutes and so forth,

902
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,960
but we didn't really...

903
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,040
And some of them aren't really that accurate.

904
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,020
So we came up...

905
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,860
I'm going to tell you some of the new descriptions

906
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,940
of rock formations,

907
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,780
for instance, I forget where it was,

908
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,280
maybe Valley of Fire,

909
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,680
but we realized that everywhere you looked,

910
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,540
there were sleeping Tyrannosauruses,

911
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,480
not just any dinosaur.

912
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,940
They were all either Tyrannosauruses

913
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,940
or Allosauruses,

914
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,400
or one of those big carnivores.

915
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,240
Yes, sleeping.

916
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,640
Sleeping.

917
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,000
All of them laying on their chins,

918
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,340
on their bellies, sleeping.

919
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,760
Sometimes there would be a sleeping Tyrannosaurus

920
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,340
within a sleeping Tyrannosaurus,

921
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,920
within an even bigger...

922
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,160
There were bigger sleeping Tyrannosaurus,

923
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,040
but it's like you kept seeing the same pattern everywhere.

924
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,160
The rocks were all slanted,

925
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,780
going down a certain way,

926
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,180
and they all ended with this sort of a jawbone

927
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,860
and a skull eye,

928
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,800
and it was just sleeping Tyrannosauruses

929
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,660
all the way down.

930
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,960
By the same token,

931
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,700
you go around Zion National Park,

932
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,180
and everywhere you look, there's what...

933
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,780
Well, for the radio audience,

934
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,240
I'll say white breasts.

935
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,860
We had a somewhat more...

936
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,180
Blunt name for what...

937
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,360
They're really called Navajo sandstone domes,

938
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,740
but to us, they were white...

939
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,580
Big, swelling white bosoms.

940
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,440
They're pretty.

941
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,000
They're real pretty.

942
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,840
At the Trona Pinnacles,

943
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,140
where the Tim Burton Planet of the Apes was shot,

944
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,460
we noticed that there was row upon row

945
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,700
of building-sized rock formations

946
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,920
that all looked like...

947
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,480
like a surprised crab

948
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,320
with his claws or mittens

949
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,760
sticking up out of the ground on either side.

950
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,920
And he always had his antenna raised in surprise.

951
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,220
All of the...

952
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,720
It was just...

953
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,580
We saw the first crab with mittens

954
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,740
and thought, wow, that's amazing.

955
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,140
That huge rock for me looks like crab with mittens.

956
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,100
Let's go see what's behind it.

957
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,560
But there was another crab with mittens.

958
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,000
Behind that, another surprised crab with mittens.

959
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,900
Well, I understand the mittens part,

960
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,160
and I can see how, like,

961
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,780
big, big...

962
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,320
Mitten-like things could cover them,

963
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,160
little claws and stuff.

964
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,300
But how in the hell do you register

965
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,780
or understand what a surprised crab looks like?

966
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,180
Is his...

967
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,040
Are his little eyes bigger than yours?

968
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,020
No, because he's got his mittens up in surprise.

969
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,400
His mittens...

970
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,420
It's the way he's displaying his claws.

971
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,140
He looks like he's going...

972
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,020
Ah!

973
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,900
Ah.

974
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah, it's like, ooh, humans, gross.

975
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,520
So it's the gesture of those two little...

976
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:58,880
Yes, it's the gesture.

977
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,500
Yes.

978
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,180
Yes.

979
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,360
I thought perhaps you were reading something into, you know...

980
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,320
The face of a crab.

981
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,900
It might be a reading...

982
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
...high-contact language or something.

983
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,400
Well, now, of course, there are some places

984
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,940
of types of landscape.

985
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,380
We call them crazy all kinds of faces and shapes land.

986
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,720
I have seen those.

987
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,200
Well, Princess Wee can see a face in everything

988
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,080
when she's at one of those.

989
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,020
Oh, yeah.

990
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,540
I hear that.

991
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,280
Let's see.

992
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,340
Yeah, those are kind of a wild card.

993
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,260
They look like anything.

994
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,580
They start taking on demonic, you know, appurtenances.

995
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,520
Yeah.

996
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,560
After a certain period of time.

997
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:36,720
Right.

998
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,540
Just a few swirls in some linoleum and bam, I've got a demon.

999
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,040
Or I've got an angel.

1000
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,160
Or an ape.

1001
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,060
Or an ape.

1002
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,280
Or a common ape face.

1003
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:45,960
Or a clown.

1004
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,720
Yes.

1005
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,180
Or a baby.

1006
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,880
Or a clown, baby, ape face.

1007
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Well, that's...

1008
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,800
You find all of those in crazy face pancake lip land.

1009
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,440
It's a modular Cretan highway, too.

1010
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,900
You can go to where they have small hoodoos that we call hoodoos.

1011
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,020
Hoodoo toddlers.

1012
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,600
They're like very skinny mushroom head things.

1013
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,960
There was...

1014
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,620
Well, Princess Wee named one type of chinly formation, the giant's toes.

1015
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,680
And they do look like giant's toes.

1016
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,760
They do look like giant's toes.

1017
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:28,400
There's dripping paint rocks, chocolate wafer rocks, cinnamon pancake rocks,

1018
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,800
mint and chocolate ice cream swirl.

1019
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,000
Schmooze.

1020
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,920
That was one.

1021
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,320
It's kind of an all-purpose.

1022
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,480
Oh, the albino Cthulhu type, which is...

1023
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,900
The albino Cthulhu type?

1024
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,760
Yeah, that was inside of Carlsbad Caverns.

1025
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,240
Right, you run into those in caves.

1026
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:52,860
Hideous, nameless, eldritch creatures from the time beyond time.

1027
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,880
When limestone and water drip slowly for a long, long time.

1028
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,560
Scalagmite.

1029
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,920
Yes, scalagmite.

1030
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,780
They make Cthulhi.

1031
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,080
Cthulhu.

1032
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,900
Albino Cthulhu.

1033
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,460
Cthulhu type.

1034
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,520
That's a new...

1035
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:05,640
Oh, yeah.

1036
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,920
It's scary, too.

1037
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Fake bricks.

1038
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,760
I've often urinated to that sound.

1039
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,460
You occasionally find places where they've built the theme park so shoddily

1040
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,360
that the rocks look like fake bricks.

1041
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,940
And basically...

1042
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,740
I've got a handy and holy relic over here.

1043
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,820
You know, Princess Wee thinks all those things are formed by nature.

1044
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,460
She doesn't understand that Monument Valley and Death Valley,

1045
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,040
and all of them, Mammoth Cave, all of those were manufactured, you know.

1046
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,180
Like Disneyland.

1047
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:39,820
Yeah.

1048
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,240
In a laboratory?

1049
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:50,060
Well, I mean, they hire the finest migrant artists and rock carvers.

1050
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,860
So they can pay them less.

1051
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,580
Yeah.

1052
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,980
But they do a great job.

1053
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:02,920
I mean, when they make those balloon toots, the rocks that I call balloon toots,

1054
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,200
Uh-huh.

1055
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,420
The one with the giraffes on the side?

1056
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,240
The little toy figures?

1057
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,200
I guess maybe when you were growing up, balloon toots didn't mean the same thing

1058
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,680
that they meant when Pappy referred to.

1059
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
Don't kick your brother in the balloon toots again.

1060
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,200
Ah.

1061
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,860
That hurts.

1062
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,840
Tiki heads, the Easter Island heads that weren't carved.

1063
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,840
Yes.

1064
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,120
Because they really are the heads of giants that are buried up to their neck in the dirt.

1065
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,920
And have calcified over the years.

1066
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,820
And were mostly...

1067
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,620
Mostly of a meteorological content to begin with, which is, you know,

1068
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,660
gets back to a lot of your Cthulhu messages.

1069
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:47,740
Your Cthulhu kind of inner messages were like there is a war between the gods below the earth.

1070
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,400
The titans, actually.

1071
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,880
They call them the Pinto Bean Boys.

1072
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:01,480
Well, there were Pinto Bean Boy titans that carved Monument Valley.

1073
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,760
Really?

1074
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:02,800


1075
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,420
They're childish titans, but they get a lot done.

1076
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,020
We went to the Devil's Drive-In.

1077
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,260
We saw the honeycomb hideout of Martian honeycombs.

1078
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,960
Oh, the Devil's Liquor Cabinet.

1079
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,500
That was one of my favorites.

1080
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,940
You can really get lost in there.

1081
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,200
That's a silly talking doll.

1082
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:30,920
But the craziest rocks of all are the ones that Princess Weave labeled Corn Starch on Speakers.

1083
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,540
After...

1084
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,480
When you put liquid cornstarch on speakers and turn the speakers on, the cornstarch dances.

1085
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,720
It jumps around and forms the most incredible shapes.

1086
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,540
Yeah, shapes grow up out of it.

1087
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:53,060
If you hired a public speaker to a corn dance and you poured some liquid on he or she,

1088
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,600
then they would start dancing the corn dance in what now?

1089
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,960
Cornstarch on speakers.

1090
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,340
Cornstarch on speakers.

1091
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,380
Cornstarch mud.

1092
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,780
Yeah, you have to...

1093
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,960
You have to be able to change your shape.

1094
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,940
Cornstarch with cold water and it makes mud.

1095
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,740
And then you put that on a speaker and you put the sound through it.

1096
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:17,800
And the sound going through that colloidal suspension makes these crazy shapes grow up out of the cornstarch mud.

1097
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,760
Yeah, Google it.

1098
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,560
Google YouTube.

1099
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,280
Google this phrase.

1100
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,140
YouTube cornstarch on speakers.

1101
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,620
I know how to make pudding, so just don't worry about me having to Google about cornstarch on speakers.

1102
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:31,980
But no, no.

1103
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,760
Don't start Googling.

1104
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,300
Don't start Googling while we're right in front of everybody on the radio.

1105
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,820
If you make pudding, it'll ruin everything.

1106
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,840
I can't already stop what I already started by God's man.

1107
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,900
No pudding.

1108
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,600
No pudding.

1109
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:42,780
No pudding.

1110
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Cold cornstarch in water.

1111
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,800
Cold, cold.

1112
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,760
What else did we have?

1113
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,380
I think there's the nude gargoyle rocks.

1114
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,260
Man, those are scary.

1115
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,680
I can't say some of the types of cracks.

1116
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,800
I can't even look at those.

1117
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,680
But my favorite parts were the ones that had...

1118
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,960
that looked like my monster hunter tri landscapes

1119
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,160
that have good gathering spots and fishing spots and...

1120
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,660
As long as you avoid where the baroth and the carupaco go.

1121
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,840
And the bull fangos.

1122
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,100
And bub-el butts.

1123
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,020
And bub-el butts, yeah.

1124
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,040
Bub-el butts?

1125
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,520
Yeah.

1126
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,900
Yeah, that was from...

1127
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,020
I don't know, but Hal was talking...

1128
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,560
I was talking about the bub-el butts earlier in this show.

1129
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,200
Oh, a person's name.

1130
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,040
A person's name, bub-el butt.

1131
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:33,620
Yeah.

1132
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,520
Yeah, Chinley.

1133
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,220
That's right.

1134
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,920
Yeah, Chinley.

1135
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,740
Mr. Chinley Greenness.

1136
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,900
The proper name would be bub-er or bub-er-inus or something.

1137
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,540
Or moinkopi.

1138
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,060
The loincloth.

1139
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,240
Moinkopi.

1140
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,900
One of our favorite places was everywhere you looked,

1141
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,300
there was windgate rock on top.

1142
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,520
Windgate.

1143
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,040
Windgate.

1144
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,000
Which is the smooth...

1145
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,100
What they call it?

1146
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,660
Shred.

1147
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,020
Shred.

1148
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,780
It's slippery rock or sheer rock or...

1149
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,800
Slip rock or something.

1150
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,100
Yeah.

1151
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:07,820
Yes.

1152
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,100
Then there would be a layer of Chinley, which was...

1153
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,920
Slick rock.

1154
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,660
Could come in every...

1155
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:12,920
Slick rock.

1156
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,800
Slick rock, that's right.

1157
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,840
And then Chinley, which was more like giant toes shape,

1158
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,720
and comes in all colors.

1159
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,560
Blue, turquoise, pink, purple, white, every color.

1160
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,240
Bright colors.

1161
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,140
In the artist's ghetto part of Death Valley,

1162
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,080
all of those colors are mixed.

1163
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,580
And Princess Wee and I kept going back to that place.

1164
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,640
We wouldn't leave Death Valley for three days

1165
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,160
because we were waiting for the sun to come out.

1166
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,340
It rained.

1167
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,760
It rained in Death Valley.

1168
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,420
When we got to Death Valley,

1169
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,940
the driest place in the universe,

1170
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,720
at the lowest place below sea level,

1171
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,680
222 feet below sea level,

1172
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,100
they get two inches of rain a year.

1173
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,240
And...

1174
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:01,960
And...

1175
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,720
You were coming to have a great take.

1176
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,780
We had to worry about our engine getting flooded in Death Valley.

1177
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,940
Well, at least you didn't have to worry about your ancestors

1178
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,840
forcing their way back into the common market.

1179
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,300
No.

1180
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,080
No, we didn't.

1181
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,480
We did have to worry about getting flooded in the middle of Death Valley,

1182
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,040
which was really unusual.

1183
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,260
It was like...

1184
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,240
One minute, there's this salt, dried salt lake,

1185
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,440
bad water basin.

1186
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,980
Hottest, lowest place in the world.

1187
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,960
Next minute, it's an actual lake

1188
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,200
with a couple of feet of water in it.

1189
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,020
All of a sudden, 10 minutes later,

1190
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,000
it's a dry salt flat again.

1191
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,500
But boy, there's a lot of happy little frogs

1192
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,860
and newts and mud-dwelling things

1193
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,880
that only come out once a year.

1194
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,640
In that one particular spot,

1195
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,060
separating the cold...

1196
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,640
I mean, the fresh from the bracken water.

1197
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,000
Oh, God, we learned the most horrible thing,

1198
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,120
the saddest thing about a desert,

1199
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,120
an endangered desert creature called the desert tortoise.

1200
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,440
The desert tortoise only gets to drink

1201
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
maybe every year or two.

1202
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,920
Holy crap.

1203
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,360
So it takes them a long, long time to fill their bladder.

1204
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,480
And that's what they keep as reserve water

1205
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,060
in case they go a year or two with no water at all.

1206
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,740
But here's the thing.

1207
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,620
If someone...

1208
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,480
If some little 12-year-old Pobucker boy,

1209
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,620
some little Kwait or Monsko boy

1210
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,520
comes up and scares that tortoise,

1211
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,300
it will flush all of its water out.

1212
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,280
It will void its water, all of it.

1213
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,380
And it might take it another five years

1214
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,640
to build up one single decent urination.

1215
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,240
Bladderful.

1216
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,180
What a valuable lesson for kids today.

1217
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,080
Do not attempt to frighten a desert tortoise.

1218
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,100
You will literally scare...

1219
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,400
It's bladder for five years.

1220
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:02,780
Right.

1221
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,420
You'll scare the water out of it.

1222
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,060
You may have a hard time breaking the, you know,

1223
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,580
contents of what you're saying down

1224
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,480
so the children understand what you're actually saying.

1225
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,780
Don't frighten the tortoise or he'll pee too much.

1226
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,980
But I think when they hear the final part of it

1227
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,340
about going to the bathroom or making a turtle pee...

1228
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,220
Oh, they'll just run around looking for those turtles

1229
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,520
and scaring them deliberately.

1230
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,140
Let's make him pee five years' worth of his life away.

1231
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,080
Because we're stupid kids.

1232
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,400
And they'll be facing each other a bunch of weird pictures they drew

1233
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,280
of things that actually scare them worse.

1234
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,080
And then the thing will just keep multiplying and multiplying

1235
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,520
and it'll go geometric and stuff.

1236
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,940
Well, everywhere you go, there's bacteria.

1237
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,700
And we've got ten minutes to go, Dave.

1238
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,520
And I'm going to...

1239
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,400
Because of that and the buzz,

1240
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,100
I'm going to fade you out

1241
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,080
and let us end this show with some more music

1242
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,620
and some more music.

1243
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1244
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1245
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1246
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1247
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1248
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1249
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1250
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1251
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1252
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1253
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1254
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1255
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


1256
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,800
There's a Rudy Schwartz project song coming up.

1257
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,760
And we hit this.

1258
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,780
Jonathan Colton.

1259
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,360
One last time.

1260
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,000
Bacteria.

1261
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,120
Bacteria.

1262
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,620
Look, there's bacteria.

1263
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,000
Bacteria.

1264
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,080
Bacteria.

1265
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,280
You might not see them, but they're there.

1266
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:20,940
Bacteria.

1267
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,020
Bacteria.

1268
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,880
Everything you touch.

1269
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:24,980
Bacteria.

1270
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,000
Bacteria.

1271
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,320
That's right.

1272
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,680
Salmonella bacteria.

1273
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,860
But we have to watch out for bacteria.

1274
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,940
That can spoil our chicken.

1275
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,000
Bacteria practically everywhere.

1276
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,860
Everywhere you look.

1277
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:36,960
In the kitchen.

1278
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,940
Inside the cooler.

1279
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,180
In the dining area.

1280
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,260
In the restrooms.

1281
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,820
On our raw chicken.

1282
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,720
And like I said, bacteria.

1283
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,180
Bacteria.

1284
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,520
Look, there's bacteria.

1285
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:52,980
Bacteria.

1286
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,100
Bacteria.

1287
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,300
You might not see them, but they're there.

1288
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:56,960
Bacteria.

1289
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,120
Bacteria.

1290
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,380
Bacteria.

1291
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,860
Everything you touch.

1292
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,000
Bacteria.

1293
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,020
Bacteria.

1294
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,340
That's right.

1295
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,700
Salmonella bacteria.

1296
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,400
Salmonella grows on raw chicken, especially old chicken.

1297
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,920
Moist foods like our salad, staph bacteria on the left, and strep bacteria on the right.

1298
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,880
Salmonella.

1299
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,860
Shigella.

1300
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:18,860
Clostridium.

1301
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,820
If you didn't wash your hands, they would become breeding grounds for bacteria.

1302
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,160
Bacteria.

1303
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,540
Look, there's bacteria.

1304
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,020
Bacteria.

1305
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:29,840
Bacteria.

1306
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,280
You might not see them, but they're there.

1307
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,000
Bacteria.

1308
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,120
Bacteria.

1309
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,840
Everything you touch.

1310
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,000
Bacteria.

1311
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,000
Bacteria.

1312
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,320
That's right.

1313
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,640
Salmonella bacteria.

1314
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,900
Fever.

1315
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,860
Cramps and fever.

1316
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,060
Dysentery.

1317
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,000
Fever.

1318
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,000
V-v-v-fever.

1319
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,140
Vomiting.

1320
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,600
Vomiting.

1321
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,000
Chills.

1322
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,800
Cramps.

1323
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,000
Chills.

1324
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,480
And chills and cramps.

1325
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,780
One square inch.

1326
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,280
Half a billion.

1327
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,680
Salmonella bacteria.

1328
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,840
These bacteria really sound so good.

1329
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,840


1330
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,840


1331
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,840


1332
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,840


1333
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,840


1334
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,840


1335
00:50:59,840 --> 00:50:59,960
It's a good thing they're in the series.

1336
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,100
They are when they're left unchecked.

1337
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,980
And it could mean a trip to the hospital.

1338
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,960
For someone.

1339
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,960
Our customers.

1340
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,720
Wow.

1341
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:08,980
Ourselves.

1342
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,820
All right.

1343
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,860
Our chicken.

1344
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,820
All right.

1345
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,500
And our reputation.

1346
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,860
All right.

1347
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,280
All right.

1348
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,440
You mean bacteria on me right now?

1349
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,320
Clean, clean and then clean again.

1350
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:18,920
Bacteria.

1351
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,140
Bacteria.

1352
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,640
Look, there's bacteria.

1353
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,020
Bacteria.

1354
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,080
Bacteria.

1355
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,300
You might not see them, but they're there.

1356
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:26,920
Bacteria.

1357
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,080
Bacteria.

1358
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,820
Everything you touch.

1359
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:29,820


1360
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:29,820


1361
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:29,820


1362
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:29,820


1363
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:29,820


1364
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,000
Bacteria.

1365
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,000
Bacteria.

1366
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,300
That's right.

1367
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,700
Salmonella bacteria.

1368
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,740
Salmonella bacteria.

1369
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,720
Salmonella bacteria.

1370
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,540
So, do the new ones redeem as much of a Bobby's soul as the old pamphlets?

1371
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,360
Oh, more.

1372
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,640
I know the shows that take the show to.

1373
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,260
The new ones are much more highly compressed and efficient.

1374
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:57,720
The new pamphlets can actually extract up to 99.9% of a Bobby's soul in less than nine

1375
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,660
tenths of a second.

1376
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:07,240
So, the definitely, the slack, you can acquire a whole lot more slack faster and at cheaper

1377
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,020
cost with the new more efficient subgenius pamphlets.

1378
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,620
Yes, even you, those of you who have, who can barely discern white from black, day from

1379
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,400
night, no reflection upon your vision of course.

1380
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,540
It is important to make those distinctions.

1381
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,560
Are asking those, those decisions.

1382
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,700
Making those decisions in the help book of Jader.

1383
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm stretched for a mile and a half.

1384
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,760
President Obama pleaded not guilty to conspiring to kill Americans.

1385
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,660
The White House says the President will also have more to say on the topic next week when

1386
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,320
he visits Chicago.

1387
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,220
The President has said conspiring to kill Americans is among his main priorities during

1388
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,040
his second term.

1389
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,240
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. says it is 67-14-397.

1390
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,540
That's right.

1391
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,520
PR News.

1392
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,220
PR News.

1393
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,240
The Labor Department says you're listening to PR News in Washington.

1394
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,280
You can do incredible tricks automatically.

1395
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,780
Especially designed pool rooms.

1396
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,060
Hey, is there any tie between Bob's wife Connie and the conspiracy?

1397
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,280
Obviously.

1398
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,820
There's obviously a connection there.

1399
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,600
You seem to have penetrated a simple analog in the allegory.

1400
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:16,820
Right.

1401
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:23,000
There's no doubt that the word con in Connie and the con in conspiracy all are composed

1402
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,820
of the very same letters of the alphabet.

1403
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,080
Yeah.

1404
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,540
You see it is necessary for the society.

1405
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,920
You're a subgenius to embrace the conspiracy and even to have carnal relations with the

1406
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,540
conspiracies.

1407
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:40,800
To a certain degree, only in the interest of avoiding it, eventually, and finding slack.

1408
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,400
We hate to do it, but carnal relations are carnal relations.

1409
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,320
And somewhere slack has to be obtained where you find it.

1410
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,060
And what about the rest of the world?

1411
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,880
The, um...

1412
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,260
I don't care about them.

1413
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,500
We don't care about them.

1414
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,560
We want them to care about themselves.

1415
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,540
I care about me.

1416
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:57,720
I care about my wife.

1417
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,400
And through caring about themselves, they can care about us.

1418
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,680
Oh, true subgeniuses.

1419
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,760
Well, they have plenty of things to care about.

1420
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,120
I mean, like people who buy clothes for people.

1421
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,740
We know that everyone must love themselves before they can love another person.

1422
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,440
It's tough to stand by, et cetera, uh...

1423
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,560
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1424
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,300
Hello?

1425
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,020
You know, the ones who buy lots of stuff.

1426
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,060
Well, you can do that too, but those are the prosumers.

1427
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,220
If they buy what they want, that's the important thing.

1428
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,040
You're talking about prosumers who are professional buyers.

1429
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,520
Just like Homer Simpson says, donuts of the world beware of the

1430
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,520


1431
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,520


1432
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,520


1433
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,520


1434
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,520


1435
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,820
world.

1436
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,980
It's judgment day.

1437
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeah.

1438
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,780
He didn't say that.

1439
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,120
Wait a minute, he didn't?

1440
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,120
Well, it says that right here in the script.

1441
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,940
Are you one to challenge the script writer?

1442
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,560
No.

1443
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,020
No.

1444
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:39,780
Pay attention to these flowers.

1445
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,140
No, no, no.

1446
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:40,600
They are not...

1447
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,080
That's been done before, and those people aren't around anymore.

1448
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,200
Heh, heh, heh.

1449
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,400
Few know what I mean.

1450
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,160
Um, also, we had an anonymous message...

1451
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,780
They're out hip-hopping in a hot rod.

1452
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,660
...some callers are gonna come down, and I guess they're here now.

1453
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh.

1454
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,220
We're going to interview these folks.

1455
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:56,620
Did I ever do that?

1456
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,020
Did I ever do that?

1457
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,440
I'll break you up.

1458
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,500
They're out hip-hopping in a hot rod.

1459
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:57,780
They're out hip-hopping in a hot rod.

1460
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:57,780


1461
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,020
I'm gonna be on the air.

1462
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,080
Sure, when you were a big kid, you could drive.

1463
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,080
You could come down to the show.

1464
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:08,140
I've heard that if you have at least three shows on your hard drive, your computer will

1465
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,980
run faster.

1466
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,140
Um, it's, uh...

1467
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,300
Now the ball gags are placed in...

1468
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,100
If you've downloaded at least three shows from...

1469
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,260
If you've downloaded at least three shows from...

1470
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:22,540
Well, I mean, uh, Serpent X is much harder to say, because I like to just say QuiveringBrain.com.

1471
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,020
It's more like an education service.

1472
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,480
If you go to www.QuiveringBrain.com, I'm gonna put up a link to the show, and you can

1473
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:27,480


1474
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:27,480


1475
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,000
find the link for the Puzzling Evidence, uh, show.

1476
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,280
Is that Puzzling Evidence plus P show?

1477
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,580
Is that the one you're, uh...

1478
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,920
Well, they're all there, even the ones without P.

1479
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,480
Oh.

1480
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,300
I did.

1481
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,020
P and Slack, same stuff.

1482
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,260
It can be.

1483
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,520
I always thought that...

1484
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,900
Well, I just wanna know three things.

1485
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,740
P, damn, ass.

1486
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,520
What does that have to do with anything?

1487
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,120
That's what I've gotta find out, and that's your challenge here at the last waning few

1488
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,040
minutes of the show.

1489
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,440
And rewind to the show.

1490
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:57,440


1491
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:57,460
And rewind to the show.

1492
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,460


1493
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,460


1494
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,460


1495
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,460


1496
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,460


1497
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,460


1498
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,140
So, Carl, 848-4425, and...

1499
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,580
I'm gonna put away my stuff.

1500
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,780
No, you can't call, because you've already called.

1501
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,620
Because your mom said so.

1502
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,380
End of show.

1503
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,220
You're all beautiful right now.

1504
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,780
End of show.

1505
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,520
You have to hang up and call back to call.

1506
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,940
Bob, it was awesome meeting you.

1507
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,880
This has been an incredible three days.

1508
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,280
This is a good thing.

1509
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,420
Right.

1510
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:16,940
Okay.

1511
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,620
Bob, best of luck.

1512
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,160
Thanks, man.

1513
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:21,840
Thanks, man.

1514
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:24,860
Thanks, man.

1515
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,520
Thanks, man.

1516
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,940
Thanks, man.

1517
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,460
Thanks, man.

1518
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1519
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1520
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1521
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1522
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1523
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1524
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1525
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1526
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1527
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,460


1528
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,040
Thanks, man.

1529
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:51,760
Hey, Eli Green!

1530
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,680
HEY, EDITASS!

1531
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,480
HE CALLS Girls

1532
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,640
to seduce complete record collectors into buying multiple copies of the same release.

1533
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,140
Rudy, that's not very nice.

1534
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,940
No shit, Waldo. And to make the whole scam even more insulting,

1535
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,880
let's start off with a pointless little ditty on the subject of vomit.

1536
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,840
Vomit?

1537
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,280
That's right, Waldo. Vomit. Go grab a corn dog and pull up a chair.

1538
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:13,760
Okay.

1539
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,360
I would have preferred an assassin's pubic hair.

1540
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:37,020
I would have preferred an assassin's pubic hair.

1541
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,780
Who was a-rockin' and a-rollin' with a boogie woogie blue?

1542
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,760
Good God Almighty, make my puke just turn blue!

1543
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,720
Twistin' and a-frugin' and a-shoot-a-doop-a-doo!

1544
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,940
Turn out the lights! Turn out the lights!

1545
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,800
Turn out the lights and let my vomit come through!

1546
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,720
Well, poppers in the kitchen could be a good idea.

1547
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,740
Hypnoggy beats too.

1548
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,820
Mommas havin' sex with the pot-black crew.

1549
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,780
Sisters got a yeast inflation, don't know what to do.

1550
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,920
Turn out the lights! Turn out the lights!

1551
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,820
Turn out the lights and let my vomit come through!

1552
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,840
Hey, oh, rockin' Terry, rockin'!

1553
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,080
Turn out the lights! Turn out the lights!

1554
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,980
Turn out the lights and let my vomit come through!

1555
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1556
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,800
Oh, sweet patootie, Bud's got a beauty!

1557
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,780
Oh, sweet patootie, Bud's got a beauty!

1558
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,800
Oh, sweet patootie, Bud's got a beauty!

1559
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,600
Who has put pubic hair on my coke?

1560
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,720
Well, Jerry Cossett suckin' on Arsenio's dick!

1561
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,620
Bud's got a corn dog roasted on a stick!

1562
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,600
Satan's got a present that he wants to give to you!

1563
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,840
Turn out the lights! Turn out the lights!

1564
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,480
Turn out the lights and let my vomit come through!

1565
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,720
I said, I'd turn out the lights! Turn out the lights!

1566
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,700
Turn out the lights and let my...

1567
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,160
...pot-black crew!

1568
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:21,660
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1569
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,380
For free information,

1570
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:38,220
write to P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1571
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:44,420
or see www.subgenius.com

1572
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,520
Praise Bob!

1573
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,040
For Sire, there is no more money!

1574
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,480
We gotta get some money!

1575
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,120
That dirty purgish hark of backflag!

1576
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,640
We wantin' Philip Buck to Burton!

1577
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:01,960
Perkaluma Burton!

1578
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,000
Thurton first tonight!

1579
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,060
Beep! Beep! Beep!

1580
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,240
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1581
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,580
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1582
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:19,680
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1583
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,120
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!

1584
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,120
But if you truly love Bob,

1585
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,680
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1586
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,700
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1587
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,180
or especially the radio page,

1588
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,200
or the catalog store pages,

1589
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,500
and help out financially as best you can.

1590
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,860
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1591
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,520
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1592
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,460
But some of you still have jobs.

1593
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,780
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1594
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,840
even if it's only once a month,

1595
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,360
from enough of you.

1596
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,780
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1597
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,080
All we're saying is that

1598
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,500
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs,

1599
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,540
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1600
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,140
We also take checks and money orders to

1601
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,040
Subgenius Foundation.

1602
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:20,880
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1603
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,480
44118.

1604
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,740
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
