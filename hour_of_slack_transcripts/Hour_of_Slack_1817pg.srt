1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Oh Bob, oh Bob, won't you spare me over to another show?

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,120
Get ready for the judgment day.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,520
What?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,920
Sun is shining, come on get happy.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,540
Lord is waiting to take your hand.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,360
Shout hallelujah, come on get happy.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,860
Let's go to the promised land.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,560
Yes?

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,100
Yes?

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,340
Yes.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,720
That I heard of once in a lullaby.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,540
We're back here on the air at WWW.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,700
Wonderful Parkinson's, West Wisconsin.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,740
Home of the Thunder Bears, the Eager Eaters, and Grandpa's Homemade Onion Aid.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,360
We'll be talking with people on what does Thanksgiving really mean to us here in 1942.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,780
The war raging all around us, our feet fried, and our hands distended like so.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,140
We're gonna wake up one of us.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,320
Oh my god, what's going on?

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,500
The first thing I remember.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, there's blood everywhere.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,660
That's the last thing I forgot.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,160
No, he's trying to, he can't make them shut up.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,880
Ready, here we go.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,560
He can't make them shut up.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,220
Will you be?

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,000
He'll never make them shut up.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Somebody gag the cowboy.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
Alright, here we go.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,080
Five, four, three, two, one.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,240
And now it's that time you've been waiting for, kids.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:44,280
Your hero, my lonesome cowboy name just rode in on his automatic horse bucket.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Howdy, kids.

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,860
I had a terrible ride here tonight.

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,220
I was threatened and accosted by three young bullies, one of whom had a rancid, arid eye

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,900
that kept on staring downwards while he beat me for my boots.

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,540
After being stabbed and knifed several times about the head and buttock,

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,660
I began to scream and chased a 13RTA bus all the way down Chester Avenue.

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,740
Once I got to the dumpster next to Mary Lou's, I had visions of her in my head.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,540
Oh, Mary Lou.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,800
I had visions of ski patrol and visions of French bunny girls wearing little parkas

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,740
and teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny critterments you couldn't even call clothing.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,900
Smart guy.

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,080
And he kept me.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,900
He kept me going.

45
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,620
As the oil was slicking up around my feet and the fires were raging, making the air

46
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,900
on my ears burn down, all I could do was think of the song, Jesus.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,740
So you, uh, you go to prostitutes, huh?

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,300
And all I could think of was blij, left a finger, mean, paintless, dear best man.

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,820
You, you, I thought you knew what you were doing.

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,180
You'll never know until you have it.

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,360
And I Vaughn geometric dreams are blowing me to pieces.

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,260
It's just not real, but this looks so cozy.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,300
It's still melting depending on your imagination.

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,780
I love my pink raw Trendy dry suit.

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:23,780


56
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,540
Oh, I love my pink resistant to smoke boy.

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,680
I love all Abu nheng naog coming out and hunting him.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,700
I love to see my money beer ol sah bin.

59
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,380
Awesome.

60
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,900
I know how much you earn every year and I'm glad I don't have a paperì‹œ putt.

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,060
But yeah, oh my goodness.

62
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,060


63
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,060


64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,560
Oh, yes, dear friends, welcome to our slot number 1,818.

65
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,420
That instrumental was by Captain Beefheart and the magic band called Flavor Bud Living from the album Doc at the Radar Station.

66
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,620
Indeed, all the music in this episode is from that artist and album, except the very last song.

67
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,840
Oh, and one singing commercial by the Fireside Theater.

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,600
And this background music by Empire Jazz Orchestra.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:37,320
All the rest of the episode is taken from my 2001 collection of best clips from ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB in Cleveland.

70
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,600
The great show of the late Chaz Smith, on which Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I were honored to be regulars.

71
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,440
If regulars is the correct term, it's probably not.

72
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,580
Anyway, Dave will now give us a synopsis of the glamorous podcast.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,700
The first part of that movie, The Space Princess Flies Again.

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,280
Anyone familiar with the expious exploits of a woman's various space exploitations

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,280
is familiar with a science fiction scenario wherein an antidote is found for the candidate as a human being.

76
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,880
She's vilified by her own environment and soon finds fun in the attic.

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,100
Granddad has found his own fun in the attic.

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,580
A little tin box given to him by his grandmother.

79
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,720
And the gonorrhea has gone away.

80
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,780
I'm sorry, sir.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
That was the glamorous part.

82
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,180
And then there's the sordid part about the addicts in the attic.

83
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,540
Jeez, it's, you know, weird when you have to hide your sexuality as if it were some form of...

84
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,140
Hello, Kelly, you're on the air.

85
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,120
Tim, Tim calling from Norway.

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,340
Freaking Tim ought to be slapped.

87
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,100
Doc Frop and Sister Decadence might be calling out tonight.

88
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,220
They may be calling out anymore.

89
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh, my.

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
Threatened to do that.

91
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,740
They threaten to call?

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,480
Yeah.

93
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,460
Look, Captain, there are buzzards flying over your head.

94
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,640
Not over head, just over your head.

95
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,220
Just overhead.

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,960
Doc Frop has apparently grown some newly mutated forms of...

97
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
We got him back.

98
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,580
...Zipulops, the sacred Tibetan herb.

99
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,900
But the Dalai Lama has never really sneaked a puff, has he?

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Or was he like...

101
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,440
The Dalai Lama's the one who showed Bob how to grow it.

102
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,220
Well, he showed him how to grow it.

103
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,560
But he...

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,480
He frowned on the actual...

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,560
He gave him the droppings that he started...

106
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,380
That Bob started his Frop, his home Frop.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,480
This was the first...

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,180
The Dalai Lama back in the 50s, not the one now.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In a darkened room, the lava lamps fluttered like crazy.

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,340
The love magic...

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,540
Oh, it's a party.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,200
I'm sick.

113
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
A broken party, friends.

114
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,840
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,800
It's a destroyed party.

116
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,580
It's gonna destroy your mind.

117
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,360
Mama told you not to come, and yet you did.

118
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,640
You played with yourself, and you came to the party, and you did it.

119
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,460
You came, and you did it, and you took it.

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,140
You took it all the way.

121
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
You took all of them.

122
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,780
Too much was always better than enough.

123
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,000
That's what Bob said.

124
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,760
And so you went ahead and did it, and now you've got to face the consequences.

125
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
You've got to face the consequences.

126
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,240
You've got to face the consequences.

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,780
You've got to face the consequences.

128
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,600
You've got to face the consequences.

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,900
You're beautiful.

130
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:23,980
You're beautiful.

131
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,460
Have you ever heard of close changes on planet Theron?

132
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,020
Because they did.

133
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,060
Oh, yeah.

134
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,860
They did actually abduct this iglesbian, took him to planet Theron.

135
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,240
Right.

136
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Man, I forgot all about that.

137
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,060
And that was some tight changes right there.

138
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,440
Tight changes and some tai chi on top of it.

139
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,300
Well, you know, you have to keep the body and mind functioning.

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,600
Right.

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,500
You have to kind of keep the synapses fried.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,460
That's what it's all about.

143
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,240
And make sure you don't eat too many cholesterol.

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,960
All connected.

145
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,400
Right.

146
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
Because they can control your mind.

147
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,440
Right.

148
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,340
The cholesterolization controls your mind.

149
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,540
That's right.

150
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,780
It's all a dream.

151
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,400
It's all in your mind.

152
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,200
I thought the cholesterol.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,260
My mind.

154
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,780
The cholesterol.

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,580
I thought the triglycerides were in my brain.

156
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,560
It's in your brain.

157
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,060
My mind.

158
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,960
It's in your brain.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
You're my friend.

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,840
My mind is my friend.

161
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,360
My mind is my mind.

162
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,800
My mind is my mind.

163
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,480
My mind is my mind.

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,120
My mind is my mind.

165
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,320
But that's so fine.

166
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,780
Fine.

167
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,960
Those patches.

168
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,300
What path?

169
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,880
A continent.

170
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,260
I don't mind.

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,320
I don't mind.

172
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,880
We'll have to go on reading off the magma and report.

173
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Mind your own business.

174
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,500
What path?

175
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,040
A continent.

176
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,400
I used to pray to it night and rubber leg.

177
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,180
Don't mind me.

178
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,320
My rubber leg was getting a little bit.

181
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,480

182
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,320
But that's the fine thing.

183
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,860
Those arches.

184
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,100
You could get in there and breathe.

Forget about the waterline machines coming back.

188
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,460
You could start again.

189
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,860
Start a whole new life.

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Oh.

191
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm gonna get high.

192
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,380
I'm gonna get high and go to one of them spaced out trans-so concerts.

193
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,380
I'm gonna get high.

194
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:43,780
I'll try some of that mace mixed with DMT mixed with marijuana mixed with Everclear.

200
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,900
You'd sever the connection between your right and left brains.

201
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,660
Now if you want to get a buzz on, dude, you won't be able to tell the difference between

your car and your glasses.

Reagan achieved that state without even trying.

we know how to grow your own green sexuality.

282
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,660
But, that's you.

283
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,380
If we can keep the mechanical tractors

284
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,320
from smoking the crops,

285
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,740
it'll all be yours.

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,280
And the sex organs is all the fun.

287
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Poor upside.

288
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,900

I'm so wet.

291
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,220
Now, what we need to do

292
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,240
is take a little bit

293
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,560
of these nose hairs down.

294
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,800
And we look so cute.

Well, we're not into colloquialisms, baby.

306
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,940
Well, the colloquials like to smoke it.

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,820
Others, though,

308
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,380
where I come from,

311
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,180
That's the way a North Texan does it

312
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,360
in November to commemorate the

313
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I remember when Bob was in Korea.

314
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,340
He was shot 24 times in the abdominal muscle.

315
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
And he didn't desire quinine

316
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
or any of that alpha-stic himself.

317
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,920
And when the medics came by,

318
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,560
he asked for pure 100% has you brought?

319
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,980
I said, first officers and first officers.

320
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,880
JFK was in the problem.

321
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,900
When he was with that was what Jackie

322
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,420
was crawling over the back of the

323
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,420
the limo to get out of the trunk.

324
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,060
So his head blew up.

325
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,680
He must need more of his frappy.

326
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,860
Here you hear you.

327
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,420
The case of Bob Dobbs

328
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,980

Bailiff, could you please

333
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,020
bring in the bleeding head of Arnold Fluxus?

334
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,420
E.N. Palmer.

335
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,520
He said something.

336
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,660
Are you guys giving out legal advice?

337
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
Yes, we are calling in for legal advice.

338
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,160
You will.

339
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,420
You got the right people.

340
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,860
Okay.

341
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,780
If you wanted to, like, sell your body

342
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,860
to a necrophiliac, but you were still alive,

343
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,380
you know, like, just get the money in advance

344
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,840
and like just promise to take care of it, you know, and,

345
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,840
you know, like not, you know, mess it up.

346
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,260
Or anything.

347
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,380
And, you know, would that be legal?

348
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,760
Did you make a contractual obligation

349
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,300
with this person stating that?

350
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, I'm considering it. Yeah.

351
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,700
Okay.

352
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,220
And at the moment of your death

353
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,200
in this contract, it is written

354
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,660
that he will be able to perform rude stunts in the bus with you?

355
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah.

356
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,780
Is this an exclusive contract?

357
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,780
Would would anybody can others get in on it?

358
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,840
I don't know.

359
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,380
Is he?

360
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,560
Well, you know, I'm just saying, would that be legal

361
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,520
to sell your body to someone after after you were dead?

362
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,780
Speaking of pro choice issues.

363
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,620
If somebody, for instance, it not just for the pure fun of of necrophilia,

364
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,520
which I'm sure most people out there enjoy from time to time.

365
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,580
Many religious people do is sort of sell their body

366
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,060
to the highest bidder for what happens after death.

367
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,840
Well, that's why the Chinese had to invade Tibet.

368
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,220
They were selling stiffs as love corpses for their strange worship.

369
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,040
Activity service as payment to the gods.

370
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,400
Lip service and to buy into to so that the gods then can use them after death.

371
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,920
But.

372
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,480
That's to use their souls, not their bodies, I guess.

373
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Now, God can do that.

374
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,640
Why not man?

375
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,420
We'll see world where man now think like a lawyer.

376
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,120
Okay, God, calm down.

377
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,600
So man, think like a lawyer for a second.

378
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,600
Oh, this cadavre is greater than God.

379
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,340
This corpse or cadaver, whichever we call it, is non exosqueezes.

380
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,280
Hock's pro quo, meaning it is not a cadaver until some certain point in time

381
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,840
at which her contractual obligation begins and his.

382
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,260
Do you have to be from a.

383
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,560
You know what?

384
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
She's talking about Bob called you, didn't he?

385
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,540
Young lady.

386
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,420
Are we having?

387
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,160
I think I've been making deals with you now.

388
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,780
I know Bob.

389
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,580
This show proves that humans, it would be a scary idea

390
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,180
if humans actually did start colonizing the universe.

391
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,360
Just think they would want to take this rag tag bunch of malarkey everywhere.

392
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,920
They went.

393
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,360
You can't imagine a bunch of us out there.

394
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,480
Can you imagine a bunch of dorks on Alpha Centauri with their own radio show

395
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,860
barking up the airwaves?

396
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,660
And some other planetary system making, you know, huge.

397
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,600
We would be the horrible monsters from outer space.

398
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,760
And in fact, we would be the ecclesiastical mongrels of which your own church

399
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,000
and many other churches have whispered silently in our hearts since the beginning of colonization.

400
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:29,500
Since the very first days that the devices were implanted in your anus, my anus, all of ours.

401
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Hey, speak for yourself.

402
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,500
I am. I'm not.

403
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,320
I'm not talking through your mouth and I will never do that again.

404
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,760
As long.

405
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,020
As long as I don't, you know, those Tibetan scripture things, I'll never, ever try and speak through another body, living or dead.

406
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,540
But my own.

407
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:52,380
I say get those inserted devices out of yourself one expellation at a time.

408
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,540
I say get it while you can.

409
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,480
Every fart.

410
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,560
See, there's two philosophies right there.

411
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,420
Takes another few molecules of that device out with it.

412
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,900
Stan says get the devices out with the church of the subgenius as your assisterator.

413
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,740
Chaz says your assisterator will be those flatulent devices.

414
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,100
The booster rocket number one.

415
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,600
Hi, neighbors.

416
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,880
I'm Edgar Allan Paul, manager of Bird of Prey Motors, where you can follow the feathers to under the sign of the black bird.

417
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,480
If you've been turned down before, never more, never more.

418
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah, that's right, Nick.

419
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,480
That's my bird, Nick.

420
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,140
And I guess I know a bird when I see one.

421
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,960
Even if you've been killed in an auto accident.

422
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,280
And can't get your driver's license back from the police, we'll help you.

423
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,460
You know, it usually takes a lawyer to help a doctor cure a policeman.

424
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,440
But if it's action you want, well, we're all actors here.

425
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,140
And here.

426
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,840
And here.

427
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,240
At all the Bird of Prey garages in Gotham and Metropolis.

428
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,340
And now in Duckburg, dockside at the corner of something Pumpin Avenue.

429
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:02,220
Well, for precision auto salvage, body belts, and transmission problems, too, y'all come on down to where the president stands under every car.

430
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,940
That's the Bird of Prey garages serving the Tri-City area since 10-1-0.

431
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,240
9 o'clock.

432
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,980
Every morning.

433
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,920
When do we close?

434
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,480
Never more, never more.

435
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,060
I will stand upon my end.

436
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Until this bird is dead.

437
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,660
At the Bird of Prey.

438
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,280
The Bird of Prey garage.

439
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,680
In the loop park with Nick Gurel and Nicole.

440
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,600
Thank you to the Fireside Theatre.

441
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,940
Before that, except for the Captain Beefheart song Hot Head, it's been in the air.

442
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:35,940


443
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:35,940


444
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,120
ESO Swamp Radio from old WCSB Cleveland all the way up.

445
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,740
Then it's going to continue to be ESO Swamp Radio almost all the way down.

446
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,480
In fact, let's go to the phones now and see what this caller has to say.

447
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,940
But listen, Dave, I wanted to tell you that, you know,

448
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,960
the last time I listened to this show, I was a 16-year-old runt.

449
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,240
Now you're a 52-year-old runt with bad eyesight.

450
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,920
But it's amazing when I listen to the tapes now, I actually understand them.

451
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,380
Anyway.

452
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,060
I'm so sorry.

453
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,660
Yeah, man, but did you ever think that when you were really young,

454
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,800
you really understood it better than you ever would understand

455
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,120
if you ever understood it before?

456
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Yeah, I understand that. I understand what you just said.

457
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,120
And just think that next year, you'll look back and you'll go,

458
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,460
man, I understand this more than I ever understood it before.

459
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,320
And then you'll look back on those years that you understood it before that

460
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,380
and go, but I really knew that.

461
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,000
And the year after that, my head will explode.

462
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,560
Well, that's why most of them quit doing it, you know.

463
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,440
Well, listen, boy.

464
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,920
They only like it.

465
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:35,920


466
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,260
Listen while they don't understand.

467
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,300
Listen, guys.

468
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,280
Bob bless all of you.

469
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,920
And have a wondrous New Year.

470
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,920
Listen, it's so amazing that I've been able to get back in contact with you.

471
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm glad this show, what is this, 52 years you're on the air now?

472
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,680
Yeah.

473
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,920
Well, this is actually the 55th year coming up.

474
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,040
This is the year we have to board the Discovery.

475
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,720
Wasn't it the Discovery in 2001?

476
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,400
Very, very thin air, as they call it.

477
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,840
Now, are you doing any more episodes?

478
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,180
Are we doing any more episodes?

479
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,260
The big ship that went out there.

480
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,960
We do an occasional dog food commercial.

481
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,740
Dave had an episode.

482
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,840
At the time, it was mostly been decent maternity.

483
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,660
And so we, you know, are lifted by lawsuits and other incidental things.

484
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,260
Dave's got a lot of maternity suits happening right now.

485
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,080
That's the best.

486
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,520
That we are in a decade of change.

487
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,800
We may be in a decade of convulsion and upheaval.

488
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,360
And therefore, the biggest thing you can do to prepare for the 90s

489
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,580
is to build your own ship.

490
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,880
Marvelous things can happen to you despite what's going on around you.

491
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,580
I would recommend very strongly that everyone read...

492
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,360
The Book of the Subgenius.

493
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,600
Disease and pestilence stalking the land.

494
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,120
Bob's promise rings true.

495
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,680
Ah!

496
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,160
Please tell them that I am God.

497
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,880
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

498
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,900
God.

499
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:32,360
Here's a little poem by a contributor named Reverend Onan Kenobot.

500
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,700
Oh.

501
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:32,900


502
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,100
Oh.

503
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,440
Oh.

504
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,180
Oh.

505
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,180


506
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,300
Oh.

507
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,300


508
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,300


509
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,320
Oh.

510
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh.

511
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:35,360


512
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,820
Oh.

513
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,900
Oh.

514
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,060
Oh.

515
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,280
Oh.

516
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


517
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


518
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


519
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


520
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


521
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


522
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,280


523
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,500


524
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,880
or no?

525
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


526
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


527
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


528
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


529
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


530
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


531
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,120


532
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,040
We know no one knows.

533
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,880
I know none.

534
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,720
Oh.

535
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:45,780
I know none.

536
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,780


537
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,780


538
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,780


539
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,780


540
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,780


541
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,780


542
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,720
We have a Western story.

543
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm not the transplant brand in the culture business of was born.

544
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,760
I know none.

545
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,140
I've never seen baloon write a story aboutï¿½

546
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,560
spacemakers.

547
00:23:59,560 --> 00:23:59,560


548
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
But I know none.

549
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,340
Cyjano.

550
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:11,480
happens for a reason. A sea of pink will make one think that normalcy is not misery, and getting

551
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:18,200
along with the teeming masses by being bullies and kissing asses is how things are run, and gosh,

552
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,060
even fun, because everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for a reason.

553
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:36,180
True stories told of minds controlled. True power spied in pyramids' eye. A UFO fuels our misery to

554
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:44,760
grease the gears of the conspiracy. Their lasers avoid. Be paranoid, because everything happens for

555
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:53,700
a reason. Everything happens for a reason. A salesman spoke. Our hearts awoke. Our church was

556
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,940
founded. Our hopes well grounded.

557
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:04,920
The Church of the Subgenius scoffs at rebuke, offering no reasons but an excuse, and lays the

558
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:15,360
blame and the damned false claim that everything happens for a reason. I thank you, Reverend Onan

559
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,840
Canobite, darn it, man, and the Empire Jazz Orchestra. So, okay.

560
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,980
I actually stand, I get a weird cold feeling.

561
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:33,340
My skin gets all greasy and clammy and gray, and my eyelids roll back, and I think that I can see the inside of my brain.

562
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,500
So that's your secret, man. I always wondered why you attracted so many chicks.

563
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,020
It's a brain. It's a brain.

564
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,540
He turns his brain inside out.

565
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,080
See the light coming out of his ears.

566
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
He waggles his brain at the girls, and they come running.

567
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,280
Yes, your eyes are so red.

568
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,340
It's the Dave brain. Oh, it's so convoluted. Like your speech. Oh, Dave.

569
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,040
That's right. Dave, we need to just take a few more minutes.

570
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,040


571
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,040


572
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,440
Dave, you're so Bob. I thought Bob was just kind of Dave.

573
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,940
It's like a saloon in the Dave brain. It's like an old western saloon in there.

574
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,780
It's always 2001, except for 2001.

575
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,000
Right. But it's 1888 and, you know, like, it's like an old...

576
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,900
It's 1888 and 2001.

577
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,100
At the same time.

578
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,840
And the year 2328.

579
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,500
There's them like Lily, you know, type prostitute dancer girls around, and cowboys.

580
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,240
The year 5449 is in there.

581
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,660
Well, of course.

582
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,000
It's the saloon at the end of time. The saloon at the time intersection.

583
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,120
Where Dave meets every archetype of Dave.

584
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,080
From throughout history. The transvestite hooker with a heart of gold.

585
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,480
Dave Visa.

586
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,040
Or Dave Vess.

587
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,680
The crooked mayor Dave.

588
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,800
The rich developer Dave.

589
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,960
All in the saloon at the end of the universe.

590
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,580
The starship captain.

591
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,380
It isn't a pleasant sight.

592
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,140
Handsome Dave.

593
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,780
Who wants to look at things anyway?

594
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,080
The saddled crippled lawyer in a wheelchair.

595
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,100
Especially with these near, dear eye sockets.

596
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,420
Dave.

597
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,220
He's leagued up.

598
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,640
The best man.

599
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,060
In the saloon of... life.

600
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,020
What do you have, partner? What do you have?

601
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,940
You there, partner with the one eye pointed down, the other one pointed sideways.

602
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,420
What do you have?

603
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,660
I'll have a time... I'll have a time interse...

604
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,840
Ahhhh!

605
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,180
I mean a sarsaparilla, sir.

606
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,080
We don't serve no sarsaparilla, no St. Louis sissies around here.

607
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,440
You drink a man's drink or you walk out there in the street and get shot down by him.

608
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:46,120
And at the moment that they... the inhabitants of the cosmic saloon did not even notice the passage of the time intersection.

609
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,020
But everything had changed.

610
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,620
And when they walked outside, the circus of Dr. Lowe was just arriving.

611
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,500
Now a fence and tankers and lions and... laugh, laugh, laughing clowns.

612
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,880
And Sheriff Grumley was...

613
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:15,280
The yeti jumped... the sideshow yeti broke free from its chains, ran into the crowd and carried off the spinster repressed Bridget Librarian.

614
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,980
And he and Pan, having a three-way with her, turned her on.

615
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,100
And then the stupid, ignorant, racist rednecks...

616
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,640
While getting the local town surviving Indian to dance...

617
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:37,920
Accidentally knocked over the fishbowl containing the infant Loch Ness Monster, which grew to gigantic size...

618
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:46,540
Chased the man into a giant flaming cathedral where they threw spears at him until they traded to James Franciscus and it died.

619
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,740
And so we learn that nature...

620
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,940
In its infinite wisdom...

621
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,160
Mocks man with its puny pride.

622
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:05,440
Nature which holds us in its tender grip, its mercy is its gentle cradle until we've approached the moment of wisdom...

623
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,200
And so...

624
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,100
At which time it turns its hand down and its cold icy stare out of it.

625
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,880
And so we know that Godzilla will be back again...

626
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,800
To teach man a lesson.

627
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,640
Only this time...

628
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,860
He will...

629
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,800
He will come...

630
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,480
To teach man a lesson.

631
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,880
In the form of a friendly little puppy...

632
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
Named Joy Boy...

633
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
We have already seen these things.

634
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,500
Dr. Panaram and Dr. Patel and I have spent hours and hours in mystic dreaming.

635
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,620
And this is our prediction...

636
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,680
That not only will the white buffalo return...

637
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,080
But the cute little puppy will be the Messiah of mankind.

638
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,100
Oh man...

639
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,120
That's a lousy prediction, man.

640
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,580
That is nuts.

641
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,560
That is nuts.

642
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,140
The hints are in the air.

643
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,200
I was...

644
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,500
I was hoping you were bleeding.

645
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,240
I looked at all the other contestants and noticed there wasn't a drop of blood on any of them.

646
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,820
How did you get so stiff and straight like that?

647
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,340
Oh my, what an unusual haircut.

648
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,780
You just sit down right here and cross both of your legs.

649
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,980
I mean all three.

650
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,720
We know how you work the room.

651
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,640
And you can just cross your eyes now and fold your hands.

652
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,880
And you can just listen to this message.

653
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,820
Fuhakboa Zand.

654
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,240
Leader of the Magma...

655
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,140
Uh, reports.

656
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,300
And my recollection.

657
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,840
That's right, you won't remember anything.

658
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,040
Time is being distended.

659
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,220
You're going through a temporal shift right now.

660
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,580
Mom, I'm back.

661
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,320
Mom?

662
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,060
Ma?

663
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,780
What the hell you doing down there in the basement?

664
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,120
Jesus, God, Ma...

665
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
Is that...

666
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,020
What the hell are you doing?

667
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,020
The Bald-Headed Elvis from Michigan, I guess.

668
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,040
Call 8-7.

669
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,960
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on his back.

670
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:18,960


671
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:18,960


672
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:18,960


673
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:18,960


674
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,460
on my knee

675
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,640
The pond shines dry like a lady's

676
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,120
compact

677
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,500
Lilies leap like flat green

678
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,280
hearts with white hearts

679
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,300
squirting yellow pollen

680
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,060
cocks

681
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,660
Ferns ran like cool spades

682
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,680
fossils away from rocks

683
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,660
Bees echoed

684
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,960
dark carbon hums

685
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,460
that dashed in

686
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,960
nothing

687
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,740
Nats my ears and nostrils

688
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,320
hit my brain like

689
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,400
homes in numb to nothing

690
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,460
wings stuck on liquid

691
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:52,920
bones

692
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,400
Making love to a vampire with a monkey

693
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,100
on my knee

694
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,300
The moon poured hollow down my

695
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,080
milky leg

696
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,560
Splashed still and moved

697
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,420
The wind

698
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,220
peed down the willows

699
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,680
and pricked the needle fine

700
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,200
The monkey moved

701
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,560
a fur shadow

702
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,660
Its soot tail curled in twos

703
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,140
Its lips

704
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,300
smiled needles

705
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,260
Its eyes

706
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,080
rolled loose

707
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,520
Her throat broke open

708
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,440
Glistened in the dew

709
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,300
Red berries dangled

710
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,540
like a dream of rubies too

711
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,940
Snot muscles ran down her ivory chin and tooth within

712
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,420
A locket, a pin

713
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,040
held fast to then

714
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,420
My love, my pocket deep within

715
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,120
Incenses dangled a chain

716
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


717
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


718
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


719
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


720
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


721
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


722
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,920
A man clasped me to her then

723
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,620
The messenger spoke the wind

724
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,760
that blows between our time

725
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,340
I sent you then

726
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,660
in whispers spin and flow

727
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,300
in silver dust around the pointed pen

728
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,960
Sent to nothing

729
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,540
God please

730
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,620
my mind for good

731
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,560
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee

732
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,240
Oh that thing

733
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,820
That poem

734
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,860
Eyes crawl out with magics

735
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,840
White cloth bones

736
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,000
Pile up like thrown blades

737
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,420
Rags in skull

738
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,380
Scoop soil cracks

739
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,540
Drain screams

740
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,820
Please take my hand and join me

741
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,500
Too soon its clutches gleams

742
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,780
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee

743
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,120
Death be damned wife

744
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,560
What pain

745
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,220
Killing time

746
00:33:52,220 --> 00:34:04,880
Be it life or death

747
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,020
nÄ±n spell

748
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,840
Dead or knew

749
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:16,840


750
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Ð°Ð¼Ð¸

751
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,000
I love Fox Music.

752
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:21,980
Oh!

753
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,340
Fox Music.

754
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,180
Wait a minute, gentlemen.

755
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,440
It's Chaz, the magic music sex man.

756
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,740
Ladies and gentlemen, Chaz, the magic music sex man.

757
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,180
Ladies and gentlemen.

758
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,880
Chaz is a sex god.

759
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,000
Baby.

760
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,200
Yeah, I picked him all about the past.

761
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,980
It was 1972 in Detroit City, and Chaz was doing a long, lean walk around the both sides of town.

762
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,820
Long Chaz, they called him.

763
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,660
He had big feet.

764
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,920
Long, dong.

765
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,300
A private detective who didn't keep too many things private.

766
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,300
Hey!

767
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,820
We're gonna party tonight.

768
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,660
And man, could he dance.

769
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,700
I got a good money and I feel right.

770
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,320
He's been dancing since Jesus hung in the cross.

771
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,040
I remember Chaz like it.

772
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,020
But no tomorrow.

773
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,420
He was my student down at the academy.

774
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,600
And he always had a funky thing going down.

775
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,060
What else could I do but tell him to go on with his pursuit?

776
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,700
Those magic feet even drove me crazy.

777
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,520
Chaz had been funky ever since God was changing Jesus' diapers.

778
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,880
He was a funky man.

779
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,660
Chaz put the face on funk.

780
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,460
He two- saÃ§gs stubborn.

781
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,680
He took his shoes off and burned a couple times.

782
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,020
And he took a show from beÄŸ Yon Woo.

783
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,800
Chaz andèƒ½ calculated how many milesrico he pulled back to the top-right afteroffs.

784
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,820
So he won.

785
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,240
Chaz walked almost completely left in 0.1 seconds.

786
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,240


787
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,760
Can I go next ?

788
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,880
It was beyondhanded pressure which metallicavatting really was in a half second.

789
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,720
zwotava Banker

790
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:07,880
after months of low quality looping or absolutely ambivalent with the

791
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,200
The rock of Colombia is rock.

792
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,200


793
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,320
Proud of my God.

794
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,180
Partner to go around the world like the world.

795
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,940
your nasal cortex most of the experiences.

796
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,000
You express that so well.

797
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,600
The long knitting needles, believe me, are...

798
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,140
Express yourself.

799
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,200
Express yourself.

800
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,380
It's a kind of a clean feeling you get, you know, like you've all been...

801
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,160
Clean yourself.

802
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,120
Clean.

803
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,540
Fresh.

804
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,720
Clean.

805
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,340
Clean it out.

806
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,120
Wipe yourself.

807
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,160
Find refreshment where you live.

808
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,060
Ream yourself.

809
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,740
You peppermint douche.

810
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,320
Live again.

811
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,980
In a clean body.

812
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,240
A breath.

813
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,060
Refresh.

814
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,600
Lighten up.

815
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,820
Manhole.

816
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,700
Grab rocks.

817
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,660
Move with...

818
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,240
Stallions.

819
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,380
Bowie knives.

820
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,520
Brass cannonballs.

821
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,880
And a brick chest.

822
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,040
Ah, there he is.

823
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,020
And you just put this right on his head.

824
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,760
Oh, my God.

825
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,360
I've never seen anything like that before.

826
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,440
He's got a head condom.

827
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,800
Dave has just put a condom over his complete head.

828
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,860
He's ready to dive right in.

829
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,800
I can't breathe.

830
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,620
Oh, it's doing...

831
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,140
Oh, my God.

832
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,440
That's obscene.

833
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,160
It's lubricated.

834
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,640
He's getting into it now.

835
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,200
Ladies and gentlemen, you should see what's going on in the studio.

836
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,480
I've never seen performance art quite like that.

837
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,800
Keep your heart out, Howard.

838
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,480
It's stirring.

839
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,160
Ow.

840
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,020
All right, but I need something to play.

841
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,280
Yaw, yaw, yaw.

842
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:55,560
Lords of Acid is just about nothing but that kind of Richard and Kitty Cat.

843
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,140
Well, how about a pronuncement of earth-squagging impertinence?

844
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,320
Somebody told me that people have group sex at Lords of Acid concerts.

845
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,760
I said, now, I've been to five X days.

846
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,500
And a Thrill Kill concert.

847
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,700
I've seen them all just about.

848
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,880
But...

849
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,600
And this young lady that was explaining this to me said,

850
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,320
well, I had my first three-way at a Lords of Acid concert.

851
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,400
Well, everybody had a three-way there, but they're talking about long-sliking dogs.

852
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,960
They're talking about three-way hits.

853
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,640
No, I thought they were...

854
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I think they were talking about three-way sexual activities with a prairie squid.

855
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,100
A man on one end, a woman on the other, and a squid in the middle.

856
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,480
You better believe it, baby.

857
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,060
And sometimes you can get another guy or girl in there,

858
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,360
depending on if it's a large enough and willing enough squid.

859
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,020
Depending on how big the ink sac is on the squid.

860
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,520
That's right.

861
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,240
You can always use the ink sac once it's been de-inked.

862
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,180
Can you put them together like a little pioneer toy when you were 75 years old?

863
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,740
You can use de-inking suction cup pad machines.

864
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,700
Subgenius Foundation.

865
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,420
Huh?

866
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,500
I mean, just if you had three squid.

867
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,580
Not three squids.

868
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm, of course, an erudite person.

869
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,680
Three squid.

870
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,420
Could you just snap them together like blocks?

871
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,840
And they would serve the same purpose of perhaps 100 just to clear?

872
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,620
The South American army squid will do that.

873
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,240
They will actually form bridges of their own bodies across rivers

874
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,100
so that their horny squid mates can get across at the cost of thousands of lives,

875
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,720
yet thousands.

876
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,000
Thousands more will live.

877
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,060
The reason for the psychic experiments.

878
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,460
Look here.

879
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,760
The arm is squared.

880
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,000
They're not only growing in size through conjugating and multiplying,

881
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,560
but they have one mind.

882
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,020
One heart, one mind.

883
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,540
Much like you, Dr.

884
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:00,520
If you cut off the head, it just grows another one.

885
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,900
One mind.

886
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,100
If you pull a beak, another beak appears.

887
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,480
If you shave an eyebrow, another thing laughs at you and cries at you.

888
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,360
If you pull out its fangs, it grows twice as many.

889
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,720
If you pull its ears, it wants you to rub its belly.

890
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,600
If you give it milk, it will suck your blood.

891
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,200
All these things and more can be yours at Squid Town, Prairie Town, USA.

892
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,000
My, miles and miles of furrowed dirt.

893
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,180
And squid flipping and undulating and eating every patch.

894
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,180
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

895
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,760
Yeah, Rose, Pond Rose, I never believed there could be such a squid farm.

896
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,720
Oh, fine.

897
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,240
Squids, as far as I can see.

898
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,440
They're slupping and slupping.

899
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,140
I think they're ready to be picked.

900
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,640
I got my Viagra.

901
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,780
I'm all greased up and ready to go.

902
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,180
Look, look, I got one of them fake beauty marks on my...

903
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,920
Oh, sorry, it's a melanoma.

904
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,560
But look, I got a tear.

905
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,160
Oh, tight, tight, tight pants.

906
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,700
I got a tight squid here.

907
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,280
Yeah.

908
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,540
I'm going to retire soon.

909
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,880
A little bit of that sorrel sausage sorcery there, eh?

910
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,440
That's right.

911
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,860
I like to get down in them furrows and just plow.

912
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,680
You know what I mean?

913
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,960
Just plow my way.

914
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,780
Use one squid as a condom for the use of another squid.

915
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,680
Yep.

916
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,780
And then the bigger...

917
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,540
And use it then.

918
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,360
Use a bigger one atop them.

919
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,900
We were the ones who invented them things back in the dome.

920
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
You know, back in the dome.

921
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,420
Squid with a squid.

922
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,640
Well, back under the squid.

923
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,440
You could take one of them and you would shave your eyebrow for you.

924
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,980
You wouldn't have to even sit in a chair.

925
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,260
You could just sit there and lecture it about anything that came to your mind.

926
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,260
I tried to get a patent on those things, but it turns out you can't patent a formula.

927
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,280
That's right.

928
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,320
But that didn't matter back in the day.

929
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,360
And that's all you really need to create that.

930
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,060
We just sit there with Linden.

931
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,500
Linden and having the squid.

932
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Linden and having.

933
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,400
Mammy didn't know nothing.

934
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,320
We did all kinds of songs.

935
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,880
Linden and having.

936
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,540
Happy with none the wiser.

937
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,780
Remember the squid songs we used to make up when we had nothing else to do but just try

938
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,000
to recharge our depleted accordion?

939
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,440
Knowing the squids.

940
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:25,900
Yep.

941
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,700
Didn't even know them real personal.

942
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,320
Loving the squid.

943
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,560
Having the squids.

944
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,020
Plowing the squid.

945
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,820
Squidding around on the squid.

946
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,520
Squid cage.

947
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:36,680
Squid cage.

948
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,060
Squid cage.

949
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,780
Squid soup.

950
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,380
Squid sandwiches.

951
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,260
Look at it for maybe a half an hour.

952
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,520
Squid bed.

953
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,900
Squid.

954
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,020
Squid flags.

955
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,280
Squid flags.

956
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,240
Squid pudding.

957
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,000
Squid bait furniture.

958
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,200
Squid primavera.

959
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,020
There's nothing like squid pudding, though.

960
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,440
All that stuff.

961
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:52,980
Squid.

962
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,220
Everybody's grandmother made squid pudding out of their own orifices.

963
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,480
And squid strudel is good, too.

964
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,040
When you had a dry, dry old granny.

965
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,460
Not like the rest of us.

966
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,420
Oh, no.

967
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,720
We used to dry out the granny.

968
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,260
I remember that.

969
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,040
We'd take the old granny.

970
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,520
We'd take the grannies and we'd string them up.

971
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,260
Smoke them.

972
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,120
Smoke them.

973
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,720
And for a long time.

974
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:12,960
And get them cured.

975
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,260
Two, three, four weeks.

976
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,880
We would be cured, but we would never get high off of it.

977
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,360
Jerk granny.

978
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:17,920
Nope.

979
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,480
Wasn't right.

980
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,620
Besides, grandpa didn't like that.

981
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,840
No, he wanted to all do it himself.

982
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,800
He wanted to do his own jerking.

983
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,800
He walked 50 miles a day to go to a squid.

984
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,280
And then grandma, she walked until she quit squidding.

985
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,580
She'd walk about 25 miles a day.

986
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,040
And they just keep telling the same story.

987
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,040
Everybody knows you took the squid.

988
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,100
Oh, I've been jerking.

989
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,820
You're in the old days.

990
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,060
Like that prairie squid murking.

991
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,020
I remember that old song.

992
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,700
Oh, crap.

993
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,500
Yeah, we'll cut you.

994
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,940
Yeah, we'll cut you.

995
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:45,940


996
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,400
Aliens coming to earth to get our beef jerking.

997
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,320
You know, how the hell did you ever survive the last seven years without your droinkies?

998
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:57,980
I'm sorry.

999
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:04,240
Well, what happens is if you've been around enough squid, well, they get into you.

1000
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,560
And they just start reproducing and hollering.

1001
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,040
And hollering.

1002
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,040


1003
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,900
And hollering.

1004
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,400
Before you know it, you're just a vessel for squid intelligence.

1005
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,080
And then you got to send them to college.

1006
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,920
Exactly.

1007
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:17,980
Start all over again.

1008
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,960
You're going to get done with the little peckers.

1009
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,840
Keep you young.

1010
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,960
Keep you young and quick.

1011
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,620
My feet have gone to sleep while we're talking about this.

1012
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,280
And I think my hemorrhoids come back.

1013
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,920
So if we could maybe change the subject a little bit.

1014
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,400
No.

1015
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,180
All right.

1016
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,860
I know that's the only thing you ever want to really.

1017
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,080
Talk about in depth.

1018
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,760
But for crying out loud, we've been talking about it for six weeks now.

1019
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,640
I know.

1020
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,140
I know.

1021
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,640
Isn't a boy named Sue.

1022
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,920
He cannot leave the back of the EMS vehicle singing to the various crippled victims of the gerbling problems.

1023
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,680
I guess we want to call them problems.

1024
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,080
Somebody was clearly at fault and didn't want to take.

1025
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,320
Didn't want to take credit.

1026
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,860
If you don't.

1027
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,920
Don't feed the gerbil.

1028
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,500
What do you think is going to happen?

1029
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:11,980
Soon.

1030
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,820
You know.

1031
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,460
The gerbil becomes very hungry.

1032
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,140
As his belly becomes hollow and his skin becomes slick.

1033
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,680
As the hair falls out and his eyes grow weak.

1034
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,320
He will bite at anything.

1035
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,980
The last minute.

1036
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:30,580
I will substitute the starving gerbil for the healthy one.

1037
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,320
Or just about ready now.

1038
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,320
The master won't suspect until it's too late.

1039
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:36,780
Hmm.

1040
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,340
He humiliates.

1041
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:38,780
That's the only.

1042
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,260
Hi friends.

1043
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,480
I'm Heinrich Himmler.

1044
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,020
And boy, when it gets hard to understand, it really gets hard.

1045
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,940
And when it gets big, it gets really big.

1046
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,200
We like to make it big and hard for you to understand.

1047
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,480
So zip up your zip suit and check it out.

1048
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:55,680
Kids.

1049
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,800
That's why my tongue got this way.

1050
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,720
It's all bigger.

1051
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,160
Hard.

1052
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,700
I can't.

1053
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,220
Yeah.

1054
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,980
I thought it was like.

1055
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,380
And you thought that it was something mutant and ugly, but really in the subgenius.

1056
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:06,580
Church.

1057
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:14,140
That hanging lolly gaggy tongue and that twisted face is the sexiest thing you've ever seen.

1058
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,500
That's what the subgenius women called beautiful.

1059
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,020
Yeah.

1060
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,920
And wait till you see what the men go for.

1061
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,820
Oh my God.

1062
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,240
Oh my God.

1063
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,840
Can you imagine?

1064
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,480
Have you ever seen a woman with that many lips?

1065
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,320
He's coming over here.

1066
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,780
No.

1067
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,560
No, he's just.

1068
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,300
Have you ever seen women with that many lips there?

1069
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,320
And look, each one of them has its own separate personality.

1070
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,220
I can't imagine.

1071
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:35,980
That's what you want.

1072
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,200
You want guys.

1073
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,420
Believe you me.

1074
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,100
I'm older.

1075
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,820
Once you've gone there, you'll never go.

1076
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,900
The other place.

1077
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,560
Anytime ever again.

1078
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,380
I'm speaking to you professionally as a sex professional.

1079
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,940
Now.

1080
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,680
Now, professionally speaking, saying what is the best sex position for a subgenius to take?

1081
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,980
Under Bob.

1082
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,800
All is under Bob.

1083
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,940
I thought you were going to say that.

1084
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,700
Bob is always on top.

1085
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,220
Yeah.

1086
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:05,980
He is.

1087
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:19,060
And if one has earned a reach around from that great super salesman, that living avatar of slack, then one should leave a special tip for him.

1088
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,020
And it's important to leave that tip in the right jar, isn't it, Reverend?

1089
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,880
Yes, that's right.

1090
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,220
And to use a nice clean knife when you separate the tip from all the rest.

1091
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,040
A clean, clean, clean and sterilized knife.

1092
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,820
Now.

1093
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:35,460
No offense.

1094
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,340
Extra sterilized.

1095
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:37,740
Pure.

1096
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,420
Sharp.

1097
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:59,920
I needed to bust in here and mention that the voices on that especially sexy mess of squidy stuff from ESO radio were Reverend Blipo Abernathy, also known as William Cates, the Hollywood actor.

1098
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,200
And Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the stars.

1099
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:12,100
And the most famous of all the UFOs who I had just married shortly before that show was recorded, I think.

1100
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,440
But now, back to Bob.

1101
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,460
Bob?

1102
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,520
I think of Bob as a protean sex gland often.

1103
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:33,360
And when I think of myself ensconced in a little home, a little domicile on the pipe on the ring of Saturn's moon, I can see little flocks of pastures of green sheep floating by.

1104
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,680
And what do they call those?

1105
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,180
Hillocks?

1106
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:35,380
Hillocks?

1107
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,400
Like a little cottage with smoke curling out of it.

1108
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,120
And each one resembles a pipe.

1109
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,780
And I can see myself there with my own little Connie.

1110
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,240
A Connie of my own design, perhaps.

1111
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,840
Hairy-footed, perhaps with a face much bigger than the rest of her body.

1112
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,980
I like that kind, too.

1113
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,620
I thought you did, and that's why I brought her up.

1114
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,560
She's been calling you again, Stang.

1115
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,160
That big head girl?

1116
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,320
From space?

1117
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,720
She's been calling you, Stang.

1118
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:00,920
Oh.

1119
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,200
Oh, Bob.

1120
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,200


1121
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,200
I think I hear her.

1122
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,500
I think all I ever get is your machine.

1123
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,160
I know you've been thinking of me.

1124
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:17,420
I went back to the carnival again and went on the ferris wheel and rode the merry-go-round, and all I could do was think of you.

1125
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,580
Of course, it was very hard to fit my head in.

1126
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,600
The merry-go-round was very low ceiling.

1127
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,140
But still, I was alone.

1128
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,700
And thought of you.

1129
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,060
I ate a half a loaf of bread, and then I played with myself and cried again.

1130
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,700
Then I went on the ferris wheel.

1131
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,480
I had to be restrained because my head was disturbing the other passengers.

1132
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,980
And I thought of you again.

1133
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,960
I went down to the boardwalk and looked at the scene.

1134
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,120
And all I could see was you, Reverend.

1135
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,860
Why you don't call me back sometime?

1136
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,920
Well, it's bleeding.

1137
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,680
A huge little ice cream.

1138
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,400
I've been a big woman from space world calling you back again.

1139
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,240
Hoping sometime you'll return my call.

1140
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:07,780
Bye.

1141
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,340
And I wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you.

1142
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,700
It's so strange.

1143
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,840
The steam fills my head, the stars get red for the night so blue.

1144
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,020
All those groupies.

1145
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,860
Yeah, I remember.

1146
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,060
All they needed to do was to just send their $30 to Bob.

1147
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,740
And I know that's all they're trying to do.

1148
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,620
They think I know Bob's phone number.

1149
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,460
You think that's...

1150
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,600
And I do.

1151
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,120
You do.

1152
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,140
But they think I can give it to them and I can't.

1153
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,340
I just can't.

1154
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,280
And instead of giving you their $30...

1155
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,140
I deny them Bob's essence.

1156
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,700
What do they do?

1157
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,520
They come up to you and in time they say something stupid.

1158
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,080
They play with your hairy feet.

1159
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,440
They talk backwards to you and try and trick you.

1160
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,480
If time is right, listen to the words.

1161
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,320
Time, yes.

1162
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,320
If time really existed...

1163
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,260
How many times has this happened at Divisible?

1164
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,180
Every time.

1165
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,520
Every damn one.

1166
00:50:59,520 --> 00:50:59,700
So many times.

1167
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1168
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1169
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1170
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1171
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1172
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1173
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1174
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,700


1175
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,280
I remember the last time I was playing with Einstein's secret orchestra at the Divisible

1176
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,120
for the Reverend Ivan Zang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1177
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:12,360
We just finished a song and a rush of about 11 women were storming up on the stage.

1178
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,560
It's always 15-year-old guys with glasses.

1179
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,000
Skankily clothed.

1180
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,460
If only it was women.

1181
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah, if only it was women who didn't look like kind of fat guys in those weird Pendleston

1182
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,060
shirts with like...

1183
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:23,780
With a Bob shirt.

1184
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,780
With real thick glasses.

1185
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,020
That's too tight.

1186
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,580
Guys that kind of look like us, you know, and only...

1187
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,240
I thought that was really good.

1188
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,540
The only part I enjoy was saying, you know, they're really smart and everything.

1189
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,280
Yeah, but you know what?

1190
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,720
You missed this one note.

1191
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,220
I saw where you missed this note.

1192
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,020
Yeah, it looks smart as shit.

1193
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,320
And there's a link on your website.

1194
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:38,880
It's dead.

1195
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,380
I wanted to make sure you knew about that.

1196
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,620
And you know what's wrong with those CDs?

1197
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,100
That's where they go skipping.

1198
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,520
No, man.

1199
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,400
We don't want that.

1200
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:44,920
That's a coding problem.

1201
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,240
We don't want that.

1202
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:45,960
That's a coding problem.

1203
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:46,840
Hi.

1204
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,620
How have you been?

1205
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,560
I'm watching you tonight.

1206
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,440
Are you all right?

1207
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,400
Are you hungry?

1208
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,320
Can I get you anything?

1209
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,720
A cup of coffee, perhaps?

1210
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,840
A sandwich?

1211
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,040
A ham?

1212
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,360
A glass of Guinness and some crackers?

1213
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,680
A bee job?

1214
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,680
Maybe some...

1215
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,320
Knotted nylons?

1216
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:01,880
Oh, yes, bees.

1217
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,360
Yes.

1218
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,560
I can bring you peas.

1219
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,760
Would you like some peas, honey?

1220
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,920
I can make honey for you.

1221
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:07,680
Oh.

1222
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,320
Oh.

1223
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,820
No, they don't talk that way.

1224
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,340
The hot Yoo-hoo bottles?

1225
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,120
No, they don't wear Hulu skirts.

1226
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,740
They don't talk funny language-ish for our pleasure.

1227
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,780
No, they just say, price Bob.

1228
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,600
None of them have hair on their faces.

1229
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,740
I found my copy of Book of the Subgenius for a dollar at the cutout bin.

1230
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,340
Would you sign it?

1231
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,020
Some of them.

1232
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,320
Some of them do have the little lines, the dotted lines for the cranial implants and

1233
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,420
the place where they took off the top of their head.

1234
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,320
I like that.

1235
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,800
All right.

1236
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,140
Let's have a little break here.

1237
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,280
Thank you, ESO.

1238
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,620
But here's some wit and wisdom.

1239
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,760
I pulled these from The Week news magazine.

1240
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,800
A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night and in between does

1241
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,160
what he wants to do.

1242
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,540
Bob Dylan said that.

1243
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,400
Never hate your enemies.

1244
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,100
It affects your judgment.

1245
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,640
The fictional Godfather character Michael Corleone said that.

1246
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,020
I like work.

1247
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,600
It fascinates me.

1248
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:23,940
I can sit and look at it for hours, said author Jerome K. Jerome, if that really is his name.

1249
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,340
Adam invented love at first sight, one of the greatest labor-saving machines the world

1250
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:36,920
ever saw, said humorist Josh Billings.

1251
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:46,660
To die is poignantly bitter, but the idea of having to die without having lived is unbearable,

1252
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,940
said Eric Fromm.

1253
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,920
I'm going to die.

1254
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:53,920


1255
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:53,920


1256
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,360
And now this.

1257
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,880
Oh, death.

1258
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,140
Oh, death.

1259
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,840
Won't you spare me over till another year?

1260
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:20,080
Well, what is this that I can't see with ice-cold hands taking hold of me?

1261
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,960
Well, I am death.

1262
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,340
None can excel.

1263
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,360
I'll open the door to heaven or hell.

1264
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,460
Oh, death.

1265
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,080
Someone would pray.

1266
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,560
Could you wait to call me another day?

1267
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,700
The children prayed.

1268
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,420
The preacher preached.

1269
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,220
Time and mercy is out of your reach.

1270
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,100
I'll fix your feet.

1271
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:54,240
Till you can't walk, I'll lock your jaws till you can't talk.

1272
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,960
I'll close your eyes so you can't see this very hour come and go with me.

1273
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Death, I come to take the soul, leave the body and leave it cold.

1274
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,060
To drop the flesh off of the frame.

1275
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,040
The earth and worms both have a claim.

1276
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,540
Oh, death.

1277
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,520
Oh, death.

1278
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,040
Won't you spare me over till another year?

1279
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,400
My mother came to my bed.

1280
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,220
Placed a cold towel upon my head.

1281
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,480
My head is warm.

1282
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,340
My feet are cold.

1283
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,440
Death is a-movin' upon my soul.

1284
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,780
Oh, death.

1285
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,460
How you're treatin' me?

1286
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,560
You close my eyes so I can't see.

1287
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,220
Well, you're hurtin' my body.

1288
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,940
You make me cold.

1289
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,920
You've run my life right out of my soul.

1290
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,040
Oh, death.

1291
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,200
Please consider my age.

1292
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,320
Please don't take me at this stage.

1293
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,440
My wealth is all at your command.

1294
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,420
If you will move your icy hands.

1295
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,700
Oh, the young, the rich or poor.

1296
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,200
How like me you know.

1297
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,280
No wealth, no land, no silver, no gold.

1298
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,680
Nothing satisfies me but your soul.

1299
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,840
Oh, death.

1300
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,240
Oh, death.

1301
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,500
Won't you spare me over till another year?

1302
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,360
Won't you spare me over till another year?

1303
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,760
Won't you spare me over till another year?

1304
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,820
Sobering.

1305
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,680
Sobering indeed, friends.

1306
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,020
That was Ralph Stanley singing.

1307
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,100
And I first heard it on the soundtrack of

1308
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,540
Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?

1309
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,360
That's actually kind of a hard song for an old person to hear.

1310
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,980
By the time you're my age, you've seen way too many younger folks

1311
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,100
taken before their time by illness or accident.

1312
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,160
Yes, sir.

1313
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,980
One thing I hate more than the conspiracy,

1314
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,200
even more than the conspiracy, is chronic diseases.

1315
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,480
Not the aging, that's fair enough.

1316
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,100
But the hurting.

1317
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,660
At least this show was really funny up till now.

1318
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,180
But just as the grim reaper comes a-knockin'

1319
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,740
just when you'd rather he not, which is every time,

1320
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,040
well, so too must this hour of slack,

1321
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,300
much like beans, come to its end.

1322
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,460
People say in Boston even,

1323
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,260
beans do it.

1324
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,840
Beans'll do it, friends.

1325
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:17,980
Let's vote.

1326
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,440
Home again.

1327
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,740
And in fact, now I'm going to give you more information

1328
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,420

1329

1333

1334
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,500

1352

Okay.
