1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
What do we do? Come back like this?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey guys, wanna look for planes or something?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,900
I'm going home.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,960
Yeah, I'll come with you. Let's go listen to the radio.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,000
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,680
The Self Genius Hour of Slut.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,520
You are funny, Bob.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,380
Hey, wait a minute. There's something really ugly crawling up your shirt.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,140
That's my tie, Bob. Sorry.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,660
Oh, look out, folks. It's time for the morning traffic.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,320
Today's morning traffic report brought to you by Chateau Jason and the wine that used to play football.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,700
20 seconds.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,980
Nice meeting you.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,220
No time for jokes, okay?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
Look, the hold button says hold and the kill button is right next to it.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,200
Kill button? I just came in for a cup of coffee.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,020
10 seconds. Better put your headphones on.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,520
Hey, wait a second. You want me to go on the radio?

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,940
That's very funny. Good luck.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,240
Oh, yes, dear friends. It's rerun time again, and this is a good one.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,000
Hour of Slut number 724 from early 2000.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,160
This was one of the very last shows that I mastered on cassette tape

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,460
because we went all digital after this one.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,140
It's also one of the first shows I did after moving from Dallas to Cleveland

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,980
and taking up residence on Chaz Smith's show,

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,840
ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB at Cleveland State.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,020
This intercuts some killer stuff from the 1999 X-Day revival

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,380
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra and me preaching,

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,860
and it features excellent UFO-oriented collages from our old album,

30
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,000
Media Barrage No. 11, which was remastered to CD about that time.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,280
And there's lots of music, including some period Todd Rundgren,

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,860
and things vastly less well-known like the church itself.

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,860
As I record these sentences on June 1st, conspiracy year so-called 2020,

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,700
the last sentence of John Bruner's The Sheep Look Up has come true.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,180
That smell is America burning.

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,840
But not us. Not yet, anyway.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,300
We're burning only with the desire.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,160
We're burning with the desire to share our slack with you.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,240
So let's use this fine rerun to go back in time

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,200
to the comparatively idyllic and utopian year of 2000.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,520
Oh, if only we'd known how good we already had it then.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,820
We invite you to participate in a program designed to help you find a richer, more productive life.

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,680
Talk Radio is about sharing your concerns and problems

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,100
and helping to find answers through creative solutions.

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,100
And now, you better wake up.

46
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,060
It's late.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,360
It's late.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
It's late.

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,120
250,000 K, the impact.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,100
Another quarter million projected within the year.

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,480
Enter.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,900
Come on, just push enter and it's done.

53
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,560
Which is it gonna be?

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:32,980
Hmm?

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,100
And uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out, we'll go for Sex Day!

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,120
We want you people to dance into the new century.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,640
Screw into the new century.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,140
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover is what you'll be doing forever.

60
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,360
So make sense.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
Make sure you're not asleep.

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
Make sure you're not watching TV.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,300
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,600
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch you'll never be able to scratch.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,240
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

66
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,620
A sea of Bob's pills.

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,300
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to see them.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,360
I believe you 100%.

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,220
Look into my eyes.

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,940
I always tell the truth.

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,320
I believe you.

72
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,140
Now just calm down.

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,980
The stars are blue-shifting.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,460
They're heading back in at a phenomenal rate.

75
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,440
Yes, we know what's happening as far as the blue shift.

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,860
Everyone is warm.

77
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,160
The whole universe is gonna end in about 14 hours.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,420
No, no.

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,060
All contingencies have been planned for.

80
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,440
Calm down.

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,920
You're looking to be evident.

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,740
I got the data right here.

83
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,440
All contingencies have been taken care of.

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,620
Everything has gelled.

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,160
The positive response has occurred.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Oh, good.

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
No, no, no, no, no.

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,100
Wait, wait.

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,840
Don't, don't.

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,360
Shhh.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,720
Shhh.

92
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm gonna put it in.

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,160
What are we gonna do?

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,940
How are we gonna get it back in here?

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
It just disappeared.

96
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,500
What are we gonna do now?

97
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,880
He did a little blue sparkly flashy thing and he was gone.

98
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,980
I think he was...

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,320
Look at that.

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,140
I think he was doing Elvis and his blue spangly thing.

101
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,420
My God.

102
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:13,600
Period.

103
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,380
Those fools.

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,200
Look.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
I warned the fools.

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,980
Oh, my God.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,100
He was wearing snow shoes.

108
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,880
Look at the Earth.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,220
It's gonna be so hard to make it through that little thing.

110
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,940
My God.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,140
It's the blue flame.

112
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,760
No, he's wearing one of those little hairy hats.

113
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,120
It's that fire.

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,120


119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,860
They set fire to the atmosphere.

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,200
No, no, no, he's just sitting on his head.

121
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,360
Those fools.

122
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,900
I warned those fools.

123
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,340
Oh, my God.

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,920
No.

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,740
They set fire to the atmosphere.

126
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,740
Blowing up plutonium and other things.

127
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,740
Well, that was different but now they've set fire to hydrogen and the whole atmosphere

128
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,060
just peeled away.

129
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,740
Those fools, those poor, poor fools.

130
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,640
And also, it's Pirates Galore, an excellent view of the future in which

131
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,320
everything and everyone you know is completely tied up backwards.

132
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,060
I can't play a damn thing anymore until all the lights are out.

133
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,560
And at 7 o'clock, it's Mom's Poultry Penance,

134
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,000
where Mom gets down on hands and knees and makes Dad satisfied like he used to be

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
back when he had teens.

136
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,320
It's Terrence McSquacken, singing songs about cars,

137
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,620
and a man with an exploding foot.

138
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,920
So don't miss the adventure as two more tip carries on the back of the...

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,080
There's no more fuel in the tank.

140
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,620
We have about 38 hours of oxygen left in the ship.

141
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,100
Yes, but we still believe, Commandante.

142
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
Is it not most important that we believe?

143
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,300
If we believe, perhaps...

144
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,280
The only thing that I can tell you is to aim the ship out.

145
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,040
You're going to what?

146
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,640
You're going...

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,400
Toward the sun.

148
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,020
You're going to point the ship at the sun?

149
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,840
I don't point the ship at the sun.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,980
You are going to point the ship at the sun?

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,720
Captain, I can't breathe.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm having problems with this noxious...

153
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,520
What do we do?

154
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,880
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

155
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,640
it must have been very disconcerting for them

156
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,600
to cross millions of miles...

157
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,960
of space, only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

158
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
The End

159
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
The End

160
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,220


165
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,780
The End

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
The End

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,880

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,760
Thank you.

183
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,620
Thank you.

184
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,100
Thank you.

185
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,780
Thank you.

186
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,220
Thank you.

187
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,180
Thank you.

188
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,260
Thank you.

189
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,680
Thank you.

190
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,800
Thank you.

191
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Thank you.

192
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,680
Thank you.

193
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,580
Thank you.

194
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
Thank you.

195
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,120
Thank you.

196
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,120


197
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,120


198
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,120


199
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,120


200
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,800
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

201
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,300
as those which were first called flying saucers

202
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,520
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

203
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,960
who let their imaginations run away

204
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,140
with their veracity. By 1950 some of these characters were beginning to spin

205
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,120
their stories of fantastic conversations with alleged space people. Some of them

206
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,020
expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

207
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,100
Why I was strapped to this chair and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

208
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,940
flashing off rhythmically and it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes

209
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,220
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons while pencils of light and energy flashed across

210
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,400
my body and I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me and I couldn't figure out

211
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,580
why I was sitting there and they didn't say anything they just kept flashing those lights

212
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,560
at me and and and pumping those strange chemicals into me

213
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,940
and I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there and they didn't say anything they just kept

214
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,400
flashing those lights at me and and the man with a funny head the leader the the man with a

215
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,320
strange grin and the pipe well I just want to know if you want to be in the church or out of

216
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:38,940
the church and where's the wall yeah I didn't know that I'd been snatched up and it wasn't

217
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,980
really a dream until I saw these sacred nasal positions and suddenly it all came back to me

218
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,700
and I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

219
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,920
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires in and I was like oh my god

220
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,320
I was still there so I was very boxed I came in this was very violent but alsoาก mult понять

221
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,640
I was dressed in my blond dress as well as performing the race called the

222
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,040
from the black belt I've been a duas otras oftens Paris stonetsurack hol Avoidwart

223
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:12,840
I came to you from a long long ways off I come from a planet that is similar to yours your many fears tensions

224
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:21,900
and frustrations are no longer ours I hate them with all my heart in human and to be destroyed what is your objective

225
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,000
You are not ready, but we will still save you.

226
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,960
In your quest for self-destruction, you will send up more satellites.

227
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,040
And we will be there, waiting to come again.

228
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,140
In the cycle to the moon, we're right.

229
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,280
And they came, one by one.

230
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,720
I'll be right here.

231
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:57,140
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars.

232
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Now, this man was invisible to me, except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight.

233
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,380
By 1998, every normal, mediocrity,

234
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:18,300
pink boy, admin, Trekkie, and hippie is going to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

235
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,700
Or something.

236
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,800
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

237
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,280
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

238
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,620
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

239
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,640
Perhaps.

240
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,380
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

241
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,020
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

242
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,700
But for the fact that many of Nostradamus' other...

243
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,260
prophecies have already been fulfilled.

244
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,600
But the old ones are coming back.

245
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm going to let them through.

246
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
We are here.

247
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,200
Where are you from?

248
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,100
I don't like his feet.

249
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
Let me feed you a little pork.

250
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,080
He's trying to tell us something.

251
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,480
And banjo, and birdies, and bottles.

252
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,700
And banjo, and birdies, and bottles.

253
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:19,700


254
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
And then we're going to...

255
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,120
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

256
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,400
On July 5th, 1998, 7 AM, when we all have hangovers,

257
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,520
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call

258
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
the advent of the angelic host.

259
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,000
Because...

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,220
The end of the world.

261
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,060
The end of the world.

262
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,760
The end of the world.

263
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,300
The end of the world.

264
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,060
The end of the world.

265
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,400
The end of the world.

266
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,480
The end of the world.

267
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,780
The end of the world.

268
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,860
The end of the world.

269
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,280
fpsolo

270
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,520
END OF THE LAST TIME

271
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,080
We're gonna kill someone!

272
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,300
The Exist will descend with their scientifically magic implements.

273
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,360
There'll be stalls of technology that will be too much for us to handle.

274
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,460
In one instant, all the hangovers will disappear, along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

275
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,480
But in return, the human race will have to take on living machinery so complex that those it is peaceful.

276
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,700
The end result will be equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

277
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,380
Bob, and not some conspiracy world government, must be there in a position of world leadership

278
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,640
to explain humanity's behavior to the Exists in ways they can understand

279
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,920
so they don't put us out of our misery with a snap of their cosmic finger like they did the dinosaurs.

280
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,460
The right people, us, must be the ones that the Exists make into super humans.

281
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:13,460


282
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,780
Super human over men!

283
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,900
And even then, things will be damn tough for the rest of this period, which is called the Time and Half Time.

284
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,400
The Exists have landed.

285
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,320
Earth's under their control.

286
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,880
Bob's vision.

287
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,340
Span's proven.

288
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,700
The city's radioactive home.

289
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,980
We don't know what their game is.

290
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,820
But their name is unpronounceable.

291
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,800
We don't know.

292
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,460
What their game is. But their name is unpronounceable. We don't know.

293
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,820
That's what they came for.

294
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,800
But what they aim for.

295
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,580
It is impossible to spare not mean beings.

296
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:33,600
And the second year before the millennium of the day of God come Wednesday as in the twinkling of an eye

297
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
they will come along the Warum.

298
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,480
The Yayk finans神未来

299
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,560
which are like and supernatural home!

300
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,340
And burn for sayings

301
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,480
ERS

302
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:51,340
others. They come as men, as grave images, as a whirlwind, and as a cloud, and they are now the heavens

303
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,320
of the exiles.

304
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:14,440
The exiles have landed their machines following our tracks. Bob's vision stands proven. A world without slack.

305
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,600
So,

306
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,740
don't

307
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,680
come up to me saying,

308
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:34,020
Oh, Reverend Stang, I spent my $30. I went to the subgenius show. I saw all the preachers, heard all the bands, but I didn't get slack. Where's my slack? Give me my slack.

309
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:50,020
My friend, if that's the way you're thinking, then you never heard anything Bob said. You never understood a word he wrote in the book of the subgenius. Because the day that we can sell you slack is the day the conspiracy has won. You make your own slack.

310
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,040
Bob!

311
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,740
is

312
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,080
not

313
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,680
the

314
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,420
answer!

315
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,540
But, neither is anything else.

316
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,180
You

317
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,540
must

318
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,020
learn

319
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,640
to think

320
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:57,880
for

321
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,300
yourself

322
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,440
but only

323
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,900
Bob

324
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,360
can

325
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,880
show

326
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,140
you

327
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,460
how.

328
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,500
Question

329
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,240
authority

330
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,360
or

331
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,980
health

332
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,940
Mount them!

333
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,340
Can't

334
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,060
take

335
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,700
a

336
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,300
joke!

337
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,020
Please, Bob!

338
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,040
Tell me

339
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,460
somebody!

340
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,320
Goodnight!

341
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,820
Tough

342
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,040
fun.

343
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,660
Hm!

344
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,100
Fuck,

345
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,320
iTunes!

346
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,320


347
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,000
Next night's secret artist your friends,

348
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,520
Mildred Shepard.

349
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,800
Beyond the Soft.

350
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,760
If I don't meet you no more in this world,

351
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,660
I'll see you on the next one.

352
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,720
And don't be late.

353
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,960
Peace.

354
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,160
My dad, remember that?

355
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,240
That's it, one more time!

356
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,260
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

357
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,700
Hey, guess what? That website, when we...

358
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,860
Here's the entire result of being in Time Magazine

359
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,020
for Churches of Genius, okay?

360
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,520
Amazing.

361
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,820
We finally, we met in Time Magazine,

362
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,480
and our website's URL was...

363
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,760
Milk it, baby, milk it, milk it, baby!

364
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,320
The big result, the final end result was

365
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,600
our merchant credit card company

366
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,300
quit doing business with us.

367
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,740
Wow.

368
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,940
Having looked at the website and discovered

369
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,000
that there was, quote,

370
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,600
questionable material, unquote.

371
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,040
So, Jesus...

372
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,620
Fat naked people in a swimming pool at Brushwood?

373
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,380
Yeah, Jesus had to call up...

374
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,620
That is always questionable.

375
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
...a new bank.

376
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,120
We had to find a pornographer's bank

377
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,860
that would do anything for a buck.

378
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,880
Praise Bob and God bless America!

379
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,440
Where there's still people who do anything for a buck

380
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,380
and understand the values!

381
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,280
You're on the air with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

382
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


383
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


384
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


385
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


386
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
who's a...

387
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,060
You were complaining about the One World Advertiser.

388
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,200
I think it's a fine little giveaway paper

389
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
I find on my doorstep.

390
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,540
Every day.

391
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,420
The One World Paperboy throws it in here.

392
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,260
Look over here.

393
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
One Church of the Subgenius for sale.

394
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,520
What?

395
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,280
Yeah.

396
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,720
It's on page three of the One World Advertiser,

397
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,480
underneath the garage sale listings and the lost kitties.

398
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,860
The Church of the Subgenius has been willing to sell out

399
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,160
for a long time.

400
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,260
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

401
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


402
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


403
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


404
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


405
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


406
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


407
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


408
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


409
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,260


410
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,880
It's in the shopper.

411
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,300
They haven't had any buyers yet.

412
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,920
Oh man, if you get it in the shopper,

413
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,260
that means it's definitely going down.

414
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,260
Those guys, see, they're very anxious to jump the story,

415
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,920
as they say in those local news jargon.

416
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,540
Market analysis summary.

417
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,320
The Subgenius market is not restricted by age, gender,

418
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,040
belief system, or even international boundaries.

419
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,020
Anybody might be interested.

420
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,880
The majority of our members fall in ridden males 18 to 25,

421
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,720
above average intelligence, computer literate,

422
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,080
and somewhat rebellious.

423
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,520
That's not what this says.

424
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,640
It says almost free to good home.

425
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,240
That's not what this says.

426
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,240


427
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,240


428
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,240


429
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,240


430
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,240


431
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,620
That's what this says.

432
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,780
Sounds like a good profile of hackers who may have

433
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,300
attacked the sites over the last few days.

434
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,180
I don't know if they got the profile, they got John Douglas,

435
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,720
you know.

436
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,700
They might all be in this together.

437
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,920
The same people that knock down those sites are the same

438
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:06,960
people that are fucked.

439
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,200
Can you imagine the FBI profiles?

440
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,580
Do you know what called out talk of the nation today and

441
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,840
claimed the Church of the Subgenius had something to do

442
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,200
with that?

443
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,460
Yeah.

444
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:14,980
Figures.

445
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,260
Wouldn't that be a funny joke, yeah?

446
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,340
As long as they spell the name right in the newspaper,

447
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:19,960
you know?

448
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,220
Well, you know, it's funny.

449
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:29,380
Funny, because back in 1982, the world's first Macintosh virus was blamed on the Church of the Subgenius.

450
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,860
It was a lie.

451
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,800
A lie!

452
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,560
Because it was a peace message.

453
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,840
Well, that is the reason why the genetic spawn that you have from fornicating apples have ruined mankind.

454
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,040
And have ruined our business structure.

455
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,620
Have ruined the social infrastructure and our cultural beliefs.

456
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,640
Look at what it's become.

457
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,900
It's, you know, it destroyed everything with that.

458
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,660
But it's like the story of Para-Ubu, like the absurdity of mankind.

459
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,540
Yeah.

460
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,160
Yeah.

461
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah, it's like that.

462
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,100
Yeah.

463
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,660
It's full of irony, like art and all that shit.

464
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,880
Yeah.

465
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,100
Yeah, art's got irony in it, and it's got, what's that other stuff?

466
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,680
Luminum.

467
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,160
Torture.

468
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,000
Torture.

469
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,700
It's got luninum, torture.

470
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,400
It's got irony.

471
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,720
It's got, what, vapor?

472
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,460
What are we talking about, the earth or the society?

473
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,980
Greasy fried chicken.

474
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,060
Oh, oh, oh.

475
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,660
I got it.

476
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,080
What we don't like about it, what we can't stand about it.

477
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,840
No, we're talking about, you know, this right here.

478
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,540
These tubes of fried chicken, though, just aren't the same.

479
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,740
These ones?

480
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,180
Yeah.

481
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,920
Well, what do you have to compare them with, man?

482
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,680
You know, come on.

483
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,240
I mean, to me, fried chicken wasn't something that you squeezed out of a tube.

484
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,200
Not in the old days.

485
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,160
To me, it was something that you, you know, that came in little nuggets, these bite-sized nuggets.

486
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,540
Yeah.

487
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,880
And you just, you had a handful of them, and you shoved them in, and they had crispiness.

488
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:49,880


489
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,600
There was crispy stuff on them.

490
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:50,860
Yeah.

491
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,560
That's a chicken.

492
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,700
You could imagine them as like little deep fried butters.

493
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,180
But, I mean, the stuff that's coming out of tubes, that's just, that's not a real chicken.

494
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,840
Well, it does have a very, very chickeny rich smell, doesn't it?

495
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,220
Yeah.

496
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,500
I mean, come on.

497
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,020
And the tomatoes, these, this, this, this stuff in the tube, tomatoes didn't come out of a tube.

498
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,000
I remember tomatoes were these perfect, hard things that always were really shiny.

499
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,340
Right.

500
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,480
Well, they were really just round tubes.

501
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,220
They didn't have any taste.

502
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,540
They were round tubes with no taste.

503
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Yeah.

504
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,660
But those were real, and chickens, remember chickens?

505
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,420
They were these boneless creatures.

506
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:19,880
Yeah.

507
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,880
They had their feet grown into the cage.

508
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,420
Boneless tubes.

509
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,420


510
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,600
Yeah.

511
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,540
Real chickens.

512
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:23,640
I like these.

513
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,360
They had no heads.

514
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,260
They were cloned, and that's the way chicken was meant to taste.

515
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,040
Rich and greasy like mom used to make.

516
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,700
It's like this modern, they have this so-called progress has, I think, in some ways, yes,

517
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,300
I dare to say it, is taking us, yes, backwards.

518
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, we agree.

519
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,940
Backwards, not forwards.

520
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,520
Don't we, Chas?

521
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Agree completely?

522
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,540
We're revolutionists.

523
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,140
It's almost like, it's almost as if.

524
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,240
21st century, daddy-o.

525
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,400
Come on.

526
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
This has just now occurred to me.

527
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:45,600
Well, look, here.

528
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,260
Put it together.

529
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,460
The evolution.

530
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:54,360
The internet has been attacked, so people are unhappy with the future world.

531
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,080
Soon the infrastructure will fall.

532
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,580
Just a few, a few.

533
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,980
And the ratings have come in, and the oldies music station, the radio station in town here

534
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,380
that plays oldies music from the 50s and the 60s, a much simpler time when we could kill

535
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,800
students in the campuses.

536
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,220
Right.

537
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,380
And get away with it.

538
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:12,680
Yeah.

539
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,440
But the oldies station is the number one thing.

540
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,440


541
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,440


542
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,080
The oldies station is the number one station by far in the ratings.

543
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:29,060
So people are listening to oldies music, attacking websites, and, you know, what else is happening?

544
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:29,560
You know.

545
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,120
Oh, dear friends, I'll tell you what's happening.

546
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,820
Credits.

547
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,440
Credits are happening.

548
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,440
What we heard from the very beginning of the show was a show from KPFA in Berkeley puzzling

549
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,360
evidence.

550
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,360
And Dr. Howell bits and pieces there.

551
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,420
Some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some,

552
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,120
some, Bob lives.

553
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:54,280
We've been listening to clips from the double X day 1999 de

554
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,800
viva.

555
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,920
Well at Brushwood.

556
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,780
that's a new CD.

557
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,620
The X-Day 99

558
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,580
Devival is a new CD.

559
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,820
And I've been playing little bits and pieces

560
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,900
of that with Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background

561
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,840
and yours truly preaching.

562
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,740
And of course, we've been hearing lots of the

563
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,600
ESO radio show,

564
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,780
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Swamp

565
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,440
Radio out of WCSB

566
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,160
in Cleveland, which is

567
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,860
essentially where I'm producing

568
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,740
this show, although I'm not going

569
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,280
into the studio yet and doing that.

570
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,740
I go into the studio for Chaz's show.

571
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,860
On Thursday nights. And you can call

572
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,260
in at WCSB

573
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,860
in Cleveland. And Lonesome

574
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,220
Cowboy Dave.

575
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,540
Ah, yes, the mighty

576
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,120
Dave

577
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,180
keeping us all off track.

578
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,600
Don't you see?

579
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:41,820
And...

580
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,760
Fascist Christ was the

581
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,500
name of that song by

582
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,240
Todd Rundgren from his

583
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
No World Order album.

584
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,080
Remember that?

585
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,940
Uh...

586
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,140
Oh,

587
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,820
the Danish or

588
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,580
Norwegian song

589
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,880
Tis Tag in Greer

590
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,420
is by

591
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,960
Mithotain.

592
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,960
And the music that you're hearing in the background is

593
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,020
AMORPHOS!

594
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,760
Uh, amorphous.

595
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,780
Friends, and what we've

596
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,560
heard quite a bit of

597
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,840
is the old subgenius

598
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,460
media barrage

599
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,720
number 11.

600
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,920
With the UFOs collage where we

601
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
heard G. Gordon Gordon and

602
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
Space. A lot of collage

603
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,280
from me and Doug

604
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,360
Weldman of Puzzling Evidence and Byron

605
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,400
Werner, who

606
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,200
has a new show on internet

607
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,580

Uh,

613
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,500
and Buck Naked, the former

614
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,960
subgenius preacher, he

615
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,520
disavowed the church. He found

616
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,100
another religion.

617
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,340
Some rival cult.

618
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,980
He won't tell us what it is.

619
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,980
Uh, doing the excess

620
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,160
have landed. Also off the old

621
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,900
media barrage number 11. And friends,

622
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,420
eh, yes.

623
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,140
...

624
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,420

625
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,600

626
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,920

627
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,340

628
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,340


629
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,340


630
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,340


631
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,340

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,160

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,160


639
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,080
...

640
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,080


641
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,100
...

642
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,100


643
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,160
...

644
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


645
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


646
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


647
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


648
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


649
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


650
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


651
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


652
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


653
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


654
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,160


655
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,140
...

656
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,020
...

657
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,040

658
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,060

659
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,080

660
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,100

661
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,120

662
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,140

663
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,160
...

664
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,180
...

665
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,200
...

666
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,220
...

667
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,640
For the worldly flesh, we flesh, we flesh

668
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:09,000
I look through and I hear no sound

669
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,920
It's a sound, it's a sound, it's a sound

670
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:19,200
It's a sound, it's a sound, it's a sound

671
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:38,320
It's a sound, it's a sound, it's a sound

672
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,300
The worldly flesh, it's a sound

673
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,960
The worldly flesh, it's a sound

674
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,220
I see a something but I still can't hear

675
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,660
Like a box of glass, poking out my ears

676
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,980
It's a sound

677
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,180
It's a sound

678
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,180


679
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,960
I'm sure it'll play on your ears

680
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,080
The worldly flesh, worldly flesh

681
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,200
All of the raindrops, the misrepresentation

682
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,060
The worldly flesh, worldly flesh

683
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm in trouble, I'm so hard in the face

684
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,880
I setKAVE

685
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,060
What are your greed and peace?

686
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,100
You'll see I'm ver

687
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,980
I'm sorry you can't forget

688
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,240
Can be saying goodnight

689
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,520
Try to avoid pidin' me

690
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,020
And to turn here to that end

691
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,880
To fall and fall again

692
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:08,880


693
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:08,880


694
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,780
All alike, all alike

695
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:09,780


696
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,400
I'lliam

697
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,960

I'lliam

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:15,460


701
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,620

I'lliam

705
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,940
Ain't no rest for the one we've lost

706
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:04,520
Life has passed, you're the latest

707
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,880
Lost we dance, cause the one we've lost

708
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:21,940
We are destined to the one we've lost

709
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:29,700
This is where we're destined, we're the one we've lost

710
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,200
Life has passed, you're the latest

711
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,780
Lost we dance, cause the one we've lost

712
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,220
We are destined to the one we've lost

713
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:55,780
We are destined to the one we've lost

714
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,120
Well, the weirdest thing is that they said in 1959...

715
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,760
What does it all mean?

716
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,600
40 years ago, 1959, but it's really 2000.

717
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,220
Are we ending the loop? Are we coming to the end of the loop?

718
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,020
Yes, this is a perfect inaccurate...

719
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,140
Now we're gonna flip back.

720
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,440
This is a very...

721
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,340
It's a very functional...

722
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,360
I think it is. I think the tape, I think in the tape, the grand tape,

723
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,760
is coming to the end of the loop.

724
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,500
It's starting to crackle.

725
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,900
We're coming back to the splice.

726
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,100
We're coming right to the splice.

727
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,800
The splice in time.

728
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,140
But listen to this.

729
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,800
The time.

730
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,440
In 1959, 40 years ago technically,

731
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,500
the average 17-year-old American had a vocabulary of about 25,000 words.

732
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,360
You know what his vocabulary is now?

733
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,780
Like what?

734
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,700
250.

735
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,560
10,000.

736
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,400
Wow.

737
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,720
Definitely going backwards.

738
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,720
And half of them are like, you know what I mean.

739
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,520
And the other half are like, you know...

740
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,260
Like, and...

741
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,980
And I'm like...

742
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm so sure.

743
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,000
For sure.

744
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:54,860
Dude!

745
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,400
And it was like, you know, like it was like...

746
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,880
You guys, you sit there and you whine about how...

747
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
Oh no, we're gonna do something.

748
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,500
We're doing something about it.

749
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,120
Everything is becoming the one government, the one religion,

750
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,040
and you don't do anything about it.

751
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,720
You, on your show...

752
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,820
Yeah, I write this music.

753
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,520
Now listen, listen.

754
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,040
Wait a minute.

755
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,560
The undertones and the...

756
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,840
I am doing something about it.

757
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:20,760
The symphonic sounds that are the very basis of the government taking over.

758
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,600
These are the things getting into people's minds.

759
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,340
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

760
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,380
Yeah, well, every week...

761
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,500
We are doing something about it.

762
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,460
Every week I play this, and anybody who hears it...

763
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,260
Is deprogrammed, man.

764
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,520
...is downloaded.

765
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,700
It's deprogrammed.

766
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,660
That's the deal, man.

767
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,920
We're trying to deprogram you.

768
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,600
That's right.

769
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:35,800
Oh, push.

770
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,180
The Pokemon.

771
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,260
I would never touch you there.

772
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,340
No, are you guys aware about the Pokemon craze or whatever?

773
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,920
They're bringing back the Pokeballs.

774
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,080
The Pokeballs?

775
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,620
Yeah.

776
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,940
They're apparently...

777
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,620
The Pokemon.

778
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,520
...the television commercials they're on now are requesting that you return the Pokemon balls.

779
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,260
Oh, yeah, that's true.

780
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,940
The Pokeballs.

781
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,100
You've got to go back there.

782
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,720
Did you know that?

783
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:54,940
Yeah.

784
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,420
They're going to send them home.

785
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,300
They're not the problem.

786
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,140
Their visas are...

787
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,680
It's over.

788
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,560
That's the deal.

789
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,240
The Pokemon themselves are the mind control devices.

790
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,340
We know that.

791
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,020
This is the perfect marketing ploy that the children buy these.

792
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,080
They keep them long enough, and the tones that emanate from them...

793
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,100
...help to take over their minds.

794
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,500
And when they return the ball, they think that they're...

795
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,360
This music is the antidote.

796
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,580
This music, this show, is the antidote to that poison.

797
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,140
A program on Comedy...

798
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,200
Well, I would certainly hope so.

799
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,760
A comedy cable program show already explored that idea of Pokemon being mind control devices.

800
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,460
All I do know is sit in my house and try and get the message out to people that the Pokeball is not the problem.

801
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,380
It's simply the Pokemon.

802
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,500
Just tell them to listen to the show.

803
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,760
I try...

804
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,180
I can't...

805
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:42,740
Tell them to listen to my house.

806
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,400
Tell them to...

807
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,960
I love Goddess Annalise keeps me in the house.

808
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,080
All right, well, the...

809
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,380
Tell them Goddess Annalise...

810
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:48,680
Tell them Goddess Annalise...

811
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,080
Annalise says hello.

812
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,640
Annalise.

813
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,100
Oh, good.

814
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,660
And we're gonna...

815
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,120
Yeah, now...

816
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,600
Okay, if Pokemon is the Antichrist...

817
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,040
Okay, we'll talk about that.

818
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,440
...then our savior must be the Rastaman, right?

819
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,880
Oh, the Pokemon is the Rastaman.

820
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,640
Oh, my God, man.

821
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,600
This is getting too confusing.

822
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,620
I mean, now the Antichrist is the Christ, too?

823
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,340
I wanted to hear more about the love...

824
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,860
Canal?

825
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,160
...connection here with this...

826
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,640
Oh, wow.

827
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,180
...caller.

828
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,360
The caller has...

829
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,280
...he's got his own love goddess, apparently.

830
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,620
Hanna-Loa.

831
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,340
It sounds like it's the other way around.

832
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,440
The love goddess has him.

833
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,080
Right, right.

834
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,120
Well, his...

835
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,400
It won't let him out, but you can tell he kind of likes it.

836
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:20,760
Oh, yeah.

837
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,320
He kind of prefers being kept and...

838
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,600
I think he's been shrunk down, and she uses him in...

839
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:28,900
That's what...

840
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,400
Yeah, right.

841
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,660
That's what the shadows say.

842
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,020
He's shrunk down to about 14 inches tall.

843
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,180
Yeah.

844
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,860
Dig that, baby.

845
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,560
Daddy-o.

846
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,480
Keeps him in, like, a little...

847
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,140
You know, one of those, like, I Dream of Jeannie...

848
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,340
I Dream of Jeannie.

849
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,540
...homes.

850
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,020
Yeah.

851
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
You know, it's funny you mention that...

852
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,960
...in a little thought, man.

853
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,760
...because I was thinking about Tinkerbell.

854
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,160
...as it drives away.

855
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,620
In fact, Princess Wee, who's recovering from a trepanation operation tonight, and I were

856
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,340
discussing Tinkerbell, and, like, exactly...

857
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,780
Tinkerbell and liquid latex.

858
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,540
Yeah, baby.

859
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,740
Would Tinkerbell be able to do anything but kind of get you in the...

860
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,980
Of course, you've got to like...

861
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,420
...point in the right direction, and you'd have to take care of finishing, you know,

862
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,600
dousing her, but...

863
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,980
Yeah, with liquid latex.

864
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,860
And Princess Wee pointed out...

865
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,260
Well, but she'd be great for girls.

866
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,660
Those wings probably...

867
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,140
Yeah.

868
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,340
...just flicker and...

869
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,040
Flutter and...

870
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,400
...flutter and...

871
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:20,860
...flip and flap.

872
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,180
You mean, like, if you was to flip the wings, or if the wings was to flip you?

873
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,560
Well, I don't know.

874
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,860
I don't know.

875
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,500
The Tinkerbell.

876
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,660
You've got to find out how it works.

877
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,420
I guess I...

878
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,180
I guess me and Tinkerbell's going to have to have a little talk now, won't we?

879
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,140
I have never had a fornicational scene with a person with wings.

880
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,100
A fairy.

881
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,000
A tiny little...

882
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,400
He said, yeah, I was a fairy until it was my turn, or something.

883
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,500
No, I was a sadist until it was my turn.

884
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:45,700
But what if you...

885
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:52,240
But what if a little fair maiden were to use a fairy in this way...

886
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,040
In this first fashion.

887
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,640
...for sexual satisfaction, and accidentally inserted a fury instead?

888
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,760
Oh, man!

889
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,780
Wow.

890
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,360
Now, a fury is an evil fairy.

891
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,500
Bad.

892
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,120
Bad.

893
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,460
The furies, you wouldn't want to...

894
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,040
Unleash the furies in the fairies.

895
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,260
Jeez.

896
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,580
That would cause a misruption in everything.

897
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,720
The furies can look like fairies when they want to.

898
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,520
But then they have that horrid grimace that...

899
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,980
You guys are freaking me out, man.

900
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,340
That's the deal, man.

901
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,340
Furies are really old.

902
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,760
It was like Mozart wrote about the furies and stuff.

903
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,880
Yeah, and there was an odyssey.

904
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,560
The furies...

905
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,220
Yeah, right.

906
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,940
The furies.

907
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,340
They're bad fairies.

908
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,800
Bad.

909
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,820
But what about the...

910
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
They're like from the dark side.

911
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,860
What about the fates?

912
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,060
They're little Darth Vaders.

913
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,180
What if the fates won't speak to us?

914
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,320
The fates won't speak to us.

915
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,480
Wings.

916
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,900
What if, like, the fates turn their back on us?

917
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,700
Like, we want to talk to one of the music...

918
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,660
The fates are neutral.

919
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,640
They're like Switzerland.

920
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,440
Huh?

921
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,900
Well, the fates are neutral.

922
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,620
They're like Switzerland.

923
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,100
They're just the messengers.

924
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,760
Here, buddy.

925
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,180
Good at banking and stuff.

926
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,280
This is the way it's going to be.

927
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,360
Heroin addicts.

928
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,660
Yeah.

929
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,620
That's the fates.

930
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:51,900
Swiss.

931
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,760
The cheese...

932
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,800
And the fairies are cool.

933
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,620
You know, the fairies, you get good peanut butter.

934
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,600
You know?

935
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,060
They should.

936
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,660
I mean, if that was in the job description, at least, I'd want to go for it.

937
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,980
What do fairies have to do with peanut butter?

938
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,300
You're losing, man.

939
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,780
Or unionism.

940
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,800
I was following it.

941
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,640
Or unionism.

942
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,580
Peter Pan.

943
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,340
I mean, I thought we were talking about, you know, Tinkerbell.

944
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,320
I thought we were talking about, you know, workers' rights and stuff, man.

945
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,620
I thought we were talking about how good-looking Tinkerbell was in that little outfit.

946
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,580
That's where we started.

947
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,120
Covered in peanut butter, man.

948
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,260
Imagine licking that peanut butter off.

949
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,680
Oh, we better stop talking about sex with Tinkerbell.

950
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,200
Oh, my God.

951
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,920
Look down in the basement.

952
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,400
Sex?

953
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,980
What do you mean?

954
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,300
I was talking about having dinner with Tinkerbell.

955
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,060
Oh, my God.

956
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,720
That's not chicken.

957
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,080
She would probably taste like chicken.

958
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,320
I was...

959
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,220
You know, it's today.

960
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,000
This modern morality.

961
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,660
I'm shrinking.

962
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,740
I was watching that South Park movie.

963
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,740
It was a big hit movie last year.

964
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,020
I finally had a chance to rent it.

965
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,720
And was watching that movie.

966
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,120
And in the first ten minutes, I thought, now, what if an old man like me heard it while I hear this is a famous big movie.

967
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Everybody's going to see it.

968
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,960
It's the biggest hit movie.

969
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm going to go see it.

970
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,900
He goes and watches people standing in line.

971
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,500
He watches people standing in line.

972
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,500
Actually, I thought it was a hilarious movie.

973
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,200
I loved it.

974
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,680
I thought it was great.

975
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:09,900
Brilliant.

976
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,480
Wish I'd thought of it.

977
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,080
But...

978
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,260
To another old man like myself, he'd walk in there and he'd go,

979
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,060
they're lining up and paying $10 a ticket to watch stick figures say...

980
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,000
Man.

981
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,000
Which is, it's stick figures talking dirt, saying four-letter...

982
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,900
What a Sunday afternoon.

983
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
And Alice in Wonderland.

984
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,160
On the basis, on the face of it, it's stick figures cussing.

985
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,920
What has this world evolved down into?

986
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,360
It's just motion pictures.

987
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,560
I told you they wouldn't last.

988
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,980
That's why they last?

989
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,780
A hundred years ago, I told you...

990
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,140
Motion pictures are transitional.

991
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,280
Yeah, it's just a fad.

992
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,020
Movement is transitional, Daddy-o.

993
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,560
I mean, just think of it, man.

994
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,400
I don't know what it's coming to now.

995
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,660
So the fad is coming to now.

996
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,600
Pretty soon we'll all be still as doorknobs.

997
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,620
You know what I'm saying?

998
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,420
It's going to...

999
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,260
Movies are going to...

1000
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,340
Movement is transitional.

1001
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,800
The fad of movement...

1002
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,080
Movement is a fad, man.

1003
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,980
Just think of it.

1004
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,740
We're all going to be still as a...

1005
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:09,280
You know, it is a transitional, ephemeral fad compared to the amount of time during the

1006
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,280


1007
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,340
We're all going to be still as a...

1008
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,880
...duration during which there has been no movement.

1009
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,880
...before we was born and after we was dead.

1010
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,500
But when there is no movement, is there time?

1011
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,400
If there's nothing, no duration across which an event occurs, can one say that time has

1012
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:21,760
passed?

1013
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,720
We would only say that time can only be measured in terms of...

1014
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:24,720


1015
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,840
But I can always tell you when the gas has been passed around the studio...

1016
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,940
Or at least change of some kind.

1017
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:30,660
If there's no movement...

1018
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:30,800
Around the road.

1019
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,060
...the inert gas...

1020
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,420
...there's no change, then...

1021
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,980
Someone has been passing inert gases on the road again, and I don't think it's Fermi

1022
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,740
or Albert Einstein.

1023
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,920
If you fad in your...

1024
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,220
And if it fads in your car and no one else smells it, did you really fart?

1025
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,060
I wonder if Einstein thought about that.

1026
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,540
But if there's five bandmates in a van and somebody farts...

1027
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,600
Then you say fart out.

1028
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,640
Hey, everybody, guess what time it is?

1029
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,220
Time for fun.

1030
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,020
So, everybody, join in and have some fun.

1031
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,320
My name is Hemaroy Rogers and these are my rolloys.

1032
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,900
We hope that you have had a good time.

1033
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,280
We know that we sure did.

1034
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:19,280
My name is Hemeroy Rogers, and these are my roid boys.

1035
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:26,320
We hope that you have had some fun, so we thank that hat man.

1036
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,280
Hey everybody, come on, have some fun!

1037
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,280
My name is Hemeroy Rogers, and these are my roid boys.

1038
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:46,820
I think that it would be fun to kill them all today.

1039
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,400
I'm gonna kill them all with my bare hands!

1040
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,980
These bombs already planted at these designated targets in the capitals of these communist states.

1041
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,180
People have to get past it.

1042
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,260
People have to get past it.

1043
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,220
We have to grow up and move on and eat our Popeye's spinach.

1044
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,560
Yes, a huge mass, looking almost like a detached beard, right?

1045
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:18,000
A huge dripping handful of seaweed, always when Popeye pulled it uncooked out of the can

1046
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,840
and dropped it into his toothless mouth, his huge, bulgish jaw would chew it.

1047
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:30,960
And the Adam's apple prominently distend as the work of alimentation was robustly caricatured.

1048
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,260
Finally, the...

1049
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,480
morphological muscular elongation with the pictorial iconic accompaniment,

1050
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:44,460
together with the mechanization or superhuman function of the body,

1051
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:51,660
the fight syndrome is begun, and of course the familiar musical accompaniment that we all know.

1052
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,840
What is this?

1053
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,660
It's the dissolution of the Mapes Hotel in Reno, Nevada.

1054
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,760
It's the death of Bob Squire, the master of political imagery.

1055
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,260
What was that again? Squire?

1056
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,240
Bob Squire died this week.

1057
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,740
The resurrection process has an unfortunate...

1058
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,420
Oh, also, yeah, we did want to bring up...

1059
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,280
What we want to tell you is all the lines of all the movies,

1060
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,640
so you don't have any bad surprises when you go see the movies.

1061
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,600
We'll tell you the things like the blonde did it,

1062
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,380
or the person you think did it did it,

1063
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,100
or all the passengers did it,

1064
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,060
or he puts her on the plane, he dies on the bus, he dies in the freezing water,

1065
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,540
she falls from the bell tower, she shoots him in the paper...

1066
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,260
Oh, my goodness.

1067
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,240
Jesus Christ.

1068
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:32,580
It's confusing.

1069
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,600
It's like Thorazin.

1070
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,200
He cuts off his genitals.

1071
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,500
The stab, this dwarf stabs him.

1072
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:39,880
Ouch.

1073
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,400
His mom has been hypnotized.

1074
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,060
Hey, don't say nothing about my mama.

1075
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,340
He turns back into a half-wit.

1076
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,280
That's my favorite.

1077
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,900
How about a three-quarters wit?

1078
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,200
He blows up the bridge.

1079
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,300
He drives off the bridge.

1080
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,660
He pushes the man off the cliff.

1081
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,020
They drive into the Grand Canyon.

1082
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,080
She wasn't really dead.

1083
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,100
He wasn't really dead.

1084
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,420
Don't look under the bed.

1085
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,580
Don't look under the bed.

1086
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,740
That's on the Disney Channel.

1087
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,540
That's on top of the world, Ma.

1088
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,300
What's that from?

1089
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:04,760
Top of the world.

1090
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,460
That's to the end of White Heat with James Cagney.

1091
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,820
He blows up the giant refinery tank that he's standing on top of.

1092
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,440
Yep.

1093
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,380
The gigolo gets the motel.

1094
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,760
The hooker gets the millionaire.

1095
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,420
Kevin Spacey gets his.

1096
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,400
Glenn Close gets hers.

1097
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,140
Uh-oh, we're in space.

1098
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,240
Where no one can hear you squeal.

1099
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,220
Oh, my God.

1100
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,960
That's good.

1101
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:37,960


1102
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:37,960


1103
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:37,960


1104
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,620
In the eternal silences of infinite space.

1105
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,760
It sure is nice out here.

1106
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,640
Somebody's coming.

1107
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,320
It's the gods and monsters show.

1108
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,640
Where it's all wet and damp and squelchy and swampy and sloppy.

1109
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,160
Like the bathroom at Cafe This.

1110
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,660
Oh, thanks.

1111
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,520
Now the pralines are here, and they just dump them off next to the old bus in the back.

1112
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,460
The station's full of them.

1113
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,420
One ton of pralines.

1114
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,420
And up there go those little Rice Krispies.

1115
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,300
Uh, boys, aren't you being just a little bit silly?

1116
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,900
That's, uh, Dr. Howell and

1117
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,240
Buzzing Evidence on the KPFA Show,

1118
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,220
a particular one from January 27th of the year 2000.

1119
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,280
Before that, Hemeroy Rogers, the tail end of his CD,

1120
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,040
which you can find on mp3.com.

1121
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,940
You can order that CD through mp3.com.

1122
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,540
And, uh, I think...

1123
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,400
He didn't put it on this letter!

1124
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,120
What does he think I am, a genius?

1125
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,120
This is the church of the sub-genius!

1126
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,580
It's, uh, but it's Hemer...

1127
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,780
I believe it's something like...

1128
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,440
You go to the mp3.com and just, you know, search for

1129
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,120
Hemeroy Rogers

1130
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,060
and his roid boys.

1131
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,340
And, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

1132
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,900
where we never shut up.

1133
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,000
But, but, uh, but friends,

1134
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,540
actually, we should have a scary,

1135
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,900
scary music, but...

1136
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,440
Because they're scary...

1137
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,940
These are the predictions

1138
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,160
for the coming years.

1139
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,820
Monsters like unto men

1140
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,000
will be around thee all night

1141
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,120
and shall lead thee to look past the door

1142
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,820
which should be locked

1143
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,940
and thy silences will terrify thee

1144
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,220
and bring thee not the devils

1145
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,800
for thine spirit is locked away

1146
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,280
inside the white star.

1147
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:52,660
And the angels of heaven

1148
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:52,660


1149
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:52,660


1150
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,760
which my angels saw

1151
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,340
bring from space,

1152
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,760
which is the vessel of all that is known.

1153
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,880
And even now I shall feed signs

1154
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,220
in the heaven and signs in the earth,

1155
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,960
blood-bellies from the earth.

1156
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,860
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.

1157
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,760
The children of heaven

1158
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,040
and the angels from heaven

1159
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,360
are among thee, spreading lies and deception.

1160
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,960
They turn not as they go,

1161
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,520
but they turn as they go.

1162
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,500
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

1163
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,780
Blasto, you have earned this!

1164
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,200
They do it their way.

1165
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,800
As the mutants move,

1166
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,400
battle leaps.

1167
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,140
Tibetan Tiger Man.

1168
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,520
What about the

1169
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1170
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1171
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1172
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1173
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1174
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1175
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,520


1176
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,480
what about this reputed

1177
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,820
Jesus Starfleet

1178
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,640
that was supposed to have shown up?

1179
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,120
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central

1180
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,140
and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

1181
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,300
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

1182
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,500
What a space ovation!

1183
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,160
Now let's feel an upper.

1184
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,960
And now in celebration of this great occasion,

1185
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,760
we have planned a lunar party.

1186
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,500
We hope all young people for our future,

1187
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,240
for the solar system,

1188
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,520
will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

1189
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:39,820
Bob?

1190
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,520
Late that Saturday night, before retiring,

1191
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,280
I took out the snapshot picture of the sailor

1192
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,280
and studied it until I could close my eyes

1193
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,840
and see this man's face as though he was standing in front of me.

1194
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,160
It's Bob!

1195
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,380
I love you.

1196
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,820
Bob loves you.

1197
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,480
Bob loves you.

1198
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,680
I'm flying in success.

1199
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,440
All my friends,

1200
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,260
cause they're so nice.

1201
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,780
And Nina loves you.

1202
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,780
I'm gonna see them again and again.

1203
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,660
Is it before or after the Bob pills?

1204
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,460
The arrival of a space ship in Washington.

1205
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,740
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction

1206
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,880
are based on hysteria,

1207
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,220
and are absolutely false.

1208
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,320
And you are not alone.

1209
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,100
And you are not alone.

1210
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,900
Remember it's true.

1211
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,760
And you are not alone.

1212
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,540
The UFO, the UFO,

1213
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,260
breaking us up.

1214
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,860
The UFO, the UFO,

1215
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,800
making us up.

1216
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,700
The UFO, the UFO,

1217
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,360
making us up.

1218
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,960
Your brothers from outer space

1219
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,480
are coming with advanced knowledge.

1220
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,460
To help human race.

1221
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,640
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1222
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,060
Where are you leading us, Bob?

1223
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,360
What is waiting there for me?

1224
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,020
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

1225
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1226
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,980
Bob can save me,

1227
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,120
but will he?

1228
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,500
Don't count on it, Buck.

1229
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,620
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

1230
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,260
Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbsy, Dobbs.

1231
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,060
What is waiting there for me?

1232
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:03,540
Bob.

1233
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,140
Don't count on it, Buck.

1234
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,020
Friend, the Elder Gods have been sleeping.

1235
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:08,900
But they're waking up.

1236
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,740
And you've gotta find that word of Bob before-

1237
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,140
Friends, you've got to get on it.

1238
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,720
You've gotta get on it.

1239
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,980
And it's on-

1240
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,200
I'm gonna give you the address.

1241
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,080
to get onto.

1242
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,160
Friends, you can write to Bob

1243
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,560
and find out, to get free information

1244
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,280
about the Church of the Subgenius,

1245
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,460
go ahead, send that self-addressed stamped envelope

1246
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,020
to that post office box,

1247
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,300
807 Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1248
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,000
You know, I've been saying that address

1249
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,740
for 15 years on the radio.

1250
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,940
Praise Bob and Hail Connie.

1251
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,980
But friends, www.subgenius.com

1252
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,340
is always the thing to do.

1253
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,820
And this in the background is

1254
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,680
the Flying Ryan Brothers

1255
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,800
with their lovely tune, Captain Nemo,

1256
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,420
from their album, Colorama,

1257
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,600
at ryanetics.com.

1258
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,100
Dear friends, I...

1259
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,720
I'll see you next time.

1260
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,440
guitar solo

1261
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,660
solo

1262
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:19,660


1263
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,540
in harmony

1264
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,780
keep your hat on tight

1265
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,660
you're back to the winter

1266
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,660
sacking the saddle

1267
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,320
heads or tails

1268
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,120
and happy trails

1269
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,240
we'll see you all next week

1270
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,720
March 3rd

1271
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,200
Friday night

1272
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,860
you could tell

1273
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,200
the large ones

1274
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:33,660
keep coming

1275
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,120
and keep coming

1276
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,520

Triology Soaps.

1349
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,080
They're made by our friend, the crazy Lord Ferg,

1350
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:21,200
who embeds a soap Dobbs head inside a translucent outer layer of very high quality soap.

1351
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,900
You can get it in all kinds of flavors and scents.

1352
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,520
And you can get it with nonsense.

1353
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,180
None at all.

1354
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,720
