1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,400
That's right, friends, this is KNON. This is, I repeat, KNON on our new frequency of 89.3 FM, whatever that means. Thank you.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,860
Give me a lighter. I'll light that sucker.

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,000
I bet you will.

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,780
I can't tell you how excited I am about our first guest this morning. He will be joining us in just a couple of moments.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,500
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius. Praise Bob.

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,500
Did we have any operating difficulties?

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,960
Hey, what's going on here?

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,660
The Subgenius.

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,060
The Subgenius.

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,880
The Subgenius.

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,040
The Subgenius.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,140
The Subgenius.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,500


14
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,980
The Subgenius.

15
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,980
The Subgenius.

16
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,000
The Subgenius.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,220
The Subgenius.

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,260
The Subgenius.

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:38,780
And remind you of this. He who laughs last laughs best, but also gets his teeth kicked in, and if you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of everyone else.

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,460
Is it rolling?

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,720
Backwards masking, take one.

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,680
Meow.

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,780
Meow.

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,700
Meow.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,160
Meow.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,540
Meow.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,140
Satan is cool, God is a jerk.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,580
Wonder if we fooled anybody.

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,480
Yeah, I've heard about Satan trying to get people to sell their souls,

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,420
but he's not really too good at it.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,180
Actually, he tried to get me to sell mine,

32
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,440
but all he offered me was crap like a Hugo and tennis shoes from Taiwan

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,140
and carob yogurt balls and lunar-powered sundial, crap like that.

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
So I told him he'd have to do better than that,

35
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,820
and I thought he was a cheapskate,

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,240
and he got all huffy and red in the face and called me a spoilsport,

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,560
but I told him to go straight to hell because that just wasn't good enough.

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,300
I wasn't going to sell myself that cheap.

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,940
So there.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,880
Oh, yes.

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,820
A dear friend.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,000
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,040
at our new place.

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,040
On the dial.

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,540
89.3 Unusual.

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,120
I hope you're finding us.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,940
And I hope those of you who never heard us before

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,460
keep listening because I have specially designed this show.

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,640
This is a very unusual show for you strangers to it.

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,760
And what we're doing tonight is basically

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,760
sort of a revised introduction to the church for new viewers.

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,620
Every three or four months we do that, just like a pledge drive.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,160
Just to catch you up.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,880
And we're going to talk about what the church of the subgenius is

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,280
and why there must be and has always been a bob.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,820
Also tonight, though, we're going to preview the new album

57
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,320
by the Swinging Eredites of Boston.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,140
If you've never heard them, then hang in there.

59
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,700
By the way, while I'm still thinking about it,

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
this is Quark in the background.

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,960
Quark in the mighty stereo background.

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Friends, listen on headphones.

63
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,280
You really should.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,020
And start.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,060
You take decks up.

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,720
We'll also later be doing some reading from the new subgenius book,

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,240
High Weirdness by Mail, which isn't out yet.

68
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,780
So, therefore, you couldn't call this an ad exactly.

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,240
You're getting a preview, friends, of a major Simon & Schuster publication.

70
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,000
And it's going to make some of you so mad, so mad, I hope,

71
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,580
if we're doing our job.

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,440
So, uh...

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,140
So, uh...

74
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,900
See if you can figure out what's going on here.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,820
If you can't, we don't need you.

76
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,380
Understand?

77
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,500
That's the whole point of this.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,780
THE TRUTH IS THERE

79
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,120
THE TRUTH IS THERE

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
THE TRUTH IS THERE

81
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,640
THE TRUTH IS THERE

82
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,940
THE TRUTH IS THERE

83
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,380
THE TRUTH IS THERE

84
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Okay, that's it.

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,680
Now you know what the Church of the Subgenius is about.

86
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
Bob is sex.

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,600
Praise Bob, dear friends.

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,700
This is the radio ministry of the church.

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,480
We've been saying let's start back at the beginning

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,940
because a lot of people are not aware of exactly what J.R. Bob Dobbs

91
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,080
and the church, Praise Bob, are all about.

92
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,920
Tell us all about it.

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,940
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is the end times church for mutants

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:23,280
formed to spread the seed word of that great saint of sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

95
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Bob formed the church in 1953 being the saint of sales.

96
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,340
There he is.

97
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,640
But he kind of kept it under wraps until around 1980

98
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,940
when he...

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,260
recruited Dr. Philodromin and myself

100
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,400
to begin releasing the secrets of his teachings to the public at large,

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,280
which, of course, has had disastrous effects.

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,280
Bob?

103
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,380
Bob?

104
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,100
Bob.

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Bob is sex.

106
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,100
That's your key phrase.

107
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,220
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

108
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,700
We are...

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,700
controlling transmission.

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,900
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,560
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

112
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,040
What can I do to make you understand him?

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,780
I love you.

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,700
The rewards are worth the effort.

115
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,320
Oh, yes, dear friends, the harvest.

116
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,820
But you see, if you do have some questions here,

117
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,580
you can still call and speak to an actual human being

118
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,480
who might answer your questions in a linear way.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,260
Call the station.

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,300
Speak to the Will O'Dobbs.

121
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,060
He'll give you information on where to get more information

122
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,460
and help you find out whether you can actually handle that information or not,

123
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,420
which is a whole other question altogether.

124
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,240
You see, the keys to instant success,

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
mystic knowledge,

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,540
and miraculous adventures,

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,700
even contact with the Space Brothers,

128
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,480
are within your grasp

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,200
simply by tuning in to this show

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,280
every Sunday night at 9.

131
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,040
Do you have different tastes?

132
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,420
Intrigued by the bizarre?

133
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
The kooky? The kinky?

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,720
As long as it keeps its distance?

135
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,420
Do you enjoy getting unsolicited,

136
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,120
but unspeakably,

137
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,860
weirdly weird things in the mail for free?

138
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
Love to snicker in superiority,

139
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,520
perhaps largely imagined,

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,560
at the incredible gullibility of those around you?

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,920
Enjoy reading the headlines on sleazy tabloids

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,180
and ads for local psychic fortune tellers?

143
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,980
Do you, my friend, appreciate the unexpected glimpses

144
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,620
of strange realities behind religions,

145
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,380
other than your own?

146
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,720
Entranced by the thought processes of the mentally ill?

147
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,840
And bored to tears by any music, video, or literature

148
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,140
that isn't almost shockingly original?

149
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,620
Are you painfully aware, dear friend,

150
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,780
that all great geniuses and inventors of the past

151
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,680
appeared totally insane to everyone around them?

152
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,960
Then have we got a religion for you, my friend.

153
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,400
Actually, that was the introduction

154
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,240
from the religion's second book,

155
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,520
High Weirdness by Mail, but, you know,

156
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,520
let's not get technical.

157
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,720
Superior mutants, repent!

158
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,880
Quit your job! Slack off!

159
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,160
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die!

160
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,520
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do,

161
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,660
just keep listening.

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,300
The end times is here!

163
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,120
Yo, freedom at last!

164
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,200
At last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

165
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,180
This is it, the only faith that promises

166
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,360
action, thrill, success in sex and business.

167
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,300
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

168
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,100
I did not put you here to suffer.

169
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,080
No, I did not put you here to whine.

170
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,280
No, I did not put you here to whine.

171
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,740
You must

172
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,240
respect any wrong

173
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
And you must play fair

174
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,620
Because theory profits

175
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,440
You drown in fear

176
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,940
And you must bet

177
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,980
And you must let

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Some of your decades go to waste

179
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,980
You must respect any wrong

180
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,660
Detroit.

181
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,060
Thank you.

182
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,140
Thank you.

183
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,840
They're doing it anyway.

184
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,520
What do they care?

185
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,500
Are we controlled by secret forces?

186
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,020
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

187
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,440
Do people think you're strange?

188
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,240
Do you?

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,100
Then you may be on the right track.

190
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,980
Are you abnormal?

191
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,280
Then you are probably better than most people.

192
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,080
Yes.

193
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,680
Yes.

194
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:14,720
I am completely agree with all the obstacle and with all the enemies who are between me

195
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
and what I want to do.

196
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
I see that they cooperate.

197
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,500
They are in a providential manner.

198
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,780
They help me to do exactly what I want.

199
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:36,860
Because if I have not to fight, it is in the fighting that I can see better what I want to do.

200
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,080
It is in the friction, as you say.

201
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,400
Friction.

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,120
Friction.

203
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,300
That thing become more clear.

204
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:52,280
It become more clear just because it runs the danger to be far, to go away from me.

205
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,760
We spread this mighty seed word of slack, how to get it, how to fight.

206
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,440
How to fight the conspiracy through radio shows in different cities, through videotape.

207
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,680
Two books now are excuse scrolls suitable for framing and live shows.

208
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,200
I do a lot of science fiction conventions and then there is Buck Naked, Reverend Buck Naked here in Dallas.

209
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,580
He occasionally plays with his band More Drunk Cowboys here and there.

210
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,280
He preaches.

211
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,660
Although he is a, as a true subgenius, he says,

212
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,400
I am a schismatic.

213
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,580
And has formed his own splinter group, which of course does intense battle with my personal splinter group.

214
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,380
It always happens.

215
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,780
Drunk in Budweiser.

216
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,600
Watching fireball TV.

217
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
Swallowing red air.

218
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,640
Drunk in Budweiser.

219
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:58,640


220
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,820
The day my clue dog died.

221
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,600
Leading the pack to him.

222
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,440
Over and over again.

223
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,820
I was drunk in Budweiser.

224
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,500
And I was on TV.

225
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,740
The day that my toy got kicked.

226
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,420
By a mule.

227
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,000
I was with cousin Junior.

228
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,780
The DNA backfired.

229
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,300
I was drunk.

230
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,800
I was lonely.

231
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,540
I was water.

232
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,580
And I was drinking Budweiser.

233
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,520
And Bob was on TV.

234
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,140
Drunk in Budweiser.

235
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,800
Watching fireball TV.

236
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,740
Oh, many thanks to Buck Naked and the Jaybirds, now known as More Drunk Cowboys.

237
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,420
This is the swinging love corpses in the background.

238
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,700
Now friends, you know, okay, here's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

239
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,560
For those of you tuning in accidentally for the first time, it's probably the only way we could ever get you to.

240
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:46,080
If you sincerely desire a truly well-rounded education, you've got to study the extremist, the obscure, and the so-called nutty.

241
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
You need the balance.

242
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:58,380
Once your poor brain is being impregnated with middle-of-the-road crap 24 hours a day, no matter what.

243
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,320
Network, TV, newspapers, radio, magazines at the supermarket.

244
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,100
Even if you never watch, read, listen, or leave your house.

245
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,540
Even if you are deaf and blind.

246
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:18,740
The telepathic pressure alone of the uncountable normals surrounding you will ensure that you are not alone.

247
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,300
You're automatically well-grounded in consensus reality.

248
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,980
Screw consensus reality.

249
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,660
What we all need is more of that common sense stuff.

250
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,160
Badly named, because it's not really such a common commodity after all.

251
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:43,260
And our guru, the great mystic, the saint of sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs often preached on this.

252
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,680
You know how dumb the average guy is?

253
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,720
He wants to be a good teacher.

254
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,720


255
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,560
He's asked his flock of apprentice sales ministers.

256
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,600
Well, by definition, half of them are even dumber than that.

257
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Praise Bob. Sad but true and getting worse each year, dear friends.

258
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,840
The kooks are our future.

259
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,920
So make no mistake.

260
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,960
It'll be a rich harvest for industrial skull farmers like us.

261
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,280
And those of every creed.

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:25,980
Because the brains of the all too willings are out there ripening, ingesting a rich loam of made-for-TV UFO movies.

263
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,280
And absurd claims for holistic vitamins.

264
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,320
Radio preachers who converse with angels.

265
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,980
Millions of potential vegetables just waiting to be plucked, shucked, and hauled off to market.

266
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,060
And if it ain't us that does it, it's gonna be a lesser cult.

267
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,240
Or even worse, some political group, dear friends.

268
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,220
So if you don't get it by now, you never will.

269
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
Like they say and say again.

270
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,680
I don't know what you're doing.

271
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,260
You want to know what we're doing?

272
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,280
Sounds pink to me.

273
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,220
We've been talking about it for an hour and a half.

274
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,660
And if you haven't figured it out yet, pal, you never will.

275
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,940
Well, I'm a Christian and I think this is a sin.

276
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,060
I think this is a fake hate call.

277
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,000
Duh.

278
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,820
This is a fake hate call.

279
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,480
I want to get some real hate calls.

280
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,980
This guy's a Bobby.

281
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,920
We can't deal with it.

282
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,840
Listen, no friends out there.

283
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,300
We don't want fake hate calls.

284
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,460
We need the real thing.

285
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,860
I mean, it's just like in Dallas.

286
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,480
I mean, I'm in the middle of the Bible Belt.

287
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,360
We've been doing this subgenius hour of Slack show every Sunday night for almost a year.

288
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,460
And no one's killed us yet.

289
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,880
Well, did the Reverend ever explain to you what subgenius meant?

290
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,320
What was their connotation to concern?

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
No, we didn't get into that today.

292
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,280
I was just wondering.

293
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,020
You know, I just kind of always took it on its face value.

294
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,240
Uh-huh.

295
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,200
Well, if you joined it, you would be subgenius, wouldn't you?

296
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,300
I believe so.

297
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,020
What is he going to be when he wakes up and starts breathing?

298
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,520
Tell you what, I'm not going to turn my radio on Friday morning no more.

299
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,400
Because I thought the little imbibing I'd done last night would pass.

300
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,060
But I ran it back into a nightmare when the radio came on.

301
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,040
Stuff happens.

302
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,680
Thank you, Gary.

303
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,260
Thanks very much for calling, Norman.

304
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,940
How are you, sir?

305
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,740
Yeah, I'm sorry I missed Reverend Stang a while ago.

306
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,320
He mentioned a Reverend Bucknaked.

307
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,280
Yeah, I think I knew him years back when he played in a band.

308
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,220
I believe that Reverend Naked does still play in a band.

309
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,400
Yeah.

310
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,540
Does he play the organ?

311
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,440
I don't know.

312
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,020
Yeah.

313
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,400
Well, this Bucknaked I knew could finger an organ better than anybody I ever saw.

314
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,800
That's about enough on that one, John.

315
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,480
Hi, Kevin.

316
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,080
How are you doing?

317
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,500
Fine.

318
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:54,920
How are you?

319
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,740
Good, good.

320
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,620
I've never called before, but...

321
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,320
Well, we're glad you could call today.

322
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,020
Well, thank you.

323
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,660
I do listen all the time.

324
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,080
I wanted to say something about that subgenius thing.

325
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,260
I had seen a video of a guy who was playing a guitar.

326
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,260


327
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,260


328
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,260


329
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,260


330
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,260


331
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,540
He was playing a piece of paper that was printed by them about six or seven years ago.

332
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,380
And a friend of mine brought it over and said, look at this.

333
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,520
And we looked at it, and it was the scariest thing I ever saw.

334
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,880
I just wanted the listeners to hear this experience that I had gone through.

335
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,880
Anyway, I read it, and what it was was it looked like gibberish on the surface.

336
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:36,340
In other words, it was just a lot of weird lettering and words that didn't make any real sense.

337
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,200
Until...

338
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,960
What?

339
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,280
Until...

340
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Until I read through it, and it just...

341
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,620
It was like possessed or something.

342
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,500
It was scary.

343
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,020
It really scared me.

344
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,180
There was bad words in there, and there was...

345
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,480
No.

346
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,300
...messy stuff.

347
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,620
I mean, not like full bad words, but like just really, really scary stuff.

348
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,040
While you were reading it, did demons with fingernails begin clawing at your flesh?

349
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,740
Well, I know one thing.

350
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,260
No, they didn't claw at my flesh.

351
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,260


352
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,780
But it scared me to the point to where I decided I better not read anymore.

353
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,720
And it was a question of...

354
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm not a religious fanatic or anything by far, but I could tell that there was definitely not wholesome stuff in there.

355
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,160
And I just thought it was really...

356
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,660
It made such an impression on me.

357
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,180
Like I said, seven years ago I read this thing, and it was done very professionally, printed and everything.

358
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,420
It wasn't just, you know, scurvy.

359
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,400
But it wasn't wholesome?

360
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,780
No, it was...

361
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,440
My word.

362
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,720
I would say it was just really, really weird.

363
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,460
Weird and not wholesome.

364
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,120
Boy, I'm surprised they allow that kind of stuff to be printed.

366
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,460
Well, no, you see, it wasn't anything you could just, you know, say, oh, there is bad, you know, bad...

367
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,180
Bad words, yeah.

368
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,400
...words being written.

369
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,780
It was more like...

370
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,800
It was like speaking in tongues, except it was evil.

371
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,520
Mm.

372
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,340
If you could imagine something like that.

373
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,420
Oh, I think I could, and we thank you for alerting us to it, Jeff.

374
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:28,200
Well, you know, evil is as evil does, or something like that, I suppose.

375
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,640
I wish that I could play the entirety of the tapes that these little...

376
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,660
...interviews come off of.

377
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,640
They're usually very old interviews.

378
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,340
I'd love to play the whole thing, but they're from other stations.

379
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,360
Hey, let's do something new, you know?

380
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,440
Speaking of which, there are some new things here I need to cover.

381
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,820
See, the subgenius mentality does not have to call itself subgenius.

382
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,020
You'll be saved from damnation if you do call yourself a subgenius.

383
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,500
And especially if you're currently...

384
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,340
...wearing the right membership cards in your pocket.

385
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,880
You can write for information about that.

386
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,860
We'll give the number at the end of the broadcast at 10 o'clock.

387
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:22,060
But in the meantime, there are, like I say, other ways to do the same thing that a subgenius does, which is to get slack.

388
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:34,020
And this weekend, the lead singer of the Swingin' Erudites, who I've played many times before in their older incarnations on the show...

389
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,940
...the lead singer Johnny Angel, a friend of Dr. Cleve...

390
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,940
...brother Cleve Duncan's, who you all know so well...

391
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,180
...he sent me their album.

392
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
In fact, he sent me several copies of it.

393
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:54,000
And yes, the Swingin' Erudites have finally made it to vinyl...

394
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,840
...or whatever it is they record on nowadays.

395
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,620
Disc, film, you know...

396
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,040
I think this is analog, not digital.

397
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,840
But I'm gonna play just a few bits and pieces off of it.

398
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,500
This one right here is probably a good one to...

399
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,720
...to dedicate to the worried caller who called that normal talk show...

400
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,220
...saying that the nonsensical subgenius stuff he had read seemed so evil.

401
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,780
You know, to others, to some, it seems neither nonsensical nor exactly evil.

402
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,020
Right.

403
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,600
For everybody's headin' west

404
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,440
Where they hear the serpent's best

405
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,720
Will meet a former mouseketeer

406
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,780
And get the hell away from here

407
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,960
Services!

408
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,560
We must have fleeced the block this time once too often

409
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,740
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

410
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,100
And the Reverend Jerry Falwell put the last nail in the coffin

411
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,940
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

412
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,980
We're going out west to the Golden Coast

413
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,200
I hear the preaching is peachy and the Lord is most

414
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,020
Now that we ain't got no home

415
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,640
Let's praise the Lord and pass the copper tone

416
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,080
Go to where it never freezes and surf all day

417
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,740
Thank you Jesus

418
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,320
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

419
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,820
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

420
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,040
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

421
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,120
Well we moved to California, was a matter of survival

422
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,060
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

423
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,720
We got the Hodas and Rockinis and we had a big revival

424
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,560
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

425
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,840
They claim a rolling stone, shout gather no moss

426
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,840
We'll build a bitchin' woody from the Holy Cross

427
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,620
Surf and sea and waves and sand

428
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,340
Drop the shroud into a wreck and get a groovy town

429
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,960
Arthur, who art in heaven

430
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,320
Get me a scurvy at the 7-Eleven

431
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,900
7-Eleven

432
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,900
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

433
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,280
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

434
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,580
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

435
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,280
On your knees!

436
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,120
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

437
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,120


438
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,120


439
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,140
Hey can we go to Kansas?

440
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,040
We could have moved to Texas

441
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,060
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

442
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,440
The Reverend Jimmy don't care cause he likes both sexes

443
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,080
Frankie and the Nut, Geechee and the Tammy

444
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,060
Would have moved to New York City but boy oh boy, the Nut is gonna be my baby!

445
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,740
There's two Jews for every gore

446
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,640
Two Jews for every gore

447
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,580
I really wish to hell I was the Holy Father

448
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,520
Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tanny

449
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,860
I wouldn't need a surfboard, I could walk on water

450
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,080
Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tanny

451
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,000
Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tanny

452
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,120
Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tanny

453
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,200
Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tanny

454
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,500
David Lee Roth, here's Hagar Samy

455
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,440
On and hang tight

456
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,660
on

457
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,780
Oh, yes indeedy!

458
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,380
Well, we've certainly had some interesting calls tonight

459
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,500
at 823-7490

460
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,020
Since we've switched frequencies with KCBI, you see

461
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,760
This used to be KNON, the station for open-minded weirdos

462
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,680
and rednecks, minorities

463
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,380
of all kinds, anybody not totally into the mainstream

464
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,040
and anybody into the mainstream,

465
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,920
whereas KCBI was somewhat more narrow readership or listenership.

466
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,520
So half of the calls have been saying,

467
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,560
hey, KNON, where are you on the dial?

468
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,920
And if you're hearing me, you already know,

469
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,620
and if not, then what's the point in trying to tell you?

470
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,580
We're a little bit to the left.

471
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,920
And the other half of the callers have called expecting to hear KCBI,

472
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
which used to occupy this airspace.

473
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,480
And, well, for those of you wishing that you were hearing

474
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,220
your good old KCBI Christian station that you're used to,

475
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,500
you are the lucky ones.

476
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,700
You are really lucky because you are now finally by accident

477
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,340
being delivered from the false religion,

478
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,080
the biggest trick.

479
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,600
The devil ever pulled on you to the church of the subgenius.

480
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,080
The biggest trick ever pulled on the devil.

481
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,000
Let's see.

482
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,220
He and the devil thinks I'm kidding right now.

483
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,180
Don't you, Satan?

484
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh, yes, yes.

485
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,200
It's a study in opposites, dear friends,

486
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,280
but at the same time, I mean, we're on the side of right and good.

487
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,260
And the only difference between us and what you may have used to be listening to

488
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,620
is that it doesn't really matter to us how much money you make, see?

489
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,080
Or what religion you are, what color you are, what sex you are.

490
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,440
To us, now, I'm not speaking for,

491
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,100
Canaan is not solid church of the subgenius.

492
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,300
We only do this one hour a week.

493
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,060
That's all the slack you're going to get for a week.

494
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,940
In this form.

495
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,820
However, stay tuned for further slack of many different kinds.

496
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,440
This is a station that has gospel in the morning,

497
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,460
Hispanic music during a chunk of the day,

498
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,900
soul and hip-hop, rap stuff another chunk of the day,

499
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,680
country, redneck, good old Texas stuff,

500
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,060
and then the weird punk late on into the night,

501
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,220
plus special days of talk shows.

502
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,620
And,

503
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,980
and alternate news that you may not quite get the uncensored versions of

504
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,360
and other stations, so.

505
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,420
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,060
Why don't you, those of you who have stumbled upon us,

507
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,520
upon our new frequency,

508
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,320
please just keep listening.

509
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,700
Don't judge the whole station by this show.

510
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,180
How could any other show keep up with this?

511
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,320
They don't all have Bob.

512
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,560
Some of them just have records.

513
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,620
What you just heard a little while ago

514
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,920
was the swinging,

515
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,640
the erudites version of Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tammy.

516
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,920
We're going to play some more swinging erudites.

517
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,660
It's nice to reach out.

518
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,980
It's nice for a change not to be preaching to the saved.

519
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,020
That is the downfall of everybody from the early Christians

520
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,300
to the new age fakers,

521
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,720
to the modern day Christian fakers,

522
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,260
to, in fact,

523
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,040
the subgenius fakers,

524
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,320
preaching to the saved.

525
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,780
I hope that you all,

526
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,400
that you all who cannot figure out what's going on,

527
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,960
keep listening and become ever more confused

528
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,500
until the fear and puzzlement builds up in your mind

529
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,720
to the point where you can't quit talking about it.

530
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,060
And those of you who work with you in your office

531
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,700
and think you're a religious fanatic,

532
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,780
they'll think it sounds like a pretty interesting idea

533
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,360
and probably end up contributing money

534
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,760
either to this station or

535
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,180
some other agency.

536
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,900
But thereof, you see...

537
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:00,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

538
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,260
And you tried everything.

539
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,400
You ain't seen nothing yet.

540
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,260
Learn to think big.

541
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,520
Develop the tricks of length extension.

542
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,860
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

543
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,100
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

544
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,080
Get stuck in 4K everyday.

545
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,080
The student of Dobbs' training

546
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,000
is practically forced to bring his strangest desires

547
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,820
into rampaging life.

548
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,780
I used to get embarrassed of all my glass manners.

549
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,700
Now I get paid.

550
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

551
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,440
The pinks pay me fabulous sums of money

552
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,760
for what they used to put me in jail for.

553
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,600
Thanks to Bob.

554
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:53,420

560
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,540
Dobbs is seen to it that he exercises this abnormality

561
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,280
to do what he does best.

562
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,280


563
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,600
What you otherwise, he teaches, would be nothing short of spiritual suicide.

Now, see another dimension on your TV.

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,500
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

572
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,440
Become physically attractive overnight.

573
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,460
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

574

¶¶

575
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,840
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior

576
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,900
to explore new ways of going over the edge.

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,280


594
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,300
yourselves ¶¶

595
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,420
Giving away shelter in the dark.

596
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,420
And that you have all except one.

597
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,100
It's about sports.

598
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,320
But don't you worry.

599
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,260
Your own is going outside your—

600
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,980
living in war and death.

601
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,020
To throw your own hunting prescription.

602
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,240
Is this existence in here the cause or cause of death,

603
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,300
Its Ramble's Chancery!

604
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,900
And what will it do?

605
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,000
What's gone wrong,

606
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,300
what's causing this nuisance,

607
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,340
they spice up 43感じ Christine!

608
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,060
Who's this kind Rammel boy?

609
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,560
It's feu after this thing to a fuzz on the spring,

610
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,760
Friends, we can cruise it all the way down the line, I'm afraid.

611
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,300
All the way.

612
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,680
Even though that wasn't actually...

613
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,180
Talk about the amusement park.

614
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,960
Oh, well, yes.

615
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,240
If we give, we'll never be able to raise the money for that amusement park now.

616
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Amusement park?

617
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,080
What amusement park?

618
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,320
Oh, the subgenius amusement park in Oklahoma.

619
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,280
On the highway, across from the Stucky's.

620
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,980
Near that big cement dinosaur they got out there?

621
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,340
Yes, there's a giant crude cement bob now with a cafe inside.

622
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,840
Talk about the nail slide.

623
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,080
They must have had some of the hot chili at that cafe.

624
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,940
Yes, and...

625
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,140
Listen to that reaction.

626
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,940
You know, the shower of razors and a lot of fun in the funhouse.

627
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,940
Of course, my favorite.

628
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Of course, you know what a funhouse.

629
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,740
The distorto chamber.

630
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,760
It seems there are some people who have been locked in there since 1944.

631
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,940
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

632
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,020
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon,

633
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,860
which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

634
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,400
and carnage, insanity, and destruction

635
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,900
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

636
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,700
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

637
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,960
A time of cataclysmic economic change

638
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,640
that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know,

639
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,960
while billions of deserving conspirators

640
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,720
and doobs fry in hell on Earth.

641
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,920
Oh, and that's the part I can't wait to see.

642
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,400
That's what, that's really the point of every religion.

643
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,660
That's the point we're all, that every true fanatic is waiting for.

644
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,060
When he gets to see the unbelievers

645
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,100
fry the flesh peel off their bones

646
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,560
for eternity without killing them.

647
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,840
Well, we're going to drop away from,

648
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,140
from the dogma for a while.

649
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,840
That is an old classic subgenius media barrage material, by the way.

650
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,440
Co-produced by myself, Reverend Ivan Stang, your host,

651
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,040
and Dr. Bleepo Abernathy,

652
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,560
and I believe Brother Cleve Duncan,

653
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,400
who was at one time involved in the band.

654
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,220
We're going to continue playing the Swinging Erudites.

655
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,520
This is the Paul McCartney Massacre.

656
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,520
You're going to love it.

657
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,440
This album is crammed with stuff.

658
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,300
A whole lot of it has,

659
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,020
each song has one or two words that I,

660
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,940
because of our dedication to decency and morality,

661
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,020
and that this is a family show,

662
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,240
that we have to censor some of those words.

663
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,740
This upcoming material, I don't think I do,

664
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,920
this is from the Swinging Erudites.

665
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,940
And before I forget, why don't I give you their address

666
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,200
so you can write for information on procuring the amazing music by these guys,

667
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,320
or tell your record store to write them,

668
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,140
because they need to,

669
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,680
all the support they can get in this part of the country.

670
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,280
They're well known in New York, LA, Boston, so forth,

671
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,600
but down here, it takes a little longer.

672
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,760
And that's Swinging Erudites at P.O. Box 923,

673
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,980
Northampton, Massachusetts.

674
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:43,320
Once again, Box 923, Northampton, Massachusetts.

675
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,120
M.A. 0-1-2.

676
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,160
1080.

677
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,540
And this is, I mean, you can't really,

678
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,460
this, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for what we're doing to music

679
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,120
in the name of the erudites, but, uh,

680
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,380
but I'm glad, I'm glad if it hurts you.

681
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,640
I'm so glad.

682
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,900
And those of you who it most hurt should listen closest to the lyrics here.

683
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,720
Thank you.

684
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,680
I love your

685
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:19,680


686
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:19,680


687
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:47,120
You think the people would have had enough of the Pallmark heartyou think the people were having up a palm a party. I look around me and I see that this is so, it's yoko. So people want to word the, well, stop scheming with maybe the best lives, but we're not necessarily complying with the rules.

688
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
So here we go

689
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,740
Again

690
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,640
It was 20 years ago today

691
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,100
Long before they ever had CDs

692
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,520
Now the Paisley is back in style

693
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,020
It's guaranteed to stay a while

694
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,340
Why don't you find something new

695
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,920
Not the same thing all these years

696
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,400
You're stupid people living in the past

697
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Yesterday

698
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,260
All that trouble seemed so far away

699
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,800
Now I need a place to hide

700
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,380
Hide away

701
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:52,120
I believe in yesterday

702
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:54,880
Suddenly

703
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
There's a hand overshadowing day

704
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
Bernie Rumble stands against the bay

705
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,640
I believe in yesterday

706
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,800
Why she had to go

707
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,760
I don't know

708
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,700
She went and said

709
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,180
Yesterday

710
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,920
I said something wrong

711
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,520
Now I long for yesterday

712
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,020
Yesterday

713
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,920
I'm not alone

714
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:46,940
I'm not alone

715
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
I'm not alone

716
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:50,460
I'm not alone

717
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,900
Yesterday

718
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,880
All that trouble seemed so far away

719
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,780
Now I need a place just to hide away

720
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,440
I said something wrong

721
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,960
Now I long for yesterday

722
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,980
Oh, yeah

723
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm not alone

724
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:15,780


725
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,620
Yeah, yeah

726
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,840
Yeah, yeah

727
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,680
Wow, wow, wow

728
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,120
Oh, wow, wow

729
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,800
Oh, wow, wow

730
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,060
Yesterday

731
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,280
We were in the studio

732
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,660
Oh, wow, wow

733
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,520
Someone said play

734
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,060
Yesterday

735
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,220
It wasn't yesterday

736
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,140
Wow, wow, wow

737
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,460
That was rock rockstar

738
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,200
Oh, wow, wow

739
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,680
Oh, wow, wow

740
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,360
Oh, wow, wow

741
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,380
Oh, wow, wow

742
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:45,760
Oh, wow, wow

743
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:45,760


744
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:45,760


745
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,340
There goes Ringle, because he's got so many rings.

746
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,220
And here comes Linda, she's a dog with wings.

747
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,900
Down, down, I'm really down.

748
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,280
Down, down.

749
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,500
Picture yourself killing time in the studio,

750
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,860
trying to pad this record to LP size.

751
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,600
Suddenly someone says you're out of money.

752
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,560
Did I mention Van Allwhite's thighs?

753
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,220
Yes, it is.

754
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,140
I've been going this far away.

755
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,280
So I need to find a way.

756
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,460
Oh, I figured.

757
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,240
And yes, I did.

758
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,380
It's reggae time.

759
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,620
Oh, no, it ain't.

760
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,220
Because we got to comment on these calls we're getting.

761
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,940
I mean, this is the most amazing,

762
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,140
Dими gave us one,

763
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,260
Vaughn got about 5% off for this right here.

764
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,780
But he was out of money

765
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:15,780


766
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,620
And so I collected the money on the

767
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:16,640
is all the word I had.

768
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,920
Those, the� ceteras I didn't buy

769
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:18,920


770
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:18,920


771
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:18,920


772
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:18,920


773
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:18,920


774
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,000
live broadcast.

775
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,240
Yes.

776
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,060
Yes.

777
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:25,380


778
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,020
This is bad.

779
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,440
This is almost fun.

780
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,920
This is a Have you got, friend.

781
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,120
fact, not don't Google me.

782
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,200
to clarifying a couple of things.

783
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,860
Number one, the church of the subgenius is not satanic.

784
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,480
We do occasionally make minor financial arrangements

785
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,140
with lesser demonic entities.

786
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,680
Only our guru Bob Dobbs makes deals with Satan,

787
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,500
but he's not friends.

788
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,060
And the only reason he does that is because Satan owes

789
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,360
both Bob and his buddy, the fightin' Jesus,

790
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,440
quite a bit of what you might call money.

791
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,760
Souls, actually, is the commodity used.

792
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,480
J.R. Bob Dobbs is an old drinkin' buddy

793
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,340
of the fightin' Jesus.

794
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:17,540
Bob has instructed us that most everything Jesus said

795
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,440
was really cool, considering it's a bit dated.

796
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,140
I mean, you know, but.

797
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,220
So relax.

798
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,780
Relax, friends.

799
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,860
And go.

800
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,420
In your own delusion.

801
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:32,800
In your own delusions.

802
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,260
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

803
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,900
Find a place to hide.

804
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,760
And bridge your confusion.

805
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,800
We will save you from the clutches of the conspiracy.

806
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,660
We will save you from the chains of time.

807
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,540
We will save you from the men in black.

808
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,040
Because every subgenius must have slack pre-fab.

809
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,140
Yes, dear friends, we are praising Bob real hard tonight.

810
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,120
And praise the fightin' Jesus, too.

811
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:07,680
What the heck?

812
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,460
It's just the fan clubs of the fightin' Jesus

813
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,240
that make us mad sometimes.

814
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
And, see, we're just not as forgiving.

815
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,560
You know, Bob isn't as well connected as Jesus

816
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,160
or any of the other Jisai.

817
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,780
There's so many of them runnin' around nowadays.

818
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,660
But there's only one true Bob, friends.

819
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,060
Oh, boy.

820
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,620
Let me hear you say it.

821
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,020
Woo!

822
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,040


823
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,460
Hey, Bob!

824
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,380
Oh!

825
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,000
Hey, Bob!

826
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,640
Woo!

827
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,480
Woo!

828
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,440
Woo!

829
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,780
Hey, Bob!

830
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,460
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

831
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,080
will usher in a spiritual rebreather

832
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,280
and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

833
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,540
supernatural bridges,

834
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,320
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities.

835
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,040
Bob, a teacher of science at the sevi parking lot,

836
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,040


837
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,040


838
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,000
I don't want to, but I don't want to.

839
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,440
I want to talk to you.

840
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,480
Would you like to share some of the stories

841
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,480


842
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,480


843
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,360
A book will transform the lives of those who dare

844
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,160
to seek them and pay for them...

845
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,220
That's right.

846
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:25,180
You're lucky to live in the end time.

847
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,140
he's not the Christ either

848
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,080
he's more like the anti-anti-Christ

849
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,840
whatever the heck that means

850
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,680
we just have to trust in Bob and have faith

851
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,080
faith is what it's all about

852
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,780
just like with your other religions

853
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,340
unquestioning faith

854
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:47,760
we don't need to know why or where for

855
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,260
or where the proof came from

856
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,700
Bob said it, I believe it

857
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,080
that settles it

858
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:07,680
remember the motto

859
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,760
perform the salute

860
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,460
slack off and study the pamphlet

861
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,840
and you can get those pamphlets, friends

862
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,420
by writing for information

863
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,660
free information from

864
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,920
God

865
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,440
got that pencil ready?

866
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,280
we'll try to give it again at the end

867
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:26,900
Bob

868
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,940
there's a pipe in the sky, friends

869
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,280
and you'll follow it anywhere

870
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,440
especially to P.O. Box

871
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,960
140306

872
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,560
in mighty, mighty

873
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,880
Dallas, Texas

874
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,000
75214

875
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,760
Bob

876
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,220
at Box 140306

877
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,340
Dallas, Texas

878
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,920
75214

879
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,480
there is a pipe in the sky

880
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,860
and it follows you everywhere, dear friend

881
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,700
are you gonna be ready to dive into Bob's pipe

882
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,940
like a pinch of his frock

883
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,020
and rise on the smoke

884
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,380
up to the escape saucers of the sex goddesses

885
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,600
on X-Day 1998

886
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,420
or are you gonna be left behind

887
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,940
like the rest of the unbelievers

888
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,680
frying, frying in a head of smoke?

889
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,900
hell of your own making

890
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,800
except for the time in the end

891
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,100
this randomness of mine

892
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,760
on all colors...

893
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,660
but before I go any further

894
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,660
I do have to give a, um

895
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,260
a little bit of a, uh

896
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,880
well actually

897
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,300
let's just, let's just, uh

898
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,800
calm down here for a second

899
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,680
and put on some more

900
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,280
oh, what kind of pleasant music

901
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,660
here, We Killed Elvis by the Episcopalian Band

902
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,360
with the Epstein Brothers

903
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,000
that ought to be good background

904
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,580
for this little announcement here

905
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,420
ha

906
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,300
you our Slack fans will love this one

907
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,300
it's doggy dip in garland time again

908
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,640
yes, it's time again to begin dipping your dog

909
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,740
and my dog too

910
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,840
pesticide dips and baths for all dogs

911
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,940
uh, no cats please

912
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,880
to help get rid of a pesty fleas and ticks

913
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,220
which can carry, uh, pretty serious diseases...

914
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,640
some of them designed by our own Dynasty...

915
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:30,340
own defense department. This happens, these are like special dip deals, I believe it's

916
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:38,240
free dog dips, at the M Bank of Garland parking lot on Garland Road and Avenue D.

917
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:46,580
And the reason why is, you know, you've got to get an early jump on those little arachnid

918
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:56,480
toyed fleas and ticks. Ticks! Shoot those ticks down, man. They come endless. Oh, it's so fun to

919
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,640
hear them pop when you put the match head on them. And also, it helps cool down your pet in the heat

920
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,240
of summer. The dips are effective for seven to ten days, offered every two weeks until mid-September.

921
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,600
It's a recovery and recoveringly a good cause. I'm just invited. Hope to serve.

922
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,480
I ain't gonna.

923
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:25,680
I'm gonna be there, but you understand. You know, it's hard to know sometimes where to take

924
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:34,200
the show. It becomes so ugly and frightening, even for us. The challenge of trying to save

925
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:41,120
the unsavable, to find the unfindable cassettes, sometimes drives us to use bits and pieces of,

926
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,680
actually, this whole show is composed of bits and pieces of other subgenius shows.

927
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:55,220
However, the one I'm about to play is the probably most original of them all. KPFA,

928
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:02,220
Berkeley, excerpts here from more than an hour, less than a show. Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence,

929
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:09,620
Mobius Rex, Gary Gabrog, Fran, Lies, and Glass Madness sometimes. And even once in a while,

930
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,480
me.

931
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,900
All right, all right. We'll be quiet. Okay, everybody, keep it down.

932
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,700
The show wife hates the show. There has to be a show wife hating the show.

933
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,440
Full voice effect can't be, uh, yeah.

934
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,520
Well, there it goes. I'm gonna show show wife my show thing.

935
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,400
Thou who hast unbuckled my buckler when I'm snapped my shield.

936
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,160
He's doing that buckly, buckly.

937
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He really likes that. Well, I like to get out my bullwhip and, uh,

938
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,740
just remove that buckler if it's got a badge attached to it.

939
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,840
Buck naked before Bob.

940
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,040
What? Naked before who?

941
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,880
I don't wanna be that. I don't wanna be that guy.

942
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,440
The buck passeth not. For the doe and the buck dwell in the same place.

943
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,760
Yes, it's possible someone was naked before Bob.

944
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,300
The buck is Bob.

945
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,520
Could be.

946
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,200
He is buck in tradition.

947
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,580
Could have been.

948
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,920
As a philosophical bat in the buckets of butts.

949
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,220
Could have been, I guess.

950
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,840
Who is being that you...

951
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,720
And why is he allowed to talk twice as fast as me?

952
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,140
I don't know.

953
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,540
Because you had too much show air, Gary.

954
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,900
And so did I.

955
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,100
Buck six six.

956
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,520
It sure felt...

957
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,040
Felt good.

958
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,800
How can you keep talking like that? I have noticed that you just...

959
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,100
Go, go, go.

960
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,360
It's beautiful. It's like poetry.

961
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,700
This?

962
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:25,660
Yes.

963
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,280
It's... it's a constant.

964
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,360
It's like an isosceles triangle stacked onto...

965
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,080
Planck's number.

966
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,140
Wow, that's pretty scientific.

967
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,640
Well, how do you kill it?

968
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,360
Do you just, uh, like, plug it in or...

969
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
You reduce its potentiometer level to the minus...

970
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,000
What?

971
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:44,360
Eight...

972
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,120
You have a spanking new issue of the book of the subject.

973
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:47,820
It's still there.

974
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,600
You just can't do it.

975
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,060
Sorry, I dropped a little collar on the floor there, but...

976
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,060
You gotta be able to pull yourself together pretty soon.

977
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:52,660
And now...

978
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:57,520
And now it's time for the show to be...

979
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:58,960
Itself.

980
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,060
You wish, buddy.

981
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,700
How right he is.

982
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,620
Go on, show. Let your hair down.

983
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,200
Yeah, this show is self.

984
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,960
Take your pants off.

985
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,980
Shake your shoes out and take it easy.

986
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,380
Yeah, shake your booties.

987
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,520
Yeah, at least...

988
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:13,900
Drive them.

989
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,660
Lean back and just, uh...

990
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,180
Ride with the slack.

991
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,140
Surf that buck plane.

992
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,920
Climb onto the slack wagon.

993
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,780
That magic surfboard of Bob.

994
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,380
Oh, God, it's messy in here.

995
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,620
God, my pants are getting all wet.

996
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,800
Crush those little blue devils.

997
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,860
I guess I just get too excited around the show or something.

998
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:31,800
I don't know.

999
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,800
Why are we doing this in an ice skating rink?

1000
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,500
This is terrible.

1001
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,400
It's cold in here.

1002
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:35,560
It's cold, yeah.

1003
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,360
These skates don't really fit.

1004
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,620
It's the best snack bar for miles of work.

1005
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,300
My feet hurt.

1006
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,680
I don't know if I want to be here anymore.

1007
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,460
Well, take those skates out of me.

1008
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,940
You've got them on upside down.

1009
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,360
Oh, that's why they hurt.

1010
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,560
When do we run up the show?

1011
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,720
I mean, is it like...

1012
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,020
Last time...

1013
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,400
What show?

1014
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,760
We didn't get to run up the show until half an hour after we finished.

1015
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,780
Oh, yeah.

1016
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,480
By then, it had gotten kind of stale.

1017
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,620
It wasn't as good anymore.

1018
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,200
How do you explain that exactly?

1019
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,560
Friends, I don't know if I really want to expose my audience as to what happens after the show.

1020
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,220
And what is actually done with the souls of the listeners afterwards,

1021
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,340
which we collect here on the...

1022
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,980
The microphone and these special condensers.

1023
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,820
Actually, it's not the microphone.

1024
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,620
It's like a bounce back from your speakers.

1025
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,460
It goes back to the transmitter and then is mailed to the church.

1026
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,080
Once again, at B.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1027
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,180
And you can also get information about...

1028
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,120
Well, actually, actually, friends, it's almost time for us to go.

1029
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,160
I'm going to play one more Swingin' Area Dice song pretty quick here to get us out

1030
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,920
and sort of transfer the slack awareness over to...

1031
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,300
to Robert Wisdom's show, American Music Party.

1032
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:53,040
I had meant originally to start on this show this new little department,

1033
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,580
a new department of the Hour of Slack, which we will start next week,

1034
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,200
reading from the book High Weirdness by Mail,

1035
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,940
which tells you where to get the weirdest stuff from the weirdest groups

1036
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:11,860
under the categories of weird science, UFO contactees, Jesus contactees,

1037
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,840
even weirder.

1038
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,940
Weirder religions than our own or yours.

1039
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:23,160
Health and self-improvement scams, new age saps, cosmic hippie stuff,

1040
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:35,300
great catalogs, and weird politics, funny clubs, weird art, comics, sleaze and rudeness,

1041
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,280
and of course, the cassette revolution in independent music and so forth.

1042
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,560
We'll read like one selection per chapter.

1043
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,180
We'll read like one episode per show and tell you the addresses of where to write for free information

1044
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:51,980
from these amazingly either brilliant or completely insane people.

1045
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,780
Thank you so much for bearing with the truth

1046
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,500
and the fragments of it that hurt so bad on the Hour of Slack.

1047
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:04,860
K and a win.

1048
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,240
Thank y'all.

1049
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,080
And this is the Swingin' Area Dice coming right...

1050
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,200
coming right...

1051
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,860
I met him at the candy store.

1052
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,060
The first hit was free.

1053
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,200
Yeah, we get the picture.

1054
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,480
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack.

1055
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,860
He lit the pipe and what did I do?

1056
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,300
Do, do, do.

1057
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,920
I talked to Jesus.

1058
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,580
He deserves it all of his crew.

1059
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,900
His motley crew.

1060
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,960
Little then did I suspect.

1061
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,040
In twenty minutes I'd be wrecked.

1062
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,440
Thanks for the craving, the dealer of the crack.

1063
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,680
I saw all those corny ads on TV.

1064
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,700
The boo.

1065
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,580
Too.

1066
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:13,920
Bad.

1067
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:13,920


1068
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,400
But what did they mean to a nice girl like me?

1069
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,960
Not Jack.

1070
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,780
My parents said, take care of yourself.

1071
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,580
But they're always wrong about everything else.

1072
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,260
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack.

1073
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:43,520
They kept saying, don't be pushed over and over, man,

1074
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:43,920
till I got there.

1075
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,480
I pushed my TV set out the window.

1076
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,820
It just increases my paranoia, man.

1077
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,840
Look into my mirror and see in a police car.

1078
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,260
I mean, I'm getting better.

1079
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,860
Thank you, David Crockney.

1080
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,080
No charge you.

1081
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,520
I felt so helpless.

1082
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,480
What could I do?

1083
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,280
Sell blood.

1084
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,900
I pawned mom's purse and her wedding rings too.

1085
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,680
To the house of correction.

1086
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,700
I could run.

1087
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,480
A three minute mile.

1088
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,740
Just to get my hands on that little brown bio.

1089
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,720
You made me a track star, the dealer of the crack.

1090
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,480
Walking the strip was the last place I was found.

1091
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,500
Downtown.

1092
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:40,480
Looking so spelt down at 83 pounds.

1093
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,360
Anorexia nervosa.

1094
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,080
Daddy's caddy, I got a board.

1095
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,100
Sign me into the Betty Ford.

1096
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,240
Get me a Valium, the dealer of the crack.

1097
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,480
Like you wow, like I meant like you must.

1098
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,720
I'm the celebrities here at this hospital, you know.

1099
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,080
I'm a little campier.

1100
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,820
Like I meant to be nerd.

1101
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,240
Richard Pryor.

1102
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,720
Like Kimmy Baker.

1103
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,140
Like she's really cool, you know.

1104
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,400
And like she had me some really neat makeup.

1105
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,080
And uh, Jerry Lee Lewis.

1106
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,240
And like, boy was there a whole lot of shaking going on there.

1107
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,780
And Julie from the love boat.

1108
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,020
And uh, she's not a perky anymore.

1109
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,640
But like, other people are like really cool.

1110
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,980
And like, now I feel like one of them, you know.

1111
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,940
And like, thanks to you, dealer of the crack.

1112
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,260
Like, I'm a celebrity too.

1113
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,420
Ooh.

1114
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:37,540
Yeah.

1115
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,060
Oh.

1116
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,200
Oh.

1117
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:39,140


1118
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,500
Oh.

1119
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,540
Oh.

1120
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,100
Oh.

1121
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:42,880
Oh.

1122
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,240
And now, the people of South Africa would like to thank Paul Simon for his efforts.

1123
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,620
OK boys and girls.

1124
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,600
One, two, three, ah.

01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:09,480

01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,060


1160
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:30,380
