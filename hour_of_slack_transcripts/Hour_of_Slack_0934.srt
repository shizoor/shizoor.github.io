1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs,

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,680
serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small, spinning fragment of solar driftwood,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,160
which by chance or design, man has inherited out of the dark mystery of time and space.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,580
Yet across an immense, ethereal gulf,

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,440
minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle,

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,660
people, intellects, vast, cool, and unsympathetic,

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,580
regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,460
Our mission to Mars takes place sometime in the future

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,760
when a sightseeing trip to the red planet is an everyday adventure.

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,920
When you enter, please use all three aisles.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,920
Keep your group together and move as far toward the end as you can.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,400
Welcome to mission control, space travelers.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,420
The first part of your trip to Mars today will be directed from this room,

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,900
and so will your landing when you return to Earth.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,500
Now on the large monitor, you can see your spacecraft waiting on the launch pad.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,600
Countdown is in progress and all systems are go.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,640
Have a good flight.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,360
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,600
Ladies and gentlemen, please follow me to the boarding gate.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,420
Mars is the new planet.

21
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,420


22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,420


23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,420


24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,420


25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,180
295, auto control is terminated.

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,040
You are cleared for hyperspace penetration.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,100
Good luck.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,800
295.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,080
Back in the 70s and 80s, this would have seemed like science fiction,

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,740
but today it's routine.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,440
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard our McDonnell Douglas DC-88 space liner

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,880
for today's mission to Mars.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,840
The captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,860
And please, no smoking.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,720
Attention, please.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Folks, this is Third Officer Collins speaking.

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm your tour guide today, and I'll be telling you about what's going on during the trip.

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,520
Right now, we're on final countdown,

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,460
and you can watch our liftoff on the lower screen in your cabin.

40
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,500
I'll speak to you again after we're in space.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,280
Mission control, this is Mars 295 ready for departure.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
295, roger. Countdown is go.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,800
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,540
We'll meet again at midnight.

45
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,880
We'll meet again at midnight.

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,480
Let's get some hot chicks on the phone and talk about Mars or something.

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,300
Well, why don't you get off the phone, because our phone lines are pretty much clogged up on your dumb ass.

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,580
Pointed at the pigeons.

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,240
Video taped the whole thing.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,420
Well, come on. There's got to be some redheads out there. Real redheads.

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,980
Listen to the conversation of these lost youth.

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,720
We are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,620
New caller on the air.

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,140
Hello?

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,640
Hello.

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,740
Yeah, so, so, so, it's destroyed for lack of knowledge.

57
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,040
So, oh, should we be talking about, like, current events?

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,020
Like, whether, like, we should be exploring Mars or paying off the...

59
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,700
Oh, did you hear the babies?

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,760
Or should we be talking about, like, the price of frop in China?

61
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,600
Myself, personally, you know.

62
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,780
Did you hear the babies?

63
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,020
Well, the baby in the first vessel that landed on Mars is not dead.

64
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,240
The baby is...

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,060
Maybe I...

66
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,300
A Mars baby.

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,640
My boss gets real upset when I talk about the babies that they put in those things.

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,720
Oh, they said, did they send...

69
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,660
Is that where they sent all the aborted fetuses was to Mars?

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,820
Oh, no, no, no. But seriously, you know, they...

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,280
What does a Martian baby taste like?

72
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,540
NASA doesn't make a big deal about this.

73
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,640
They don't talk about it on networks.

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,240
But if you look on the Internet news, there's, you know, further down at the end of the story, they'll report on these...

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,060
They were orphans, you know.

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,720
These were babies that nobody wanted.

77
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,820
Oh, oh. So they sent them to Mars, and maybe if they lived, then they'd live, and they'd be like Martian babies.

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,320
And then, like in the future, like in Ray Bradbury, when the people would go there, there'd be, like...

79
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,800
Well, the idea was to slowly...

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,500
These humans they're waiting for...

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,920
With somebody that...

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,140
For one thing, adult-sized people can't fit on those crafts.

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,820
Those are...

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,800
It's too expensive.

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,520
And it's experimental.

86
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,020
You know, this was like...

87
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,560
And you know how the animal rights people are.

88
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,540
They can't use chemicals.

89
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,680
Oh, yeah. So you can't use animals.

90
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,180
So...

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,200
But they have these...

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,600
They have these, like, test tube babies, basically ready to...

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,500
That would be, quote, born, unquote, shortly upon landing.

94
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:38,820
On Mars.

95
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,300
And then would be slowly adjusted to the Martian atmosphere.

96
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,720
They'd never really be able to breathe completely.

97
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:56,440
Oh, and really, like, those little robot things that they had that you think are riding around Mars are really, like, attendant to the babies, like changing their diapers and giving them bottles and things like that.

98
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,740
Is that what's going on there?

99
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,260
Somewhat.

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,080
That's...

101
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,500
There's...

102
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,820
There's...

103
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,760
Yeah, I mean, they...

104
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,140
They're twins?

105
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,780
They're doing that research.

106
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,320
But the whole thing is, like, there was...

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,080
Why not?

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,640
That was, I think, the scientific question.

109
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,380
Why not?

110
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,620
These kids, like I say, were abandoned or whatever.

111
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,280
They were found in a dumpster, like, nearly dead.

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,660
And it's like, well, the moms threw them away, so...

113
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,780
You know, it's garbage.

114
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,680
You can do whatever you want with garbage, right?

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,320
That's right.

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,940
It's public domain.

117
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,240
Well, it's not exactly that...

118
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,460
It's not like that.

119
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,160
I mean, that's...

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,660
That's silly.

121
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,360
But they...

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,680
But it's surprising how many people didn't know about the babies aboard the Opportunity

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,140
in the Spirit.

124
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,600
They're not inside the little crawling robots.

125
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,640
They're inside the body of the lander itself.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,300
And I think that they...

127
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,000
The body of the lamb.

128
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,880
All right, guys.

129
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
We got to pause for station identification here.

130
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,180
Oh, yeah.

131
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,100
I was driving on the freeway in the...

132
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,140
Yeah.

133
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


134
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


135
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


136
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


137
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


138
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


139
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


140
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


141
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


142
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


143
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


144
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,140
So, we passed by the fast lane with a rabid wolverine in my underwear when suddenly a guy

145
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,700
behind me in the back seat popped right up and cut those hands across my eyes.

146
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,700
I guess they said, Uncle Frank or Cousin Louie.

147
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Is it Bob or Joe or Walter?

148
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,560
Could it be Bill or Jim or Ed or Bernie or Steve?

149
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,500
I probably would have kept on guessing, but about that time we crashed into the truck.

150
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,500
And as I'm bleeding, bleeding, there are the asphalt.

151
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,660
Finally, I recognize the face of my Himachi dealer.

152
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,160
Who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,180
Everything you know is wrong

154
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,220
Black is white, up is down and short is long

155
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,520
And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter

156
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,140
Everything you know is wrong

157
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,000
Just forget the words that sing along

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,640
All you need to understand is everything you know is wrong

159
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,780
I was walking to the kitchen for some golden grams

160
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,420
When I accidentally stepped into an alternate dimension

161
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,360
And soon I was abducted by some aliens from space who kinda looked like Jamie Marr

162
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,640
They sucked out my internal organs and they took some Polaroids

163
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,880
And said I was a darn good sport

164
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,080
And as a way of saying thank you they offered to transport me back to any point in history that I would care to go

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,540
And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,620
So I could paint my own picture

167
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
And my phone bill on time

168
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,200
Just then the floating disembodied head of Colonel Sanders started yelling

169
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,820
Everything you know is wrong

170
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,860
Black is white, up is down and short is long

171
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,280
And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter

172
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,740
Everything you know is wrong

173
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,580
Just forget the words that sing along

174
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,260
All you need to understand is everything you know is wrong

175
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,140
Flste Zait 000

176

Closed Captioning by ancientroc0

177
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,100
I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin

178
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,100
When I got a nasty paper cut

179
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,420
And well, to make a long story short

180
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,580
It got infected and I died

181
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,180
So now I'm up in heaven with St. Peter

182
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,140
By the pearly gates

183
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,080
And it's obvious he doesn't like the narrow jacket

184
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,620
That I'm wearing

185
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,900
He tells me that they've got a dress code

186
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,120
Well, he lets me into heaven anyway

187
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,020
But I get the room next to the noisy ice machine

188
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,980
For all eternity

189
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,640
And every day he runs by screaming

190
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,260
Everything you know is wrong

191
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,200
Black is white, up is down, and short is long

192
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,580
And everything you used to think was so important

193
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,220
Doesn't really matter anymore

194
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,120
Because of simple fact remakes it

195
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
Everything you know is wrong

196
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,980
Just forget the words and sing along

197
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,800
All you need to understand is

198
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,620
Everything you know is wrong

199
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,560
Everything you know is wrong

200
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,380
Weird Al Yankovic, dear friends

201
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,440
And that's probably the most normal thing

202
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,200
That you're going to hear on this show all month

203
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,660
Much of this particular hour of slack

204
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,900
Number 934

205
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,580
Is from the

206
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
Dr. Sinister's Radio Sinesthesia show

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,280
On WCSB Cleveland

208
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,860
At which lonesome cowboy Dave

209
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,820
And Princess Wee and I

210
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,320
Invade now and then

211
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,600
In between live hours of slack

212
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,720
Such as the other night

213
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,280
When we were watching Princess Wee

214
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,020
The queen of all the UFOs, of course

215
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,600
Was watching the Mars crash last night

216
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,440
You know, they broadcast that live on the internet

217
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,840
So you can have a window in NASA

218
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,240
Which is kind of like a small classroom now

219
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,840
It used to be a giant classroom

220
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,420
Now it looks like a small classroom

221
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,920
With few cubby holes and guys with computers

222
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,620
And that's NASA now

223
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,780
And they were happy as can be

224
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,460
Because the babies

225
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,720
The one baby they thought had died

226
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,980
Was still alive

227
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,660
And the other one that was just landed

228
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,700
Had landed successfully

229
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,820
And was drinking its little fluid and so forth

230
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,020
And the robot was taking pictures

231
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,420
And it's weird looking

232
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,760
It's like it's in a different place

233
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,080
They're in a different higher elevation

234
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,860
Looking for signs of water

235
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,540
And there's like these Yeti droppings

236
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,620
These, well, to us they're Yeti droppings

237
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,480
The sign is there

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,620
They'll say that they're rocks or something

239
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,460
But there's these big flat white sheets

240
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,240
Of stinking, oozing putrescence

241
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
That obviously, Danny said

242
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,340
Genius thought that's a Yeti

243
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,060
Yeti's stinking

244
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,660
I love that word

245
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,040
But space Yeti

246
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
You know, Martian Yetis, whatever

247
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,080
Hey, it's like lagging behind

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,520
I don't want to

249
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,580
There's a six second delay

250
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,520
Between what's on the phone

251
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,680
And what we broadcast

252
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,920
Turn your radio down

253
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,060
Yeah, and then there's

254
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,260
And then there's probably some more delay

255
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,920
Through the internet

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,540
It's the technology of the future

257
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,140
It allows time travel

258
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,480
It's amazing

259
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,700
You are listening back in time

260
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,660
Backward, slow, crappy, crackly time travel

261
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,280
When you go back in time

262
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,100
You're there

263
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,360
But you're all crackly

264
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,380
Well, I can't listen

265
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,580
That's going to make me insane

266
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,240
Yeah

267
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
That's the idea

268
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,260
That's why they don't do

269
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,660
In fact

270
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,040
That's why

271
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,580
As a matter of fact

272
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,320
The so-called butterfly effect

273
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,480
Are exactly why

274
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,920
They outlawed that stuff in the 20s

275
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,380
You know, as a matter of fact

276
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,280
We actually have this

277
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,680
On top of our antenna

278
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,000
We are in control of a satellite

279
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,980
In orbit

280
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,120
Equipped with orbital mind control lasers

281
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,520
And a few people

282
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
We share this message with them

283
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,480
And they do not get turned into mindless zombies

284
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,080
By listening to this show

285
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,400
By program

286
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,500
We tell them

287
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,360
That they have to put on

288
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,780
A polished copper strainer

289
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,840
Over their heads

290
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,040
What happens when mindless zombies

291
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Listen to your program?

292
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,680
Do they become

293
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,940
Like mindful

294
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,040
Non-zombies?

295
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,280
Or do they just become

296
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,960
They just have a great time

297
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,720
Dabbling

298
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,840
All the zombies have a great time

299
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,040
Zombies?

300
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,920
The zombies

301
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,080
Dabbling

302
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,760
Dabbies?

303
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,460
Start

304
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,080
They go out on the town

305
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,280
And they just go to town

306
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,460
And paint the town black

307
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,380
And blue

308
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,180
And they eat brains

309
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,080
Lots of brains

310
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,340
And they get in the way

311
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,980
They kind of keep the streets clear of

312
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,200
Foul brains littering up the streets

313
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,960
Yeah

314
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,020
We have a nasty brain problem here in Cleveland

315
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,460
Yeah, well

316
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,880
I've only been there once or twice

317
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,040
We use it as a verb here actually

318
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,820
It's braining cats and dogs right now

319
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,000
There's not so many like

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,220
Brains littering the road

321
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,480
I guess

322
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,920
You know, maybe Spang and we

323
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,440
They go out and they pick up the brains

324
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,060
In their neighborhood

325
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,140
Just to keep it kind of clean

326
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,800
You guys carry on for a second, alright?

327
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,180
Carry on

328
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,520
Well, you know, when I was growing up in Dallas

329
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,880
Picking up brains off the street was no big deal

330
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,280
Because, you know, obviously the Kennedy assassination

331
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,980
The subsequent Oswald shooting

332
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,100
Spattering brains everywhere there

333
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,440
You know, the hell

334
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,300
Everything from the Kennedy assassination

335
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,700
Down to the Mickey Mantle liver replacement operation

336
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,240
Operation

337
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,620
Operation

338
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,480
Elvis, must you always smother my cooking in Tredo

339
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,520
Before you even taste it?

340
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,080
Are you kidding me?

341
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:54,800
Thank you

342
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,260
Remember, these starters don't come off

343
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,260


344
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,260


345
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,340
Oh, yeah, and whoops

346
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,540
Yep, so it's already known

347
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:58,540


348
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,680
You might actually want to suck on

349
00:13:59,680 --> 00:13:59,680


350
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
Really, look

351
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,920
And yes, translation

352
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:03,920


353
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
Kirby

354
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,340
Let's thank Mr. Turkey

355
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,340


356
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,480
Happy tag

357
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,220
Remember, I'm Evet

358
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,660
Mr. Türkiye

359
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,060
Shakura

360
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,160
keh

361
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,700
Goodbye

362
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,300
Let's do a film

363
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
I never saw anything.

364
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,300
I don't know what Mars is, and I was never there.

365
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,660
He had to shine that flashlight right on his ass.

366
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,040
You embarrassed the hell out of me.

367
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,300
I love him so much it hurts.

368
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,760
What do you know about love, Nymphonese?

369
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,020
If I didn't have you chasing a wall, no man in this town would be safe.

370
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,560
Stop that. I'm your doctor.

371
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,080
Get against the wall.

372
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,800
Mike, come in. I think I'm going to throw up.

373
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,020
How can I resist an offer like that?

374
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,140
Harry, your sister isn't an alien.

375
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,840
She's something much worse.

376
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,680
Honey, did you do a lot of drugs before we met?

377
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,560
A mix by dad, or so the file name says.

378
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,140
And that poor lonesome baby on Mars, what do you think about that?

379
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,180
There's one, well, there's two, but they're on opposite sides,

380
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,780
and their goal is to meet up and populate Mars.

381
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,780
They won't let us abort unwanted babies.

382
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
They want to send them to Mars.

383
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,440
Well, who wants to send unwanted babies to Mars?

384
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,860
They should just be aborted.

385
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,360
They should feed them to me.

386
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,420
They should use the unwanted baby stem cells instead of sending them to Mars.

387
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,340
Give them to Ali McGraw so she won't be so ugly looking anymore.

388
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,440
Wait, that's for real? They have stem cells on those things for real?

389
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,260
No, they actually had babies on them.

390
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,460
Well, they were, yeah, when they first were launched, they were babies.

391
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh, gosh.

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,540
They were stem cells, but by the time they got, you know, it's like nine months voyage to Mars.

393
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,140
By the time they got there, they were ready to be quote, unquote, born or decanted.

394
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,040
Decanted, yes.

395
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,580
Actually, they're kept inside the spaceship.

396
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,220
The hatchery and conditioning center.

397
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, these babies on Mars are expected to be really tough.

398
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,880
And the idea, there's one, I think the one on the Spirit is a boy.

399
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,900
And the one on the Opportunity is a girl.

400
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,580
That's why they call it the Opportunity.

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,140
I think everybody, every other human's ass.

402
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,240
Aren't they on the other side of Mars for me?

403
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,540
Right.

404
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,900
They're on the dark side of Mars.

405
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:26,500
So, the idea is, if they're tough enough to find their way to each other and mate by the time they're, you know, 12 or 13 years old,

406
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,800
they will be the fathers, the Adam and Eve of a new race that is incredibly tough.

407
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:40,980
It will be like the toughest race of humans if the little Martian on, the little baby on the Opportunity can meet the one on the Spirit.

408
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:40,980


409
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,360
What if, for example, they both go west?

410
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,940
Then they're basically waltzing around Mars and they're still on the opposite pole.

411
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,480
Well, then that particular Martian race was not meant to be.

412
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,020
Well, I just see it being like a bad movie.

413
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,120
Like, these two little Martian babies getting together and they grow up.

414
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,880
Well, you guys are saying that you're acting like the dust pool, some silly cartoon.

415
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,320
And then one day, the one girl baby says, oh, I saw what you're doing over there.

416
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,480
Like that Blue Lagoon.

417
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,960
It's only, it'd be like, right now.

418
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:10,960


419
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,380
Red sand.

420
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,260
It'd be like the movie Blue Lagoon.

421
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,700
Well, that's a very romantic way to look at it.

422
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:27,200
This is actually a serious scientific experiment conducted by NASA to see if they can evolve a race of new super, super men, shall we say, and super women on the planet Mars.

423
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,960
It's part of the new space push that George Bush has presented to Congress.

424
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
George Bush.

425
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,300
To raise a race of super men on the planet Mars.

426
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,740
I wonder if it was legume sperm in any of those babies.

427
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,760
Well, we can only pray.

428
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,720
That there wasn't.

429
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,100
To whatever God won't listen to us.

430
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,840
Exactly.

431
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,160
Bang, I'll see you back on IRC.

432
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,920
Bang.

433
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,900
See ya.

434
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,200
I can barely hear you.

435
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,700
You're so far down the line of strings and tin cans, I can barely hear you, St. Bucky.

436
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,060
I will see you back on IRC.

437
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,540
Oh.

438
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,140
Yeah, I'm getting out of here too.

439
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I can barely hear you.

440
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:15,980
There's nothing.

441
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,580
From the land of endless night come I, an alien from afar,

442
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,180
Spume forth upon you a pleasant sphere so much like you, and yet so unalike.

443
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,620
Phil 7 cleanse Gal 네 slowly

444
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,620
X.am I'm I the you before, the you you were when your world was new?

445
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,680
Later Alex.

446
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,620
Or am I the you that you will be tomorrow?

447
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,440
Later bites.

448
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,080
Through me.

449
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Though I'm a.

450
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,640
future or your past, I know not which. For I come from that spark of light so far in space,

451
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:57,520
your mind the distance could not comprehend. It was once my home, and calls to me when I look up

452
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,900
into the void. But it is not the verdant place your planet is that warms and cools you as the

453
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:13,060
seasons go. Oh no. My mind recalls a seething cold and flung among the stars and satellites

454
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:20,600
and galaxies of boundless time. There, through evolution, I became the creature I am now.

455
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,060
No heart or feelings show in me. Perhaps I'm better off than you, for I see things without

456
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:33,560
emotion as they are. Some may envy me, but I pay a price to be from human feelings free.

457
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,120
In me, you see your destiny.

458
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,460
From the land of endless night, come I, an alien from afar,

459
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,920
spewn forth upon your pleasant sphere, so much like you, and yet so unalike.

460
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,880
Leonard Nimoy, out shatnering Shatner in this wonderful classic.

461
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,760
Land of endless night. Perhaps we should pray for him.

462
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,120
But really, I think we should all pray for the little babies inside those landers on Mars. I

463
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:32,180
thank God for saving the life of the first one. It's stranded away from the tool robot now,

464
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,660
because the tool robot's got sand in its joints or something.

465
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:43,720
It can't walk. It can communicate with the Earth, but it can't get back to the baby. So the baby

466
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,500
inside the mainlander is on its own, and the baby on the other side of the planet is still in pretty

467
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,820
good shape, because its nursemaid is still out photographing things and bringing back samples

468
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,340
and so forth. There once was a Martian named Smith.

469
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,020
He was a scientist, and he was a scientist. He was a scientist. He was a scientist.

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Let's get back on the science mode, like Mars. What do you think they're going to find after they

471
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,320
drill in that rock? I think the whole reason they're going up there is to bury all the...

472
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,560
Left by people living between the cracks? They're just burying some incriminating

473
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,720
evidence that Bush and Cheney had against them. That's the whole purpose.

474
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,040
I'll tell you what, they're looking for oil. They're going to find the Statue of Liberty

475
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,820
buried up to its neck, and Saddam Hussein's buried web. A

476
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:34,880
statue of liberty buried up to its neck, and Saddam Hussein's buried web. A statue of liberty buried up to its neck, and Saddam Hussein's buried web. A

477
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,680
Bush is looking for oil up there. Why do you think they're going to find it?

478
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,580
Yeah, really? Pretty soon we'll have the Martian pipeline.

479
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,980
He's going to pipe an oil line from here to Mars. Just imagine, and on a clear day,

480
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,960
you would actually be able to climb the pipe up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

481
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,460
Until next thing you know, you're on Mars. I would like to drop Dick Cheney.

482
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,280
You can't do that from Earth because our mountains are not high enough.

483
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,320
You can't do it on Mars.

484
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,540
But on Mars, there's a mountain that is high enough to climb all the way to Earth.

485
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,980
Well, there are a number of what they call decibels and increments between the planetary spheres.

486
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:28,480
And once you've crossed these, you suffer a number of different kinds of deaths and are automatically resurrected and reincarnated and re-scooped, as they say in...

487
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,820
Well, no, seriously, Dave, there is a mountain...

488
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,000
How about save that for science class tomorrow?

489
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,060
Well, Dave...

490
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,260
Dave, there is a mountain on Mars so high called Mons Olympus.

491
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,780
Oh, like the Mons Veneris, one of my other favorite mountains.

492
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,720
And it is so high that once you climb to the top of that, you can almost jump to Earth.

493
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,080
It's much easier to get to Earth.

494
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,980
So once they get to Mars, then they can go up that high mountain and jump to Earth.

495
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:02,620
So you're saying Mount Olympus is not in place, but Mount Olympus is on Mars because Mars is now here in the United States, America, Greece, whatever, the United States, the whole planet.

496
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,120
Okay.

497
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,340


498
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,540
Okay.

499
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,020
Okay.

500
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,020


501
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,020


502
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,020


503
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,020


504
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,020


505
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,680
Now, first thing you said to me, you said there's no such thing as Mars.

506
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,180
Then you say everybody from Mars.

507
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,980
And now you're saying Mount Olympus, home of the guys, old Greek mythology.

508
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,300
Look, I'm using...

509
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,220
Dave, I'm just using what the convenient nomenclature that the humans here use.

510
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
Well, don't you think of that...

511
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,680
He's professional.

512
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,620
Yes, I'm professional.

513
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:34,040
And what you're about to hear is a rare, just-released, perfect mint-conditioned recording of the Swingin' Love Corpses song...

514
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,260
High on Dockstock Mountain.

515
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:56,920
Now, this song is a commemorative of the very first World Subgenius Outdoor Music Festival held in the wilds of northern Arkansas called Dockstock in 1985, I believe it was.

516
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,180
High on Dockstock Mountain.

517
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:34,020
High on Dockstock Mountain.

518
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,760
From across the nation they came and they saw

519
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,600
A new will begin in northern Arkansas

520
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,860
They drove the storms and heralded night

521
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,920
To the new awakening in Dockstock in sight

522
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,080
They shared suits of love and grew great ties

523
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,980
The journey was dead and they were beating in five

524
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,980
The body was there but they were few

525
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,040
The body was there but they were few

526
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,120
It was mostly cool guys like me and you

527
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,740
And we got high, so high on Dockstock Mountain

528
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,940
Yeah, we got high, so high on Dockstock Mountain

529
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,540
We ate lots of mushrooms to commune with nature

530
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,660
How are we to know we'd have to move our shit later?

531
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,940
Five hundred colors flat

532
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,580
We've map

533
00:25:36,580 --> 00:26:02,760
Bear flowers, we painted pink, until then we got high, so high on Dockstock Mountain So we

534
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:02,760


535
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:02,760


536
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,600
soon after DC, then know we'd hold Dockstock on Dockstock thinking we'd already passed all three and five

537
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,620
go in one place before high school and moves up five Republican run in apoyoist I think we had

538
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:03,620


539
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:03,620


540
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:03,880
provides work.

541
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dr. Mountain.

542
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,900
People were happy, they were all having fun.

543
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,060
While Dr. Sir Bob was farming skulls in the sun.

544
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,040
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound.

545
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,160
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground.

546
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,240
The band that dared not was speaking his name.

547
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,400
While his doctors on the plant show was playing their fame.

548
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,400
Sparkdog Explosion and Combo Gang Punch.

549
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,260
Then his sister said, just in time for lunch.

550
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,620
And we got high, so high, on Dr. Mountain.

551
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,940
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dr. Mountain.

552
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:32,140
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dr. Mountain.

553
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:48,020
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dr. Mountain.

554
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,960
Gonna go back there, I'll even meet the Pope.

555
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,900
Better make it to Toc Toc, or just give up hope.

556
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,780
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear.

557
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,000
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear.

558
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,000
Now I'm gonna go back, and I won't be stopped.

559
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,140
I'm gonna go back, to smoke the ultimate frown.

560
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,060
You just can't imagine what it's like till you go.

561
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,380
When reality's on hold, and Doc Socks is going high.

562
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,580
Dr. So high, on Dr. Mountain.

563
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,500
Dr. So high, on Dr. Mountain.

564
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,220
Dr. So high, on Dr. Mountain.

565
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,720
Dr. So high, on Dr. Mountain.

566
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,800
Dr. So high.

567
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,320
Oh, yeah, I was way up high on Doc Sock Mountain.

568
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,560
I climbed down, I climbed up all the way to the top, whoo.

569
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,760
I took, I took everything you could think of.

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,660
I shot beers, I smoked heroin.

571
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,740
I snorted marijuana.

572
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,220
I sttuck in beer.

573
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,300
I stuck a stiff glue.

574
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,420
I put barbiturate repositories in my rectal cavity.

575
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,800
I soul danced on Venus with James Brown's sister-in-law.

576
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,460
I peed 10 square miles of asphalt.

577
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,800
And then I got stuck up there on top of Dockstock Mountain

578
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,760
because the song was over before I could ever come down.

579
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,200
So now I'm lost in Dockstock,

580
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,220
fropulated hell neither world,

581
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,080
in the song.

582
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,600
Hi on Dockstock Mountain, friends,

583
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,060
by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

584
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,440
And if you're new here,

585
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,640
you can download a ton of Swingin' Love Corpses material

586
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
and other mixes

587
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,440
from this website of Dr. Philo Drummond.

588
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:08,980
That's right.

589
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,020
Dr. Philo Drummond himself has another new website

590
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,500
called QuiveringBrain.com.

591
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
That's QuiveringBrain is one word.

592
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,600
Just type in www.QuiveringBrain.com.

593
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,340
It's all free.

594
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,160
It's all live.

595
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,920
It's all nude.

596
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,520
Check it out.

597
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,680
Wow.

598
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,600
Airborne,

599
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,080
incommunicado,

600
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,760
flea bags.

601
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,400
They all live here.

602
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,500
They sleep in our basement sometimes.

603
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,040
They wake up at the same time we do

604
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,900
and they follow us around the house.

605
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,180
And then it's too late.

606
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,120
We must bring them to their knees.

607
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,180
We must bring them to the dinner table.

608
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,320
And shave their knees.

609
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,500
Shave their knees.

610
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Shave their knees.

611
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,120
Shave their knees.

612
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,760
Shave.

613
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,840
That scared the hell out of me,

614
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,080
my initiation when they start doing that.

615
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,620
Oh, man.

616
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,160
We've seen them on movies.

617
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,000
My dad used to scare us.

618
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,340
Shave his knees.

619
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,540
Shave it off.

620
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,620
Shave it off.

621
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,100
It creeps you out.

622
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,920
And then braiding the armpit hairs

623
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,160
of those poor little girls.

624
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,080
But then you get to do it to the next initiate.

625
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,040
You know, the next...

626
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,160
You get to be the guy

627
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,100
that hands him the razor

628
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,440
and starts the chant.

629
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,560
Shave his knees.

630
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,480
Shave his knees.

631
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,620
I love initiating new bobbies.

632
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,820
Neophytes.

633
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,500
Yeah.

634
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,220
Bringing in the...

635
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,720
Oh, you know, it symbolizes

636
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,660
the renouncing of your old life

637
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,480
and the intake of Bob's sweet love

638
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,520
or something like that.

639
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,280
There's something in the textbook.

640
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,160
I think they stole the idea from the Masons.

641
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,040
The Masons make you shave your knees.

642
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,560
Well, those...

643
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,340
When they used to sell Masons shoes,

644
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,100
they used to offer everybody

645
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,860
a shave and haircut, two bits.

646
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,760
They'd lift up those old pantaloons

647
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,560
and just scrape the knees quite gently.

648
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,700
And that was part of a whole routine.

649
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,900
But we live in a different kind of country nowadays.

650
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,040
No, it's not sexy now.

651
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,040
It's not the same.

652
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,020
It's ludicrous now.

653
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,700
Nothing's the same.

654
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,260
Everything's different, even that itself.

655
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,220
And that's where most of the problems, you know...

656
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,420
The molecules just keep shifting so fast.

657
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,220
You know, you're looking at one person,

658
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,840
next thing you know,

659
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,540
you're looking at a freaking pterodactyl or something.

660
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,820
Right.

661
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,480
The quantum tsunami explains part of it

662
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,520
and the sunspots,

663
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,380
but there's definitely a little more

664
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,760
than just that going on.

665
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,160
Well, what if we all become immortal

666
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,540
during this big new solar setup of flares

667
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,480
and stuff like that?

668
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,920
But immortal to what end?

669
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,600
Yeah.

670
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,540
In what quality of immortality are we talking?

671
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,840
If the whole planet is dead

672
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,180
and we're just still walking around,

673
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,980
is that really life?

674
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,800
Is it?

675
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,600
These are the questions we have to ask.

676
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,700
These are the kind of things that we have to

677
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,060
grapple with in this modern day and age.

678
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,360
These are the...

679
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,500
End times close in on us.

680
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,740
Bob's stopwatch slowly winds down.

681
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,460
The huge, huge autonomic heads

682
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,060
with a thousand, thousand, thousand teeth

683
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,480
crunching up cities

684
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,880
and each individual individual.

685
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,780
In those towns.

686
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,500
Are you ready to be p-tested on judgment day?

687
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,640
For God's p-test.

688
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,040
The only p-test they're getting from me

689
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,940
is a taste test.

690
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,500
No, my friend.

691
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,680
When we say a p-test,

692
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,700
we mean your pituitary gland.

693
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,820
Oh, that test.

694
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,400
Yes.

695
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
We're going to be...

696
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,300
And your Enochian fluids.

697
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,820
We're going to see if you can communicate

698
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,320
with spirits and angels too

699
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,140
by testing the very, very top of your...

700
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,340
What's the pineal?

701
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,240
Pineal, pineal.

702
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,140
Don't forget the pineal gland.

703
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,640
Because I always forget it.

704
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,040
What do you want to call it?

705
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,400
Pineal gland.

706
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,500
Well, you're a med student, aren't you?

707
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,080
Not really, no.

708
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,440
Or a med kind of guy.

709
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,920
I mean, you know a lot about anatomy and...

710
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,540
I know a little, I mean...

711
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,500
What does your pineal gland do

712
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,060
besides make you cry bitter tears and explode?

713
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,140
I'm not sure that anybody knows

714
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,160
the answer to that question.

715
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,420
That's why it is considered

716
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,360
sometimes the seat of the third eye.

717
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,320
That's right.

718
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,020
Oh, a...

719
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,400
More rudimentary, less advanced

720
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,040
metaphysical sense organ.

721
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,260
But do they not indeed make air fresheners

722
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,480
from the same gland?

723
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,480
Pineal fresh...

724
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,420
No, no, that's pine.

725
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,640
That's not pineal.

726
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,660
Although they do make air fresheners

727
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,640
out of pineal glands,

728
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,640
but not in the stores that you shop at.

729
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,020
Right.

730
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,460
That's for the skull and bones.

731
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,200
They get the adrenochrome

732
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,400
and the pineal extract.

733
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,000
We'll have two.

734
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,640
I just have an adrenal gland issue.

735
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,120
This year we will have

736
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Kerry and Dean running against each other.

737
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,840
They both know the handshake and everything.

738
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,120
When they come...

739
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,160
When they meet each other...

740
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,860
Oh, really? I didn't...

741
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,800
I didn't know these guys.

742
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,820
So it's like skull...

743
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,340
It's like skull versus skull.

744
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,280
Skull versus skull.

745
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:09,760
Yeah.

746
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,300
Yeah.

747
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,720
The control factor.

748
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,580
So, in other words,

749
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,320
the old right-wing cranks were correct.

750
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,780
The threat was the Council on Foreign Relations.

751
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,220
And the old left-wing...

752
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,220


753
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,220


754
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,740
Yeah.

755
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,240
There was two.

756
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,480
There were 15 families around the world.

757
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,300
And, yeah.

758
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,140
All the cooks were right.

759
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,640
Yeah.

760
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,120
The Trilateral Commission was the threat after all.

761
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,480
Mm-hmm.

762
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,880
John Birch Society, we laughed at them.

763
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,080
Hey, crazy old people.

764
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,880
Think there's commies under the bed.

765
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,940
And it turned out

766
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,140
the right-wingers were the commies all along.

767
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,680
Oh, the old communists.

768
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,080
Oh, the old communists are right-wingers now.

769
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,980
Yep.

770
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,880
It's all come so turned around,

771
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,840
back-ass words.

772
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,560
It's like...

773
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,180
It's a smorgasbord, David.

774
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,400
They pulled one over on us.

775
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,200
They switched urs.

776
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,700
They switched with Mars.

777
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,260
And it sounded like a crazy joke.

778
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,940
World War II was a cover-up of the planet switching.

779
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,980
And I dare say this on the radio

780
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,880
because everybody thinks

781
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,860
it's a crazy old silly college student show.

782
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,940
Oh, they let Reverend Sang.

783
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,160
He's so crazy, he'll say anything.

784
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,620
But it's true.

785
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,980
Mars and Earth were switched

786
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,740
during what we remember as World War II.

787
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,920
And that movie, Dark City,

788
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,560
is a thinly disguised parable of how they did it.

789
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,520
And a man looked.

790
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,520
They hid it all right in plain view.

791
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,940
Oh, Mark the Beast.

792
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,580
The mark of...

793
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,240
There shall be a mark in your hand

794
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,540
and on your forehead and so forth.

795
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,740
Without it, you can't even...

796
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,540
Hey, dude.

797
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,040
It's called the UPC code.

798
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,500
The mark on your hand is called your thumbprint.

799
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,520
The mark on the forehead is called your face.

800
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,600
The Beast is the character recognition program.

801
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,640
Get used to it.

802
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,020
You were marked when you were born.

803
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,680
No, it's real weird.

804
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,760
And the Beast is a gene.

805
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,040
A gene.

806
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,820
And it was sinful.

807
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,280
Evil, irritating gene

808
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,700
that must be cut out.

809
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,440
A sidewinder on the spiral staircase of life.

810
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,600
That's why I get facial reconstructive surgery

811
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,520
every three years

812
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,700
and I had my fingerprints removed a long time ago.

813
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,680
And you know the right places to go, too, though.

814
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,560
That's the thing, man.

815
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,840
You're hooked up.

816
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,520
A lot of people,

817
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,720
they don't know how they can get this done.

818
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,800
It cannot be done on the North American mainland.

819
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,920
You will have to either go to South America,

820
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,820
Eastern Europe,

821
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,840
or the Caribbean.

822
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,900
And then you have to hope that the guy who's giving you the plastic surgery

823
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,860
and the new eyeballs

824
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,400
isn't somebody you busted earlier in your career.

825
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,700
Or somebody who just has something

826
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,460
and really has it out to get you.

827
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,340
I was working putting chocolates on pillows the other day, you know,

828
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,960
really has their sheepskin, so to speak.

829
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,560
Very careful.

830
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,280
Yeah.

831
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,640
And they're tricky.

832
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,440
These chop shops are everywhere now, too.

833
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,020
I mean, it's worse than the cannibalism problem in a lot of ways.

834
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,620
Conspiracy bugs.

835
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,780
You can be used for any kind of spare part.

836
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,020
They creep up on you.

837
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,600
I not only no longer recognize my own thumbs,

838
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,760
but my face that I stare at and see on the other side of the monitor screen

839
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,800
is no longer the same face that recognizes the other side of the face.

840
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,640
A face that I'm looking at, you know what I'm saying?

841
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,880
You cracked a few mirrors in your day.

842
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,100
Yep.

843
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,520
I put some holes in some monitors.

844
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,660
I smacked some hardware.

845
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,140
And I broke down and cried on the way home.

846
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,020
Where are we to live when the Martians own the Earth?

847
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
See, there you go.

848
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,960
And we'd all be having knee-jerk reactions.

849
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,140
You know, it's so ironic.

850
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,780
What do you mean, when the Martians?

851
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,080
The Martians currently own the Earth.

852
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,580
Quote, the Earth, unquote.

853
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,140
Of course, it's really what we think of as Mars.

854
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,200
Yeah.

855
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,500
When will some of the Martians,

856
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,480
finally go back?

857
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,700
We're the Martians, and we're trying to go back.

858
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,380
Well, once we restore Mars to its, or Earth,

859
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:10,420
I should say, original Earth, to its original Adamic beauty.

860
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Oh, Adamic beauty.

861
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,940
What do you think the conspiracy did to the so-called Red Planet?

862
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,940
It used to be the Garden of Eden,

863
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,120
and actually used to be what we think of as Earth.

864
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,280
It was our home planet.

865
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,180
Notice how everything seems heavier.

866
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,080
It's not even a planet.

867
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,680
Well, that's what I thought.

868
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
And everything takes too long,

869
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,360
and you never get paid anywhere near enough.

870
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,060
I thought we brought that with us from Mars.

871
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,580
You know, the heaviness was the iron ore and the oxide in the atmosphere,

872
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,180
which made us so slovenly slow.

873
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,460
There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend.

874
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,880
Those with a rope around their neck

875
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,640
and the people who have the job of doing the cutting.

876
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,420
And those with that rope around their testicles.

877
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,200
We made it, Fred.

878
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,160
Where on Mars?

879
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,540
No sweat at all.

880
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,440
Check all systems, secure retros, maintain full power at all times.

881
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:04,660
Okay.

882
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,740
This is Captain Fred Thomas,

883
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,420
commanding interplanetary vehicle M1, colonization probe.

884
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,880
To Colonel Hal Danvers, headquarters communication, planet Earth.

885
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,620
Subject of report.

886
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,860
Arrival on the planet Mars.

887
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,740
Landing is completely successful.

888
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm going out, Jim.

889
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,920
Remember the general's orders.

890
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,640
Stay in touch at all times, huh?

891
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,340
Roger.

892
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,700
Listen, Fred, be real careful, will you?

893
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,860
Yeah, be careful, Fred.

894
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,500
For the hundredth time, be careful.

895
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,020
Continuing arrival report.

896
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,700
Time, 1348.

897
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,020
Mars time, that is, Colonel.

898
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,780
On Earth, you'll be receiving this exactly three and a half minutes from now, sir.

899
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,900
Just add that to my figures.

900
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,760
There are enough Yeti outfits and supplies here to equip a small army.

901
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,640
Captain Thomas reports...

902
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:00,960
Fire!

903
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,280
Fire!

904
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,460
Let it out!

905
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,540
It is the cry of the Yeti!

906
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,720
The Yeti!

907
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,640
Fred, where are you?

908
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,260
Answer me, Fred!

909
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,140
Oh my God!

910
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,340
Help me, Fred!

911
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,120
Help!

912
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,720
Help!

913
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:18,760


914
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:19,640


915
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,200
What's up there?

916
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,880
What's doing it?

917
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,920
All your base are belong to us.

918
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,380
No sign of life, he said.

919
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,240
Only my Yeti could bring on such terror.

920
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,620
I've got a person back home to help you.

921
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,580
Surveillance orders have gone!

922
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,540
Oh, Eva!

923
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,720
Eva!

924
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,080
Eva!

925
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,900
Eva!

926
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,740
Eva!

927
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:49,600


928
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:49,860
Eva!

929
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:50,880


930
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:50,980


931
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,260
Eva!

932
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,700
Eva!

933
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,780
Eva!

934
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,040
Eva!

935
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,280
Eva!

936
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,320
Eva!

937
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,540
Eva!

938
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:04,680
Eva!

939
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,160
Eva!

940
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:05,340


941
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:05,640


942
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,980
Eva!

943
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,220


944
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,260


945
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,460
Eva!

946
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,280
Eva!

947
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,600
What's up there?

948
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,320
What's doing it?

949
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,840
No sign of life, he said.

950
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Sir paid orders.

951
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,720
Then go on!

952
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,200
A collage by New Monet.

953
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,360
And now...

954
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,080
I went to the science club.

955
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,400
The first place we're ever going to go is Mars.

956
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,820
We'll see about that.

957
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,280
I've been to Mars and back.

958
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,480
I'm going to go to Mars after this is over, actually.

959
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,940
My subgenius brother, I have news for you.

960
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,380
You are the Martian.

961
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,880
You were born on Mars.

962
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,940
I live on Mars.

963
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,560
And furthermore, Mars is coming to you.

964
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,940
You're not going to it.

965
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,540
Mars is coming back.

966
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,700
Mars is coming back. Earth back to Mars.

967
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,540
6873515. Let's take another call here.

968
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,920
I wonder what Dr. Sinister really thought about all this Mars stuff.

969
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,360
All the way from the kookies

970
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,120
to the most benign infrastructure.

971
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,680
Some people think that it's a big waste of money.

972
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,760
Let's see what this caller number three thinks here.

973
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,000
What's your take on Mars?

974
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,200
Oh, it saved...

975
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,840
That was the third call.

976
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,640
We've got an explorer trying to signal us.

977
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,840
The floorager is lost.

978
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,300
That was like a 3D stereoscoped IMAX movie.

979
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,380
Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost the floorager.

980
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,140
It looks like it went down somewhere over the Mara.

981
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,600
It's the...

982
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,680
A jar of human face.

983
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,100
A mountain has opened its mouth

984
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,980
and swallowed the Opportunity Lander like a giant pill.

985
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,740
Apparently, we had a window.

986
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,560
No, we don't have windows.

987
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,740
We don't have windows yet.

988
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,180
We have to...

989
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,520
Oh, my God.

990
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,940
We've lost the Opportunity and the Spirit

991
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,120
and the know-how and the courage

992
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
and the money and the backing,

993
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,220
the financial help from Hollywood.

994
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,520
It was a brave little spacecraft.

995
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,160
Who thought it can?

996
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,340
Who thought it could?

997
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,420
Who thought it can?

998
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,840
I think I can.

999
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,880
I think I can.

1000
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,320
I think...

1001
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1002
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,920
The bravest little tin can robot of them all.

1003
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,080
And one on either side of the planet

1004
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,940
with a baby inside.

1005
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,640
And if they can just meet...

1006
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,880
Designed by Dr. Sinister himself.

1007
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,600
They shall be the Adam and Eve of a new Earth.

1008
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,780
Earth shall become its rightful paradise.

1009
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,460
But there won't be science poofters,

1010
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,460
just elocuted persons,

1011
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,160
not scientific poofters who really do not understand.

1012
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,040
That's right, because the world is not just nuts and bolts and math.

1013
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,720
No, there is spirit underlying all things.

1014
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,420
DNA and turtle grease and thousands of different functions.

1015
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,080
And it's turtle.

1016
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,680
Turtle grease all the way down.

1017
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,780
As the great philosopher said.

1018
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,820
As the chakras ping-ping by like a mighty...

1019
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,620
Like, you know, they go ping-ping and like that, you know?

1020
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,080
Yep.

1021
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,120
Faster than the speed of light.

1022
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,760
The chakras and the waves, the chakra waves...

1023
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,560
6873515.

1024
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,160
...move faster than the speed of the light.

1025
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,260
You see when you go...

1026
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah, I was disconnected.

1027
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,320
You were disconnected.

1028
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,940
He believes he's connected.

1029
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,640
I was disconnected.

1030
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,220
Disconnected, I said.

1031
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:22,580
Oh.

1032
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,100
This guy might be reconnected, but I'm not.

1033
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm...

1034
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,320
We're kind of all disconnected this day and age.

1035
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:28,820
...discarnate.

1036
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,660
It's really just a trip to another dimension.

1037
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,320
A move up to a new sort of life.

1038
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,440
You get to wear a diaphragm on your head

1039
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,480
and you can sing songs in a high-pitched voice.

1040
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,880
What could be, you know, what could be wrong with that?

1041
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,460
Three little bits of scoliosis.

1042
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,020
No one knows, either.

1043
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:47,980
But come on.

1044
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,000
Hey, guess what?

1045
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,440
I drilled in a rock today, but it was in my backyard.

1046
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,100
And it was in a piece of sandstone.

1047
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,860
Oh.

1048
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,260
You built a what?

1049
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,020
You say a meteor fell into your backyard?

1050
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,880
You saw it?

1051
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,480
I said I drilled its hole in a rock,

1052
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,820
but it was in my backyard.

1053
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,280
Oh, in other words, you're saying you were creating a false meteor

1054
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,120
much in the same way that women in their extreme vanity

1055
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,140
have 300-pound boobies nowadays.

1056
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,140
No, actually, I was taking a half-inch drill bit

1057
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,800
and putting my address in a piece of sandstone.

1058
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,100
With your teeth?

1059
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,820
No, with a drill.

1060
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,680
Oh, okay.

1061
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,040
Well, some people use a nose drill.

1062
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,060
Some people trephinate themselves in the middle area,

1063
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,520
you know, the third nostril area.

1064
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,900
There's an imbalance of the humors in your cranium.

1065
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,240
What if I got to Mars tonight?

1066
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,320
Why'd you guys go to Mars?

1067
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,860
Why do I got to go to Mars?

1068
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,180
No, why was that conversation all about Mars?

1069
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,900
Oh, I just said...

1070
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,920
Well, Mars is a subject of wonder and speculation.

1071
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,020
That glowing red orb in the sky

1072
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,300
sending war and giant one-eyed monsters with ray guns.

1073
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,460
And the emperor wants to send us there.

1074
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,340
The emperor does want to send us there.

1075
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,820
Did you know the emperor loves Jesus more than he loves his own saxophone or his own...

1076
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,180
Did you know that if we got all our tax money back from missions to Mars,

1077
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,640
we'd have a lot of money?

1078
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,180
And you think they would fix the rope?

1079
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,500
Did you pay a lot for the...

1080
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,060
Do you pay a lot of taxes?

1081
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,680
Yeah, but we wouldn't have.

1082
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,980
They just have better potted plants in the congressional offices.

1083
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,620
They spend a lot more money on things besides Mars.

1084
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,140
Yeah, they spend as much money on...

1085
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,180
I bought the knobbies for it.

1086
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,800
You have the knobbies?

1087
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,680
That's not what they...

1088
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,440
I bought the four-wheeler...

1089
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,340
You have the Hitler love dog.

1090
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,000
The rims, too.

1091
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,980
He sounds like he has the Hitler love dog.

1092
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,440
You know, when you call them the knobbies.

1093
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
They're the Nazis, not the knobbies.

1094
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,600
The knobbies are skillful, underpaid...

1095
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,860
Who has NASA's annual budget anyway?

1096
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,600
Oh, this may sound ridiculous,

1097
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:50,020
but World War II is nothing but a ruse to hide the swapping of Earth and Mars, the two planets.

1098
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,620
World War II's been going on...

1099
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,280
since the geometric age, back when...

1100
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,660
Right.

1101
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,380
It was a war of the world.

1102
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,960
...you know, you and all those guys lived on on the 22nd.

1103
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,640
It was War of the Worlds II.

1104
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,040
The first time, it was the common cold killed them,

1105
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,960
but the second time, they won, became the conspiracy,

1106
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,980
made us slaves, and brought us to this hell planet that we used to call Mars.

1107
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:09,540
Yeah.

1108
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,260
Instead of now the common cold, we have the communist cold.

1109
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,580
We share it equally, and it's freezing all of our titties off.

1110
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,560
Each according to his means.

1111
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,560
Right, and what about Lenin's overcoat?

1112
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,020
Overcoat.

1113
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:28,920
Lenin's overcoat is useless compared to this fine rant that I'm about to play

1114
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,380
that was posted to alt.binaries.slack by the selfless self-slayer.

1115
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
I'm probably already on their list.

1116
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,380
Just a lone gunman shooting in the dark, just wanting to know something to make a choice.

1117
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:49,280
And then, smashed out of my brains on prop, I come to one of their choices and be dumb and all.

1118
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,360
What a subgenius.

1119
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,400
Let's hear it for him.

1120
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,380
I say, no.

1121
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,920
Or is that no?

1122
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,660
I can't remember what with my brains melting and all in the oven of knowledge.

1123
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,640
What the hey?

1124
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,220
Who said anything mattered?

1125
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,080
But that's probably out there too, saying, look at him, look at him,

1126
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,240
probing into our database of soul code.

1127
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,620
Get him before he makes off into the real world with something they might use against him.

1128
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,160
And then what would happen?

1129
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,420
They'd probably come barging through my door, guns blazing,

1130
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,020
bazookas blowing cowley off the rack of my subconscious,

1131
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,340
drifting barrels of lead against me.

1132
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,860
Flying for the first time in my life, waiting, waiting to hit bottom.

1133
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,240
And then waking up and saying,

1134
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:34,860
am I ready to sit for eight hours in a closet thinking about sex?

1135
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,320
Sex?

1136
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,760
Probably not.

1137
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,560
That was probably just yesterday, wiggling around in my memory of how bored I can get at home,

1138
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,160
dreaming of maybe existing.

1139
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,080
If I get around to it, that is, if I ever actually get off my slack and ass off,

1140
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,600
or maybe not.

1141
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,680
But that's something I guess I'm gonna have to find out about now,

1142
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,400
when all is done and everyone is dead.

1143
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,380
Can I hear Gaia calling out, I'm lonely.

1144
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,120
Is there anyone there to hear?

1145
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,620
When we go blasting off into the sky, rockets blazing behind us,

1146
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,040
like an immature devil trying to fart on God?

1147
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,580
Nah, it was probably just a dream again.

1148
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,100
But you know this frog, it'll come back to haunt you.

1149
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,520
Or is that to hunt you?

1150
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,100
It's never quite sure with this stuff.

1151
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,720
Hey you, are you out there somewhere?

1152
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,100
If not, why don't you echo back?

1153
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,860
Are you subgenius too?

1154
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,660
Too?

1155
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,640
Too?

1156
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,460
Too?

1157
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,180
Too?

1158
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,840
The Selfless Self Slayer

1159
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,960
A time to reconnect the tubes.

1160
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,060
Put it right back in here.

1161
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,880
The tubes, now that was a great band.

1162
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,100
It was also a better neck implant.

1163
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,560
And what about the clocks?

1164
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,900
The clocks were a good neck implant too,

1165
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,560
but some people chose them as like a psychic implant of some kind.

1166
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,340
Uh, shot shot.

1167
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,580
Shot shot shot shot shot.

1168
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,240
This bum came up to me on the street and handed me this,

1169
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,700
this old plastic disc, I guess it's one of those 44 EP or something.

1170
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,640
It's a 7844 EP, something like that.

1171
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,440
33 and 3 4ths.

1172
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,640
And there's pictures of these funny looking musicians on it.

1173
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,760
Dressed up in gorilla suits.

1174
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,720
Dressed up in gorilla suits wearing ties and smoking cigars.

1175
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,520
The clocks at Cleveland's Agora, 1981.

1176
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,760
And look, there's the little baby Chaz, Professor Chaz.

1177
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,700
The little teeny tiny baby.

1178
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,120
And the little tiny baby, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1179
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,160
Baby, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1180
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,160
The little baby.

1181
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,980
The yagoo koo kaka baby.

1182
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:45,660
We must warn the listener, audience, that the following presentation may cause erectile dysfunction

1183
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,340
or a lack of motivation.

1184
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:53,000
Those people involved in union activities who salute to the left could please,

1185
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,780
or if they would please, take the red carpet right.

1186
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,160
Okay, let's listen to actually, this is a song by DeLuca it said on the jacket.

1187
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,120
Jail me, I'm talking about it.

1188
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,140
I can't take it.

1189
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,440
Talk talk talk is punished.

1190
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,840
I can't make it.

1191
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,360
I bet my treatment's started when I walk through the door.

1192
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,440
At the door there's a point where I fall.

1193
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,480
My head's a phone speaker.

1194
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,340
I wear a visor on my mouth.

1195
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,800
And on the floor my bed increases.

1196
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,660
I try to keep the white noise out.

1197
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,080
I'm not stuttering.

1198
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,440
I'm not schizophrenic.

1199
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,780
I'm not anything.

1200
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,140
Talk to you while you keep me here is such an evil ring.

1201
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,060
You won't talk without me.

1202
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,380
.

1203
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:55,500
.

1204
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:55,680
.

1205
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:58,520
.

1206
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:58,580
.

1207
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:58,600
.

1208
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:58,680
.

1209
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:58,760
.

1210
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:58,880
.

1211
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,040
.

1212
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,640
.

1213
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,120
.

1214
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,000
.

1215
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,520
.

1216
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:14,660
.

1217
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:14,720
.

1218
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:14,740
.

1219
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,640
You won't talk about me

1220
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,260
You're playing too shock and cry

1221
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,580
My doctor's training my way

1222
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,240
I'm a record by attention

1223
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,260
All this is a pill

1224
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,740
Finalizing dose

1225
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,140
Yeah, you're closing by the chair

1226
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,300
But the door, there's a warrant for it

1227
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,720
Relief the young and value young

1228
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,100
All group and go band ride

1229
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,440
Yeah, talk to my authority

1230
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,320
You know no more than I

1231
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,720
I'm not stuttering

1232
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,720
I'm not schizophrenic

1233
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,500
I'm not anything

1234
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,540
Doctor, why do you keep me here

1235
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,620
Such an evil wind

1236
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,440
You won't talk about me

1237
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1238
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1239
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,200
There's no recognition

1240
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,720
There's no recognition

1241
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1242
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,800
There's no connection

1243
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,500
Oh, oh

1244
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:18,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1245
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,460
There's no connection

1246
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,580
There's no recognition

1247
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,080
Oh, oh

1248
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,460
Oh, oh

1249
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1250
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1251
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1252
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1253
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1254
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1255
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460


1256
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,880
There's no connection

1257
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,840
Oh, oh

1258
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1259
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1260
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1261
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,280
Oh

1262
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,600
Alright, then I'll stop playing

1263
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,300
I say, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

1264
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,460
When there's no connection

1265
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,100
Why did I tell ya

1266
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,160
If only

1267
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,120
That's very cool

1268
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,160
Stop stuttering

1269
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,560
I don't know

1270
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,400
When there's none

1271
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,180
I smeared big, huge parts of my brain to make me do that.

1272
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,840
And now it sounds so immature and faulty-rawlish.

1273
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,300
And yet wonderful in some way that I can't express.

1274
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,980
I don't know.

1275
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,600
I'm kind of confused.

1276
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,560
It has a real lonesome cowboy Dave ring to it.

1277
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,000
Uh-huh.

1278
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,380
It definitely does.

1279
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,020
Even though it's over, what, how many, 24,000 years ago?

1280
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,080
24,000 years.

1281
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,860
That was recorded on the old.

1282
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,380
The Blistex powder.

1283
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,140
Yeah, the Blistex.

1284
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,780
Fostex, Fostex, right.

1285
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,580
Yeah, the old, like a rock and stick wire recorders and stuff.

1286
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,440
The same thing they use as acne cream nowadays.

1287
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,500
Well, not nowadays.

1288
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,480
I would say like in the late 80s, actually.

1289
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,520
It's kind of been out of, for.

1290
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,660
Now, that was 80s punk.

1291
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,520
16 years now.

1292
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,660
This would be 1980s punk.

1293
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,040
It's like post-punk.

1294
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,860
As opposed to 90s punk or 2000s punk.

1295
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,960
It was punk people who thought that they were too snappy to continue being punks

1296
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,740
and wanted to do something that showed that they were basically assholes, I think.

1297
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,800
No, I didn't mean it that way.

1298
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,100
I meant.

1299
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,380
Let's see.

1300
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:41,620
Let's do it again.

1301
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,860
All right.

1302
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:08,580
All right.

1303
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,360
We'll go with Steve's away.

1304
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,520
He's a nice little thing.

1305
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,180
Life won't go to hell.

1306
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,340
Life won't shine.

1307
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:17,560
Stage.

1308
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,880
Stage.

1309
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,880
There's just a rain in the employee parking lot.

1310
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,520
I ride the portabell to my point of thought.

1311
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,040
I take the readouts and think of what they've got.

1312
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,740
Reading out the passages of unreadable thought.

1313
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,120
It's a life plan for a girl and him.

1314
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,020
Life, life, life won't shine.

1315
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,360
Stage.

1316
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,620
Stage.

1317
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,840
I know what I must do until I've done the job.

1318
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,140
I start my car, turn my radio on.

1319
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,800
And I watch the lights of silent to another place.

1320
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,540
And on the road we speed away.

1321
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:21,360
You know, racism.

1322
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,340
Life won't go to hell.

1323
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,320
Life won't shine.

1324
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:28,880
Stage.

1325
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,340
Stage.

1326
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:33,700
Stage.

1327
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,240
Stage.

1328
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:34,940
Stage.

1329
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,840
I must say, that sounded like a cross between

1330
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,800
Gwar and Jefferson Airplane

1331
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,700
or maybe the Strawberry Alarm Clock.

1332
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,100
Well, they used to describe this band

1333
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,240
as like the Strawberry Alarm Clock.

1334
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:56,980
Did they?

1335
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,600
Yes.

1336
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,000
I'm not surprised.

1337
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,340
No, they actually described it as the Chocolate Watch Band.

1338
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,560
I don't get it.

1339
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,660
Because of time pieces and so forth.

1340
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,660
No, but they actually, Lenny K said,

1341
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,360
these guys remind me of the Chocolate Watch Band.

1342
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,680
And so we ate a lot of chocolate and fell asleep.

1343
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,240
I can't remember anything the Chocolate Watch Band did

1344
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,660
besides slap around mentally handicapped people

1345
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,180
in public places and all the trouble they got into.

1346
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,120
A Slave Planet by The Clocks.

1347
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,060
Friends and...

1348
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:35,460
Uh...

1349
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,260
The remnants of The Clocks will be at the next Subgenius Devival

1350
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,860
which is May 22nd in Cleveland

1351
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,980
at the Beachland Ballroom.

1352
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,580
I'm just telling you that that's where

1353
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave will next be

1354
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,140
with man and the amino acids

1355
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,040
who are heard here in the background.

1356
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,120
Or rather, Reverend Angry Larry of Automatic Robot Fish.

1357
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,680
This is Hour of Slack, number 934.

1358
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,540
Friends, the voice of the church,

1359
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,460
of the subgenius.

00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,820

www.subgenius.com.

1366
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,100
Let's get some hot chicks on the phone

1367
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,860
and talk about Mars or something.

1368
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,940
Well, why don't you get off the phone

1369
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,920
because our phone lines are pretty much clogged up

1370
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,680
by your dumb ass.
