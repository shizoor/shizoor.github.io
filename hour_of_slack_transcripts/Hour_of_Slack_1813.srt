00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm swollen from days of heavy conspiracy.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,120
It's now at its highest level in 35 years.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,840
The city of Chicago has released approximately 100 police officers.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,000
It's really unusual for any city to release 100 of them all at once.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,580
And local police union president Dean Angelo Sr. says he makes cops look bad.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,960
And we'll see that over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,160
The city fought the release of a video that showed the shooting death of a young PR News.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,760
In Texas, searchers continue to look for heavily wooded helicopters and boats.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,420
When it comes to requesting financial assistance from the federal PR News agency.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,180
Economist Diane Swift, DS Economics.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,040
Not only down to the Ziproff, Martin's vision reverted back.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,220
We extender deep-based Broadmoor jumps is lost outside.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,120
Wall Street 31, 1787, 28, 28, 49, 42, 6.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,660
This is PR News.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,080
The IOC says PR News.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,620
The government says PR News slowed sharply in Washington.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,660
And now, let's hear what a typical housewife thinks about.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,480
Hi out there.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
And speaking of hi, I'd like to show you the...

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,240
Oh, jeez.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,520
You see? You see? You're stupid minds.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,720
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,780
Well, I'm taking it from you.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,280
You're stupid.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,280
Stupid humans.

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,700
Nothing is more delicate or complex than the human brain.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
Sorry, didn't mean to drop it.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Too late.

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,960
Let's see what happens.

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,480
Well, it's just a frozen death, so he can do that.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,100
Then I can study the brain.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,100
You are going to be all right, doctor.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,780
Doctor, we'll put your brain back in. You'll be fine.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,020
Everything is confused.

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,600
I must point out, doctor.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,100
I tell you.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,840
I know.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
I know.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,440
Well, is that I know dot com or something?

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,180
I know. I know. What you know, you never know.

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,880
That's right.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,620
I've got to get back to work.

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,120
Okay.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
We're going back to work now.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,160
If I don't see you again, this will be a prosthesis.

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
Yeah, good luck. Good luck to you, too.

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,560
Take the Popeye spin.

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,420
You.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,580
You.

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,300
You want to work, don't you?

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,640
What?

52
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,420
Sedaptics.

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,560
Sedaptics.

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:20,740
Sedaptics.

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,880
Sedaptics.

56
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,140
Sedaptics.

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Sedaptics.

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,000
Sedaptics!

59
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,120
Sedaptics.

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,120


61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,120


62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,120


63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

64
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,300
I don't know.

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,580
What?

66
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,600
I don't know.

67
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,920
I haven't read a single word that's related to the world.

68
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,260
But I know that something is happening.

69
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,260


70
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm sure I'll get the word out.

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,200


72
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,800
You're going to be all right.

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:46,980


74
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,240


75
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm sure.

76
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,860
I'm sure.

77
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,700
You heard the story.

78
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,460
It's true.

79
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:51,460


80
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:51,860
I'm sure.

81
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,060
I don't know how to do this.

82
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,460
I don't know.

83
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't know.

84
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:52,900


85
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,040
first couple. And because that first couple embraced that enlightened redefinition, the course

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,360
of humanity was forever changed. And J.R., Bob Dobbs, and many others today in our society are

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,500
still asking you to embrace the idea that we really know is a better way. That we can define

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,940
good and evil based upon contemporary popular opinion. That you can define life and your

89
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,760
relationships to others in your own terms. In essence, that you will be like God.

90
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,960
This was the age of Jim Jones and all kinds of other vampires and psychic parasites out there

91
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:47,940
using religion to establish control of a segment of a confused and desperate population. And there's

92
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,760
no shortage of people like that.

93
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,060
For reasons good and bad, and real and imagined.

94
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:04,040
It's fascinating to me to look at religious experience, to look at cults, to look at us and them,

95
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,980
and all this stuff that I passionately disavowed. And then saying to me, which is what the subgenius

96
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,860
did, no, no, we know you don't believe in any of this stuff. We know that us and them

97
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,920
are not going to believe in anything. So, I think it's fascinating to me to look at religious

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,180
is wrong. But we're going to worship Bob Dobbs and we're all a congregation and there's the

99
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,460
pinks out there and there's us in here and we hate them and we love us. And won't that

100
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,400
be fun for a little while?

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,980
Slack is a gift to the God. The Baptist church did not save you. The Catholic church did

102
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,440
not save you. The unification church did not save you. The Jewish synagogue did not save

103
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,800
you. The church of the subgenius did not save you. But it was Bob, Bob who walked those

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,420
hot papers.

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,940
No, the church of the subgenius is not incorporated, registered, licensed, certified, approved

106
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,620
or anything by any creature of man's so-called state. It recognizes no head except the Dobbs

107
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,300
head, secular or sacred. Only that head of Dobbs. It recognizes the lordship of Bob as

108
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,160
the only sovereign, the king of kings, salesman and judge of all.

109
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,540
It is a missionary effort, you see, to educate both the masses and those in high places that

110
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,680
Bob lives, Bob sells and Bob has a law that should be kept obeyed and enforced as a society.

111
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:43,320
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1813, recorded January 11th in the

112
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,420
alleged year of 2013.

113
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,880
We'll again be hearing both new doctrinal material and decades-old classics from the

114
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:01,660
golden showers years of the church, radio outreach, plus rare fireside theater. My old

115
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:08,600
beat-up back is back in much better shape thanks to the directed torture known as physical

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,280
therapy. But next we have to work on my pain in the neck.

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,420
Uh, speaking of torture, I'm going to talk about the church of the subgenius. I'm going to

118
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,980
suitable

119
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,480
for those looking for systematic ideas, help you from the start.

120
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,540
…

121
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:38,740
The wounds that curled up as I Łukåno just rolled on my cut. It seen like a

122
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,200
ечатue!?

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,200


124
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,200


125
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,620
Orange background.

126
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:39,660
Orange background.

127
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:39,840
Orange background.

128
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,420
Orange background.

129
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,440
Orange background.

130
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,780
wearing military and superhero cosplay outfits,

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,860
tricked a bunch of innocent conservatives into letting them into the Capitol,

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,540
where they proceeded to make poor, misunderstood Trump supporters

133
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,220
look like the stupidest idiots in the universe.

134
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,260
But we're not fooled, nor do we care,

135
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,740
because we have much bigger Megalodons to fry.

136
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,940
Yes, friends, a new subgenius book is out.

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,620
Eyelash by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley.

138
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,260
And if you don't believe me, just look at the front page of subgenius.com,

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,180
or for that matter, Amazon.

140
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,800
Yes, a subgenius science fiction novel.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,660
As it says here on the back,

142
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,880
he swore he'd never deal with the aliens again.

143
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,360
But here he was.

144
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,720
Letting them beam him on board.

145
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,920
He promised that whatever they were planning,

146
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,500
he'd keep Ty out of it.

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,400
But here she was on the bridge.

148
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,100
What were the exes trying to hide

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,040
that was worse than soul harvesting and interstellar drug running?

150
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,060
And why were they being so nice to him at first?

151
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,760
What in the name of slack had J.R. Bob Dobbs gotten him into?

152
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,660
Who?

153
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,360
And friends, it says here,

154
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,700
oh, here's a quote from a great author about the book.

155
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,640
Nikolai Kingsley's writing easily equals that of the giants

156
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,880
on whose shoulders we crouch,

157
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,440
holding on for dear life with white knuckles

158
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,260
to the oversized weave of their immense dandruff-dusted sweaters

159
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,580
while they stride about their titanic world.

160
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,220
Oh, Reverend Ivan Stang said that.

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,720
Well, if I said that,

162
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,280
then you better pick up on it.

163
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,120
To quote Jimi Hendrix.

164
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,280
It's guaranteed doctrinally correct by the Subgenius Foundation.

165
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,240
Dobbs approved publisher since 1977.

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,540
That's actually true.

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
And it even has a little foreword by me.

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,020
But it is, in fact, a science fiction novel

169
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,980
set in the subgenius universe.

170
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,640
Reverend Kingsley obviously knew his,

171
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,540
his inside subgenius details,

172
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,100
especially about the aliens,

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,260
as revealed in Three-Fisted Tales of Bob

174
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,040
and Book of the Subgenius and all the other ones.

175
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
And I'm going to read a couple of excerpts from this.

176
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,120
There are two main characters,

177
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,740
Elif and Ty,

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,820
have been given a sort of instruction book.

179
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,140
About Ex Day and the Exists by Bob,

180
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,560
who is also a character in this.

181
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,720
And she was reading all the supporting data

182
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,280
on soul essence and its users.

183
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,240
For some beings even further up the scale

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,300
than the already advanced Exists,

185
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,160
soul essence was a drug.

186
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,860
How advanced are they if they have a drug problem?

187
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,360
It was all a lot more complex than it first appeared.

188
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,920
After sorting through the few bits of almost truth

189
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,080
brought back by actual abductees,

190
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,840
a depressing picture started to appear.

191
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Out there were societies at every level of development,

192
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,860
hunter and gatherer cavemen and star travelers,

193
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,300
grubby medieval diggers in the dirt

194
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,400
and slick hyper urban data miners.

195
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,620
In fact, they were all in the same place.

196
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,260
Intelligent machines and non-sentient energy forms.

197
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,860
Every possible way of encoding life was represented somewhere.

198
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,280
Intelligent plants and non-intelligent animals that ate them.

199
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,740
Grazers grazing wherever there was cheap energy.

200
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,420
Hunters preying on the prey,

201
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,220
who were preyed upon by bigger hunters.

202
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,120
And parasites to fill the niches.

203
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,240
All arranged in order of who ate what,

204
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
wants and needs, and so on.

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,600


206
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,600


207
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,600


208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,600


209
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,540
Needs made manifest.

210
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,620
Arrangements made to supply them.

211
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,820
Addictions indulged.

212
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,980
Little guys and big players.

213
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,840
Brutally repressive oligarchies

214
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,860
and ridiculously ornate hierarchies.

215
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,220
And dizzying chaotic anarchies.

216
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,500
Every manner of law and code and government and tradition

217
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,180
and the resulting confusion of jurisdictions and crimes.

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,160
Every element bumping up against the others

219
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,260
in a hopelessly tangled and

220
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,380
constantly shifting,

221
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,180
no-holds-barred death match fought between

222
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,920
mutually incomprehensible and rigidly,

223
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,460
grimly held world views.

224
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,720
The section on religion simply said,

225
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,220
Oh, just forget it.

226
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,860
Let's just say,

227
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,740
anything goes.

228
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,780
Every possible social problem would find expression somewhere,

229
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,520
and the ones that could be

230
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,500
profitably applied to other races,

231
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
higher or lower,

232
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,800
would spread in every direction.

233
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,080
Each variation on the old games.

234
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,800
Master and slaves,

235
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,160
farmer and cash crops,

236
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
citadel and barbarians,

237
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,660
dealer and addicts.

238
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,420
Every kind of scam,

239
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
confidence trick,

240
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,440
insider trading deal,

241
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
concealed toxic waste dump,

242
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,780
law enforcer bribed to look the other way,

243
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,300
rigged election,

244
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,600
and even the most dangerous of all.

245
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,080
Every market would be a gray market.

246
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,940
Everybody's ass would be up for grabs.

247
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,960
You could be the mayor of the planet one day,

248
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,660
and the next locked inside a cheap wooden crate

249
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,000
on your way to some alien creature's dinner table.

250
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,360
She tried to imagine a four-dimensional chart

251
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,260
that could show it all in real time,

252
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,580
and fell asleep to her own fantasy.

253
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:11,580


254
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:11,580


255
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,840
To dream of tentacled and subaqueous elder gods,

256
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,540
slime dripping,

257
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,760
their crusted carapaces wrinkled,

258
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,440
rigid, and nippled in dark ocean floor gray-green.

259
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Deceptively friendly abominations of the abyss,

260
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,080
who watched through closed eyes,

261
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,820
and who burbled in a liquid language

262
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,540
just on the far edge of comprehension,

263
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,900
and who only wanted to buy some...

264
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,620
stuff, you know?

265
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,620
I got the necessary right here.

266
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,820
Name your price.

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,320
We're good for it.

268
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,460
That's a little section from page 13 and 14

269
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,280
of Eyelash by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley,

270
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,900
just published by us, the Subgenius Foundation.

271
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,860
For information, see subgenius.com.

272
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,500
And now this.

273
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,480
Oh, you guys are so crazy!

274
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
Ha ha ha!

275
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,320
I think that's as funny today as it first was

276
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,400
back in the sizzling 70s.

277
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,920
That's right, I'm Dexter Fong,

278
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,800
and nothing will make me forget the thrill we had

279
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,580
making funny records back then.

280
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,800
Yes, my late partner, Hideo Wallbanger and I

281
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,020
were the men of modern comedy.

282
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,560
And today, when the satellite and the radio

283
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,880
net is crammed with the stupid drivel

284
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,220
of the hot humorous 100,

285
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
where can a gone cat like yourself get the laughs

286
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,840
that we were making then just for you?

287
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,540
What thrilling moments.

288
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,540
Well, they're all yours now on a double fun, double deal,

289
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,260
Dope Humor of the 70s, volumes one and two.

290
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,200
Who can forget such modern comedy hits

291
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
as Cheech Chong's Rubin and the Jets,

292
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,400
or Kong, Wress and Wonders' Beat the Electrician?

293
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,260
Who did you have your arm up when you first

294
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,600
sighed to bootleg by the four or five crazy guys?

295
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,020
Or cut a rug to the antics of Hilario Gomez

296
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,240
and the Wanderers?

297
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,820
Yes, all million sellers, plus the fab fire sign,

298
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,980
together again on this bonus extra.

299
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Yes, a rare collection of fill, fill, fill and fill

300
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,240
at their hilarious, inscrutable best,

301
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,220
if you order now.

302
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,380
Oh, God, wouldn't it be great to laugh again

303
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,980
and stop bumping into things?

304
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,860
Well, bozos, get on it and do it every day.

305
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,620
Now that 70s aren't gone, if you're still smiling,

306
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,540
order now.

307
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,300
Write Dope Humor Offer, Box 69, California.

308
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,220
That's write Dope Humor Offer, Box 69, California, now!

309
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,620
Let's hear about that radio show.

310
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Amazing, isn't it? Listen.

311
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,760
I'm wondering about that voice we heard on the radio.

312
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,200
Uh, I think...

313
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,720
Hmm.

314
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,080
The color of these hot butter rum martinis.

315
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,640
I'd like to talk about...

316
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,740
You're the only person listening to the show tonight.

317
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,260
Yeah, I'm coming.

318
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,420
Okay, good.

319
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,420
Look at this surface, seething and bumping.

320
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
There's enormous bubbles popping.

321
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,600
See, the rest of our listeners are machines like this one.

322
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,920
They've made so much money in their regular day jobs

323
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,120
that they were able to fend off these legal problems for years.

324
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,400
Rely on your intelligence and on your memory.

325
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,360
And think about the case.

326
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,280
As it was.

327
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,120
As you blurted out...

328
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,060
You have to say the underlined word correctly.

329
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,660
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

330
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,060
So there.

331
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,240
Bang.

332
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,860
Put a dual display on.

333
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,860
Uh, uh, over to you, uh, uh, puzzling.

334
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,540
Kill me!

335
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,280
Kill me.

336
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,460
Kill me!

337
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,040
I know what you're saying.

338
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,240
Kill me!

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,520
Okay!

340
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,540
Why not?

341
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,800
Why not?

342
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,020
Oh, uh, no, in fact, I'm not ready at all.

343
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:29,360
Uh, um, uh, I am, uh, and I, uh, I, uh, oh, goodness me, uh, I have no idea how I, uh,

344
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,860
I came by this number.

345
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,500
I've, I'm at present having numbers, uh, uh, Dr. Howe's, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, uh,

346
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,500


347
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,520
I don't sound like him at all.

348
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:39,900
I know.

349
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm presently having phone numbers dialed at random by this, uh, scumbag person who

350
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,180
I'm allowing to, uh, use my phone at the present time.

351
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,980
And he is, uh, taking over everything and dialing up people and appears to be dialing

352
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,700
up doctors of the air for some strange reason.

353
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,620
I guess him being his own person, he can do that.

354
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,140
Um, it's too bad I couldn't talk to you in a better context because I am, in fact, a

355
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,480
great fan of the subgenius.

356
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,800
And, um, but my friend, when I mentioned that, began dialing these numbers and putting me

357
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
on the phone and then running away.

358
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,280
And I am extremely annoyed by all this.

359
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,600
However, he is no friend of mine.

360
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,340
And I hope sincerely you will do your best to erase your memory of all this and can merely

361
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,180
continue to make the shows as bad as you can and abuse the callers and listen for Guy the

362
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,040
caller because he will be waiting to be abused more than the rest.

363
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,440
Woo!

364
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:34,740


365
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,720
Woo!

366
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:37,720
Yes, here we go.

367
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,680
Some sort of universe somewhere, somewhere out there where there's...

368
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,800
...a show.

369
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,700
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

370
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,560
The subgenius.

371
00:18:50,860 --> 00:19:02,740
Welcome the potential initiates and remain with us for the next thirty minutes.

372
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,680

373
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,380
Puzzling evidences.

374
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540

400
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,080


401
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,420
i'm a bad boy

402
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:35,180
you can purge it every now and then just every now and then until they were練

403
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


404
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


405
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


406
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


407
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


408
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


409
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


410
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


411
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,180


412
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,560
locked up with the fish, which was no mean feat.

413
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,200
The fish themselves were some 300 pounds.

414
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,220
Some of them weighed in excess of 700 pounds.

415
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,680
Each and every fish was equipped with a dynamic face of structure,

416
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,180
the kind that could tear apart pieces of rock with one grimace.

417
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,120
These were the fish that Bob had selected,

418
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,200
his mighty fighting sperm,

419
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,460
to spread like a mankind accordion throughout the depleted universe.

420
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,700
So you could just take it up to your room

421
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,160
and do whatever you want with it, you know what I mean?

422
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,500
Sit back in that old bungle-rungle roll-away bed

423
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,120
and watch the subway go by.

424
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,820
Take one last drink from that bottle of port.

425
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,740
Pick up the gun.

426
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,060
Look at it.

427
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
Put one bullet in.

428
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,720
Spin the chamber.

429
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,760
Put the gun down.

430
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Pick it up again.

431
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,000
Spin the chamber again.

432
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,680
Put it down.

433
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,640
Look out the window.

434
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,460
You know, it's seven trains going by.

435
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,240
Ah, yes.

436
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,860
Life was beautiful.

437
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,160
A few more crackers, and I've got a little mustard left to put on them.

438
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,700
For a while.

439
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,960
Wasn't that something?

440
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,280
And guess what, dear friends?

441
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,320
The new Dobbs Docktown Mirror is out.

442
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,400
Volume 2, number 1, January 1st, 23 A.X.

443
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,200
Things to see, say.

444
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,020
Do, think, know, and buy.

445
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,920
And I'm going to read some sections from the Dobbs Docktown Mirror,

446
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,860
on and off, interspersed with things.

447
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,200
Such as,

448
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,220
from microbe to mutant.

449
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960
If there is a god,

450
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,340
he is a machine that converts prayers into irony.

451
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,620
More.

452
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,360
Most forms.

453
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,640
Successful.

454
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,900
Eventually, you realize the conspiracy is cheating.

455
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,320
You realize that if you keep playing by the rules,

456
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,160
you lose the game.

457
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,980
But, if you cheat like them,

458
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,520
you lose your integrity.

459
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,260
The subgenius knows that the alternative

460
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,640
is to stop playing their games.

461
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,180
There are other games going on.

462
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,300
Give them a try.

463
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,760
Oh, yeah, you might still lose,

464
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,620
but it won't be because the deck was stacked against you.

465
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,880
Don't tell me about it.

466
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,220
Don't tell anybody.

467
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,820
Tell yourself how you're going to withdraw from the conspiracy's games.

468
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,680
Then, do it.

469
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,340
A little easier.

470
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,240
Resist oppression from outside forces.

471
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs can teach you how to oppress yourself.

472
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,620
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

473
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,580
And now, this.

474
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,440
This portion is brought to you by

475
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,320
Space Age Hardware,

476
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,880
where it's always technical.

477
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,580
Three square blocks of bargains.

478
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,720
Look over here.

479
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,360
Outdoor lawn stools.

480
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,560
Three for a dozen in concrete and brick.

481
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,580
Hatchet rests.

482
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,640
29 cents.

483
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,740
Single and dupal hose couplings.

484
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,600
Twice as much, and the price is bigger, too.

485
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,960
Free, free, free, free, free, red, white and blue paint sets

486
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,300
to every fifth customer.

487
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,040
Miners not included.

488
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,200
For a good screw, meet me at

489
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Space Age Hardware.

490
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,760
Corner of Beaumont and Fletcher

491
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
in Downer.

492
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,640
So where's the next voyage?

493
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,940
When is the next voyage?

494
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
That's the one, the voyage that we're

495
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,840
going on to find the ancient...

496
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,340
To the little crinkly trees?

497
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,640
The ancient trees.

498
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,300
They look like little aluminum foil

499
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,220
up there where everything sounds like

500
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,160
only the city people

501
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,940
make. You hear conversations and pieces

502
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,940
of music while you're trying to sleep out there

503
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,600
because your mind starts

504
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,780
trying to filter out of all this

505
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,900
crazy sound out there in the middle of the night.

506
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,940
Yeah, in the ear. Because I've been lying there

507
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,540
in the ground and I'll hear people talking.

508
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,460
Think, and then think,

509
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,740
there's nobody out here. You'll hear them talking

510
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,640
and they'll be going...

511
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:52,660


512
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,440
...

513
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,260
...

514
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,420
...

515
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,240
...

516
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,200
You don't hear anything

517
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
distinct except once

518
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,840
in a while they say your name in a loud

519
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,920
enough way for you to know that

520
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,860
there's somebody talking out there. It's not a

521
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,060
suspicion anymore. It's an absolute

522
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,820
fact. The question now becomes

523
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,020
how long will it take for them to get to you

524
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,420
and how

525
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,900
fast will they kill you? Will they

526
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,000
kill you slowly or will they roast you

527
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,980
over some kind of a spit or will they just

528
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,960
take a bludgeon

529
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,000
and just hammer your head into

530
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,560
a bloody pulp? So

531
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,840
all they find is this stumpy thing

532
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,720
laying on a cot in the morning by the

533
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,980
camp. You know,

534
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,300
the

535
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,960
park ranger will come around

536
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,120
and say, oh my god,

537
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,480
the park creature

538
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,060
struck again. Okay, the truth. It wasn't

539
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,940
biohazard. It's a

540
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,660
warning sign.

541
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,980
And now some more reading from

542
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,640
the Dobbs.Town Mirror.

543
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,040
Brand new issue.

544
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,660
Immorality as a guide.

545
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:58,900
Why

546
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,960
in one's finite lifetime

547
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,800
would a person ever

548
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,260
pass by an opportunity

549
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,560
to complain?

550
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,620
Poets and plumbers agree.

551
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,000
Those who do not condemn the

552
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,480
past are remembered

553
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,940
to repeat it.

554
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
Those who repeat the past are

555
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,900
condemned to remember it.

556
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,100
Pay attention.

557
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,000
Some religions

558
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,020
are based on tradition.

559
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,800
Beliefs are

560
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,740
passed along in spoken form

561
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,000
or by example or out

562
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,380
of a book or an organization.

563
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,900
Some religions are based

564
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,260
on revelation.

565
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,940
Beliefs are revealed directly

566
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,900
to the believer, sometimes through meditation,

567
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,080
sometimes through divine

568
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,560
intervention.

569
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,840
The church of the subgenius

570
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,680
is based

571
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,980
on sending $35 to

572
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,060
the subgenius foundation.

573
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,920
Only one of these spiritual paths

574
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,120
guarantees eternal salvation

575
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,680
or triple your money back.

576
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,700
Thank you.

577
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,600
The Dobbs.Town Mirror.

578
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,120
And CyberChump for the music

579
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,700
in the background.

580
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,300
From PR News in Washington,

581
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,900
I'm Bart from Buying a Gun.

582
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,120
Scientists have announced

583
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
that for the second time ever

584
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,620
they have managed to detect

585
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,920
PR News. After the Fed

586
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
came out saying it wanted distortions

587
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,580
in the very fabric of space

588
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,820
and time. The team expects to see

589
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,840
many more PR News in the years

590
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,580
ahead. So that's kind of exciting.

591
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,060
This is really a new window on the universe.

592
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,780
What is radical?

593
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,020
What is not common sense?

594
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Dow 56

595
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,040
17 733.

596
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,900
The National Rifle Association says this

597
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,140
is PR News.

598
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,520
PR News. PR News. Washington.

599
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,860
Washington. The purple dinosaur

600
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
who has been called everything from

601
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,300
refreshingly sweet to nauseatingly

602
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,740
nerdy. Well,

603
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,380
once again, rule

604
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,060
toddler TV. Menacing

605
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,040
the Teletubbies.

606
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,940
I believe that the Teletubbies are

607
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,380
their time is on this.

608
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,740
They're definitely never seen them.

609
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,260
Their days are numbered.

610
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,860
They may as well put a fork

611
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,980
in the Teletubbies once Barney hits the scene

612
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,260
again.

613
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,300
Hooded robe.

614
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,820
Subgenius hooded robe.

615
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,500
Clearly made to intimidate and impress.

616
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,820
And I'm guessing it dates

617
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,580
1980.

618
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,360
What's its origin?

619
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,400
The best item of its kind I've ever encountered.

620
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Unfortunately, we have no information identifying

621
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,740
the subgenius. Robe is of excellent

622
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,900
quality and thin black wool, 58 inches

623
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,740
long from the neck. Nine button.

624
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,700
Front buttons are silver colored.

625
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,300
Permanently affixed to the neck

626
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,780
is a 14 inch tall hood which comes

627
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,860
to a point at the top rear and then goes 10 inches

628
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,760
forward to its front which falls the

629
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,900
face mask with one size

630
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,820
fits all.

631
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,540
For the men that want something extra

632
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,520
which would be at the top of the forehead. It's not available

633
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,820
in stores. Two and a half inch by two

634
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,860
and three quarter inch embroidered Dobbs

635
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,380
face. This is not amazingly

636
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,840
boring stuff. This is the real thing.

637
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
Amazing. Has wavy white

638
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,480
embroidered edge. Yeah, this thing is a

639
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,440
on the back is a 12 inch high

640
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,500
red inverted pipe. Does it have

641
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
the flap in the back? How much

642
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,520
does it cost? That's the important thing.

643
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,700
How much does it charge? It's $475.

644
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,400
Does it have the pyroflatulation

645
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,560
flap in the back? But it may

646
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,120
be so aged that it would fall apart.

647
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,500
It's actually real. Because if you didn't have that

648
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,540
flap and it cost $475

649
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,700
you could risk actually igniting

650
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,000
it if you weren't careful.

651
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,220
It's a mysterious subgenius robe.

652
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,020
Yeah, from some secret

653
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,860
society or order. Look at it.

654
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,240
It's a piece of hood. That's my sad subgenius.

655
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,640
With a skull and crossbow.

656
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,360
He thinks they like him but

657
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,860
when the UFOs come the ladies are gonna kill

658
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,120
everybody but me.

659
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,720
Well, you know, of course they'll spare

660
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,320
the righteous.

661
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,880
That's what all subgeniuses

662
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,860
think. I'm helping channel the thoughts of all

663
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,840
subgeniuses onto the show.

664
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,820
That means no one will be

665
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,180
spared. And no one will call.

666
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,580
They don't need to go to Brushwood.

667
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,560
The saucers will come and pick them up

668
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,660
wherever they are.

669
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,240
They'll be instantly

670
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,440
materialized.

671
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,480
It'll be like a rapture of subgenia.

672
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,800
Yes, thank you.

673
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,860
Right now we're looking at a picture

674
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,560
of all the subgenii sitting in their

675
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
pretend first class seats

676
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,180
on the space shuttles ready to leave.

677
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,540
Mysterious and threatening secret

678
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,840
clan or society hooded robe.

679
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,620
I was just telling you it's a subgenius robe

680
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,940
from the early 70s.

681
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,280
Well, it certainly looks like a

682
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,040
terrifying, intimidating robe.

683
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,080
It does, doesn't it?

684
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,720
It's quite wonderful.

685
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,000
Pledges and all that stuff.

686
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,440
Yeah, we used to make them run the gauntlet.

687
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,080
The famous

688
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,000
naked woman gauntlet we used to run

689
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
them through. They hated that.

690
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,840
Those bobbies. They always hate stuff

691
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,940
because they're nerds.

692
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
And they're so competitive among themselves.

693
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,820
That's what's so pathetic about it.

694
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,160
Just because the average weight of each of those

695
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,800
women was well beyond

696
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,920
300 pounds, that shouldn't have any

697
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,140
effect on it if they were,

698
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,360
you know.

699
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,140
Thinkers.

700
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,960
Thinkers. Thinkers from beyond the sun.

701
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,360
The competitive world.

702
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,240
On the backside of reality.

703
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
Conspiracy biz.

704
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,860
Forbidden fantasies that boil up in a

705
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,940
drenched sunburst of fun and relaxation.

706
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,020
Rest and relaxation at last.

707
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,860
I don't feel relaxed.

708
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,620
This show makes me all tense and itchy.

709
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,760
From rest and sleep.

710
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,860
Which?

711
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,440
Yeah, you can earn money even while you sleep,

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,300
...and you'll be

727
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,300


728
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,060
Are you lonely?

729
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the Hobgoblin

730
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,800
of great minds.

731
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,220
He is the chicken,

732
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,740
the road,

733
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,480
the crossing, and the why.

734
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,980
Bob

735
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,240
is keeping a list.

736
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,380
And erasing that list.

737
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,060
He knows

738
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,760
where that thing is.

739
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,680
You can too!

740
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,160
When you join the church.

741
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,280
Of the subgenius.

742
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,540
Smile!

743
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,140
And send one dollar.

744
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,380
When you get to the

745
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,060
being proud of being proud range,

746
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,020
it's a self-feeding

747
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,060
infinite power.

748
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,560
And logically, being ashamed of being ashamed

749
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,380
turns into a kind of pride

750
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,700
and keeps you suspended.

751
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,080
Never entirely

752
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
without pride, but generally

753
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,920
feeling down.

754
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,240
There are many resources available to the

755
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,400
subgenius able to turn personality

756
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,560
quirks into sales.

757
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,360
Sales of products,

758
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,820
sales of souls,

759
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,740
sales of sales.

760
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,760
If you secretly

761
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,180
pretend to gloat about something that you

762
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,280
never did, and it makes you feel

763
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,300
a little better or gives you a silent laugh,

764
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,620
that's no vice.

765
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,720
Take my advice.

766
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,460
Because so-called

767
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,180
trouble and your

768
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,980
so-called permanent record

769
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,200
are not barriers for your

770
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,180
achievement of Slack.

771
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,280
Operators are standing

772
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,660
by.

773
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,080
As seen in

774
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,040
the Dobbs.town

775
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,700
mirror.

776
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Available from

777
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,360
Dobbs.town.

778
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,500
And now this.

779
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,980
Dr. Synchronicity,

780
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,900
we can't blow the whole thing again.

781
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,820
Now last week we spent all of two hours

782
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,220
on the telly. And we're not going to get

783
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,040
on the telly until we thought maybe seven.

784
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,240
Prindle PR.

785
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,720
So that everybody can like, there were

786
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,940
a few people caught out in the cold without television

787
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,180
sets last week. And so we're giving you an hour's

788
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,060
notice at seven o'clock. It will

789
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,900
become really necessary for you to watch

790
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,140
Channel 11. Otherwise turn on

791
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
another radio show.

792
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,140
We'll even turn one on for you.

793
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,880
You can listen to something else. What's on at

794
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,620
seven o'clock on radio besides the

795
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,420
Fireside Theater radio hour?

796
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
They could go out to a movie.

797
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,600
You can see Gone with the Wind and

798
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,860
Gun of Heaven for 50 cents.

799
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,660
That's over on

800
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,220
Figueroa. You can now see Gone with the

801
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,300
Wind. That's because...

802
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,100
What happened? Yes, beautiful

803
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,160
Hawaii. Land

804
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,960
of violins. These

805
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,060
papayas grow six feet tall

806
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,000
and each of them plays the violin

807
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,560
from birth. That's beautiful.

808
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,220
Yes, they are enchanting, aren't they? Well, don't

809
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,420
worry. Those are great films,

810
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,700
Mr. Fosland.

811
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,360
Thank you. And

812
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,840
tell us a little bit about the people

813
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,140
of Hawaii. Well, here's our

814
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,160
sum now. These are your native

815
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,220
girls. They happen to be

816
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,080
yours. They couldn't be mine, of course.

817
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,920
That's a mustard plant,

818
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,120
Charlie. That's a

819
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,240
mustard plant. They grow over four feet high

820
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,680
and up.

821
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,340
You tell them about the little girl. It's amazing.

822
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,080
It's amazing. There they are, these little

823
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,100
children eat these mustard plants out there.

824
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,200
They work in the fields. Oh, must be hardy, but not hot.

825
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,220
Hardy, but not hot. They work in the

826
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,460
fields, these little children.

827
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,240
It's wonderful. It's orthogenic, too, you know.

828
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,060
Here comes a picture now

829
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,720
of...

830
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,200
That's Texas. That's Texas?

831
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,980
That's Texas. How did we get to... That's right.

832
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,200
I remember we flew back to Texas. The slide. Yes, it must have

833
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,820
been mixed up. Made a little mistake.

834
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,180
Oh, and there's Breaking Through

835
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,900
the Ice to Save Mr. Wilson

836
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,560
on the tour. That was on the

837
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,020
beautiful Tropical Sun tour that we took everyone

838
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,900
on last week.

839
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,780
Oh, and it rained. Yeah.

840
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,680
Yeah, it rained.

841
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,940
Before that, between

842
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,960
readings from the Dobbs.Town

843
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,060
Mirror, we heard news from

844
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,200
Leigh Murr, a clip from

845
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
Sandy Boone's movie about Bob

846
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,180
and the church, and by the way,

847
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,680
that was Nick Offerman,

848
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,180
not whatever I said

849
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,920
last time. Some

850
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,540
ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB

851
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,160
Cleveland with Chaz Smith and

852
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

853
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
and some puzzling evidence show

854
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,020
from KPFA Berkeley with Dr.

855
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,900
Philodruman and Dr. Howell.

856
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,760
And puzzling evidence.

857
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,920
More of all of the above coming,

858
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,780
but now,

859
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,420
puzzling evidence from 2001.

860
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,120
Now, do you know where the hamburger

861
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,620
originated?

862
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,880
No.

863
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,220
It originated on the Russian steppes

864
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,920
where medieval tartars ate

865
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,020
raw meat scraped and

866
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,860
shredded with a dull knife and

867
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,960
seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion

868
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,160
juice. German sailors

869
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,900
picked up the delicacy at the

870
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,120
Baltic ports and took the recipe

871
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,200
back to their home base at Hamburg.

872
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,160
Finicky hamburgers, not

873
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,940
accustomed to eating their meat raw

874
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,220
like savages, took some of

875
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,100
the red out of the tartar steak by

876
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,280
broiling the outside.

877
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,440
Thus, the Hamburg steak

878
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,060
was born.

879
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,380
So even though the hamburgers

880
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,980
took credit for making it,

881
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,780
I guess technically since they applied

882
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,420
the heat process,

883
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,980
you know, I like to think about those

884
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,180
tartars out there scraping it with

885
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,400
a dull knife though.

886
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,040
Trying to figure out how to make steak

887
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,880
tartar but winding it up with a hamburger.

888
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,380
I just heard about steak tartar

889
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,820
like a few months ago.

890
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,200
Yeah? I had no idea that

891
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,240
people ate that. And did

892
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,420
you try some or? Oh no.

893
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,160
You would never, why, because of the sauce?

894
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,060
Because I wouldn't eat

895
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,200
raw meat. Yeah, that is a problem.

896
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,660
Me either. How about raw fish? Yes.

897
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,100
I don't even eat cooked

898
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,460
meat.

899
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,460
I will only eat raw fish

900
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,520
if they have

901
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,220
fins and scales.

902
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,940
I only eat nuts.

903
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,500
I'm a strict nutarian.

904
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,500
Like a breast-arian?

905
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,760
I eat seeds and nuts.

906
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,460
I'm kind of like a squirrel

907
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,560
in that sense.

908
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,780
I'm on a squirrel diet.

909
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,920
Does that work?

910
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah, it actually works

911
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,220
real well. It's sort of high in oil

912
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,100
but it keeps your weight down.

913
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,440
So you're not eating nuts?

914
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,320
No, otherwise. But you get lots

915
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,820
of energy?

916
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,000
Yeah, I'm a

917
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,260
bountiful

918
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,340
bastion of energy.

919
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,500
I'm a skyrocket of energy.

920
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,100
You can't push over.

921
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,040
You can tell right now.

922
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,120
Thank you, Doctors of the Air.

923
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,360
Coming up next is a song

924
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,860
by Reverend Morgan

925
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,800
Glutentag called

926
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,360
Hidden Track.

927
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,820
As he describes it,

928
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:23,880
quote,

929
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,740
I wrote a song for a hidden track

930
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,780
at the end of a CD,

931
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,580
but I didn't write the rest of the songs

932
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,660
and CDs seemingly aren't a thing anymore.

933
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,440
It ended up being

934
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,460
some sort of generic preaching

935
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,840
slash hobo warning.

936
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,980
That's

937
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,360
pretty subgeniously.

938
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,580
Hidden Track by

939
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,980
Morgan Glutentag.

940
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,820
They say you won't come back

941
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,100
if you take that hidden track.

942
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,920
Oh,

943
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,100
Hidden Track.

944
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,400
You'll pay a hefty fare.

945
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,140
Please, my friend,

946
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,880
take care. Oh,

947
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,180
Hidden Track.

948
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,320
Oh,

949
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,600
Oh,

950
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,660


951
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,660


952
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,660


953
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
If you board that awful train,

954
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,120
you'll surely go insane.

955
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,140
Oh,

956
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,260
Hidden Track.

957
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,580
Dark things you must beware

958
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,140
when you ride those ghostly rails.

959
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:32,840
Oh,

960
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,080
Hidden Track.

961
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,500
Oh,

962
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,980
Oh,

963
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,200
Oh,

964
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,220
Oh,

965
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,680
Oh,

966
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,600
There is no

967
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,800
dining car to speak of

968
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,340
even though

969
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,680
the passengers get fed.

970
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,300
If you

971
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,080
find it difficult

972
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,340
to slumber, you've made your

973
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,180
own bed.

974
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,940
Oh,

975
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,580
Hidden Track.

976
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,180
As we see as articulations within

977
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,220
three-dimensional means,

978
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,360
those things are bound by light

979
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,320
and by it. And so

980
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,140
such beings are bound by light's

981
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,720
limitations. And so

982
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,360
to occupy the space within

983
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,500
light would mean to operate without time.

984
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,120
The four-dimensional frame,

985
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,880
and so it operates solely in the now.

986
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,400
Unless these

987
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,180
beings can transcend their basic

988
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,300
frequencies and resonate in a

989
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,220
hyperspace plane.

990
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,200
Oh,

991
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,800
Oh,

992
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Oh,

993
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,360
Oh,

994
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,040
They say you won't come back

995
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,140
if you take that Hidden Track.

996
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,400
Oh,

997
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,400
Hidden Track.

998
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,360
You'll pay a hefty

999
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,440
fare. Please, my friend,

1000
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,960
take care. Oh,

1001
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,120
Hidden Track.

1002
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,640
Oh,

1003
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,700
Oh,

1004
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,900
Oh,

1005
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,520
Oh,

1006
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:07,860


1007
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,520
Hidden Track.

1008
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:11,540
Oh,

1009
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,780
Oh,

1010
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,340
Oh,

1011
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,340


1012
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,340


1013
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,580
Hidden Track.

1014
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,760
Oh,

1015
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,300
Oh,

1016
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:32,880
Oh,

1017
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,400
Oh,

1018
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,920
Oh,

1019
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,320


1020
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,400
Oh,

1021
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,420
Oh.

1022
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:38,980


1023
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:41,380


1024
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,400


1025
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,600
Oh,

1026
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,120
Oh,

1027
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,220
That laziness, I think, is very, very...

1028
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,720
It's kind of provocative.

1029
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,640
You know, slackers are attracted to that level of laziness.

1030
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,640
Not that I'm a slacker.

1031
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,620
What's that?

1032
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,260
She's flossing just for you.

1033
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,800
Well, I'm really just a slack abuser.

1034
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,640
That's really nice.

1035
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,760
I'm not a slacker per se.

1036
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,160
It's just that when I find slack, I try to use it to its fullest extent.

1037
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,520
I just want to tell her when she turns her suit toward the...

1038
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,140
When you turn your suit toward the command center, the signal comes in better.

1039
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,920
Yeah.

1040
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,600
That's what it is.

1041
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,040
You're lying on your back.

1042
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,260
You should be on your side.

1043
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,400
Then you can look out over the top of the cockpit and see the earth below us.

1044
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,460
How do you guys know these things?

1045
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,420
Because we're right up above you.

1046
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:41,820
Yeah.

1047
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:41,940
High above.

1048
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,360
Berkeley.

1049
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,260
Because we're on the internet, you know, and you can find anybody on the internet.

1050
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,580
And folks, remember, we are going to find the end of the internet on this show.

1051
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,920
To try to find the show?

1052
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,300
She was looking for the end of the internet for four hours.

1053
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,060
Imagine that.

1054
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,440
She's up four hours of her life.

1055
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,240
She'll never get back.

1056
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,020
Oh, you were looking for the website that you can download the show from?

1057
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,100
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1058
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,400
And now, friends, this.

1059
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,660
This.

1060
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,600
Onan's optimism rant.

1061
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:22,900
The music in the background is by CyberChump from the CD called Their Moment of Perfect Happiness.

1062
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,440
Dr. Onan Canterbite wrote this.

1063
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,620
These are the end times.

1064
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,860
One way or another, these are the end times.

1065
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,360
For some, the end times mean...

1066
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,800
It means an expiration of clean air, potable water, and a lack of food.

1067
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,260
Or disease, decay, and death.

1068
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,640
For some, the end times means the end of time.

1069
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,240
A final triumph of time control as promised by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1070
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,180
The end times come to the pinks and the subgeniuses alike.

1071
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,000
And sadly, in all forms.

1072
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,340
But you're hearing my voice.

1073
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,500
And therefore...

1074
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,260
Well, these are...

1075
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:11,520
Yay!

1076
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,400
The end times!

1077
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,580
Fate has not seen fit to end your time at this time.

1078
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,820
No, you've got some suffering in you yet.

1079
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,820
And that won't go to waste.

1080
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,600
Jehovah One, alien space god, feeds on mortal suffering and seasons it with irony.

1081
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,240
The same is true of all the elder gods and a few of the younger gods.

1082
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,520
And there's no denying them their banquet.

1083
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,380
The end times are the end times.

1084
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,000
We pray they pray.

1085
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,700
The conspiracy will tell you that there's no cause for optimism.

1086
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,820
The conspiracy will tell you that optimism is expecting everything to turn out right.

1087
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,540
Everything.

1088
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,440
Every time.

1089
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,480
And if everything doesn't turn out right every time, then optimism has failed.

1090
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,420
Since optimism fails, one should stick with the success of failure.

1091
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,260
Oh, the conspiracy is great at rewarding failure when it's your failure.

1092
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,440
They don't like it so much when they fail.

1093
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,040
They don't even like it when you notice that they can fail.

1094
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:31,940
Gentle listener, you may be surprised to learn that the subgenius has a different perspective on the matter.

1095
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,120
For one thing, optimism is not expecting everything to turn out right every time.

1096
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:49,200
Optimism is when the subgenius is foolish and amoral enough to see all of life as one great sales opportunity.

1097
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:59,080
Whatever happens, the market is opened to the sales representative willing to take it on the chin and come back with a grin.

1098
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,520
Optimism is that infuriating, uncanny luck of Bob,

1099
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,100
by which whatever happens is exactly what he wants.

1100
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:19,140
He's not sure if he has what we would consider a memory or an understanding that future events will occur.

1101
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,300
He just is.

1102
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,940
Another thing is that even if we cannot quite ape the Dobbs nature,

1103
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:34,220
we can frame optimism as the success of what we prefer to happen.

1104
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,100
Not everything that happens, and for sure not what the conspiracy and frauds are,

1105
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,960
is just a must happen.

1106
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,580
When someone you don't like comes to a bad end,

1107
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,860
or at least goes and bothers somebody else for a while,

1108
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,220
that's hardly everything turning out right every time for them.

1109
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,860
But for you, heck yeah!

1110
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,000
Let those jerks get a taste of their own medicine for a change.

1111
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,440
Not because it'll do them any good, but because it gives you slack.

1112
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,700
So, you see, optimism is the evidence-based,

1113
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,020
and the evidence-based response to these end times.

1114
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,040
The whole planet is doomed.

1115
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,360
If the ghost dinosaurs don't get you, the plastic in the placenta will.

1116
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,520
If the oceans don't acidify you, the social media will sizzle your very soul.

1117
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,860
This naturally and necessarily means that they who tamper your cause

1118
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,200
will endure great agony and defeat.

1119
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,440
Hooray!

1120
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:35,840
Hooray!

1121
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,660
Hooray!

1122
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,420
Try to die last.

1123
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,140
I'll say that again.

1124
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,120
Try to die last, friend.

1125
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,100
Or maybe just be glad for the simple pleasures when they come your way.

1126
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:56,260
Keep a little spark lit to pass on to some other subgenius who's even more in the dark than you are.

1127
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,200
Whether you believe all it takes is a little sprinkle,

1128
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,640
or whether you believe it requires a full immersion,

1129
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:10,240
you walk into that water and gain the gift of Bob-tism from your own hand.

1130
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:16,700
By this sure means, ye shall know Bob-timism.

1131
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,620
And thank you, Uncle Dr. Onan Canterbite,

1132
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:32,460
for that optimistic, Bob-timistic, optimism.

1133
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,620
Optimism.

1134
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,640
Rant.

1135
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,440
Be a gnat.

1136
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,180
Oh.

1137
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,300
And thank you for the music,

1138
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,000
Zyberchunk.

1139
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,560
They're all unsaved, you know, and unwashed.

1140
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,960
The great unwashed are not so great.

1141
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,040
Don't let those eyes roll back in the head of you.

1142
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,460
And the unsaved are only great because we still haven't got their 30 bucks.

1143
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,300
No frothing.

1144
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,340
They're potentially great.

1145
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:01,680
And no bleeding from the eyes.

1146
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,520
But the pink can never be great.

1147
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:10,960
The pink is like a blind, deaf snake crawling on the floor of a pitch black cave.

1148
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,600
But old speedunker Bob, my friends, he's got a flashlight.

1149
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,620
And he's got a bucket and a long, sharp gigging stick.

1150
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:25,400
And soon enough, you will be searching for Dobbs on the scaly roof of your mouth, my friend.

1151
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,920
It's not a scaly thing.

1152
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,620
There's a man searching for Dobbs.

1153
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,180
Does that stuff really work anymore?

1154
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,460
Dobbs on the scaly roof face of another person's mouth.

1155
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,700
All that fire and brimstone.

1156
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,580
Does anyone believe anything anymore?

1157
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,320
No, they believe more in soaps.

1158
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,480
Except the midriff.

1159
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,800
Soaps thrown on anthracite are the now common mediums for getting the message across.

1160
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,340
I only honor the current marketing quirk.

1161
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,900
What is the current marketing?

1162
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,540
16-year-old midriff.

1163
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,000
16-year-old midriff?

1164
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,800
The halter top.

1165
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,320
The teenage halter top.

1166
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:55,520
Yeah.

1167
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,800
Yeah, that's what's going on in all the test markets.

1168
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,020
Yeah, it's fine with me.

1169
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,400
Next it'll be the back of the knee.

1170
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,400
That's fine too.

1171
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,220
Yeah, but...

1172
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,140
I'm telling you, from Columbus to Utah...

1173
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,760
So you'll buy it as long as it's the body part.

1174
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,620
I don't buy it.

1175
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,300
No, he sells it.

1176
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,220
You download it from the internet.

1177
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,080
Like the great faucet of pornography.

1178
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,420
Spewing and spewing.

1179
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,620
He does not buy.

1180
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,980
No, it's a cultural motivation.

1181
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,520
Yeah, sure.

1182
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,780
Well, my cultural icon would be perhaps to see...

1183
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,300
I back him up.

1184
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,880
To see, like...

1185
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,340
Have you ever seen like a religious picture of the Virgin Mary?

1186
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,780
Maybe hit me one more time.

1187
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,000
Showing her midriff.

1188
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,600
I wonder what kind of psychic image that would be.

1189
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:30,600


1190
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,940
I wonder what kind of impact that would have on people.

1191
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,460
You're hitting him with two things at one time.

1192
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,600
Your fist and your soft gloved foot.

1193
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,000
You know what I mean?

1194
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,420
You're kidding me.

1195
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,720
Or the...

1196
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,220
Yeah.

1197
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,620
Well, no, I know what you mean.

1198
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,280
I know what you mean.

1199
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:42,600
You know what I mean.

1200
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,020
I'm digging the...

1201
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,120
Sneaking into the psyche, you know.

1202
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,820
It's like being under the waterfall.

1203
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,420
Yeah.

1204
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,680
Only you're behind the waterfall.

1205
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,880
Well, that's more zen.

1206
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,520
You're not getting directly wet.

1207
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,280
Yeah.

1208
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,460
You're just sort of enjoying the spray coming from the...

1209
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,880
Indirect wetness.

1210
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,020
...flow.

1211
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,880
Now, see, that should be the marketing ploy's...

1212
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,180
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,600
...name, indirect wetness.

1214
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,500
I think people could understand that easily, especially what it has to do with zygotes,

1215
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:14,320
killer sperms, perhaps that blue, blue mansion on the top of that green, green hill right

1216
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:21,940
there where so many thousands of folks like you have gone before or walked through that

1217
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:28,920
door, taken a nocturnal omission through the backyards, maybe smoked a little pie in the

1218
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,100
oyster beds or...

1219
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:30,540
Yeah.

1220
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,720
...hung out by the farm waiting for dad to come back.

1221
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,140
But no, he's never coming back.

1222
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,660
But the dead must come back.

1223
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,920
Sooner or later, heaven can't last forever.

1224
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,840
Soon the dads will walk the earth again.

1225
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,360
I'm sorry, son.

1226
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:53,820
The dead will never walk the earth again unless, of course, someone with a very sharp little

1227
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,860
brain like yours can figure out the proper sequence of the syllables.

1228
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,600
It takes a lot of time.

1229
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:00,700
It takes a lot of time.

1230
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,000
We'll have to reanimate the flesh.

1231
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,920
You can repeat after me, but it must be your reflection, not mine.

1232
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,100
It must be your reflection, not mine.

1233
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,120
Not that, no, no, no, no, no, the secret words.

1234
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,320
Now, hold your hand over the top of your head so as not to let any omissions come out of

1235
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:18,700
the top.

1236
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,240
Yeah.

1237
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,840
Yeah, I'll say it's a...

1238
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,840
It's a rock and roll, baby.

1239
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,780
...it was far sick.

1240
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,980
Going to the rhythm.

1241
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:29,580
Yeah, I swear.

1242
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,580
Oh, he was about to say, oh, that's a great song.

1243
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1244
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1245
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1246
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1247
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1248
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1249
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:30,580


1250
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,600
I'm going to give the secret words and Chaz is sitting here looking at internet pornography.

1251
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,500
Chaz, you've got a computer at home.

1252
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,080
You can do this.

1253
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,960
Can I sing a rock and roll?

1254
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,160
You can make...

1255
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,300
Oh, you can't listen to rock and roll and look at the internet pornography at the same

1256
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,580
time.

1257
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,380
Now, look what he's doing.

1258
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,500
Look what came out of his ear.

1259
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,280
His hairy, hairy ear.

1260
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,280
Gross.

1261
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,800
The bonobo sect will now come to order.

1262
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,580
Oh, oh, before we forget, take a look at the secret words.

1263
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,480
You're not supposed to get up on the console and do the same thing to the monitor.

1264
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,280
Now I got this.

1265
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,500
Bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo.

1266
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,220
See, he's saying it over and over again.

1267
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,640
Bonobo, bonobo, bonobo.

1268
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:11,900
Save it for the D Bible.

1269
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,840
Save your spunk up for the D Bible at the Euclid Tavern on May 12th, my friend.

1270
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,680
Save up that spunk.

1271
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,800
Not that I practice what I...

1272
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,720
You're a spunky punk.

1273
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:28,360
All good listening moms and dads and childrens out there in listening land should be aware

1274
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,560
of the sexual dangers of copycats.

1275
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:30,560


1276
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,200
I'm not going to do that.

1277
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,200


1278
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,280
Hey, speaking of sexual...

1279
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,500
Stick to your own species.

1280
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,700
Stay with your own species.

1281
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,880
Nah, don't worry about it.

1282
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,940
It's a good way of procreating the right species.

1283
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,060
That's all I'm really doing it with monkeys.

1284
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,160
Oh, better.

1285
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,360
It's a metaphor, man.

1286
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,340
Yeah, man.

1287
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,820
I'm not going to do it to a monkey.

1288
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,640
It's a metaphor, my man.

1289
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,800
And now this from the Dobbs Ducktown Mirror.

1290
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,000
Ideal preparation.

1291
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,360
How can I play an instrument perfectly?

1292
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,600
How can I write a popular book?

1293
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,240
How can I meet my true love?

1294
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,300
Two answers.

1295
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,640
Luck or effort.

1296
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,520
A, play more, write more, meet more people, including meeting people through those people.

1297
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,040
If something doesn't work out, stop doing that and do something else that seems like

1298
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,960
it might work or do anything else.

1299
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,560
Just don't keep repeating what didn't work out.

1300
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,340
Practice being more careful.

1301
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,000
You're going to be more lucky too.

1302
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,920
Say the words, I am lucky, aloud and often.

1303
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:39,740
Or B, be instantly, completely lucky every time.

1304
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:42,780
Praise Bob.

1305
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,560
That's all from the Dobbs Ducktown Mirror.

1306
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:55,000
The new issue, which is available from, well, actually we put it into every package we mail

1307
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,340
out.

1308
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,920
But you can write to.

1309
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,500
Reverend Onan Kanabite.

1310
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,020
Got your pencil ready?

1311
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,900
Here's his P.O.

1312
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,160
Box.

1313
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,340
That's an easy one too.

1314
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,600
P.O.

1315
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,460
Box three.

1316
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,360
That's right.

1317
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,660
Onan.

1318
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,720
P.O.

1319
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,460
Box three.

1320

Box has an O. And 807 really means 807.
