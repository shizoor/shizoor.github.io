1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:16,120
B.O.B. Bop. B.O.B. Bop. B.O.B. Bop. Bop. Bop.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,280
This is KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,560
And this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,780
Although we haven't really officially started the show up yet.

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,980
I will in a minute.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,940
We're broadcasting tonight, not from KNON studios,

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,280
but live from here at the Buldata Time Control Laboratories,

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,720
headquarters of the Church of the Subgenius,

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,120
if you can really call it a headquarters.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,220
And I'm going to go past the little nuclear reactor there

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,860
and outside into the back pasture of the laboratories

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:13,480
where I've got the actual official Night of Slack show stashed back here.

14
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,900
It's a large, tonight's show is a large black machine.

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm rolling it out into the pasture here.

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,920
It's a, the show is a, it looks like a contraption that you'd see in the movie Dune

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,060
or some kind of science fiction movie.

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,340
You can't quite tell what it's for.

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,020
Let me put the sacred microphone down here

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,020
and we'll get this religious broadcast started up if there's any gas in it.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,460
This is, where can I put this microphone?

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,380
All right.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,960
Now, let's see if we can.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,960
Let's get this thing going here.

25
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,200
All right.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,440
This is the, friends, let's all pray together that this show will start up,

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,600
that we've got any gas at all in it, okay?

28
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,120
This is the Subgenius Hour of Slack Radio Ministry.

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,460
Well, wait a minute.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,540
It didn't work that time.

31
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,120
I'll try one more time.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,860
Shoot.

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,040
Come on, show.

34
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,960
Friends, have you sent your donation in to this show?

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,140
Or rather to KNON, your love offering?

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,800
Because if you don't, we'll never get this thing started up.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Man, this is ridiculous.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,620
What kind of a show is this?

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,560
Maybe it's wet.

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,320
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,660
I have Buck Nugget!

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,940
No trouble.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,460
Just get set and get going.

45
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey, him.

46
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,580
Recording.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
Everything's going fine.

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,740
No trouble.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,500
Welcome potential initiates.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,500
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

51
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,300
Bob?

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,640
Bob?

53
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:18,860


54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,120
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,660
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,020
What about Slack?

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
That's your key phrase.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,360
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

59
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,740
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,780
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,260
This is Reverend Ivan Smith.

62
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,260


63
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm Reverend Stan.

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,340
Sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megaphyst Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

65
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,620
With Pastor Buck Nugget of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

66
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,780
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

67
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,560
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,520
sales on planet Earth.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,260
Are you abnormal?

70
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,720
Then you are probably better than most people.

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,940
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,620
Now at last the step by step process is revealed.

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,760
This is it.

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,520
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

75
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,100
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,220
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

77
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,820
Bob is a way of life to millions.

78
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,440
Half of them don't even know it.

79
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:05,220
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through

80
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,680
the locked doorway to financial heaven.

81
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,700
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,020
We are the only real shortcut to Slack.

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,800
We will see you next time.

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,300
Bye.

85
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,580
Bye.

86
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,160
Bye.

87
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,740
Bye.

88
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,140
Bye.

89
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,640
Bye.

90
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,840
Bye.

91
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,320
Bye.

92
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,340
Bye.

93
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,660
Bye.

94
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,680
Oh, yes.

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,060
And look at the humans lining up for the slaughterhouse.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh, yes.

97
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,240
The harvest.

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,020
And we'll be right back to the sermon after this brief message.

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,120
Wise up!

100
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,580
They're out to get you.

101
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,940
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

102
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,680
Weird men arise and find out who they are

103
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,880
and how to smash them.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,000
It's the Church of the Some Genius.

105
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,320
Revival, crusade, and gun blowout.

106
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,400
Bob is coming again and again.

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,380
Friday and Saturday, November 15th, 16th, 9 p.m.

108
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,180
at the Alexandria Hotel, Maple Ballroom, 501 South Spring Street.

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,480
For ticket information, call High Performance Magazine, 6877362.

110
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,560
Good luck.

111
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

112
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,420
Keep it down.

113
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,040
And that little commercial was about the event that took us away from town last week

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,760
and put this show on tape and in the hands of madmen.

116
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,040
Ha, ha, ha, praise Bob.

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,700
You need doctors for Bob.

118
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,100
And you need it in the worst way.

119
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,540
Uh, uh, uh, can we have our next caller, please?

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,020
Oh, yeah, Deep One.

121
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,560
Oh, it's Dr. Deep One.

122
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,520
Caller, turn it up.

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,760
Caller, you're up all the way.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,900
You'll have to turn the volume on your little head, the left ear, all the way.

125
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,120
Start screaming into the phone as loud as you can.

126
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,820
Could you call her?

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
Turn your left ear sharply.

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
The famous puddle of sound.

129
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,380
Doctors have to be very quiet now.

130
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,460
Okay, go ahead.

131
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,960
This is the absolute dictator of Berkeley.

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,540
Oh, okay.

133
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,980
Yeah, we heard you.

134
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,320
No wonder you're so small.

135
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,200
Where are you supposed to watch my car?

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,860
Look to your son for a warning.

137
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,740
I say, what are you talking about?

138
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah, that's what I thought, huh?

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,600
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
Yeah, what sound in your mind are you using?

141
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,340
What's happening?

142
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,400
We're all talking funny.

143
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,760
Somebody check the tape.

144
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,380
The dictator was not the one we was sent for.

145
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,380
Oh, no.

146
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,220
With all the smoke and flame.

147
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,520
I represent all the people.

148
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

149
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,020
Subgenius Radio is...

150
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,580
Subgenius Radio is...

151
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:47,580


152
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:47,580


153
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:47,580


154
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,680
Subgenius Radio is...

155
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
The kind of radio that you have to listen to very closely.

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,080
Because if you don't, it may not make any sense.

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,540
But if you do, it'll make sense over and over and over again.

158
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,700
In fact, it's the type of radio that you should listen to on headphones

159
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,220
and make bootleg tape recordings of at the same time.

160
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,800
Because, friends, we play tapes and records made by people.

161
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,740
By people themselves, not by the conspiracy.

162
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,580
We play...

163
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,540
We play very little material that you can buy in a store.

164
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:30,120
But it's what we get in the mail from the subgeniuses and subgenius synthesizers.

165
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,960
It's material that is done out of pure need, pure desperation, pure truth.

166
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,160
The most wonderful lies and truth at the same time.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
Well, friends...

168
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,720
Our last show was on tape.

169
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,620
Our last two shows were on tape because Pastor Naked and I were out of town.

170
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Out of town on the subgenius DeVival Crusade World Tour.

171
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
Ah, yes, in San Francisco, L.A., and Seattle.

172
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,220
And theoretically, the last two shows were on tape.

173
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,100
Although I understand that last week the tape deck broke down.

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,660
Or rather, it wouldn't turn...

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:15,880
It wouldn't turn off.

176
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,400
It was stuck in play.

177
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,340
And our men on the scene, Tom Williams and Buddy West, put up a valiant battle against that technology

178
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,460
and took over the phone lines and raised $300 in love offerings for the station.

179
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,220
Ah, yes, and apparently they were joined by an incoherent friend, from what I've heard.

180
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,120
So, maybe next week we'll play the tape that they were going to play.

181
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,540
In the meanwhile, I have this praise of Brother Tom and Brother...

182
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,620
Buddy for managing to keep their heads or what's left of them.

183
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,540
Because this show is designed to be not just the cutting edge, my friends,

184
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,620
but the decapitating edge of popular culture and very, very unpopular culture.

185
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,680
But, yes, this show, friends, will be playing some music,

186
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,060
but also some tapes from the Atomic DeVival Crusade.

187
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,580
Okay.

188
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,000
Ed, I'm telling the truth.

189
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,220
Pastor Naked and I, joined by Doctors for Bob from Little Rock, Arkansas,

190
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
and the Pope of all New York,

191
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,220
we did some heroic preachings on a subgenius world tour up and down Babylon,

192
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,220
the West Coast, the Pink Coast, we call it,

193
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,860
trying to preach the word of Bob, friends, in hip nightclubs.

194
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,560
The Stone in San Francisco is where most of this tape will be from.

195
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,660
Although, I think we'll all...

196
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:45,660


197
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:45,660


198
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,620
We'll also be using cuts from the Scary Ball here in Dallas at the Twilight Room,

199
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,660
which started off the world tour.

200
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,740
But, friends, many were saved during these preachings.

201
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,980
Many were saved and many were killed,

202
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,800
including, yes, our high E-popped J.R. Bob Dobbs.

203
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,880
Friends, Bob was re-erected on this tour.

204
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,700
And don't get excited.

205
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,980
He's dead again.

206
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,760
He's dead again.

207
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,260
Killed again.

208
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,580
In his own self.

209
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
Killed again in Bob.

210
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,980
An ectosplasmodic manifestation of Bob

211
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,000
was first appeared in San Francisco on the video,

212
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,400
huge video screens that we had set up in there.

213
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,040
But he wouldn't...

214
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,520
We had been expecting a ghostly presence,

215
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,940
but it was this video image.

216
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,960
In L.A., we got the complete Bob materialization,

217
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,000
but he was sort of shimmering.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
He wasn't quite solidified.

219
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,620
And finally, the very last night of the second L.A. show,

220
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,800
Bob Dobbs walked out in physical bodily presence.

221
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,880
Our slain E-popped had materialized, walked out solid as you or me,

222
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,620
which that may be a little bit questionable.

223
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,980
But he appeared on stage and no sooner, once again,

224
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,280
no sooner did he wave to the people around him than he was, once again,

225
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,780
tragically cut down in his prime and sent back to hell or heaven

226
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,640
or wherever it is that Bob now carries on his battle.

227
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,620
And friends, I mean, this was a ritualistic re-killing.

228
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,420
And I will admit that it is possible that once again,

229
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,300
this was not the actual J.R. Bob Dobbs.

230
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,720
This man could have been an android clone of Bob.

231
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,180
He could have been a person in a mask, even.

232
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,180
It was an eerie look.

233
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,880
A looking manifestation.

234
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,260
But friends, we're going to go into that, that live revival, yes,

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,920
if you'll join us in headphones or in your car.

236
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,220
Welcome to the 173rd annual San Francisco Subgenius Devival.

237
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,560
We'd like to start off, if you would all bow your heads, please.

238
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,740
We'd like to start off with a sacred, traditional moment of noise.

239
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,580
Yeah!

240
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,180
Praise Bob!

241
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,300
Praise Bob!

242
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

243
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,760
Praise Bob!

244
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,240
Praise Bob!

245
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,020
Ah yes, it feels so good to have the power!

246
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,180
Praise Bob!

247
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,520
In San Francisco, praise Bob!

248
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,440
Are you ready to praise Bob?

249
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:58,740
Yeah!

250
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,440
Are you ready to hate the conspiracy?

251
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,200
Yeah!

252
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,360
I'd just like to take this opportunity to state briefly and for the record

253
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:21,700
that my fellow Doctors for Bob and myself are members in good standing of a church.

254
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,880
But not just any church, for the church to which we belong

255
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,820
just happens to be, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world's only bogus true religion.

256
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,260
Of course, I am referring to the church.

257
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,260
Of the subgenius!

258
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,280
Now the church of the subgenius, as founded by J.R. Bob Dob,

259
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,220
Saint of Sales, Master Slack in 1953, is the pan-religion of the future.

260
00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:01,240
Uniting superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses, and sci-fi sinners

261
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,780
in a worldwide rampage of immoral.

262
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,560
And for the church to be the center of the world,

263
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,180
it's a prophetic yuck and grins.

264
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,520
Yucks and grins which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity all too lacking.

265
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,640
And today's modern, dead-age, ago-go society, and that commodity, friends, is Slack!

266
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,140
Now Slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

267
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to deprive us of.

268
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,640
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the lapels and screaming at it!

269
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,020
Now back in the 50s,

270
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,820
Bob himself noticed a decided lack of Slack in our culture.

271
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,200
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

272
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,000
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different.

273
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,840
An insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

274
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,180
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factors.

275
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,000
Dedicated, in short, to the total and utter irrationality of our lives.

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,700
Dedicated to the eradication of the original Slack with which we were all born.

277
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,560
Well, Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen.

278
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,580
And what better way, I ask ye, than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

279
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,520
Hence the Church of the Subgenius.

280
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,400
Praise Bob!

281
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,560
Whoo! Help me somebody!

282
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,500
Now many people I know view the conspiracy on a very tiny, arcane, and mealy-mouthed level.

283
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,480
You see the conspiracy only as the U.S. government,

284
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,860
the CIA, FBI, Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, Catholic Church, Jewish Defense League,

285
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,280
Council on Foreign Relations, or Trilateral Commission.

286
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,840
Other, more occultated individuals can see to the next level.

287
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,280
You see the conspiracy as the men in black, the green energy demons,

288
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,740
the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the hollow earth,

289
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,720
the henchmen of Negian, the Iacotismo.

290
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,720
But even they don't have the full story, ladies and gentlemen.

291
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,540
For I'm here to tell you tonight that the conspiracy exists,

292
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,420
as none other than Jehovah One,

293
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,700
alien space god of wrath from some corporate sin galaxy,

294
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,240
and his stark fist of removal.

295
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,620
This is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Fort Worth.

296
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,740
This is Reverend Ivan Stang and Pastor Bucknaget.

297
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,600
We're on the road from San Francisco to Los Angeles

298
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,520
inside of a huge truck with Bob's face stuck on the wall.

299
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,160
This is the front of the engine.

300
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,500
A huge exhaust is coming out of the pipe.

301
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,760
That's right, and then it's funneled back inside the cab here,

302
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,640
so we're having a hell of a good time!

303
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,920
This is the first lead truck, the flag truck,

304
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,260
leading a huge convoy of vans carrying props

305
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,940
for the subgenius atomic revival

306
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,300
in Hollywood!

307
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,300
Big time, baby!

308
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,580
Big time.

309
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,820
The radio show.

310
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,660
This is the radio show.

311
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,660
You didn't tell me you had the whole show back here.

312
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,240
Yeah, the show is in the truck.

313
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,740
No wonder it's crowded.

314
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,640
Crazy show, sweetheart, baby.

315
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,260
Now get out of here. Just kidding.

316
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,900
We love you. Get out of here, you maniac.

317
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,940
That was the voice of Reverend Jano Hyperclete.

318
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,620
Crazy. You're ugly. You're ugly.

319
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,620
Come on, sane man.

320
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,780
Now stay here.

321
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,900
I mean, that's really growthful.

322
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,420
I can dig where you're coming from.

323
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,080
Where you're going to.

324
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,820
I wish you'd hurry up and get there.

325
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,380
We're not in L.A. yet.

326
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,040
We're not. No, we're not in L.A. yet.

327
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,780
My mind is already in L.A.

328
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,140
My mind is in South Dakota in a jar.

329
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,640
Yeah, and then they poured it down the toilet.

330
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,840
And then flushed it.

331
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,160
They said my mind was in this jar,

332
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,440
but they never proved it.

333
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,380
They never had empirical evidence.

334
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,500
We're in a carry van. It's a unique vehicle.

335
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,480
We're all here.

336
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,980
The front is like a van,

337
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,240
and the back is squared off like a truck.

338
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,540
Ah, my legs are on fire!

339
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,960
And it's hell in here.

340
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,660
Get that cigarette butt off your legs, Garth.

341
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,620
It's a cold flame in subgenius hell.

342
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,000
Ah, yes.

343
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,320
Then back in the same vault,

344
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,140
the same flag truck is the Golden Calf.

345
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,600
The West Coast head is the Golden Calf.

346
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,580
The huge West Coast head is back there screaming.

347
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,860
There's a pipe seven feet long

348
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,360
and a bobbed face seven feet tall.

349
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,400
Don't think we didn't get high on that.

350
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,800
Yeah, baby, it's flammable.

351
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,040
Radio TV land.

352
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah.

353
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,840
Yes, that's...

354
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,620
Well, come on, we'll have to do tapes.

355
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,060
I think we can go to bed on this tape thing,

356
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,480
on this radio show thing, Garth.

357
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Yeah, why don't you move the show over a little bit,

358
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,980
and I'll be able to lie on the opening of the show,

359
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,160
and he can lie for the rest of the show,

360
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,300
and we'll have something to lie on.

361
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
Now I'm at the door here.

362
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,940
Brock is running around selling buttons.

363
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
There's all of the...

364
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,100
Our security forces are well armed.

365
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,380
All right, check this.

366
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,720
Just fine, no guns on you.

367
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,580
You have the time.

368
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,240
Now you two.

369
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,340
All right, turn around.

370
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,640
It's just fine.

371
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,340
Joy's down.

372
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,660
The nurses are running a weapons detector

373
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,880
up and down the...

374
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,200
the audience as they come in to screen them,

375
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,260
and occasionally they do find guns.

376
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,860
There's a box full of guns over here where people...

377
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,980
Is anybody outside preaching?

378
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,180
This is the one street in the world you can preach on,

379
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,340
and nobody's gonna give you trouble.

380
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,720
We had our propaganda table exactly across from these.

381
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,700
Campus Crusade for Christ's Confirmation Day.

382
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,780
Oh, yeah, you told me about that.

383
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,440
Our big sign, eternal damnation, one dollar.

384
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,140
And they go for it.

385
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,280
Boy, they eat up each other.

386
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,560
You should back the beginning of the show.

387
00:20:59,700 --> 00:20:59,860
All right.

388
00:20:59,880 --> 00:20:59,880


389
00:20:59,880 --> 00:20:59,880


390
00:20:59,880 --> 00:20:59,880


391
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,660
Oh, we...

392
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,560
Uh oh.

393
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,140
Uh oh.

394
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,480
Damn, the nurses just located a...

395
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,100
a...

396
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,380
Oh.

397
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,260
Located a gun on the...

398
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,980
They said a bunch of...

399
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,960
They're kids, man.

400
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,780
They're kids that refuse to quit playing with the guns.

401
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,620
That's what it...

402
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,740
Can I hear a couple of...

403
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,020
Sounds good, and now in stereo.

404
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,840
Okay.

405
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,380
Now, how about a...

406
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:29,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


409
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


410
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


411
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


412
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


413
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


414
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


415
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


416
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:29,860


417
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,980
You're going to have to work on that one if you want to make Dobstown, friend.

418
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,600
All right.

419
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:44,780
For the first time here in this Babylon city, this doomed metroplex,

420
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,500
the good Pastor Buck naked.

421
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,320
And that really is his name, by the way.

422
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,320
It was actually pronounced knockhead.

423
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,960
It's Turkish.

424
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,320
But why waste a good thing?

425
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,060
This one's called Wirehead Conspiracy.

426
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,900
It's about a dude I personally know who sold out to the UFOs.

427
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,560
Come on!

428
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,460
A light from the sky settled over them trees.

429
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,120
It left this wire in my head that customized me.

430
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,800
The wire in my head, it advises me.

431
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,220
Better living through bio-circuitry.

432
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,040
Yeah, okay.

433
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Hey!

434
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,580
The wire in my head has found me new friends.

435
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,140
Bring it up!

436
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,520
We meet at the airport where the old freeway ends.

437
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,080
And we lay down our lives for the power of sin.

438
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,300
I got a wire in my head.

439
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,700
And so do my friends.

440
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,100
The wire, a big business opportunity.

441
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,280
The wire benefits me financially.

442
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,900
The wire in my head gives me good deals.

443
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,880
The wire in my head gives me good deals.

444
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,180
I drive a real solid car.

445
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,260
And I eat fancy meals.

446
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:09,940
And you can bet I'd kill any bastard who squeals.

447
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,000
I got a wire in my head.

448
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,820
And I like how it feels.

449
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,360
I got a wire for your head.

450
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,580
And I'd install it for free.

451
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:36,940
Don't think I'm gonna eat you up.

452
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:45,780
The wire in my head must not lead me to hell.

453
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Hey!

454
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,360


455
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,820
Oh, just a second...

456
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


457
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


458
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


459
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


460
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


461
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


462
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


463
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


464
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


465
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:49,820


466
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,680
well, let's just get sent.

467
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
And they'll be setting us up.

468
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,760
Personal advantages.

469
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:52,760


470
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:52,760


471
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:52,760


472
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,720
Be bold.

473
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,460
It's live.

474
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,280
Love upon the steamed représentation.

475
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,500
Praise Bob.

476
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,660
Okay.

477
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,360
Okay.

478
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,640
Praise money and Bob.

479
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,760
This next one we're going to do is a spiritual.

480
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,700
It's known as Bob is leading me.

481
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,300
I wrote this as soon as I became incultated into the subgenius church.

482
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,900
You'll see why.

483
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,400
Changed your mind?

484
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,060
Don't want to hear it?

485
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,520
Bob.

486
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,820
Bob.

487
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,060
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

488
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
Where are you leading us, Bob?

489
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,640
Is he waiting there for me?

490
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,560
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

491
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,420
What is waiting there for me?

492
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,400
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

493
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,480
Bob can save me.

494
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,660
Bob will be.

495
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,060
Bobby.

496
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,480
Bobby.

497
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,020
Bobby.

498
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,600
Bobby.

499
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,100
Bobby.

500
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,700
Bobby.

501
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,140
Bobby.

502
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,620
Bobby.

503
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:52,740
Bobby.

504
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:52,800
Bobby.

505
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,020
Bobby.

506
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,060
Bobby.

507
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,320
Bobby.

508
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:53,360


509
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,600
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

510
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,100
What is waiting there for me?

511
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,160
Bob.

512
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,860
Thank you, okay, sit around, I'll be back.

513
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,720
But thank you.

514
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,580
It was a happier day when Bob Dobbs

515
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,620
walked the earth because in those days the conspiracy wasn't in the church.

516
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,720
And that's what I'm talking about tonight, the conspiracy in the church.

517
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,460
I've had a lot of experience with the conspiracy.

518
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,620
Yes, I'm not an artist.

519
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,120
I'm a preacher.

520
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,420
I don't make my living at this.

521
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,700
I have to make my living doing other things, sick, horrible things for them.

522
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,260
But in dealing with the conspiracy for

523
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,500
you.

524
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,620
Years, I've noticed the weirdest phenomenon.

525
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,880
There, there's the conspiracy, the normal dupes of the conspiracy down at the bottom.

526
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,740
The ones that, the rude clerks in stores, the, the high school principals and so forth.

527
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,880
But at the top, the top rungs of the conspiracy are imaginative people.

528
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:19,040
Yes, the top guys in these banks, and they are guys, most of them in these banks and

529
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,120
and plus the little governments that help

530
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,580
run the country with the banks.

531
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,960
They're kind of clever.

532
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,700
They're funny.

533
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,960
They're unsaved subgenius is probably unsavable.

534
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,480
But so here you got this conspiracy with all these unsaved latent rogue subgeniuses at the top.

535
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,600
And yet the church is filling up with pink boys.

536
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,240
Yes.

537
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,700
Yes.

538
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:48,700


539
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,360


540
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,340
Yes.

541
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,100
Halfway subgeniuses.

542
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,180
Halfway subgeniuses.

543
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,300
They're the ones who go, oh, Reverend Stang, I think Buck is real funny and, and doctors

544
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,320
for Bob are real funny.

545
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,600
But Reverend Stang, you talk about all this serious stuff.

546
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,680
It just makes me depressed.

547
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,660
And I say, little Bobby, you should be depressed because you're going to fry in hell come next

548
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,020
day, 1998.

549
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,140
While we true apostles of Dobbs are.

550
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:24,940
In that mothership waving to those poor people down below in the estate vessels of the sex

551
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,680
goddesses.

552
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,220
Oh yes.

553
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,380
But Bobby's.

554
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:29,900
Oh yes.

555
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,980
The Bobby's.

556
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,100
Those who would make this church just like all the other religions.

557
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,320
Yes.

558
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,420
It's frustrating dealing with them.

559
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,460
Very frustrating because they never know that I'm talking about them.

560
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,920
There's plenty of them here tonight.

561
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,400
Bobby's.

562
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,460
Bobby's.

563
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,720
Like Mooney's.

564
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,920
They're the kinds.

565
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,200
You can spot a Bobby.

566
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,920
They're the ones that are walking around all day long going Bob slack, Bob slack, Bob slack,

567
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,680
both Bob slack.

568
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,580
I've got slack now.

569
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,240
I've got Bob.

570
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,860
I'm free.

571
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm safe.

572
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,080
I said Bob slack, Bob slack every day for two years continuously.

573
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,580
But it was different in those days.

574
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,000
In those days you had to sin your way into Dobbs town and you had to come up with new

575
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,400
sins.

576
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,660
You couldn't just borrow somebody else's sins.

577
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,280
You had to come up with new sins.

578
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,980
You had to come up with new sins.

579
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:18,980


580
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:18,980


581
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,180
But they have this stupid impression that slack automatically comes with the subscription

582
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,020
to the Stark fist, comes with their membership card.

583
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,920
Slack actually most Americans have some stuff ideas.

584
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,440
Slack for three quarters of this planet.

585
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,420
Slack is a good meal.

586
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,860
Oh, but America, yeah, they, but yeah, these Bobby's, I believe that they can spiritually

587
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,780
mature only through agony.

588
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,400
Right.

589
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,200
We're working on it.

590
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:55,480
The slack, the only slack they'll ever know is the slack that comes when a subgenius doctor quits hitting them on the head with a hammer.

591
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,280
Yeah, boy, slack, slack.

592
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,060
Slack, slack.

593
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,040
Friends, we've come to the end of the first half hour of this radio ministry.

594
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,260
Now it's up to you to flip the show over and play side two.

595
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,180
This is KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Fort Worth.

596
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,180
I tell you, he has ape intelligence.

597
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,280
Exactly.

598
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,460
Yes, it's the mentality, Jeff.

599
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,000
You don't recognize the chimp?

600
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,920
Is that my mother?

601
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,360
You look like her.

602
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,380
You really think it could go that far, Spock?

603
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,020
Get it on yourself, Spock.

604
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,140
Get it on yourself, Spock.

605
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,560
Get it on yourself, Spock.

606
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,240
Captain, get away.

607
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,940
Get away.

608
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,300
Get away.

609
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,160
Sir, get away.

610
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,380
Get away.

611
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Captain, Mr. Spock.

612
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,940
Spock, what's going on here?

613
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,420
Pardon me.

614
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,640
No.

615
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,760
Ape shall not kill ape.

616
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,040
Too late.

617
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,600
You should have told me sooner.

618
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,360
But it didn't hurt a bit.

619
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,220
Shall we try again?

620
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,540
Go, babe.

621
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,940
You know what to do.

622
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,180
Oh, no, it's not so!

623
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,260
This is gonna be a terrible shock to you.

624
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,120
Ball mother f***ing death.

625
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,060
It's all right.

626
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,660
They're sticking to the tar baby a bomb as Dr. Wilman once said.

627
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,400
It's sick.

628
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,340
They're smug.

629
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,880
They're as smug as the rival cult.

630
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,240
They're smug as the rival cult.

631
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


632
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


633
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


634
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


635
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


636
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


637
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


638
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


639
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


640
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


641
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


642
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,240


643
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, I'm part of a group, they think.

644
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,520
I'm part of the cool group.

645
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,740
They're part of the conformity of nonconformists.

646
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,360
Yes?

647
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,360
We swore it would never happen to this church.

648
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,300
You look out, and the given, this is different, I notice.

649
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,640
This crowd is really different.

650
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,520
But a lot of times, at subgenius revivals in other towns,

651
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,160
I look out upon a sea of white male young faces.

652
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,180
And it's sick, because this, the subgenius race,

653
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,520
you know there's only two races?

654
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,560
Us and them.

655
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,220
And the subgenius race is the master race

656
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,080
because it comes in all colors, all shapes, all sizes,

657
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,900
and all ranges of intelligence,

658
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,560
because it ain't the intelligence that counts,

659
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,700
it's what you do with it.

660
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,260
One idiot inventing one good joke

661
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,980
is worth a thousand scientists,

662
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,820
making A-bombs, according to Bob.

663
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,860
When the book of the subgenius was put together,

664
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,100
it was with Bob's blessings, but we added,

665
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,500
we added to the word.

666
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,660
You shouldn't use your mind to think about your religion.

667
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,740
But we did.

668
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,180
Dr. Drummond and I thought, well,

669
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,180
these subgeniuses should form clenches, we called them.

670
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,080
Form clenches, get together,

671
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,700
and have church revivals all the time.

672
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,900
I believe that's a conspiracy concept, my friend.

673
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,120
We were wrong.

674
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,160
The solo clench is the way to go.

675
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,920
Don't try to recruit subgeniuses,

676
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,180
because you're just going to pull in more Bobbies.

677
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,940
God knows we need the money, but,

678
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,160
kill.

679
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,980
Kill Bobbies.

680
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,920
Because the basic, the bottom line is,

681
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,700
here, I'm reverence, I'm the sacred stride.

682
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,020
But no subgenius can give orders to any other subgenius,

683
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,120
because you take your orders direct from Bob.

684
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,020
Bob.

685
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,860
Kathryn Turner, Bob actually,

686
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


687
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


688
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


689
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,860


690
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,260
You're pulling into Bob yourself.

691
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,180
Oh, it's making me sick having to deal

692
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,560
with the stupid bobby, or the smart bobbies.

693
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,620
That's the problem, they are smart, yeah,

694
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,740
briefly.

695
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,720
I want to,

696
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,920
sometimes I want to shut down the sacred PO box,

697
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,860
a blood covenant with Jehovah One.

698
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,760
Wotan, the god of wrath,

699
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,020
space god from some insidious devil sin money galaxy,

700
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,820
much like this country.

701
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,840
Patriarchal monster.

702
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,400
But we must pay our biases to this thing.

703
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,300
Bob signed the contract.

704
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,860
And we will.

705
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,720
Bob predicted and there will come a strong America

706
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,640
and a strong world,

707
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
but strong through abnormality.

708
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,180
It's the anti-Bob that wants a planet of Bobs.

709
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,340
J.R. Bob Dobbs came and comes again and again and again

710
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,300
to justify your sins, my friend.

711
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,460
To rationalize your sins.

712
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,440
Doug Roman may have killed Bob for your sins,

713
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,580
but Bob did not die for your sins.

714
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,360
But the Bobby,

715
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,740
Oh, the Bobbies.

716
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,680
Oh, praise Bob, Bobbra.

717
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,400
Praise Bobbra.

718
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,900
He got it.

719
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,020
The Bobbists.

720
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,080
It's stacking up.

721
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,180
Maybe we'll be able to publish that thing soon.

722
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,000
All right.

723
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,800
The church, we have, some of us have been given to see

724
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,060
into 1998, July 5th, 1998, X day,

725
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,840
the day when the men from Planet X,

726
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,200
men they call them,

727
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,100
will come down from their beautiful saucers

728
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,980
and either save or destroy this planet.

729
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,700
Much like we would decide whether to shoot a bullet,

730
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:05,700


731
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:05,700


732
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,460
a dog, that's been hit by a car on the side of the road

733
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,900
or to take the trouble of taking them to the vet.

734
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,460
If those creatures from space arrive

735
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,520
and find a planet full of bobbies,

736
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,480
selling you church air.

737
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,340
Oh, not just church buttons, not just church clothes.

738
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
Church air.

739
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,620
And you'll pay your soul for each lungful.

740
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,660
You think Jesus had a bed?

741
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,480
Oh yeah, Jesus, oh he had to work an 80-hour week.

742
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,980
and the old jeans have it tough.

743
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,500
Friends, they're going to have you nailing yourself up on that cross.

744
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,200
And I don't know, frankly,

745
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know how you're going to get your right hand in

746
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,500
after that first day, left hand's nailed up.

747
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,720
You're going to have to pay somebody to help you.

748
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,760
How are you going to get your hand, your wallet out of your pocket, eh?

749
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,000
So sad.

750
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,400
This church, they call the church of the subgenius a joke.

751
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,180
Just like, oh, the conspiracy is a joke.

752
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,620
Yeah, a joke, big joke.

753
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,040
This could be the greatest joke ever told

754
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,720
if Earth can make it to the punchline.

755
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,240
And I don't know what that punchline's going to be.

756
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm waiting to see.

757
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
But you know, if you're a Bobby,

758
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,960
you can't lie to Bob.

759
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,720
You can't hide from Bob

760
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,120
because his face is in more places than yours is.

761
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,260
He can see out of everywhere.

762
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,140
Every one of those little pictures of Bob

763
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,740
and every dot on his dot-patterned face

764
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,800
holds a sinister yet joyous power.

765
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,300
Ah, yes.

766
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,300
They've got, oh, a mighty Bob pipe.

767
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,340
This is it.

768
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,620
It's got the rim, the white official rim.

769
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,460
But I won't get lost in the dogma.

770
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,900
They have, the conspiracy has 50,000 nuclear weapons.

771
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,180
The church of the subgenius only has three.

772
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,380
And yet, we dare to...

773
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
And fight them anyway.

774
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,660
We'll take them on and that's the miracle.

775
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,720
Oh, Bob said, friends.

776
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,540
Bob said, I'm going to give you pills.

777
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,440
Bob said, I'm going to give you drugs.

778
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,660
Bob said, but not the conspiracy pills that enslave you.

779
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,880
It's the pills of slack.

780
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,520
The pills of revolution, my friend.

781
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,540
Pills.

782
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,100
Oh, pills to the left of me.

783
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,800
Pills to my right.

784
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,880
Pills in the day and pills in the night.

785
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,900
Yeah, pills.

786
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,120
Pills.

787
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,040
Talking about pills.

788
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,240
Pills.

789
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,260
Pills for the bad and pills for the good.

790
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,700
Pills for the young and misunderstood.

791
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,300
Yeah, pills.

792
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,640
Pills.

793
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,140
Pills.

794
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,120
Talking about...

795
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,700
Pills.

796
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,780
Pills.

797
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,060
Pills in my hamper.

798
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,480
Pills in my...

799
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,820
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks.

800
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,620
Yeah, pills.

801
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,980
Pills.

802
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,900
Talking about pills.

803
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,060
Pills.

804
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,880
Pills always tell me things to do.

805
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,160
Pills are better friends than you.

806
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,300
Yeah, pills.

807
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,400
Pills.

808
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,740
He's talking about pills now.

809
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,440
Pills.

810
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,440
My friend's the pills.

811
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,020
Oh, just give me some of them pills.

812
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,900
Oh, give me those pills, Bob.

813
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,880
Here, have some pills.

814
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,360
Take some more of these pills in the morning.

815
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,680
More pills.

816
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,560
And that's just the sort of thing I was talking about.

817
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,280
Exactly, gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.

818
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,900
Hello to you in Dallas, Texas.

819
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:09,540
This is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there,

820
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,720
courtesy of Stang and the Reverend Bucknaked,

821
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,920
for which I am glad to present this opportunity to myself to speak at this time.

822
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,640
First of all, I want to say that none of the pills are ever good enough, as you all know.

823
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:31,180
And as you're out there, you know, you cannot feel anything without some sort of pill.

824
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:38,320
Now, that pill could be, of course, you know, your average, you know, vitamin or dexatrim or something like that.

825
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,380
Or it can be Jesus.

826
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,040
It's any kind of pill that you mention at all.

827
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,280
We don't want to get too specific here.

828
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,580
But let's just face it, friends, you're all looking for a pill.

829
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,260
And I don't know.

830
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:50,960
I don't know.

831
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,600
It's time to hear the beautiful lilting hymns once again, not of Bucknaked, but of that mysterious doctor,

832
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,080
Dr.

833
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,520
Glass Madness.

834
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,800
I'd like to dedicate this next song to Merle Watson of Doc and Merle Watson.

835
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:16,200
I don't know if he was a subgenius, but anybody who's a world-class guitar player and gets killed in a tractor accident's gotta be subgenius.

836
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,540
Well, Bob told us we should party if we want him to come back, but he never told us nothing but a bucket full of slack.

837
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,660
We all partied till we puked, but we never got the knack.

838
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,820
We never got nothing like a bucket full of slack.

839
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,440
Well, a bucket full of slack is all you need.

840
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,840
You don't need whiskey and you don't need weed.

841
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,740
Oh, a bucket full of slack, a bucket full of slack.

842
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,160
Take you right to heaven and you'll never get home.

843
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,060
We're gonna bring you right back.

844
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,780
Well, I met a lot of doctors, most of them are quacks.

845
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,900
None of them had ever had a bucket full of slack.

846
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,220
They try to sell you old tin, it comes in a sack.

847
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,560
Doesn't get close to a bucket full of slack.

848
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,900
A bucket full of slack is all you need.

849
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,300
You don't need whiskey and you don't need weed.

850
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,120
A bucket full of slack, a bucket full of slack.

851
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Take you right to heaven and you'll never get home.

852
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,160


853
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,160


854
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,640
We never got the knack.

855
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:31,640


856
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:31,640


857
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:31,640


858
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,560
And I'll never bring you back.

859
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,300
Well, I searched so long till I was really whacked.

860
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,500
It sure ain't easy to find a bucket full of slack.

861
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,360
But when you finally found it, it's nothing that you lack.

862
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,760
Nothing in the world like a bucket full of slack.

863
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,000
Well, a bucket full of slack is all you need.

864
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,340
You don't need whiskey and you don't need weed.

865
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,120
Well, a bucket full of slack, a bucket full of slack.

866
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
Take you right to heaven and you'll never get home.

867
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,840
I'll never bring you back.

868
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,140
Take you down to Dobbs Town, you'll never come back.

869
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,500
Down in Dallas, Texas, where the bob plants grow.

870
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,380
People who know a bob, they know where to go.

871
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,100
Down in Dallas, Texas, where the bob plants grow.

872
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,380
People who know a bob, they know where to go.

873
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,680
Hello, Bob.

874
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,960
I need someone to listen to me.

875
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,400
Hello, Bob.

876
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,560
Hello, Bob.

877
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,460
It's getting dark and I can't see.

878
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,340
Hello, Bob.

879
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,200
I was hoping you might have the key.

880
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,300
It's dark and dim and I can't swim.

881
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,040
What the hell's gonna happen to me?

882
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,800
There's a good Bob and there's a bad Bob.

883
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,880
There's a happy Bob and there's a sad Bob.

884
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,700
There's a happy Bob and there's a sad Bob.

885
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,140
There's a bad Bob and there's a wild Bob.

886
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,400
There's a wrong Bob and there's a right Bob.

887
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,180
There's a wrong Bob and there's a right Bob.

888
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,180
Well, raise your hand and clap for Bob.

889
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,840
Well, raise your hand and clap for Bob.

890
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,720
And just a slash.

891
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,060
.

892
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,140
.

893
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,140


894
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,140


895
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,140


896
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,140


897
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,500
We have a defilement!

898
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,140
This is a defilement.

899
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,120
This is a room full of pigs.

900
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,700
It's a room full of pigs.

901
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,060
Well, heck, never mind.

902
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,900
We're blowing off.

903
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,840
No.

904
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,120
I can feel it.

905
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,240
I can feel it out there.

906
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,140
You're tentative.

907
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,940
You're scared.

908
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,480
You're afraid.

909
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,500
You're lost.

910
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,040
You're homesick.

911
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,640
Yeah.

912
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,440
You need a healing, don't you?

913
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,420
I can feel it.

914
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,200
Someone out there needs a healing.

915
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,400
Healing.

916
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,460
It's a woman.

917
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,800
I want a woman who wants a healing.

918
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,640
I want a woman who wants a healing.

919
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,560
Where is she?

920
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,720
Where is she?

921
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,980
Lead me to her.

922
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,100
Oh, I can feel it.

923
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,000
Rise!

924
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,900
Come to the stage.

925
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,500
Come to the stage.

926
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,040
Come on up.

927
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,780
Okay.

928
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,640
All right, what's your name?

929
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:54,780
Lori.

930
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,220
And you don't know me or any of my ministers, do you?

931
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,200
No.

932
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,460
Uh-huh.

933
00:46:59,500 --> 00:46:59,860
All right.

934
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,740
Well, what's your complaint, hon?

935
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,520
Well, I want to be a musician.

936
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,640
You want to be a musician.

937
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,520
Ain't that a shame.

938
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,080
What do you think?

939
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,240
Aww.

940
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,440
Well, wait a minute.

941
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,160
I can see a little tentativeness.

942
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,720
Why is it that you don't think you can be a musician?

943
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,800
Well, you know, I have to work too much.

944
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,560
I don't have the...

945
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,220
Oh, she doesn't have slack.

946
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,580
She has to work too much.

947
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,260
You know what?

948
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,620
I think the conspiracy may have implanted

949
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,980
a synchromater on you.

950
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,220
Oh, yes.

951
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,200
There it is, friends.

952
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,480
The mark on the beach.

953
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,800
Butt Naked now removes the young lady's watch.

954
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:41,700
Take it off!

955
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,700
He displays the watch to the audience.

956
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,560
What should I do with it?

957
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,100
What should I do with it?

958
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,800
Get away!

959
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,540
All right.

960
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,180
He places the watch down upon the golden altar.

961
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,300
All right.

962
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:58,600
All right.

963
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,620
And pulls out the sacred sledgehammer.

964
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,460
Yeah!

965
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,720
Yeah!

966
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,300
Yeah!

967
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,680
Yeah!

968
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,900
He has smashed the watch.

969
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,460
All right.

970
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:12,940
Who else?

971
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:13,800
Who else?

972
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,060
Get up there and watch for Bob.

973
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,120
Friends in Little Rock, Arkansas,

974
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,800
they keep this thing.

975
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,660
It's called the Janer device.

976
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,180
You cannot hide from God.

977
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,940
She is bigger that you.

978
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,120
HELP ME SOMEBODY!

979
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,080
SHE AIN'T GOT NO LEGS.

980
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,180
MY LEGS ARE ON FIRE.

981
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,080
SHE NEEDS SOME HELP.

982
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:40,600
SHE NEEDS SOME HELP.

983
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,520
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM GOD.

984
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,540
BECAUSE YOU ARE BIGGER THAN ALL INFINITIES.

985
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,580
BIGGER IN THE UNIVERSITY.

986
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,120
BIGGER THAN ALL REALITIES.

987
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,680
HELP ME SOMEBODY!

988
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,980
SHE Aint' GOT NO LEGS.

989
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,380
MY LEGS ARE ON FIRE.

990
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,640
YOU CAN'T HIDE YOURSELF

991
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:55,640


992
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:55,640


993
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,080
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.

994
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,180
He's got more slack than you do.

995
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,420
He smokes more prop than you do.

996
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,560
You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

997
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,260
You cannot hide from God because he's bigger than you.

998
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,680
He's bigger than all infinities.

999
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,660
He's bigger than the whole universe.

1000
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,900
Help me, somebody.

1001
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:14,900
She ain't got no legs.

1002
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,180
My legs are on fire.

1003
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,660
Make some noise.

1004
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,160
Make some noise.

1005
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,140
Praise Bob.

1006
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,280
You cannot run from your own legs.

1007
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,280
There's not a man or woman in here tonight who can run from their own legs.

1008
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,340
Because they're what you're using to run from them with.

1009
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,220
So how are you going to run from your own legs?

1010
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,620
You cannot run from your own legs.

1011
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,120
You cannot hide from this man.

1012
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1013
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,400
You cannot hide from God because he's bigger than you.

1014
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,700
He's bigger than all infinities.

1015
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,560
He's bigger than the universe.

1016
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,760
Help me, somebody.

1017
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,720
She ain't got no legs.

1018
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,620
My legs are on fire.

1019
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,360
Praise God.

1020
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,560
You cannot see your own eyes.

1021
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,240
What are you going to do?

1022
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,180
Turn them inside out?

1023
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,200
You cannot see your own eyes.

1024
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,620
You cannot run from your own legs.

1025
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,180
There's a word you're using to run away from them with.

1026
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,040
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.

1027
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,940
You cannot hide from God.

1028
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,600
He's bigger than you.

1029
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,560
He's bigger than all infinities.

1030
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,120
He's bigger than the whole universe.

1031
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,100
Praise God.

1032
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,820
Help me, somebody.

1033
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,820
She ain't got no legs.

1034
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
My legs are on fire.

1035
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,480
Praise God.

1036
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,380
You cannot wash soap.

1037
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,960
What are you going to do?

1038
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,600
Cut it in half and rub the ends together?

1039
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,640
You can't wash soap.

1040
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,600
You can't wash soap.

1041
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,980
You cannot see your own eyes.

1042
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,960
You cannot run from your own legs.

1043
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,740
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1044
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,680
You cannot hide from God because he's bigger than you.

1045
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,660
He's bigger than all realities.

1046
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,420
He's bigger than infinities.

1047
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,140
He's bigger than the universe.

1048
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,220
Help me, somebody.

1049
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,680
She ain't got no legs.

1050
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,960
My legs are on fire.

1051
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,980
Praise God.

1052
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,120
Praise God.

1053
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,420
You cannot wet water, it's already as wet as it can get.

1054
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,980
You cannot hide from your own hiding place.

1055
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,220
It's going to see you wherever you go.

1056
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,620
You cannot swallow your own throat.

1057
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,420
You cannot digest your own stomach.

1058
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,640
You cannot see your own eyes.

1059
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,160
You cannot run from your own legs.

1060
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,800
You cannot hide from this man here by the docks because he's stupider than you are.

1061
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,080
He smokes more pride than you do.

1062
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,060
You cannot hide from God, he's mirroring you.

1063
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,820
He's mirroring all reality.

1064
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,080
He's mirroring all infinity.

1065
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,940
My leg is on fire!

1066
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,340
She ain't got no legs.

1067
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,200
Praise Bob!

1068
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:44,340
Now there's some people and some of the more conservative members of the Arkansas community

1069
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,000
for some reason don't get into our Doctors for Bob performances,

1070
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,620
our subgeniuses performances we try to present.

1071
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,380
We're going to have to stop.

1072
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,140
I don't understand why.

1073
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,660
There was some kind of legal dispute.

1074
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,180
Some woman lost her legs or something.

1075
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,960
I don't know what it was about.

1076
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,540
The police officer came up to me and says,

1077
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,820
what the hell you boys think you're doing?

1078
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,680
I said, why we're just bold surrealists, sir.

1079
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,680
Bold surrealists.

1080
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,420
Bold surrealists.

1081
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,940
Son, you know how many men we got locked up in the state penitentiary

1082
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,360
who just love to claim they're nothing but bold surrealists?

1083
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,560
Now I don't know very much about anti-music.

1084
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,780
I don't know much about pop fans.

1085
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,560
I don't know much about the workplace deities.

1086
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,060
All I know is Little Rock street law.

1087
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,100
That's what this officer of the law told me.

1088
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,240
I don't know very much about art forms.

1089
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,180
All I know is Little Rock street law, boy.

1090
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,440
I don't know very much about the history of pre-Bronze age Europe.

1091
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,320
All I know is Little Rock street law.

1092
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,780
I don't know very much about Asian history.

1093
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,500
All I know is Little Rock street law.

1094
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:36,900
I don't know very much about synthesizing sugars that my cells can use from the foods I eat.

1095
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,960
All I know is Little Rock street law.

1096
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,360
Just a second.

1097
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:46,880
I don't know very much about sustaining a three-dimensional reality in physical space.

1098
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,620
All I know is Little Rock street law.

1099
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:09,680
This officer will deal with our existing

1100
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:17,700
plastics and smoke Milky Way machines.

1101
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,300
Destruction site 10.

1102
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,980
He got no legs.

1103
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,200
His legs are on fire, my God.

1104
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,920
Help me, somebody.

1105
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:30,100
There's this one guy, he would never listen to us.

1106
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,860
We tried to give him the pamphlet.

1107
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,920
He wouldn't listen to J.R. Bob.

1108
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,320
He wouldn't listen to J.R., I'm not broke or anything.

1109
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,920
He wouldn't listen to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1110
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,720
We tried to tell him about the word.

1111
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,680
That man was on his deathbed.

1112
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,820
I was still preaching to him about slack.

1113
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,480
Oh, but he was dead set on the conspiracy.

1114
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,840
And as he was fading into the afterlife,

1115
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,580
he was half here and half there.

1116
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,040
I heard him say, preachers, my legs are on fire.

1117
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,420
Well, I thought I could get away

1118
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,660
with a sauna on our wedding day.

1119
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,780
Preacher Man said, boy, better put away your song.

1120
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,660
But I said, I don't cotton.

1121
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,400
You know God's county law.

1122
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,540
But that song was stolen.

1123
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,360
At least that's what she said.

1124
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,320
So I wrapped up in asbestos from my waist up to my head.

1125
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,500
I wrapped up in asbestos that I got from Greg's.

1126
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,140
I only wish I had enough to cover up my legs.

1127
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,080
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

1128
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,840
But I ain't no liar.

1129
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,800
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1130
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,660
Got legs on fire.

1131
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,700
Well, my head's dry and cool.

1132
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,580
So's my arms and toes.

1133
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,420
My torso, even more so.

1134
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,480
But I ain't no liar.

1135
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,440
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1136
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,460
Got legs, got legs, got legs on fire.

1137
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,140
Well, I was selling heroin at that elementary school.

1138
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,940
Preacher Man said, boy, well, you know that isn't cool.

1139
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,880
The good Lord came to me and said my time was up.

1140
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,740
When I said, why, God?

1141
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,600
He said, because that horse was cut.

1142
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,880
Well, they were shooting up in the back room.

1143
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,460
Yes, you know it's true.

1144
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,800
But they were not getting off.

1145
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,360
That's why my soul is through.

1146
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,400
I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

1147
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,200
But I ain't no liar.

1148
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,040
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1149
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,020
Got legs on fire.

1150
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,040
Oh, my brain ain't in no flame.

1151
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,960
And my shoulder ain't in pain.

1152
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,100
But my knees are crying, please.

1153
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,620
But I ain't no liar.

1154
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,520
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1155
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,420
Got legs on fire.

1156
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, I was stealing cars for God.

1157
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,440
Tryin' to get a job.

1158
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,300
Tryin' to get in wealth.

1159
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,140
But when my judgment came, he said, you'll have to go to hell.

1160
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,080
It's true, I gave my son, he said, to die for all your sins.

1161
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,680
But when they dropped that little old tin, the door was bleeding.

1162
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

1163
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,860
But I ain't no liar.

1164
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,700
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1165
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,760
Got legs on fire.

1166
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,580
Oh, my head ain't on the line.

1167
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,540
And my pinky's doing fine.

1168
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,040
But my toes need a hose.

1169
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,180
But I don't break any arms.

1170
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,200
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1171
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,200
Got legs, got legs, got legs on fire.

1172
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,080
Well, I was bashing Grandma's head with a railroad tie.

1173
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,940
The good Lord came to me and said, why did you lie?

1174
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,200
When I said, what lie, God?

1175
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,800
He said, you must confess.

1176
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,300
That ain't your grandma's head at all.

1177
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,700
It's just a bloody mess.

1178
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,840
So I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

1179
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,580
But I ain't no liar.

1180
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,500
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1181
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,580
Got legs, got legs, got legs on fire.

1182
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,420
Oh, my head's drying too.

1183
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,460
So's my arms in two.

1184
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,080
But my shins have thrummed the towel in.

1185
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,080
But I ain't no liar.

1186
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,120
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1187
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,400
Got legs, got legs, got legs on fire.

1188
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:11,480
Yes, children, it is the season of the witch.

1189
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,560
It's the season of the witch and a deadly witch.

1190
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:14,560


1191
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,320
And a deadly witch is too.

1192
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,120
And the witch...

1193
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,500
That'syers have enough luck.

1194
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,160
Get comprehensible before you believe that this is your child.

1195
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,480
You are wjin, you are orphaned from a late àsition child.

1196
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,380
Here is exs годs.

1197
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:31,620
An él good lad is pure ecstasy start shinn

1198
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,580
yabash you beat yabesh down.

1199
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:32,980
TheONGIMETHISn.

1200
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:32,980


1201
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,560
So be playin real bad,That's why ye led me to me.

1202
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:38,460
I ain't no hrah Honda, changed, for nice, off the tHaOrt sucker.

1203
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,380
OZer a OKla.

1204
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,300
Not shi-n .

1205
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:44,860
Deregulation.

1206
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,060
What do we have?

1207
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:47,960
Deregulation.

1208
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,860
What do we have?

1209
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,360
Deregulation.

1210
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,620
What do we have, children?

1211
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,080
Deregulation.

1212
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,620
Now, children, I don't have to tell any of you who have flown in an airplane recently

1213
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,800
just what a travesty of a mockery of a sham deregulation is.

1214
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,920
Why, children, if that plane isn't full enough, they'll just cancel the son of a bitch

1215
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,940
and you can whistle for your money and your schedule.

1216
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:18,040
But, children, when deregulation comes along, the airlines quit serving the little guy.

1217
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:23,540
The only place you can find an airline seat is New York to San Francisco, if you will,

1218
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,200
Los Angeles to Chicago.

1219
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,540
But, children, what if you want to fly from Little Rock to Pine Bluffs?

1220
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,840
You're screwed, children, because the little carriers have been driven out of business.

1221
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,860
You're screwed.

1222
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,920
But, children, again.

1223
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,720
In case you wonder where I'm going with this.

1224
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,000
Are you wondering, children?

1225
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,940
Are you wondering where I'm going?

1226
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,840
Are you wondering where I'm going with this, children?

1227
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,400
Well, I'm going to tell you where I'm going with this, children.

1228
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,500
There's one arena of human endeavor that has always been deregulated.

1229
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,280
And that area of endeavor is religion.

1230
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,440
And since it's never been deregulated, children,

1231
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,260
the major carriers have sprung up and dominated the numbers in the marketplace.

1232
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:18,760
Well, children, how can you compete with your Christianity, your Judaism, your Muhammadism,

1233
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,960
your Hinduism, and your Buddhism?

1234
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,780
Well, children, you can become a diabolicist if that's what you like.

1235
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,620
You can become a snake handler.

1236
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,080
But let's face it, children, that's a mighty unsatisfactory way to do your spiritual business.

1237
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,840
Yes, children, there's a direct line.

1238
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,320
There's a direct line from you to God and your Christianity, your Judaism, your Muhammadism,

1239
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,620
your Buddhism, and your Hinduism.

1240
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:50,180
But children, there's only one place where there's a direct line between you and Bob.

1241
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,020
Children, the church of the subgenius is the small carrier.

1242
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,520
It's the small religious carrier.

1243
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,700
It's the small religious carrier devoted to its clientele.

1244
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,420
You might say, children, that's not entirely unlike Eastern Airlines, the church of the

1245
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,320
subgenius is owned and operated by its employees.

1246
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:18,300
But children, like all of these carriers, like all of your carriers, your big carriers

1247
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:23,380
and your small carriers, your Bahama Airlines and your United, we have one thing in common

1248
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:23,920
with them.

1249
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,400
We operate on a profit basis.

1250
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,320
Now, children, people have been coming around to me lately and they've been saying, you

1251
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,700
know, I thought the church was dead.

1252
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,240
Thank you very much.

1253
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,820
I thought the church was dead, children.

1254
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,320
I haven't heard anything from the church.

1255
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,800
But I ask you, children, what does the church hide from you?

1256
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:45,900
And you?

1257
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:46,960
And you?

1258
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,880
And you?

1259
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,060
And you?

1260
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:49,980
And you?

1261
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:50,780
And you?

1262
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,740
And you?

1263
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:56,240
Children, how many of you have been typing onto Bob, that which is Bob's?

1264
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,960
How many of you have kept up your pledge to give 10% of your worldly goods to the church

1265
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,740

1266
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,120

1267
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,100
How many of you have bought the t-shirts?

1268
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,400
How many of you have bought the t-shirts?

1269
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,480

1270
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,840
Does the church of the subgenius run on air?

1271
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,100
