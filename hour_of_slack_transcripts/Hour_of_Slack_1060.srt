2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,300
This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is coincidental.

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,340
Seems like money.

4
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,620
Legendary nuts and money.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,620
Profit big money.

Call 13013.

You wouldn't listen?

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,120
Police Headquarters.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,940
Officer.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,680
Officer.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,080
Arrest this man.

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,100
Officer.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,300
Arrest this man.

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,540
And be careful.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,800
Be careful. He's got a subgenius.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,120
Power of smart.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
This man. This man. This man.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Police Headquarters. Officer.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,160
How does Slate contributor Daniel kill you?

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,680
Daniel can kill you by

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,980
inducing people into your life.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
He's a man in California to damage the brain,

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,900
the kidneys, and other organs.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,180
Contributor Daniel can kill you in other ways too.

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,220
For example,

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,220
email problems.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,380
Many factors increase your risk of succumbing to the elderly

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,800
Many factors increase your risk of succumbing to the elderly

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
because their circulatory systems go somewhere cooler

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,620
or get a glass of sweaty tissue

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,580
to cool their very slow, small, obese brains.

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:51,900


38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,160
And mentally ill obese people

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,600
can't lie on top of their fatty tissue.

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,880
And mentally ill elderly children

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,340
take drugs and die from an overdose

42
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,880
on a hot sweaty internal organ.

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,240
If you have a question about hot stuff pumping,

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:06,900
If you have a question about hot stuff pumping,

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,260
you're in serious danger.

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,460
Mama.

47
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,500
Mama.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,040


49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,060
I want some milk.

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,260
I want some milk.

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
I want some milk.

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,920
I want some milk.

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:34,940
I want some milk.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
I want some milk.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:36,680


56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,600
Yes, dear friends,

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,060
Yes, dear friends,

58
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,500
we're in the studio tonight.

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,480
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,980
and yours very truly,

61
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,560
Reverend Ivan Stang.

62
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,580
That's a false dear.

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,260
You are here in the most false fashion imaginable.

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,380
You are here in the most false fashion imaginable.

65
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,500
You hardly exist.

66
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,440
You are a misfit.

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,440


68
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,500
big illusions.

69
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,020
Your shirt is like a hallucination.

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,780
Your head is a mirage.

71
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,460
At least you didn't stay stuck on my pants.

72
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm really tired of that.

73
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
I've been stuck on your pants plenty of times

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,900
and you know it.

75
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,140
I've tried to forget it, friends.

76
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,500
It's an horrible thing to think of.

77
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,220
We're going back to X-Day

78
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,040
in the background of the show, here.

79
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,140
The music in the background is

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,100
In this case I think it's

81
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,040
Well, he's a roadie for the amino acids jamming.

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,740
We'll also be hearing some jamming.

83
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,680
He's an angry man, isn't he, Angry Larry?

84
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,680
Only on stage.

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,680
You know, a lot of people have said, Reverend Angry Larry, you just don't seem all that angry to tell the truth.

86
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,500
And he goes, I work it out on stage.

87
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, also, the scowl is a little bit from all the weird amputated teeth and gum parts after that most recent experiment.

88
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,620
Well, they're one of those bands.

89
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,880
It gives the illusion of a scowl, you know.

90
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,300
They're an action band, the amino acids.

91
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,460
They like to tear things up, like their faces, their hands, and so forth.

92
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,720
Highly sexed and strangely appurtenanced.

93
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:16,260
Some people interpret that as low self-esteem, but I think what it really is is low audience esteem.

94
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Yep, that's it.

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,860
A disdain for those who might look upon them with favor.

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,720
Speaking of terrible bands, also the Mondo Di Tardo.

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,440
The Tardos show up at some point.

98
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,840
The Tardos Mondo Band is on there?

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,200
Yeah, the Tardos Mondo Band.

100
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
Well, the jamming Tardos Mondo Band.

101
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,340
Oh, yes.

102
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,360
Listen.

103
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,840
See how disorganized they are?

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, that's them.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,500
Pick a key for us to play in.

106
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,300
Yeah.

107
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,540
All right, thank you very much.

108
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,840
Good night.

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,420
M.

110
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,000
M.

111
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Okay, you know what?

112
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,300
This is M.

113
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,160
Fresh out of M, man.

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,840
M.

115
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,780
The key of M.

116
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Three keys.

117
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,000
E, F, G.

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,720
A, B.

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,000
C.

120
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,660
E, F, G.

121
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,440
They wouldn't do Q.

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,880
All right, we can do something in E, F, G, I suppose.

123
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,820
The audience gets to compose the jam.

124
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,260
Francis Scott key.

125
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,560
Okay.

126
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,900
Francis Scott key.

127
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,160
Yeah.

128
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,900
I said post-mellitus key.

129
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,280
We don't do any door keys, garage keys.

130
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,120
Door key is right.

131
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,040
Yes.

132
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,140
They got lots of door keys.

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,980
Yes.

134
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,840
It's taking a long time to get to the key.

135
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,280
It's the key of Q.

136
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,260
Yeah.

137
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,140
That's it.

138
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,240
9X Day, friends.

139
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,060
When you go to a subgenius concert, it's like the visible show.

140
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,720
It's clockwork stuff.

141
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,980
You know, I mean, it's very, very highly professional, wouldn't you say?

142
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,040
Well.

143
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,000
I mean, it is art.

144
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,740
You know, a lot of people don't understand what's really so funny about this, you know.

145
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,220
Well, this is just sort of a boogie, isn't it?

146
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,640
I don't know.

147
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,420
I just did what I was told at that part because I'd lost control of my bowels and bladder,

148
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,440
so I was just...

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,620
They were just leading me around with my embedded tattoo thing that can read all the signals

150
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,500
and write them back out.

151
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,540
So you've kept up with the kids and gotten one of those inbred tattoos because I, you

152
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,660
know, I'm afraid to do that.

153
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
I'm afraid of the tattoo needle.

154
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:21,100
It's not that I look down on trendy things that date you to a certain year or tie you

155
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,020
to a certain...

156
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,120
They'll date you soon, and you know how?

157
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,940
Is that what you do to get a date?

158
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,280
You get a tattoo and then you get dates?

159
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,460
That's how you remove a fig from your eyes, senor.

160
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,100
This is going to be bad news in the future when people discover you with subgenius tattoos.

161
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,700
Can you imagine the concentration camp or the lack of focus farm you'll be heading for?

162
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,980
I've actually been imagining the lampshades that I could collect.

163
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,280
Well, they're fun to wear on your head, but not on someone else's.

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,280
Oh.

165
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,300
I've made that point also, you know, but...

166
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,960
My attitude towards tattoos is someday somebody's going to go, wow, you must have been really

167
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,060
cool in the 90s.

168
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,360
No, they're going to look in your brain with those tattoos, and they'll know that you're

169
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
a member of a criminal religion.

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,380
The Church of the Subgenius will be declared criminal in probably 2037 or one of those.

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:23,660
Oh, speaking of 2037, we have a tape, friends, from the year of 2136, courtesy of Mr. Sister,

172
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,940
the famous subgenius.

173
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,420
Also, Mr. Sister.

174
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,680
I thought it was IDMRSR.

175
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Mr. Sister.

176
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,580
ID Mr. Sister.

177
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,000
I doctor Mr. Sister.

178
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,580
I thought it was Idiocratic Demon.

179
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,540
You know him.

180
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,280
He fixed your computer one time.

181
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Yeah, he fixed it.

182
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,420
Good.

183
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,340
No, yeah, he did.

184
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,160
He did fix it well.

185
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,580
He made sweet, sweet love to your computer.

186
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,600
He did make sweet, sweet love to my computer.

187
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,820
And my computer remembers that, too, in a very, yeah.

188
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:54,580
Anyway, Mr. Sister, in the process of doing some time control experiments, which normally

189
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,340
we don't expect.

190
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,920
We don't expect this to work.

191
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:05,860
What should he, what to his reddening eyes should appear but this weird kind of tape

192
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,820
that he was able to run through his computer and extract the noise from it.

193
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,740
Now, I'm going to try to play this.

194
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:22,980
It purports to be an X-mas letter from the year of 2136.

195
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,980
Isn't there a crosstalk?

196
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,700
There's a crosstalk of between the years between, I think you said earlier, there might

197
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,600
be a little bit of crosstalk from like, you know, 2072.

198
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,660
No, this thing's pretty, no, he got rid of that.

199
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,700
That was earlier.

200
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,120
This is a clean one?

201
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,520
This is the cleaned up one, yeah.

202
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,960
So we have to be quiet.

203
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,700
We have to be quiet because it's, there's some details in here.

204
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:49,420
You've got, it's pretty, I'm not looking forward to new Iraq in the year 2136.

205
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,740
Anyway, we'll see what happens.

206
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,060
Happy holidays from the Johnson family.

207
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,480
Hope you had as good a 2136 as we did.

208
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,940
Our X-mas will be really joyful because you remember our three-year-old son, Johnny,

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,660
who drowned in the toilet in April?

210
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,320
Well, his clone will be hatched and matured right around December 25th.

211
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,640
So we'll be celebrating as a complete family once again.

212
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,100
My dear husband, Bob, is just getting over a bad winter cancer.

213
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,260
I don't know what it is, maybe the weather around here, but this is the third time he's

214
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,040
sprouted a disease.

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
He's got a massive tumor in his liver this year.

216
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,760
We went down to Walgreens and bought another bottle of Nye Cure, the nighttime cancer cure.

217
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,720
They have a new fresh citrus flavor, which tastes really good.

218
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,440
Maybe one day they'll improve on it because he's having a really uncomfortable week until

219
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,140
it kicks in.

220
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,900
Seems in this modern time, they should have something that gets rid of the cancer in under

221
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,380
a week.

222
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,860
This year, I splurged on myself and got one of those little sports hearts.

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,680
I so enjoy the smooth purr.

224
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,080
As it revs up to 200 beats per minute.

225
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,040
When my original heart failed at first, I got one of the standard replacements, but for

226
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,940
just a little more.

227
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,260
Adidas was having a special sale.

228
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,040
So I said, you only live 150 years.

229
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,400
Why not enjoy life in the fast lane?

230
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,260
We all had a two week vacation in August, which was really great.

231
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,840
We took the Jamaica pills this time.

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,120
Me and Bob and our daughter Arlene.

233
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,020
Arlene was so sad that Johnny wasn't developed enough to come along this year.

234
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,020


235
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,940
year. Arlene is studying hard because she wants to become an abortionist and open up a little shop

236
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,820
on Main Street one day. That's becoming quite a big business now that we've got Gates AIDS Off

237
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,480
added to our drinking water. I remember from history, some of the pioneers around here 200

238
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,920
years ago first started adding fluorides to prevent tooth decay. So this was a really good

239
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,800
idea along the same lines. Arlene didn't want to take the other program in junior high, covert

240
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,200
explosive detection. Too much emphasis on science and mathematics and all that dull stuff for her.

241
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,580
The weather here in Iraq outside the containment dome is pretty hot and dusty. When they have the

242
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,900
visual shields down for maintenance, we can watch the outsiders set themselves off. Once in a while,

243
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,680
one of them will sneak in and blow something up inside here. Our

244
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,900
neighbors are trying to get the outside of the containment dome to close down. They're

245
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,420
making a mess. The neighbors' clones will be ready soon, and the house next door is just about

246
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,220
rebuilt. But we had to endure another two weeks in disorder until all the stuff got fixed.

247
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,420
Right after Xmas, I hate to bring it up, but as you know, that's tax season. We have great news.

248
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,480
We've been assigned 16 more grandchildren. We were given an estimate of their future income,

249
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:45,260
which looks pretty handsome. We just have to commit that to Uncle Wally like all good citizens.

250
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,880
The good news is that we're going to be able to make a lot of money. We're going to be able to

251
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:55,620
keep a few percent of their income after they reach 37 years old. I'm sure glad President Walton

252
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,840
defeated that other guy, Bechtel, and we're finally to the point where we only have to

253
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,860
commit two generations' future income to taxes. But enough said. Never discuss religion and

254
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:12,240
politics with friends. Well, I could go on, but Grandma Johnson's fuel cells need refilling,

255
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,800
and I have to rush off to the Harvest Center for egg extraction.

256
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,580
And pretty soon, the prayer bells will be going off at the Wall Temple. Don't want to be late for

257
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,580
mid-afternoon prayer time. It's been a great year around the Johnson household. Merry Xmas and happy

258
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:38,440
2137. Bob, Melissa, Arlene, and Johnny Johnson, number two, your good friends from New Rumsfeld,

259
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:38,940
Iraq.

260
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:57,400
President's on the phone, talking to his mom and dad, saying, should I turn over evidence, or be a good old stone woman?

261
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:10,560
President's on TV, having a White House tea. He's talking liberty, but you and I agree.

262
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,180
This is a democratic country where they don't count guns.

263
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,960
And this is the crime. An offshore boat. And this is the point. That's no surprise.

264
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,300
The president of us, but you're the soldiers, mother .

265
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,700
There's a lot of treatment.

266
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,900
So you too, your repo, backed up as aqueer .

267
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:09,900


268
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,180
We dwell on these days.

269
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,500
And so, in doing so, peace .

270
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,780
You look like Jesus with his

271
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:15,780


272
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:15,780


273
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,320
Thank you.

274
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,840
The president's in your head.

275
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:45,080
The president's in your head.

276
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:06,220
The president's in your head.

277
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:27,340
The president's in your head.

278
00:16:49,540 --> 00:17:12,000
The president's in your head.

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,260
The president's in your head.

280
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,900
The president's in your head.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,500
The president's in your head.

282
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:56,720
The president's in your head.

283
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:44,980
The president's in your head.

284
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,760
The president's in your head.

285
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:41,780
The president's in your head.

286
00:20:48,620 --> 00:21:15,760
The president's in your head.

287
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:38,820
The president's in your head.

288
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:12,700
The president's in your head.

289
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:25,120
The president's in your head.

290
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,560
The president's in your head.

291
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,720
The president's in your head.

292
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,220
The president's in your head.

293
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,840
The president's in your head.

294
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,040
The president's in your head.

295
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,360
The president's in your head.

296
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,780
The president's in your head.

297
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,100
then allowing the sofa to fall off with him on it,

298
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,400
and then him to slowly, to the point of wrinking himself to death,

299
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,500
extrude the vodka from the bottle and then set the couch on fire as,

300
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,800
what was the name of the art brigade?

301
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,500
That was the Austin Art Brigade, right?

302
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,420
Well, they took it to Burning Man.

303
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,020
That was Bob's idea.

304
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,480
Bob taught him all that stuff.

305
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,320
They were a bad influence on each other, Bob and Vat.

306
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,240
Well, anything under Bob is sub-genius, you know?

307
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,600
I mean, there's not much more you can say about genius.

308
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,880
No, actually, anything under Bob would probably die

309
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,380
because its nervous system wouldn't function at all.

310
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
It would forget to breathe.

311
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,920
Sub-genius, you know, doesn't have anything to do with intelligence.

312
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:27,640
Wow.

313
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,480
That should be fairly obvious.

314
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,920
Of the medulla.

315
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,060
But with sense, common sense, sense of humor, dollars and cents,

316
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,440
as we've said 18 million times before.

317
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,840
Well, maybe not.

318
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,840
That's the cerebral stationary plane, right?

319
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,360
Yeah.

320
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,780
Okay.

321
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,100
So, there are correspondences everywhere, my friends.

322
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,360
As above, so sideways.

323
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,700
And that is why the chemtrails above correspond to the crop circles below

324
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,940
and to the superhighways of the supersonic Nazi hell creatures

325
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,740
deep, deep, deep, deep, deep below beneath the hollow earth

326
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,880
discovered by Richard Shaver.

327
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,720
Who's Richard Shaver? I'm sorry.

328
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,480
He was a guy who discovered, that's the real name of the fellow,

329
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,980
who discovered the hollow earth.

330
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,160
Oh, the guy, Little Shaver, they called him?

331
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,020
No.

332
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,260
He's the uncle of DJ Shaver,

333
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,840
who will be featured on probably next week's Hour of Slack.

334
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,100
He's a popular sub-genius.

335
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,820
Actually, he's not so much a DJ as an actual performer.

336
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,340
Like one of the many...

337
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,320
He sings louder than the people are singing on the records he plays.

338
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,280
Oh, but how did, so that's his job?

339
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,260
That's his profession? Is he a loud singer?

340
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,500
No, he only gets to do that at X-Day.

341
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,640
The rest of the time, he has to play corny music at weddings.

342
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,500
Oh, he's a wedding DJ.

343
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,300
That's what DJ usually means, I think.

344
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,400
And he discovered these correspondences.

345
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Why, in such a strange, out-of-focus place, would you discover anything?

346
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,520
Well, I forget where Richard Shaver was, I guess.

347
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,120
You know, well, you go down deep enough,

348
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,820
either in a cave or in your own mind,

349
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,580
and you will meet the supersonic Nazi.

350
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:14,580


351
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:14,580


352
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,140
Nazi hell creatures.

353
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,660
Either from the hollow earth or the hollow head, baby.

354
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,640
No, you know what I'm talking about, listener.

355
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Little miss, I know you're listening to me, honey.

356
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,560
She's been suffering a long time, too.

357
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,400
They've got the grooves going on the top of her forehead now.

358
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,040
You know, about the time when her skull flap is removed

359
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,880
and they take the actual implant out,

360
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,260
the Church of the Subgenius will be outlawed.

361
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,880
Those little numbers, those little transporter numbers

362
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,440
that are inscribed into your skull,

363
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,840
the flap and stuff, they'll be able to read those.

364
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,780
But that won't stop us.

365
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,980
And say, you're going to jail for thinking of Bob.

366
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,940
But you see, when the implant comes out,

367
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,920
the Church of the Subgenius fills in the blank hole.

368
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,480
Sure, you may be in prison.

369
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,820
You may be in Camp X-Ray.

370
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,920
Or you may be on that drug called Camp X-Ray,

371
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,680
thinking you're in Camp X-Ray.

372
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,540
It's cheaper for them to just give you the pill.

373
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,620
Friends, you don't know.

374
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,860
You think you know.

375
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,260
But I know one thing.

376
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,500
You don't know.

377
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm not going to tell you what it is,

378
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,860
but I know that.

379
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,260
And he said, that Bob said,

380
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,300
to tell you, it's going to be a bummer, man.

381
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,860
I don't want my skull flap removed.

382
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,820
I don't think it's necessary.

383
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,860
Oh, they all say that.

384
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,400
Sure, you know, initially.

385
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,640
But before the hour's out,

386
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,600
they've all signed the contract.

387
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,480
Every last one of them.

388
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,080
That's right.

389
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,840
No, no, no.

390
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,140
You have to put your name in there.

391
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,780
Sure, there's always some joker going,

392
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,900
don't do it, man.

393
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,140
Bob's just part of the conspiracy.

394
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,900
You're being sucked in.

395
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,580
It's a cult.

396
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,700
It's worse than a cult.

397
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,380
It's an anti-cult cult as a front.

398
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,140
But it's really a cult cult disguised as an anti-cult cult.

399
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,980
Would you care for some coffee now?

400
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,020
Just to relax in the lounge until your turn comes by.

401
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,300
You've been trapped.

402
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,680
Trapped in a con-infectionary your whole life.

403
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,080
Just soaking up the con-infections.

404
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,060
But yet you think it's so sweet and sugary.

405
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,060
Those sugary lies dripping down the inside of your ears,

406
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,500
down into your skull pan.

407
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,820
Oh, yeah.

408
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,720
Oh, yeah.

409
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,780
And you feel the tickling triacral.

410
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,720
You think, oh, that's just so, so,

411
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,380
it's like candy inside my brain.

412
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,900
Sure.

413
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,080
You'll suck on that conspiracy teat forever.

414
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,660
Ever.

415
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,980
And they call me a kook.

416
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,080
They call me a kook.

417
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,800
It's a cold teat.

418
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
It's a cold teat.

419
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,680
My God.

420
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,060
No wonder you look the way you look and smile the way you smile.

421
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,100
You've been shoving a convex teat in your eye.

422
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,540
You should be shoving the church of the subgenius.

423
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,820
I thought those were my glasses.

424
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,120
The church of the subgenius in your eyes.

425
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,740
I'm the man who thought his false teeth was his glasses.

426
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,680
Praise Bob.

427
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,040
I thought they were my.

428
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,020
Transmitter and my personal salvation.

429
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,180
Salvation.

430
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,300
Well, I'm starting to dry out and I'm losing my salivation.

431
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,040
So let's.

432
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm getting sleepy.

433
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,480
Play some.

434
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,440
Let's go back.

435
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
If friends.

436
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,740
Time control.

437
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,140
Indeed.

438
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,780
To.

439
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,660
Well, actually, we're not going back that far.

440
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,280
Just last week's binary slack, I think.

441
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:41,500
And the very first minute here is by Norell Preff of Norell Preff dot com.

442
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,040
But then.

443
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,120
That.

444
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,560
Name reminds me of an excreted.

445
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,540
We go to Lee Murray.

446
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,220
Now, what?

447
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,440
Hmm.

448
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,420
Preff is a word for an excreted inflation in foreign countries.

449
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:50,820
It is.

450
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,580
Well, I'll be like a booboo.

451
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,300
Strangely evolved.

452
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,880
Maybe distant planet.

453
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,700
Foreign countries.

454
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,760
But a press like.

455
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,840
Like, honey, would you put some of that alcohol on my Preff?

456
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,860
Well, there's a pair of two and prats and proof.

457
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,880
And there's piff and pan.

458
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,540
There's Preff.

459
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,040
Really?

460
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,480
It's.

461
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah.

462
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,180
Well, that's some Italian thing that, you know, I think it might be Norwegian or oblate.

463
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,500
Perhaps one of the simian clashes that we can't communicate with yet.

464
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,700
But I know it's real.

465
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,920
I know it's real.

466
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,360
Yeah.

467
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,960
I feel it's real.

468
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,500
Okay.

469
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:22,880
Here goes.

470
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,400
It's seriously impressive.

471
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,020
Wow.

472
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,380
Wow.

473
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:25,660
Wow.

474
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,260
Wow.

475
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:27,800
Wow.

476
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,940
Wow.

477
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,160
Wow.

478
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,160


479
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,020
Wow.

480
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,980
Wow.

481
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,020
Wow.

482
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,580
Wow.

483
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:33,580


484
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,660
Wow.

485
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,660


486
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,660


487
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,660


488
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,660


489
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,060
Wow.

490
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,720
Wow.

491
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,000
Wow.

492
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,780
Wow.

493
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:41,780


494
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:41,780


495
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:41,780


496
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:41,780


497
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,640
Wow.

498
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,680
Wow.

499
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,080
Wow.

500
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,820
Fabulous.

501
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,220
Well, now you can tell when you have to trust one of the answers.

502
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,120
There's a movie.

503
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,120


504
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,220

I wonder what it's like to walk around in a total blackout.

511
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,340
I never left home.

512
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,680
Bob, you've always wanted to go on a mission.

513
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,400
Why don't you go on this one?

514
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,400
Do you want to send Bob to fight the Germans?

515
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,060
No kidding, Bob.

516
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,900
If you know anything about radio, I'd be glad to let you take my place.

517
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,520
Pretty rugged, Bob.

518
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,580
We're doing all right.

519
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,560
Now here's a special program note.

520
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,580
It's Farts for Doe Show.

521
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,460
Yep, set your sights for A1 Entertainment with Farts for Doe coming up next on this...

522
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,400
So genius.

523
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,380
Power of Farts.

524
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,420
Farts for Doe.

525
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,640
It is now 28 minutes before the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.

526
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,040
Time to respond to your letters.

527
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,420
UFOs, kidnappings, and psychologists...

528
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
Her name was Laura.

529
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,320
What's her name? Maybe I know her.

530
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,860
Ask and he shall beep.

531
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,660
These words end with a leg.

532
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,660
Ready, go, go.

533
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,120
Uh...

534
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,100
Gee, go.

535
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,660
He slapped me and made me take the rattle back.

536
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,700
Her husband's sex has become more bizarre.

537
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,200
Once he started selling those sex toys.

538
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,400
You know, for Lauren...

539
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,500
Anytime it was really great.

540
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,760
Nice.

541
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,600
Um...

542
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,920
Did your husband's become more bizarre?

543
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,860
Yeah.

544
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,360
He would wear the top half of Julia.

545
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,360
He called it erotic art.

546
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,200
Yeah, he sure did.

547
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
Come on.

548
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,200
What happened then?

549
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,640
Strip poker.

550
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,540
Barge swing.

551
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,600
He's a sex runner.

552
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,840
Maniac.

553
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,960
Get it now with no credit hassles.

554
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,320
You and Alex finished each other off in the bedroom.

555
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,000
The no long-term obligation.

556
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:37,860
Weep.

557
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,220
Sunday.

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,660
That's right.

559
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm missing and killed a fifth earlier this month.

560
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,960
Ten inches of Iraqi civilians dropped on Houston today.

561
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,340
A group linked to Al-Qaeda in Iraq says it is kidding.

562
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,020
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the same group says the U.S. military says the White House says PR News isn't over yet.

563
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,520
On Wall Street, 345678.

564
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,860
The Supreme Court has refused to say this is PR.

565
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,400
The justices say...

566
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:08,640
Pay plans.

567
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,140

PRs.

587
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,140
For the first time in more than 20 years, whales have won a vote calling for resumption of PR News in Washington.

588
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,320
Ladies, I'd like to tell you about golden kitchen fats.

589

Shave with used kitchen fat.

594
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,340
Spread this rich, fluffy fat over your skin.

595
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,980
Then get going with your razor.

596
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,940
No drying out or quitting halfway with used fat.

597
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,660
No aftertaste.

598
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,620
No aftertaste.

599
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,660
No unpleasant aftertaste.

600
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
No unpleasant aftertaste.

601
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,540
That's right.

602
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,140
That's right.

603
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,680
That's right.

604
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:55,800

Used.

609

Get a jar of nourishing paste from your grocer and enjoy tasty paste right in your own kitchen

654
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:30,880
The vicious dog King ran ahead of the sled cutting tracks in the snow

Huskies hey there sergeant. Oh, oh you have and justice ruled triumphant

00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,300
Beat me to a pulpit. I'm praying

664
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,320
for some pain

665
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,160
I ain't got religion. I got a damaged brain

666
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,880
If I had a dollar for every licking that I took

667
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,100
I'd buy the pulpit that he gave

668
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,980
And buy the dirty pulpit

669
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,880

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,920
What what?

680
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,660
What what what what?

681
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
I think it's a jam

682
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,740
Yeah I think it's a jam and there's a Dave and a Princess Wee and a Reverend Angry Larry and a Reverend Phil

683
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,400
I think Reverend Phil was on drums by that point

684
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,440
This is a groovy jam man

685
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,620
All that stuff we just heard was uh

686
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Well we heard the beat me to a pulpit by the loaming

687
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,040
What was that bull girl

688
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,660
Popular bull girl Dave Fowler

689
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,320
Loathsome cow pie Dave Fowler

690
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,800
Loathsome cow pie Dave Fowler

691
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,780
The popular loathsome popular bull girl?

692
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah uh popular bull girl Dave Fowler and uh the Stardos or something like that

693
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,580
I love her name

694
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,520
I love her hairy armpits too

695
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,640
She's been braided by a tired champi-

696
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,200
No chim-

697
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,060
Her armpits were braided by a tired chimpanzee

698
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,240
I thought at least I would say it

699
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,220
Those chimpanzees go through hell for us

700
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,500
Think think of it

701
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,420
Think of all simians do for us and we can't re-reverse to our yeti nature

702
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,620
No matter how hard we try how long we try and meditate or whatever we try to do

703
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,460
We can engineer our social consciousness

704
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,980
We can refabric our genetic engineering badges

705
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,300
We can do practically everything but we can't get back to the original source

706
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,940
From which we flood from which we come

707
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
It's criminal the way humans treat us

708
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,320
It's more than criminal it's

709
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,380
It's very sad at least in my own personal case

710
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,840
Being experimented on so much

711
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:50,620
I was gonna ask you did they uh did they strap you into the centrifuge and like see how you'd undergo jeef stresses and everything?

712
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,260
No these these lacerations covering my body are from bowling night

713
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,780
No of course they did and of course it was awful

714
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,620
Look at the rest of the stuff they've done

715
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,060
Look at my hands it looks like a claw now

716
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,740
Yeah yeah

717
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,300
It looks like a bird like you know sci-fi looking bird claw thing man

718
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:15,220
That was where I yeah they uh my ankles are all messed up where they put the the uh needles to test to keep track of my blood pressure and everything

719
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,740
Yeah right

720
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,440
And then they and they had the the spot did you get the shocks in your feet?

721
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,400
The weird bag?

722
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,860
No the shocks like whenever you push the wrong switches you get the shocks

723
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,460
Oh of course I thought that was yeah

724
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,000
And if you push the right switches you got the pill

725
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,180
I didn't push any right switches

726
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,880
The banana flavored candy was what it was it wasn't really a pill

727
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,380
No banana flavored candy for me it was all

728
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,480
It felt like a pill because they'd quit giving you the shocks if you pushed the right switch

729
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,520
But if you were totally uncooperative they applied the shock machine to different parts more tender parts of your body

730
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:52,520
And then they'd start moving it into your into different parts of your nervous system that make you feel funny things not just pain

731
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,880
Man I hated elementary school

732
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh yeah

733
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,560
I can't believe the stuff those teachers would do

734
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,260
I can't believe the way humans treat us

735
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,360
And speaking of like us being dominant while I don't think you are

736
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,880
I think we're speaking of it or maybe nobody really was but our domination by these so-called lizard people

737
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,240
Do they really exist? I don't think so

738
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,340
I think it's just something wrong in human nature I think they're just people that just shouldn't continue breathing

739
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,700
I'm sorry

740
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,880
Dave I don't blame you for being upset I think we're all upset

741
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,960
There will be a time when we're done

742
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,560
Everyone in this country with our within our range of IQ

743
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,260
Where's that?

744
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,720
Well from the nipples to the lap shall we say

745
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,520
The nipples to the lap area

746
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,780
Those with that other IQs focused there

747
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,580
I mean

748
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,200
We're all disturbed we're all uncomfortable with what has happened

749
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,080
But there's little we can do is there?

750
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:05,340
There's nothing we can do they will just continue and we can but watch and hope that they will continue

751
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,340


752
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,060
I hope they don't drag us too far along with them

753
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,860
But watching is fine with me I can do that for many years probably even when I'm in feeble

754
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:18,620
I'd so much rather watch bugs than watch elmers you know what I mean?

755
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:18,940
Yeah

756
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:25,460
I mean I'd rather sit in the dirt and watch insects than have to sit in the mall and watch the others shop

757
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,400
Well if you can sit in the mall

758
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,200
It's not that I'm jealous of the others it is that I just don't like it's like being a vampire in church

759
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,320
But if you consider me a vampire I'm not a vampire

760
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,600
If you sit in the mall and watch those people in the mall as if you were watching bugs in a vampire church

761
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,140
Then huh huh then I don't know what happens then

762
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,800
Probably same thing

763
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:02,720
Now do you think these people were probably harmed early in childhood like maybe their minds were re-connected rewired maybe

764
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,300
Well on the boxes they come in it says they were not harmed

765
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,200
In production but you know and I know from having been there that it hurts a lot

766
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,740
Yeah it's a different marketing group entirely yeah

767
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:21,380
And we all carry maps made of scars scars that they form little maps all over our body but there are maps to nowhere

768
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,200
They are maps to pain

769
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,000
There's no where's the map to slack

770
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,820
Where is the slack

771
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,840
If only we had such a fever

772
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,800
Perhaps somewhere on a mammoth

773
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,940
Deeply sheltered house

774
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,380
In cow skin

775
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,840
Or in parchment somewhere

776
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,240
Opening shut-off

777
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,800
In hieroglyphs

778
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,600
Where's the road map to slack

779
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:52,160
Well you provide that sir don't you Dr. and Reverend Eileman Stang of the church

780
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,120
No as a matter of fact we don't provide a road map to slack you have to find slack yourself

781
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:04,620
We could direct you to a type of false slack that we might find to be real slack

782
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,620
But for you it would be false slack because it was our slack

783
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,720
You could imitate us but that wouldn't give you slack

784
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,680
In fact it would cause people to mock you and drive you out of your village

785
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,500
Hence cause anti-slack and great suffering for you

786
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,260
We witches have had a rough road to hoe you know what I mean

787
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,860
Being the witches of Ohio having to having to

788
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,180
The witch nuts

789
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,300
The broomstick thing is not that comfortable

790
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,220
Okay

791
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,640
It doesn't feel good up in there

792
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,740
Oh yeah you can fly but so to speak

793
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,440
But it's all in your head essentially it's headology

794
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,800
Of course it's headology

795
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,020
Try growing a spare head out of your hip socket

796
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,700
With one of those little pointy hats and a pointy nose

797
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,180
Oh sure it's difficult now but wait until the year 2136 Dave

798
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,840
You'll have to you'll have to that's the only place you'll be they'll have

799
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:11,080
Be able to grow the cultures from to regrow you after they cut you up and use you for other little Daves and Daveettes and Daveenas

800
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,600
But we need more eggs

801
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,320
The whole idea of

802
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,360
We are running out of eggs

803
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:22,780
The idea that you can be cloned from a drop of blood or some hair or a bone is that's superstitious nonsense

804
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:31,820
However they need big chunks but they can make for instance ten clones of you by cutting you into two pieces

805
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,260
Ten pieces and each of those pieces after the injections of course

806
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,280
Then there's the guys who like cut you up and then give the injection to the pieces great

807
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,620
So you end up with ten hands ten lonesome cowboy Dave forearms you know ten cowboy Dave left legs

808
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:54,180
If you don't give the Dave the injection first the clones are all going to be just that part

809
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:00,140
And that's what your life is like if you don't have Bob in your life how can you be just an eye

810
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,240
Why do you doubt it?

811
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,120
How can you be just a nose?

812
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,240
You can't see anything

813
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,500
But that's what it's like if you don't have Bob in your life

814
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
You're just a part of one sense without the other senses

815
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,980
That's an unlimited number of cells from one bell saying I mean one cell bank

816
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,360
A one cell creature is infinitely I'm sorry I'm yelling now

817
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,220
Is infinitely capable of reproducing itself without having the assistance of a human

818
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:40,000
The evidence as I left ready for hypnosis had now entanged that that is in fact a

819
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,780
Man is just there waiting to be eaten And you're not at the threshold of dreaming

820
00:44:50,780 --> 00:45:01,220
Right show is already done

821
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,340
mitospasm, or what's the term?

822
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,180
Cytospasm.

823
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,320
It's a mitoperoxysm.

824
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,360
And it splits.

825
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,000
Actually, it's just mitosis.

826
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,820
That's all it is.

827
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,580
Yeah, actual cell mitosis.

828
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,320
Cytospasm is part of the preparation procedure.

829
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,840
Which can be very, very difficult.

830
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,420
But once the brain has split,

831
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,180
there's not enough room for it in the admittedly limited skull.

832
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,900
And it'll infinitely split itself.

833
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,940
So you have to move it into a new skull.

834
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,700
But does it have to be a Dave skull?

835
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,520
Oh, no, no, no.

836
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,360
That's what you better start worrying about, brother and sister.

837
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,180
Even, yes, you sisters and you she-males and trannies

838
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,720
and such like experimental new races.

839
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,540
A Dave brain could be fit into your skull.

840
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,560
And if yours was removed and replaced with a Dave brain,

841
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,700
would you know the difference?

842
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,480
You'd just think you were still Dave, right?

843
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,320
You'd get in bed with your beautiful wife,

844
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,320
but it wouldn't be you that was making love to her.

845
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,200
It would be Dave.

846
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,360
Or one of the Dave.

847
00:45:59,520 --> 00:45:59,960
Brains.

848
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,300
Do you really like that idea?

849
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,880
Are you...

850
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,800
How can you sit like that

851
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,240
and revel in the promise of years to come

852
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,880
when you know that's what's going to happen?

853
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,660
Were you so full of pus and nail polish

854
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,040
that you think that this is the future for all of us?

855
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,760
It's beyond your own personal feelings

856
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,380
and your own glimmerings of individuality.

857
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,940
Think of the future races.

858
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,040
The people, our grandchildren.

859
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,080
Our grandchildren!

860
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:28,940
Our great...

861
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,260
Whatever deeds they come to, these people...

862
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:32,460
The babies!

863
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,300
We must always think of our future functionaries.

864
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,060
And that means the products of our lions.

865
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:39,680
Loins.

866
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,660
The products of our loins.

867
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,300
The lemmings.

868
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,420
What this background music seems to be a repeat of what we had earlier.

869
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,920
There we go.

870
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,000
I think...

871
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,080
It's like...

872
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,620
It's as if this particular CD is...

873
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,840
Has a brain of its own.

874
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,420
Yeah.

875
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,640
Yeah.

876
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,280
Well, it's better off than some of us.

877
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,660
Well, upkeep of a monocelular brain isn't so bad.

878
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,160
You've got to think of it a lot of different ways.

879
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:09,920
You've got to think of components.

880
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,060
You've got to think of what you've got to buy every year

881
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,120
just to keep things up.

882
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,600
And how do you do that when you've got a bad brain?

883
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,700
That's the whole...

884
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,920
That's the catch-23 of it.

885
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,360
That's the...

886
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,800
As Robert Anton Wilson would say.

887
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,320
If you've got a monocelular brain,

888
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,360
you just go in and you get a brand new one

889
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,320
since they're reproducing constantly.

890
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,160
Brain new!

891
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,240
Get you a brain new brain!

892
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,600
Brain new!

893
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:28,720


894
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,220
Brain new!

895
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,460
Brain new!

896
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:29,480
Brain new!

897
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:29,500
Brain new!

898
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,500


899
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,500


900
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,460
Brain new!

901
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,740
Brain factory!

902
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,880
Step right inside the effedron's rail

903
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,320
from your own spleen.

904
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,460
Drink up and have a happy day.

905
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,740
Ha-ha-poo-bah.

906
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,800
The great poo-bah.

907
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,560
They shot all those people.

908
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:46,640
Poo-bah-bah.

909
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,640
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

910
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,820
Did you know that?

911
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,280
All those people were lined up

912
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,440
and some of them refused to stay in line

913
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,520
and so they just went around

914
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,560
and started slapping them

915
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,600
with anything they could find

916
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,620
and then they were all shot.

917
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,500
That's the new world we're looking forward to.

918
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,360
A world of poison, dangerous erections,

919
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,140
people with...

920
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,160
That was a great band.

921
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,460
Dangerous erections?

922
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,780
Yeah.

923
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,320
They couldn't shoot straight either.

924
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,100
I mean, it's worse than the fascist overtake

925
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,480
of our, what is the transmitter

926
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,840
or the actual transmission of the car?

927
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,020
That was another good band, Transmission.

928
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,580
They played at Starwood

929
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,700
and stayed in the trailer,

930
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,780
in the same trailer with us.

931
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,780
They're not shy, though.

932
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,320
They're just...

933
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Well, they're invisible, aren't they?

934
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,540
They play...

935
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:32,960
No.

936
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,180
They're quite visible

937
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,460
and they play didgeridoo

938
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,460
and strange implements.

939
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,480
Not like Reverend Angry Larry

940
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,240
heard in the background.

941
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,420
Now, I got kind of lost there,

942
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,880
but I just remembered some news.

943
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,500
I'm a professor now, Dave.

944
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,200
Oh, you're an actual professor now?

945
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,140
Yes, I'm a professor

946
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,000
because I'm going to be teaching a course,

947
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,480
an online university course.

948
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,160
At the online place known as

949
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,460
MaybeLogicAcademy.org or com.

950
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,440
MaybeLogic?

951
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,660
Yeah, MaybeLogic.

952
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,460
It's, uh, MaybeLogic is what is the thought processes

953
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,120
that Pope Bob or Robert Anton Wilson invented.

954
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:20,700
Huh.

955
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,000
And these guys did a film about Pope Bob

956
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,180
called MaybeLogic,

957
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,200
which is really good.

958
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,180
And, uh...

959
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,580
I guess you could find out the bits and pieces of it

960
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,980
at MaybeLogic.com.

961
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,460
But if you poke around on there,

962
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,920
they actually have online courses

963
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,520
taught by people like Robert Anton Wilson

964
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,040
and Are You Serious Now, Are You?

965
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,260
And Douglas Rushkoff, I believe,

966
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,760
and J. David Brown

967
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,220
and various other psychedelic hippie types.

968
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,180
And guess they wanted me to teach them a course!

969
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,560
And it's called

970
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,400
How to Run Your Own Cult

971
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,240
Do's and Don'ts

972
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,800
or the History of the Church of the Subgenius

973
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,240
the First 100 Years.

974
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,140
Oh, that is just great.

975
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,480
To be a member of the faculty

976
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,060
and be able to shine your own shoes

977
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,840
and stand up straight and tall

978
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,200
when they smear spit all over your face

979
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,520
and to take your degree

980
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,900
and shove it up their swollen sphincters

981
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,660
and say, I'm a member of this faculty, Dan!

982
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,040
I get to write the history!

983
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,980
Get to write the history!

984
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,100
I get to make people into unpersons.

985
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,360
I get to be the Stalin

986
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,120
and, uh, and actually,

987
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,060
I've been Stalin for too long, friends.

988
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,180
I've got some Carl Stalin's music,

989
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,120
but we were gonna put on a comedy bit.

990
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,120
Now, did this have where the man was praising God

991
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,260
and swore not a hair of his head would be touched

992
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,800
and the lion ate his sphincter?

993
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,260
It's, uh, I don't know.

994
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,300
No, no, that, oh, I didn't take that out of the printer.

995
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,460
We, we, it's just before Dave and I left the Slacker Mansion,

996
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,340
we saw that there was news from Russia

997
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,320
of a man who jumped into a lion's cage

998
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,500
praying to Bob.

999
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,860
And the lion reached up

1000
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,660
and severed his carotid artery with one claw

1001
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,200
as he prayed to God or Bob or whoever.

1002
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,380
He claimed slack would save him

1003
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,640
and Bob was actually looking down,

1004
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,040
watching in amusement, I guess.

1005
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,420
Well, as I was saying,

1006
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,820
that, that, that online course is in November.

1007
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,960
And, but, uh, but, and it's,

1008
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,320
the important thing is we've got this comedic material

1009
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,120
by Scooter,

1010
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:27,480
Scooter.

1011
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,380
Who is, even though he's not a subgenius,

1012
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,580
this is really good.

1013
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,920
He sent it to us every day for eight years

1014
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,660
and I finally noticed it the other day.

1015
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,740
Uh, and it's, um, well, I'll just,

1016
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,460
I'll just, uh, run it.

1017
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,500
Well, and rather than us running our mouths.

1018
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,360
Shadow on the sundial says once again,

1019
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,680
it's time to turn back the hands of time.

1020
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,640
Gather up all that stuff you don't understand.

1021
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,180
Pack it up with the dance music and the new math.

1022
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,820
Take it to one of your Catholic neighbors

1023
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,920
and he can give it back to the devil

1024
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,100
when he sees him on Sunday.

1025
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,860
Get down on your knees, Wilbur,

1026
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,560
and let the Holy Spirit of the mixed metaphor

1027
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,940
emblazon your eternal soul.

1028
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,540
In Jesus' name.

1029
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,460
With your hope,

1030
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:27,600
with your ghost,

1031
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,840
Bill Denye,

1032
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,240
the Creation Science Guy.

1033
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,420
We'll be right back.

1034
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,740
from the most plentiful substance on Earth.

1035
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,860
Now, from the Research Institute of Theological Physics,

1036
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,200
Dr. Hummer.

1037
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,980
You know the two-thirds of the Earth is water?

1038
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,660
And still yet, much of the Earth is water.

1039
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,500
And you pour the water out

1040
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,680
and just as soon as you pour it out,

1041
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,540
the Earth takes it.

1042
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,740
It sucks it in and it's never satisfied.

1043
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,080
It never says it's enough.

1044
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,540
You start the water in this building

1045
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,240
and if you left it alone, it would not be.

1046
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,540
It would not until every single thing in this.

1047
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,440
And it would then begin to do its best

1048
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,960
to leap over into another building

1049
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,440
and begin to...

1050
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:39,960
It would...

1051
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,540
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

1052
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,900
And it would pour out and just...

1053
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,740
Do you see desire?

1054
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,740
Do you see how it's...

1055
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,920
And it would pour...

1056
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,100
And it's parched and dry.

1057
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,580
And it wants more and it says the...

1058
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,760
And it wants more and more

1059
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,920
and it's talking about us.

1060
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,400
That's the way we're supposed to be.

1061
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,240
We're supposed...

1062
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:54,520
I just...

1063
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,040
We're not satisfied.

1064
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,120
And then the water is never satisfied.

1065
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:58,920
Did you ever notice that?

1066
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,000
No matter how many people get swallowed up by water,

1067
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,920
it still screams out and wants for more.

1068
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,660
After the so many thousands gave their life,

1069
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,420
it did not say,

1070
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,320
okay, that's enough.

1071
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,540
It just kept taking

1072
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,620
and kept taking

1073
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,660
and kept taking

1074
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,880
and we're supposed to give

1075
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,560
and give

1076
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,500
and give

1077
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,420
and give!

1078
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,920
And I want you to know

1079
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,280
we will find water.

1080
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,260
We cry give, give.

1081
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,520
Glory.

1082
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,840
Funny thing about desire.

1083
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,900
The Bible said desire...

1084
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,340
Uh-huh.

1085
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,520
A woman's desire,

1086
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,240
a wife's desire

1087
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,480
shall be tribulation.

1088
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,580
Watch this.

1089
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,720
I'm gonna help you.

1090
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:31,980
Mmm.

1091
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,520
My desire shall be for your

1092
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,120
daughters.

1093
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,340
Their names are

1094
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,180
give and

1095
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,580
give!

1096
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,400
My desire shall be for your husband.

1097
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,540
And I dated my preacher.

1098
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,220
We dated for seven years.

1099
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,580
That was like the rapture.

1100
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,040
And your husband's like the millennium.

1101
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,920
And...

1102
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,220
Hanging shriveled up,

1103
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:55,980
withered,

1104
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,380
and just...

1105
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,620
barely hanging on.

1106
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,080
Ha ha.

1107
00:54:59,440 --> 00:54:59,720
Ha ha.

1108
00:54:59,720 --> 00:54:59,920
Ha ha.

1109
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,040
Ha ha.

1110
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,060
Glory.

1111
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,000
Oh, God.

1112
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,780
And that was, of course,

1113
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,180
Dr. Isaac Hummer

1114
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,580
from the Research Institute

1115
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,020
of Theological Physics

1116
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,420
in Backwash, Texas,

1117
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,800
speaking to us

1118
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,260
about the covalent forces

1119
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,360
that bond the molecular structures

1120
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,340
of water and desire

1121
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,800
in bipolar field anointments.

1122
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,960
Oh, yeah.

1123
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,080
From the Holy Ghost Institute of Technology,

1124
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,380
I'm Bill Deny,

1125
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,960
the Creation Science Guy.

1126
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,120
See you next time.

1127
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,040
Oh, my God.

1128
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:26,660
Ah!

1129
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,460
Public corporations broadcasting

1130
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,660
for public support

1131
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,480
from viewers for public broadcast...

1132
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,740
Friends, I must tell you,

1133
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,920
that was from Scooter,

1134
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,900
and you can...

1135
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,680
Scooter does some intense shows

1136
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,980
that are, in some ways,

1137
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,380
very similar to this show,

1138
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,720
and yet distantly related.

1139
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,960
You can check Scooter's work out

1140
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,020
at axisofevil.org,

1141
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,060
but axis is spelled A-C-K,

1142
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,600
S-I-S, not like you would think.

1143
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,540
A-C-K-S-I-S, axisofevil,

1144
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,020
one word, dot org.

1145
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,960
Thank you, Price Bob.

1146
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,260
You're listening to

1147
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,200
the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

1148
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,060
the voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1149
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,260
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius

1150
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,560
and Bob and Connie,

1151
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,040
check out www.subgenius.com.

1152
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,400
Subgenius.com.

1153
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:30,240
And, uh, and, uh, yes, it's, uh...

1154
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,560
Or write to...

1155
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,300
A post office box,

1156
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,380
181-417,

1157
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,460
Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1158
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,360
4...

1159
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,080
411-8.

1160
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,700
That's 44118.

1161
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,600
That's 181-417 at 44118.

1162
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,660
For those of you who can still 418...

1163
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,700
I wish I could learn

1164
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,800
to say the WCSB phone number backwards

1165
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,420
like Dr. Sinister does on the Hour of Slack replays

1166
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,880
of the Dr. Sinister show.

1167
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,540
No, it's more like...

1168
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,840
Oh, that kind of backwards.

1169
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,240
And you can do that soon, friends,

1170
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,460
because we'll be getting off...

1171
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,500
Yes?

1172
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,520
A fireplace poker well placed in the forehead

1173
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,440
will let you learn what you need to know.

1174
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,420
What changed?

1175
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:30,120
It will let you lean on what you think you need to know.

1176
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,260
Bob knows what you really think,

1177
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,820
and you can pay to learn what he knows.

1178
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,400
Or you can buy yourself a little Bob Nose

1179
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,040
and make off into the woods with it.

1180
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,700
Yes.

1181
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,900
Scampering through the forests and the fields

1182
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,520
wearing your little Bob Nose.

1183
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,880
Collecting slack fungus.

1184
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,080
Ah, yes.

1185
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,960
Chewing on little funny mushrooms

1186
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,440
that you find growing in your armpits and groin.

1187
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,920
Sighting brain damage.

1188
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,240
Hell, hell.

1189
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,180
We will go away.

1190
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:03,520
Goodbye.

1191
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,740
Goodbye.

1192
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,120
Let's give him a hand.

1193
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:06,760
Goodbye.

1194
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,100
Amen.

1195
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,040
Amen.

1196
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:15,520
Hey.

1197
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:15,940
Whoo!

1198
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,360
Did that shock some of you fine sisters?

1199
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,640
Well, if this kind of preaching would be preached

1200
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,340
all the time,

1201
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,040
you would be living like some old cheap heifer.

1202
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:27,860
Amen.

1203
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:28,860
Amen.

1204
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:29,600
Amen.

1205
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:29,940


1206
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:30,460
Amen.

1207
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,080
Amen.

1208
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,560
Amen.

1209
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,600
That last cut was by Reverend Mayne Brainert.

1210
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,640
And now...

1211
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,560
.

1212
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:38,660
Ben.

1213
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:39,760
Wait.

1214
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,180
No.

1215
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,280
.

1216
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,760
.

1217
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:41,760


1218
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:41,760


1219
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:41,900
.

1220
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,400
.

1221
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,180
.

1222
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,180


1223
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,180


1224
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,180


1225
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,220
.

1226
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,240
.

1227
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:43,280
.

1228
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,340
.

1229
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:43,420
.

1230
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:43,420


1231
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,540
.

1232
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,700
.

1233
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:47,700


1234
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:47,760
.

1235
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,040
.

1236
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,260
.

1237
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,260


1238
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,340
.

1239
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:53,340


1240
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:53,920
.

1241
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,120
.

1242
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,120
A white man.

1243
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,660
A white man.

1244
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:58,960
.

1245
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:58,980
.

1246
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,140
Yes, it was true.

1247
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,420
But my...

1248
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,260
A, I was speaking generally.

1249
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,060
I mean, uh...

1250
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,620
.

1251
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:04,760
.

1252
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:04,780
.

1253
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:04,780


1254
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:04,780


1255
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,340
What more could a white man have?

1256
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,720
Possibly robbery?

1257
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,680
Or if he were a very intellectual man...

1258
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:13,720
.

1259
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,140
.

1260
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,440
.

1261
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:14,560
.

1262
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,000
.

1263
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,380
.

1264
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:16,380


1265
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:16,380


1266
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:16,500
.

1267
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,500


1268
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,500


1269
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,540
.

1270
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:16,600
.

1271
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,200
.

1272
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,200


1273
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,200


1274
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,240

00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,240

00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,920
No, it is too far-fetched.

1277
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,840
