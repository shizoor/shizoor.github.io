1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Yes.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,100
Bred to be predators, but bred also to be controlled.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,880
You see, my cast concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,360
You control their thoughts?

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,840
Not just theirs.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,320
The Heloi.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,520
So it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals?

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,600
That's their role here.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,860
To be your food?

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,780
Yes.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,180
And for those who are suitable to be breeding vessels for our other colonies.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,760
You see, I am just one of many.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,220
For the first time, I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,520
What else could it be?

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,420
Brightening as the thought may be,

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
it could happen.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,820
The sun will become dark, the moon blood red,

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,780
the stars of the heavens will fall,

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,540
there'll be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming,

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,480
the islands and the mountains are shaken out of their sockets,

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,620
and the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the face of the earth.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,700
It's all coming.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,600
Yes, I'm ready now.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,620
Then close your eyes,

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,780
and tap your heels together,

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,780
three times.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,700
And think to yourself,

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,820
there's no place like...

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:34,980
Bob!

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,760
Round, round the slack foam,

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,440
Bob the Bob,

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,840
down in the saucer row.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,540
Round, round the slack foam,

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,220
Bob the Bob,

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,680
down in the saucer row.

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,560
And in that air there was a ship,

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,420
a rare ship,

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,340
an exe-ship,

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,540
with a ship in the air,

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,420
and the air through the smoke,

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,400
and the smoke from the prop,

42
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,320
and the prop and the pipe,

43
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,240
and the pipe and the grid,

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,180
and the grid and the bottom,

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,100
bob down in the saucer row.

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
Round, round the slack foam,

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,520
Bob the Bob,

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,940
down in the saucer row.

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,700
Round, round the slack foam,

50
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,380
Bob the Bob,

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,840
down in the saucer row.

52
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,180
And in that ship there was a Bob,

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
a rare Bob,

54
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,380
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
With a Bob and a ship,

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,140
and a ship in the air,

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,020
and the air through the smoke,

58
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,920
and the smoke from the prop,

59
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,380
and the prop,

60
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,920
and the pipe,

61
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,760
and the pipe and the grid,

62
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,780
and the grid and the Bob,

63
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,700
Bob down in the saucer row!

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

65
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,840
Bob down in the saucers, oh.

66
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,980
That was Pope Fred, some ancient X-Day drill.

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,280
A lively tune.

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,260
And I'll...

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,240
Are we supposed to be hearing through these headphones?

70
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,240
Yeah.

71
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,920
He likes to turn the blade down so you can barely hear.

72
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,140
I just wanted to make sure.

73
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,280
You can't hear very loud through them.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,700
I can hear you real well, though.

75
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
Oh, we can hear each other.

76
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,380
I can hear...

77
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,040
Man, I can hear me great.

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,940
That's your favorite sound, isn't it?

79
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Man, it's so great to hear me.

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,340
I'm so good sometimes.

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,620
Dr. Drummond is luxuriating in the sound of his own voice.

82
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,800
Oh, he's getting to you.

83
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,740
He just got him a baby bear hug.

84
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,820
I just got a bear hug.

85
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,100
A baby bear hug.

86
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,780
Okay.

87
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,300
So...

88
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,960
Everything will go...

89
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,220
Wow, found a giant frop thing.

90
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,920
Frop, frop, zippy frop, frop.

91
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,020
So...

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
So, recording?

93
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,820
Now, all recording devices are on go.

94
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,940
Oh, this one's not.

95
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,780
Oh, I have to do something with this.

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,180
And I hear the swells of the movie

97
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
Abominable Story.

98
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,160
Snowman, 1957.

99
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,840
Starring Forrest Tucker and Peter Cushing.

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
And so, with that, we begin

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,960
Subgenius Mind Control Experiment number 2203

102
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,780
for Friday, July 3rd, quote, 2015, unquote.

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
With the Hour of Slack Live,

104
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,940
followed by Ask Dr. Hal,

105
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,060
and then the first iteration of the Bull Dada auction

106
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,120
right here on our stage.

107
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
At Caffeina's.

108
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,480
So, bring your Bull Dada or your money or both.

109
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,060
Say, some of...

110
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,220
You two guys missed some great jamming last night.

111
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,720
Yeah, I did.

112
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,300
There was some seriously...

113
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,900
Actually, some really good music being played here,

114
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,020
which we will cut to at some point in some show.

115
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah.

116
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,180
It actually happened.

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,240
I got in late last night.

118
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,180
Well, at one point,

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,500
all of the musicians on the stage,

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,420
knew what they were doing,

121
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,300
which is unusual in a...

122
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,880
Why, though?

123
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,280
Why?

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
Well, we'll fix that later tonight.

125
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,180
It's a statistical phenomenon.

126
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,580
When you put a bunch of chimpanzees and bonobos

127
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,600
all together with musical instruments,

128
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,480
eventually they will play...

129
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,960
You hear Mozart.

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,460
Yes, exactly.

131
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,900
Yeah, but you may have a long wait before you hear...

132
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,940
It might take 200 to 300 million years.

133
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,540
For hour upon hour,

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,920
until the music gels on the stage.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,400
It might...

136
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,620
You might actually have to wait

137
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,980
for the chimpanzee to evolve into Mozart.

138
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Well, fortunately, we don't need to worry about that

139
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,380
because we have Chaosmic Kitty tonight

140
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,520
who's going to join the musicians

141
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,840
and others who are equally musically accomplished.

142
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,160
Yeah, we're going to have doctors for Wotan,

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,800
but you know what?

144
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,060
I'm really distracted.

145
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,140
I know I'm supposed to be on the radio now,

146
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,160
but I'm so distracted

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,300
because I can't find my lighter.

148
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,560
Oh, Dr. Drummond here.

149
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:45,860
Oh, no.

150
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,220
I bet I have a lighter somewhere.

151
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,120
I hope.

152
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,100
Well...

153
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,320
No.

154
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,840
By the way,

155
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,660
the ones that have Monster High stickers are mine.

156
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:52,880
Uh-huh.

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,560
Those are yours?

158
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:53,920
Okay.

159
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,740
Well, I've got some.

160
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,240
And the ones that have laughing squid sigils on them are mine.

161
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,080
Well, I've got a couple that are about this long,

162
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,540
so the really long ones,

163
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,440
like this long...

164
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,300
I use that one to light my stove at home.

165
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,780
Why did you just take my lighter?

166
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,560
Because I left it at my domicile.

167
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,180
Hmm.

168
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,380
By the end of today,

169
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,220
there'll be 40 lighters in his pocket.

170
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,780
So if you need a light, ask Philo.

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah, tonight I'll be opening up...

172
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,660
Philo's Lighter Emporium down the road there,

173
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,640
so please come by.

174
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,240
Yes, light up and live with Dr. Drummond.

175
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,720
We're going to have a close-out special tonight.

176
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,060
We haven't even opened yet.

177
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,720
We're already thinking about closing out.

178
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
Everything must go.

179
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,600
Bargain basement rock bottom prices.

180
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,360
So you're eating frop cookies, huh?

181
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,520
Shh!

182
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,700
You're not supposed to frop on the radio.

183
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
This is simply going to...

184
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,580
This is an herb.

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,500
It's not a drug.

186
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,640
Render staying inaudible.

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:48,900
I don't know about the cheeks.

188
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,480
But look at me.

189
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,480


190
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,540
You're drinking on the radio.

191
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,920
You're drinking beer.

192
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm a little hungover.

193
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,760
I have to stay up later than anybody

194
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,120
because I have to copy the audio files.

195
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,520
That is sad.

196
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,480
And it takes a long time

197
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,540
because they're long files.

198
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,560
I used to have to do that.

199
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,600
And they're horrible sounding.

200
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,080
I did that for a while.

201
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,980
The more horrible...

202
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,040
There's Leon and Reverend Finord.

203
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,760
That's back when I was doing this audio, Philo.

204
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,460
I remembered this time.

205
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,500
Yeah.

206
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,380
It's good to remember.

207
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,960
Remember sometimes.

208
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,860
Remember.

209
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,220
Some of the good things.

210
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,340
Usually just before X-Day,

211
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,920
I look at all the pictures from the previous X-Day

212
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,040
and the sign-in sheets

213
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,080
so I won't embarrass myself as badly.

214
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Just like a teacher.

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,780
I've still managed to embarrass myself a few times.

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,940
On the first day of school.

217
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,280
Fight C. Todd told me every X-Day

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,180
for five X-Days what his name meant.

219
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,780
And he forgot.

220
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,260
Did you forget it?

221
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,220
Each time I had...

222
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,260
Well, that's the sad thing.

223
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,340
I mean, every X-Day I'd go,

224
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,520
what is it?

225
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,080
What's your name?

226
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,100
I said, fuck them if they can't take a joke, Stang.

227
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,000
I told you every year for the last five years.

228
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,880
So it's not you, friends.

229
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,520
It's me.

230
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,020
Wow.

231
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,940
Also, I'm only pretending to have the sense of hearing.

232
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm just guessing what everybody says.

233
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,680
But then, of course, there's your inner hearing.

234
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,060
I just thought it was a very cleverly made-up name.

235
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,500
I wondered what happened.

236
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,800
Yeah, Fight C. Todd.

237
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,040
Right.

238
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,040
The initials of...

239
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

240
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,320
Exactly.

241
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,540
I just have to use that kind of language

242
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,700
just to say the only law in the church.

243
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Yeah.

244
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,180
We could have said something else.

245
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,600
We talked about that a lot, remember?

246
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,600
About what we should use if we don't want to say fuck them.

247
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,220
You know, we wanted to say, like...

248
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,760
We had some other alternatives.

249
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,680
The classic one, if thou canst not take a joke.

250
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,180
If they cannot take a joke, let them mount up upon themselves.

251
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah.

252
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,780
That was the Irish version.

253
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,640
Somebody said.

254
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
But it's too late now.

255
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,300
Too late.

256
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm the one who has to...

257
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,880
We mounted upon ourselves.

258
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,320
You know, there's fewer and fewer broadcast stations

259
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,340
that I have to do the censoring for.

260
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,500
Which is sort of sad.

261
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,120
Because they used to pay money.

262
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,020
Yeah.

263
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,580
Well, do we have to censor...

264
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,660
The old days, when they paid money for the show.

265
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,140
But we're beyond all that now.

266
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,320
The free speech radio.

267
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,160
So we always have to censor.

268
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
We have to think silly things like money.

269
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,720
Yes.

270
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,780
Who needs it?

271
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,420
Food.

272
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,740
Food.

273
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,160
Hey, Dr. Powell, you having some of that one old screaming chicken down there?

274
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
Which chicken?

275
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:24,860
What?

276
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,600
The screaming chicken I see on the end of the wild turkey.

277
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:28,780
Oh.

278
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,140
Do you want some?

279
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,980
Is it iced tea?

280
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,940
Is it really iced tea?

281
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,480
I want a beer.

282
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,080
It is not.

283
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,820
Oh, no.

284
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,360
I don't want it.

285
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,360
No one's been putting pineapple juice in my pineapple juice.

286
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,760
I want it to look like booze, but actually be just iced tea.

287
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,040
That's for the movie version.

288
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,920
Like they do on the movies.

289
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,520
Right.

290
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,340
Except Lee Marvin.

291
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,900
Lee Marvin.

292
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,880
He said, if I'm going to pretend to be a drunk, I don't want to be in this movie.

293
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,940
I actually want to drink real booze.

294
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
It won him an Academy Award.

295
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,260
He's a man's actor.

296
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,400
And if you've ever seen that movie, Cat Baloo, he actually is stinking drunk.

297
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,800
Really?

298
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,960
Half of that movie.

299
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,420
Sure.

300
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,500
Even the horse.

301
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,920
When he plays the kid Chalene parts, he's...

302
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,460
Now, I read somewhere that Evelyn Anchors, or one of those actresses in those old monster

303
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,280
movies, really didn't like...

304
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,040
They had Fat chance.

305
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,380
Very weird.

306
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,240
They played this in those times...

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,380
We were upset though.

308
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,580
You know, Mary Jane, I think she was like..

309
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,900
She's like you know, you never wis good.

310
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,740
She's usually always a butler.

311
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:46,920
So...

312
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,380
They're just the wrong kids.

313
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:48,720
No!

314
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,300
Yeah, so you see, the tanner leaves are from the tea that was drunk on stage.

315
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,180
Yeah.

316
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,060
I've seen things on Facebook I never expected to see,

317
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,240
like a scan of Lon Chaney Jr.'s passport from 1959.

318
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,600
Well, I hope you enjoyed it as fulsomely as possible.

319
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,300
What do you do with that?

320
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,280
I like monster movies.

321
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,640
He was a big, strong oaf,

322
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,720
and so he could pick up the actress in the traditional monster crawl,

323
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,060
but some monsters were small, like Bela Lugosi was fairly small.

324
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,900
It was very hard for him to pick up Ellen Chandler or anybody else.

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,700
He was a junkie, you know.

326
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,880
Oh, let's not go through that again.

327
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,780
He took morphine because he had...

328
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,460
That was his medicine.

329
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,100
Yeah, it's his medicine.

330
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,780
We call it our medicine.

331
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,920
Yeah, right, it's his medicine.

332
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,300
Yeah, loosen up.

333
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,060
Let me do my medicine and then finish some people.

334
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,080
That Johnny Depp movie got it all wrong.

335
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,620
Interestingly enough...

336
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,260
Interestingly enough, Doug and I, I mean, Stang and I...

337
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,240
It's Doug.

338
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,680
...knew all about that group

339
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,280
because we followed their adventures in Famous Monsters of Filmland

340
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,180
long before Johnny Depp was...

341
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,520
What are you...

342
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,740
You're talking about Ed Wood.

343
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,780
You're talking about Ed Wood.

344
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,680
Are you cutting me out of this exclusive club of you two guys

345
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,200
sitting right next to me?

346
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,680
Did you follow the stories of...

347
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,340
Sure, Famous Monsters of Filmland.

348
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,400
Vampyra and all these characters.

349
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
So you're on his bad side.

350
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,620
Did I fall off?

351
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,380
The bench, I'll say.

352
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,380
You're on the deaf side.

353
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,780
Who else is here?

354
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,560
I'm on the deaf side.

355
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,200
So, Lugosi, for example, didn't have little yapping, snapping dogs.

356
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,020
He had huge wolfhounds that followed him around.

357
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,020
And the movie got other details wrong, too.

358
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,700
That's Hollywood.

359
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,420
They always make the good guys look like the bad guys

360
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
and the bad guys look like the good guys.

361
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,060
They make the bad guys virile and strong

362
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,860
and the good guys look like wimps

363
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,420
because it's been shown it's better box office.

364
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,880
That's that way.

365
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,980
Well, you know, it's much more fun to be a bad guy than a good guy.

366
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Well, what I meant was they usually cast the aliens as monsters

367
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,560
and the humans are the good guys you're supposed to root for.

368
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,040
Nobody remembers the good guys.

369
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,180
They remember the crazy monsters, though.

370
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Villains are more interesting than heroes.

371
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,000
Villains are the ones that make things happen.

372
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,220
The reason that there's a movie there at all is because of the villain.

373
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,780
And the villain eventually becomes the hero.

374
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,960
Humphrey Bogart started out as tough-talking gangsters

375
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,020
but graduated to being the hero because everybody liked him better.

376
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
And Godzilla, whose theme is in the background right now,

377
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,040
started out as a bad guy, you know,

378
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,720
just because he destroyed a few cities.

379
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,920
But by the end of the series,

380
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,240
he's routinely saving the Earth from worse monsters.

381
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,740
And, of course, the classic thing is the Yeti.

382
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,420
Yetis are...

383
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,400
Even the great Zukowski, who studied the Yeti more than anyone,

384
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,100
thought that the Yeti were the source of evil in the world

385
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,620
and that the humans were the pure, nice ones.

386
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,660
But you suggested to him that the opposite was the core.

387
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,420
Yes, I actually...

388
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,700
Well, in Book of the Subgenius, we explained all that.

389
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,980
But I got a chance to meet Zukowski at a sci-fi con

390
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,180
and I got to be treated like a kook by Zukowski.

391
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,760
By Zukowski.

392
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,280
I stood up and said,

393
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,720
Sir, we've read Behold the Proton and all of your works,

394
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,240
but we think that you have it backwards.

395
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,100
The Yetinsen are the force of good

396
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,440
and the humans are the communists and gangster thugs.

397
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,480
And he gave me the classic, polite kook brush-off.

398
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,980
He kind of looks at everybody else and raises his eyes

399
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,380
and kind of does this and goes,

400
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,380
Well, some people get funny ideas in their heads about my work.

401
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:43,780


402
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,240
Any other questions?

403
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
Oh, man.

404
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,140
Another offensive thing they do with aliens in the movies

405
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,560
is they make them cute and simple and little and lovable and uncomplicated.

406
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,060
I don't like his feet.

407
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,540
The undeveloped humans are more animal-like in comparison to the aliens

408
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,860
than the aliens are to the lesser advanced humans.

409
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,620
And that goes right down the line.

410
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
So where...

411
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,220
Where's the...

412
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,560
Aren't we supposed to have, like, some food and things up here?

413
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,080
What?

414
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,380
Oh, I guess we can't use food and electronics.

415
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,400
That'd be like committing a Michael Pepe.

416
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,540
Food and electronics?

417
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,620
Actually, this is if you...

418
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,060
Because we no longer are allowed to do anything fun

419
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,580
in any radio stations that are real,

420
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,560
we have to make up for lost time right here, right now.

421
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,980
But here at Tarzan's radio station, it's Liberty Hall all day.

422
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,440
Yes, let joy...

423
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,760
You know, I do.

424
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


425
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


426
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


427
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


428
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


429
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


430
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


431
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


432
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


433
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,760


434
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,800
Joy be unconfined.

435
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,740
Perfect freedom is here.

436
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,620
Like that radio station that Dr. Hal and I are on.

437
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,660
Yes, it has...

438
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,340
It's supposed to be free speech.

439
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,340
And it has cameras watching your every move

440
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,680
that even look like eyeballs bulging out of the walls

441
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
with whites and corneas and pupils.

442
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,740
We feel like we're in an NSA headquarters interrogation office.

443
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,140
They cover every angle of the inside and the outside.

444
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,680
Whenever you're speaking to the mic, this big bright light goes on

445
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,760
and, like, flashes into your ear.

446
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:13,760


447
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:13,760


448
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:13,760


449
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,280
Flashes into your eyes.

450
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,440
We have to go outside to pollute ourselves

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,460
and stand quivering under the dwarf maples.

452
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
We can't even...

453
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,080
You know, we're, like, out there freezing.

454
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,500
Yes, it used to be nice and comfortable,

455
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,540
but those are old times.

456
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,380
We never worry about rain, though.

457
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,680
Well, we don't have to worry about rain

458
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,540
and dry as a bone in California,

459
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,520
but here in the land of abundant water,

460
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,320
you guys don't know how good you've gotten it.

461
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,260
Yeah, we have real weather.

462
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,020
Splash your way to...

463
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,760
Splash your way to...

464
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,760


465
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,760


466
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,760


467
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,760


468
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,760


469
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,920
The first time we saw rain, we stopped the car

470
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,580
and we all got out and just danced.

471
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,300
It was like in Nevada.

472
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,180
Look, little bitty drops falling out of the sky.

473
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,880
He's not...

474
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,840
It was in Nevada, the driest state in the nation.

475
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,760
Yeah, but the moment you get away from California,

476
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
it starts to rain.

477
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,140
It doesn't rain in California,

478
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,340
but it's raining in green and verdant and lush in Nevada.

479
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
You know, the last time I drove through Death Valley...

480
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,460
I returned your light. It's on your desk.

481
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,020
It rained.

482
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,800
It only rains for a couple of years in Death Valley.

483
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,080
Things are different now.

484
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,600
The desert is the lush, verdant, green,

485
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,940
place people should go to and live

486
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,880
and drink all the water and everything.

487
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,360
Death Valley looked really strange full of water.

488
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,700
It was a lake.

489
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,640
The Badwater Basin, the lowest point in the world,

490
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,660
was...

491
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,500
It was a lake for 10 minutes.

492
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,900
Wow.

493
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,340
And then the lake was gone again.

494
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,900
But there were frogs mating everywhere.

495
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,360
Yes, that's the way of it.

496
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,260
Was this a flute?

497
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,240
Well, they had to hurry because they only got...

498
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,180
They had to hurry.

499
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,420
They had to hurry.

500
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,420


501
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,460
And then they were dead again, you know,

502
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,380
for another hundred years or whatever.

503
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,220
This flute's broken.

504
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,440
No, it's not.

505
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
You need to push the button on the side.

506
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,220
I was blowing as hard as I could.

507
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,720
And it just...

508
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,480
There we go.

509
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,140
The Colorado River Toad,

510
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,360
which I mentioned the other day,

511
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,200
estivates 60 feet underground

512
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,960
and then burrows during the monsoon season

513
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
toward the surface.

514
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
Oh, you didn't click.

515
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

516
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,220
Can you do the flute thing

517
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,160
that draws Frankenstein's monster?

518
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,440
Only Igor can play that flute.

519
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,180
I really wanted to learn how to play that little...

520
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,440
Man, what makes it taste like that?

521
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,280
That would cause the monster

522
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,140
to do his bidding for some reason.

523
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,300
Ghost of Frankenstein was the first monster movie I saw

524
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,920
and I immediately identified with Igor.

525
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,900
It begins with him...

526
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,640
He's a sad character.

527
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,920
Of course you sympathize with the poor hunchback guy.

528
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,500
They're bullying him.

529
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
They're ganging up on him.

530
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
He throws a few chunks of rock off the ramparts on him.

531
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,000
But then he goes down and wakes up his old friend,

532
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,540
the Frankenstein monster.

533
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,620
Who will only respond to him.

534
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Yeah.

535
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,840
They pull him out of his sulfur bath.

536
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,560
Even though he used to be enemies.

537
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,120
Right.

538
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,560
And growing up,

539
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,900
I felt that that was my destiny,

540
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,640
to be like...

541
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:13,960
Igor.

542
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,160
Throwing rocks down on normals

543
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,800
and leading monsters around.

544
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,160
First, you would have to be...

545
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,980
At least you got to...

546
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,620
If you believe in your dream,

547
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,600
it will come true.

548
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,860
Igor was hanged,

549
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,060
but the execution didn't take.

550
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,340
He had a strange broken upper spine

551
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,980
and his head was canted at an odd angle.

552
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,520
Is that the future you envisage for yourself?

553
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah, I thought that was a cool look.

554
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,100
I think it was because they hung him.

555
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,240
Wasn't it because they hung him

556
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,760
and it didn't work?

557
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:43,960
Yeah, it didn't work.

558
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,460
Right.

559
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:44,680
Not so.

560
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,540
Right.

561
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,900
They hung him and said,

562
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,340
well, I guess he's not going to die,

563
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,640
so we better let him go.

564
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,600
Well, you can't execute him twice.

565
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,520
And he got the monster to get revenge for him.

566
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,380
That sounded pretty cool to me.

567
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,500
The monster went after anyone who ever mistreated him,

568
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,920
which was a long list.

569
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,160
Since he was the village...

570
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,260
Punchback.

571
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,780
Well, more like the...

572
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,160
It would be a good thing.

573
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,020
One that everybody punches.

574
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,660
You know, the punching bag.

575
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,220
To have a monster.

576
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,020
Judas Goat.

577
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,940
What am I thinking of?

578
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
What was that?

579
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,160
Yeah, I saw a TV...

580
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,060
A movie recently

581
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,440
where somebody was a hitman

582
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,720
and he was killing everybody

583
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,220
that the other guy knew.

584
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,360
They do that.

585
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,020
Not Brad Pitt, I hope.

586
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,540
No.

587
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,920
How much does that guy charge?

588
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,320
Who, Brad Pitt?

589
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,240
No, the hitman

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,200
that can kill everybody

591
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,260
that you want killed.

592
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,380
Just to get...

593
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,900
You know, just interesting.

594
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,760
I think...

595
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
In this case, he did it for free.

596
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,920
He was just like a hitman.

597
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,760
What's his phone number?

598
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:42,980
On vacation.

599
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,760
Not no country for old men.

600
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,500
He didn't have anything to do.

601
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,180
He was just, you know,

602
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,320
hanging out on vacation

603
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,600
and he's like...

604
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,740
Did he give you a business card?

605
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,280
Yeah, I'm bored.

606
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,820
I'm gonna go see if somebody

607
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,600
will just let me go off a few people,

608
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,720
you know, for fun.

609
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,820
Do that.

610
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,080
I saw that.

611
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,820
That was a movie.

612
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,720
Maybe it was

613
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,940
and maybe it wasn't.

614
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,580
It was a movie and not a memory?

615
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,440
Yes.

616
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,740
It may be a memory.

617
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,600
Did you wake up with blood

618
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,640
all over your hands

619
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
and panties on your head?

620
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,820
No, no.

621
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,740
I mean, no more often than normal.

622
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,180
No.

623
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,060
But I did

624
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,500
wash my hands a lot

625
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,680
for a while there.

626
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,460
You know, like,

627
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,900
it's like a guilty thing.

628
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,840
Like, why am I washing

629
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,780
my hands so much?

630
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,360
It's like...

631
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,900
Pontius Pilate.

632
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,120
The...

633
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,460
No, wait.

634
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,980
That's wrong.

635
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,400
What about Pontius?

636
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,200
That misunderstood

637
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,760
public official?

638
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:33,920
Poor guy.

639
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,800
He was a poor...

640
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,720
He was really put

641
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,260
between a rock and a hard place.

642
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,780
First of all,

643
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,300
he was assigned to Judea,

644
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,460
a horrible land

645
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,860
reeking of goats.

646
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:41,920


647
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,580
And secondly,

648
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,360
the office of procurator

649
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,340
of Judea

650
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,960
was a place

651
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,900
that they sent people

652
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,500
that they didn't like

653
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,220
who had no other place to go.

654
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,000
He was already

655
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,980
being punished.

656
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,600
Hey, we'll teach him a lesson.

657
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,260
This was like,

658
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,500
you know,

659
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,180
on the slow boat to China

660
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,060
or we're going to exile him

661
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,300
to Siberia.

662
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,240
Well, Basil Rathbone

663
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,940
played him sympathetically

664
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
in the motion picture

665
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,020
The Last Days of Pompeii.

666
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,920
Didn't Christopher Pace

667
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,160
play him in Plummer

668
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,200
or somebody play him

669
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,860
in some movie?

670
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,380
In Barabbas.

671
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,220
Who played him in Barabbas?

672
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,340
That Italian job.

673
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,960
Is this where you guys

674
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,920
learned your religion?

675
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,280
From Bible movies.

676
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,060
Where did you learn it?

677
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,380
Yeah, obviously.

678
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,180
We get the epics out.

679
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,520
You mean Victor Mature

680
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,580
wasn't in the Bible?

681
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,520
Yeah.

682
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,700
Demetrius and the Gladiator.

683
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,620
That's a good one.

684
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,380
Demetrius and the Gladiators

685
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,620
is one of those sequels

686
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,320
that's better than

687
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,960
the movie it follows,

688
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,700
The Robe.

689
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,560
Yeah, The Robe.

690
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,660
No holier than thou

691
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,780
Christians in that one

692
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,380
to speak of.

693
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,180
Just big brawny gladiators

694
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,620
slicing, chopping, and dicing.

695
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,920
They killed some Christians

696
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,480
in that one.

697
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,220
Oh, they killed plenty

698
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,920
and they had that wonderful guy

699
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,100
for Caligula.

700
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, yeah, that guy is great.

701
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,860
He's so good.

702
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,060
Horrible toad

703
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,420
of the Roman Emperor.

704
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,040
Those heavy-lidded eyes,

705
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,260
those pursed lips.

706
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,560
Where's your God now, Christian?

707
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm thinking of a different

708
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,780
Caligula movie,

709
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,980
the one that starts...

710
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,240
There was me.

711
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,360
That is Caligula

712
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,940
and my three droogs.

713
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,820
But you remember

714
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,820
in the second movie,

715
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,780
he gets speared

716
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,840
right in the chest.

717
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,520
He did.

718
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,360
That's actually

719
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,320
an accurate historical...

720
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,680
That would have been

721
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,260
really fun.

722
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,600
He alienated everybody

723
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,340
and then he went on further

724
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,620
and he alienated

725
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,680
the Praetorian guard

726
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,260
who were supposed

727
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,020
to guard him.

728
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,440
And so they speared him

729
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,920
in the chest

730
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,620
and then they went

731
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,880
and dragged Claudius

732
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,700
out of a closet

733
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,560
when he was quivering

734
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,120
in terror

735
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,880
and made him emperor.

736
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,160
Were you there?

737
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,220
You know I was there.

738
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,600
I was there.

739
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Because we just,

740
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,720
we make it up.

741
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,260
Kiwis Romanus Sum.

742
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,040
We make it up.

743
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,460
I wasn't in the early empire

744
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,440
but I was there

745
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,900
long enough to remember.

746
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,080
I wrote that stuff myself

747
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,020
when I was younger.

748
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,620
Yeah.

749
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,260
Philo was a senator

750
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,680
for four terms.

751
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
He was quaestor.

752
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,360
He made a senator

753
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,460
in the second term

754
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,260
of Lucius Mammilius.

755
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,280
You see references

756
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,200
to Philo.

757
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,160
That's right.

758
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,980
There was Philo,

759
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,920
also Philo of Alexandria

760
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,400
and Philo Antipater.

761
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,140
Philo of...

762
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,540
Archidias.

763
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,020
And then there was Philina.

764
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,200
Philo Do.

765
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,920
And then...

766
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,460
Oh ho.

767
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:20,940
Philomina.

768
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,800
Oh, when will we see

769
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,780
Philomina again?

770
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,320
She's a-coming.

771
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,100
She may be.

772
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,660
She's heading this way.

773
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,940
Your sister, Philomina.

774
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,420
Yeah.

775
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,580
Does she still have

776
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,100
that mustache?

777
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,580
Yeah, she's horrible.

778
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,140
Everyone in Philo's family

779
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,880
has a mustache.

780
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,640
No, Lily doesn't have

781
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,240
much of one.

782
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,780
Not yet.

783
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,640
She's only eight.

784
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,200
Not developed.

785
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,600
Not developed yet.

786
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,980
But in time,

787
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,780
she'll be able to sing

788
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,980
a barbershop quartet.

789
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,580
Well, the Yeti subgenius

790
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,160
should be proud

791
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,260
of its Yeti palate.

792
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,020
An enhanced

793
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,940
natural lip brow.

794
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,800
Well, we're not going

795
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,560
to entertain anyone

796
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,520
by talking about

797
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,020
our family sequence.

798
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,440
Yeah, yeah.

799
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,780
Well, if they're hairy enough,

800
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,600
if they're really

801
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,580
hairy and deformed,

802
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,580
it's kind of interesting.

803
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,520
Have you seen

804
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,100
Ed Strange's little girl?

805
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,000
Why?

806
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,180
She's got black,

807
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,360
thick black hair

808
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,980
coming up from her ass

809
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,200
collar.

810
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,240
She's got a crack

811
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,180
up her back.

812
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,180
She's about five years old.

813
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,240
Vital, feral,

814
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,160
luxuriant,

815
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,580
animal.

816
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,400
Maybe a future

817
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,360
lycanthrope.

818
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,080
Check her for the

819
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,420
unibrow and for the

820
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,260
equivalent of the

821
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,300
first and second digit.

822
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,380
I used to have a

823
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,960
girlfriend who had

824
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,260
a nice pelt on her

825
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,640
hair.

826
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,440
I hear scary

827
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,980
creeper, stalker,

828
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
killer guy music.

829
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,680
Yes.

830
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,900
Coincidence

831
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,580
or conspiracy?

832
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,360
Any scary

833
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,620
creeper, stalker,

834
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,520
killer guys around

835
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,620
besides us

836
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,020
that we ought to

837
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,460
know about?

838
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,980
And Bob?

839
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,620
We did that last year,

840
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:42,860
remember?

841
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,220
Yeah.

842
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,300
Yeah, the creepy

843
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,580
killer guy was last year

844
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,720
and we couldn't catch him

845
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,700
so he could be back

846
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,240
but there's been

847
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,140
no evidence yet.

848
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,960
It's been peaceful.

849
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,960
Well, you know,

850
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,700
there are plenty

851
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,680
of funny fake

852
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,200
But something could

853
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,500
happen any second.

854
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,440
Did that mean?

855
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,400
Including X-Day.

856
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,180
Well, that music

857
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,200
seems to imply

858
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,320
a certain ominous

859
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,360
overtone.

860
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Right.

861
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,740
John Carpenter

862
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,620
composes music

863
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,960
as well as

864
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,020
directs the movie

865
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,960
but does he ever

866
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,440
get credit?

867
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:08,780
No.

868
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,560
Yeah, he does.

869
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, he does.

870
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah, in fact,

871
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,640
there's a couple

872
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,800
of albums of his.

873
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,420
And what about

874
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,120
Robert Rodriguez?

875
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,120
He does that too.

876
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Yes, he's quite

877
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,300
multi-talented

878
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,460
and we mentioned

879
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,480
before, before you

880
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,180
got here, that

881
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,320
James Horner died

882
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,280
in a plane crash

883
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,800
so no more movie

884
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,160
scores from him.

885
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,980
He was good.

886
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,640
I liked his stuff.

887
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,780
sat in a corner?

888
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
No, that was

889
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,760
the guy,

890
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,180
Little Jack Horner.

891
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,240
Little Jack Horner.

892
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,440
And not

893
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,580
John Horner,

894
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,420
the paleontologist.

895
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:37,420


896
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:37,960
some people do

897
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,980
use Jack

898
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,760
as a diminutive

899
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:40,880
character.

900
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,300
in the form of

901
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,580
John,

902
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,600
which I never understood

903
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,100
because it has

904
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,680
the same number

905
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,120
of letters.

906
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,060
The name John

907
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,660
appears in

908
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,200
endless variations.

909
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,340
The name John

910
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,240
is the same as

911
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
Hans, Hansel,

912
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:52,980
Ivan,

913
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,120
Johannes,

914
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,320
Jack,

915
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,900
well,

916
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,120
Jacques.

917
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,180
It was obviously

918
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,000
from the French

919
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,420
Jacques,

920
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,100
which is,

921
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,900
you know,

922
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:03,880
that's how

923
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
Jack got in there.

924
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,480
And the name

925
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,440
Harry,

926
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,320
I might as well

927
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,840
point out,

928
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,700
is equally

929
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,340
versatile.

930
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,300
The same as

931
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,240
Henry and

932
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,160
Harold and

933
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,760
so forth,

934
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,940
linguistically.

935
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,300
And Heinrich.

936
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,120
Yes.

937
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,780
But the name

938
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,700
Bob has a

939
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,440
different and

940
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,340
more unusual

941
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,520
derivation.

942
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,080
More ominous.

943
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,600
Yes.

944
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,520
One we don't

945
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,300
talk about so

946
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,680
glibly.

947
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,940
If you don't

948
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,440
put the quotes

949
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,180
around that

950
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,880
name to

951
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,680
contain it,

952
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,320
it just

953
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,460
flies apart.

954
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
It flies apart.

955
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,460
I did over there

956
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,000
when they were

957
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
announcing the food

958
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,480
the other day

959
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,720
with Bob Burgers,

960
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,620
I quickly put the

961
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,600
quotes because of

962
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,460
Nimbus of

963
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Ectoplasm was

964
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,240
starting to form

965
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,160
around the sign.

966
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,940
Well, the two

967
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,020
bees could disengage,

968
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,620
you know,

969
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,260
without the

970
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,640
quote.

971
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,900
That's true.

972
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,840
Without the

973
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,260
rondeur in the

974
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,200
middle pressuring

975
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,820
them outward,

976
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,500
they would stay

977
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,200
where they are.

978
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,100
But Bob wants

979
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,120
to expand and

980
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,160
engulf the world.

981
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
It's only we

982
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,060
who have kept

983
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,800
him so far

984
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:58,820
where he is.

985
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,520
balanced within

986
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,300
the quotes.

987
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,220
An omnivorous

988
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,600
entity,

989
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:04,980
eating more

990
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,460
and more.

991
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
The quotes are

992
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,520
the quote marks

993
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,240
around his name

994
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,100
are like a cage.

995
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,360
They do

996
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,060
contain you.

997
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,060
Just like you

998
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,040
draw your special

999
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,300
circle so as not

1000
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,040
to be gobbled

1001
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,700
by a demon.

1002
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,020
Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,080
We drove a lot

1004
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,800
of people away

1005
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,120
the first day

1006
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,520
reading.

1007
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,540
You can open

1008
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:23,900
that up.

1009
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,340
It's written

1010
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,180
in like 1930.

1011
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,360
And it's published

1012
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,320
by the Eugenics

1013
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,340
Publishing Company.

1014
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,020
Everyone was

1015
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,300
big on Eugenics

1016
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,920
in those days.

1017
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,400
Good Lord.

1018
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,280
The Eugenics

1019
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,340
Publishing Company.

1020
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,840
No, here's a good

1021
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,160
chapter.

1022
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,100
The Perversions

1023
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
of Love, of course,

1024
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,900
is a great chapter.

1025
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,940
Another good thing.

1026
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,940
Masturbation is a

1027
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,220
thing so natural

1028
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,940
and spontaneous

1029
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,440
that the man

1030
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,600
was without a woman

1031
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,620
and the woman

1032
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,740
was without a man

1033
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,660
that it tends

1034
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,640
to spring up

1035
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,460
at all times

1036
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,660
and in all countries.

1037
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,040
Stop it.

1038
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,420
Stop it.

1039
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,240
Stop it, Reverend

1040
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,780
Stang.

1041
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,240
I'm going to hurl.

1042
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,520
When we were

1043
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,220
reading from this,

1044
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,980
people got so

1045
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,920
turned on that

1046
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,840
they had to go

1047
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,800
run off and try

1048
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,660
the things we were

1049
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,320
reading about.

1050
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,720
Sodomy, I think,

1051
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,280
was the...

1052
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,840
Big fans.

1053
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,240
Sodomy?

1054
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,000
What is this?

1055
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,600
So-do-my?

1056
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,880
What is this?

1057
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,960
It's from the

1058
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,420
cities of the plains,

1059
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
Sodom and Gomorrah.

1060
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,820
So-do-my?

1061
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,040
They were destroyed

1062
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,480
by the fire from heaven

1063
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,460
and Lot's wife

1064
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,200
So-do-me?

1065
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,600
That's what it means.

1066
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,240
So-do-me.

1067
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,800
Jammed into a

1068
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,160
pillar of salt.

1069
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,060
A big Lot's.

1070
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,380
Boy, I wish I'd

1071
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:28,740
known that

1072
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,440
when I was younger.

1073
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,260
You didn't mention

1074
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,880
one other thing

1075
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,560
about the quotes

1076
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,980
around Bob, Stang,

1077
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,480
which we should

1078
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,100
throw in before

1079
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,020
we abandon the subject

1080
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,680
and that is

1081
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,720
that's a good way

1082
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,500
to tell who's

1083
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,800
really a subgenius,

1084
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,740
and who isn't.

1085
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,960
Some jerk

1086
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,780
who puts up

1087
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,120
Bob without the quotes

1088
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,100
is just playing

1089
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,580
at being a subgenius.

1090
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Well, they're playing

1091
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,080
with disaster.

1092
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,020
Yes.

1093
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,980
Either one of those

1094
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,540
bees could go

1095
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,280
skittering off.

1096
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,620
Susie!

1097
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,060
Susie the floozy's here.

1098
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,980
You should show

1099
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,660
everybody your

1100
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,320
Bob tattoo

1101
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,220
with the bees

1102
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,280
on either cheek.

1103
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,280
You know,

1104
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,640
she's got to...

1105
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,940
She's got a bee

1106
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,680
on each cheek

1107
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,380
of her life.

1108
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,080
An unfortunate

1109
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,060
encounter

1110
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,760
with a beehive

1111
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,400
creature.

1112
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,880
Donald,

1113
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,460
she's already there.

1114
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,840
She...

1115
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,060
Problem.

1116
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,340
That's all right.

1117
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
You have a bee

1118
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,280
on each cheek

1119
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,960
of your life.

1120
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,120
Yeah.

1121
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,340
You'll remember me

1122
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:21,920
for the rest

1123
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,460
of your life.

1124
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,960
I'm going to cut

1125
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,840
the two Z's.

1126
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,980
One on each cheek.

1127
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,200
You're not...

1128
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,180
And God bless

1129
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,680
your son.

1130
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,320
Well,

1131
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,300
leave it off the...

1132
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,600
He does a pretty good

1133
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,360
read, doesn't he?

1134
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,960
He won't be able

1135
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,700
to talk for another

1136
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,980
hour after that, though.

1137
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,160
I can't talk anyway.

1138
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,880
Anyway,

1139
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,040
cut your belly

1140
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,840
open and make it

1141
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,660
like that black stuff

1142
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,420
you got in there.

1143
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,660
Oh, yeah.

1144
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,300
Remember when you

1145
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,280
showed the black stuff

1146
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,440
that one time?

1147
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,260
It's gross.

1148
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
It smelled bad, too.

1149
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,520
Another term for that

1150
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,600
is glaxel.

1151
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,400
Yeah,

1152
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,100
as we were saying,

1153
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,500
you can tell

1154
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,720
the dilettantes

1155
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,220
by the way

1156
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,520
they spell Bob's name.

1157
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,520
They can't even

1158
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,580
spell Bob.

1159
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,220
Look,

1160
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,740
the Holy Temple

1161
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,860
of Mass Consumption

1162
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,940
has entered the building.

1163
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,900
Yes,

1164
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,540
and look,

1165
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,400
David Apocalypse

1166
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,320
is headed this way

1167
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,140
and St. Andrew

1168
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,800
the Impaled

1169
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,600
and more and more

1170
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,160
they come.

1171
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,340
What would it take

1172
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,940
to get Circus Apocalypse

1173
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,780
back together?

1174
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,180
Two more bullets.

1175
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,220
Hey, hey, hey,

1176
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,600
yeah, yeah.

1177
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Whee, whee.

1178
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,320
Whiskey, he said.

1179
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,480
Whiskey and acid.

1180
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,360
That's a good combination,

1181
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,260
I would say.

1182
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,860
After...

1183
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,140
After a stroll

1184
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,060
through the rain.

1185
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,160
Philo,

1186
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,980
are you on the internet?

1187
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:46,920
No.

1188
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
Oh, he's jamming.

1189
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,800
He's got your

1190
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,200
synthesizer up.

1191
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,160
Well, why don't I

1192
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,540
start playing my video game?

1193
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,240
We'll be even.

1194
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,600
I can play.

1195
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,580
Are you saying

1196
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,780
I can't play and talk

1197
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,260
at the same time?

1198
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,020
Yeah, you can play and talk.

1199
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,960
He does this at the show

1200
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,880
all the time, Doug.

1201
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,760
He whips out

1202
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,360
his electronic doodads

1203
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,480
and twiddles them

1204
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,520
all through the broadcast.

1205
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,600
I know.

1206
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,260
And he reads

1207
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,040
from Wikipedia

1208
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,400
as if he was just...

1209
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,340
As if he knew

1210
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,140
all this stuff.

1211
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,900
He also keeps me honest

1212
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,340
by looking up

1213
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,100
everything I say.

1214
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,420
I may as well have

1215
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,540
composed Wikipedia myself.

1216
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,860
He looks up

1217
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,380
what I say

1218
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,700
and keeps it on.

1219
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,220
I probably did, you know,

1220
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,920
just do great

1221
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,780
sections of it.

1222
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,260
I could have,

1223
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:24,900
you know.

1224
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,840
Anybody can.

1225
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,080
You all can.

1226
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,400
I'm a Wikipedia editor.

1227
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,380
You are?

1228
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,400
Yeah, I keep putting

1229
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,540
your name back

1230
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,400
into that article.

1231
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,640
Those assholes.

1232
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,140
Who keeps pulling it out?

1233
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,000
That's the question.

1234
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,700
Wikipedia is like,

1235
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,560
unfollowers.

1236
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,020
Facebook,

1237
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,640
Mermadons.

1238
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,220
Wikipedia editors.

1239
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,060
Other than you,

1240
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,900
Reverend Stang,

1241
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,660
and any of you

1242
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,080
people in the audience here,

1243
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,600
of course,

1244
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,240
not included.

1245
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,220
But other than that,

1246
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,320
they're the most

1247
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,920
lowest lives on Earth.

1248
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,500
They're the scumbags.

1249
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,520
Oh, Reverend N. Carrick.

1250
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,700
He babysits

1251
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,060
the subgenius entry

1252
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,640
in Wikipedia

1253
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,680
and fixes it

1254
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,840
when the jealous people

1255
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,360
Thank God for his good work.

1256
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,700
Anybody can go in there

1257
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,220
and just write

1258
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
all kinds of lies.

1259
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,060
Regular people

1260
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,760
have had trouble

1261
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,860
getting their lies

1262
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,640
out of there,

1263
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,140
you know?

1264
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,320
Just regular,

1265
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,680
normal,

1266
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,420
everyday people.

1267
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,640
Kill them all.

1268
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,540
Fortunately,

1269
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,820
many people think

1270
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,440
that there's some

1271
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,140
special admin privilege

1272
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,900
they have to have

1273
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,500
to get in there.

1274
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,560
No, not so.

1275
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
And, in fact,

1276
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,580
there's no complicated

1277
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,840
machinery to buy

1278
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,820
and you can start

1279
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,300
at once.

1280
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,860
You can go in there

1281
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,020
and really destroy

1282
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,960
all kinds of

1283
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
Wikipedia pages.

1284
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,340
But they're ready

1285
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,740
for you.

1286
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,160
Whenever our page

1287
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,060
is vandalized

1288
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,460
in Wikipedia,

1289
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,500
it's fixed again.

1290
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,160
Very quickly.

1291
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,200
Thanks, Ankara.

1292
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,100
Yes, all hail

1293
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,680
Ankara.

1294
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,320
So, now that

1295
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,100
we've given credit

1296
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,900
where credit is due.

1297
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,100
Is there someone here

1298
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,180
that does that for us?

1299
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,920
Now, this is

1300
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,380
when the ladies

1301
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,840
are all supposed

1302
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,940
to get undressed, right?

1303
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,740
If not the guys.

1304
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,380
Oh, wow, look at them go!

1305
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,600
There they are.

1306
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,060
See?

1307
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,300
Not you, Susie.

1308
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,920
Um, remember.

1309
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1310
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1311
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:07,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1312
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1313
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,380


1314
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1315
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:08,680


1316
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:08,680


1317
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:08,680


1318
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:08,680


1319
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,760
spontaneous expression

1320
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
of pure joy

1321
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,840
that we've come

1322
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,120
to love and expect.

1323
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,020
Well, yeah,

1324
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,500
it's too bad

1325
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,260
the radio audience

1326
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,980
can't see

1327
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,300
this endless display

1328
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,900
of naked,

1329
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,260
uh, female

1330
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,140
and similar clothes.

1331
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
The parade of

1332
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,700
pulchritude

1333
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,340
now taking place.

1334
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,180
Yes, sir,

1335
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,920
look at them go.

1336
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,820
Easy on the eyes.

1337
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,020
Next topic.

1338
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,420
Yeah, that's like

1339
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,440
looking at YouTubes

1340
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,000
on the radio.

1341
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,340
Yes.

1342
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,740
It's unfair.

1343
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,360
It's mean.

1344
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:34,840
Uh-huh.

1345
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,780
On the radio.

1346
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,100
Radio.

1347
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,720
No one can

1348
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,680
see you.

1349
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:38,680


1350
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:38,680


1351
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:38,960
You scream.

1352
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,100
Dr. Drummond,

1353
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,680
do you think

1354
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,320
we will ever

1355
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,580
get puzzling evidence

1356
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,000
to come out to X-Day?

1357
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,620
I don't think so.

1358
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,420
Never?

1359
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,320
Never?

1360
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,220
Never?

1361
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,520
He's afraid

1362
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,560
that he wouldn't

1363
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,540
get his butt

1364
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,420
kissed enough.

1365
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,640
Well, he could be.

1366
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,040
It might be such

1367
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,100
a terrible,

1368
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,740
and plus,

1369
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,920
the reality,

1370
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,100
you know,

1371
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,540
of the,

1372
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,840
the church.

1373
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,920
Yes, it's

1374
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,480
scary to some.

1375
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,560
One thing to hear it

1376
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
as a form of audio,

1377
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,180
but to experience it

1378
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,980
in the fully

1379
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,680
sensitive,

1380
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,320
sensual fashion

1381
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,780
might be more

1382
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
even than puzzling

1383
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,560
evidence could do,

1384
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,300
but I doubt it.

1385
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,520
I think he's adaptable.

1386
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,500
Was I just hearing that?

1387
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,900
Yeah.

1388
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,120
Did that again?

1389
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,260
This is what

1390
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,740
Philo,

1391
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,280
what happens

1392
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,060
when Philo plays

1393
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,100
with his belly button.

1394
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,240
It makes these sounds.

1395
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,460
True slack

1396
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,640
is by definition

1397
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,700
indefinable,

1398
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,580
a kind of

1399
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,740
direct perception,

1400
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,240
unfettered

1401
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,480
by common sense.

1402
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,820
It is not

1403
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,840
mere laziness.

1404
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,680
It is a

1405
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,780
rather a kind of

1406
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,140
active sloth.

1407
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,700
Slack is different

1408
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,340
for each person.

1409
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,940
One might call it

1410
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,040
something for nothing,

1411
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,980
but the normals,

1412
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,240
the mediocretins,

1413
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,560
the somnambulax

1414
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,980
and pseudo subslans

1415
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,240
have tried

1416
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,100
to make it

1417
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,880
something that

1418
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,460
we have been led

1419
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,880
to believe

1420
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
we must work

1421
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,920
to buy.

1422
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,360
And this is

1423
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,080
a terrible error.

1424
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,340
That's the sign

1425
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,440
of false slack.

1426
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,540
If you have to

1427
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,360
spend your days

1428
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,860
in meaningless toil

1429
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,280
to buy

1430
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,460
meaningless objects

1431
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,360
which will

1432
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,120
allegedly

1433
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
improve your

1434
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,340
meaningless leisure,

1435
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,460
you are on

1436
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,260
the wrong path

1437
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,480
and you're buying

1438
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,300
false slack

1439
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,320
merchandised

1440
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,820
and manufactured

1441
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,640
by the conspiracy.

1442
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,340
True slack

1443
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,020
is instantly

1444
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,860
recognizable

1445
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,140
and discernible.

1446
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,260
By the way,

1447
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,360
there's a misprint

1448
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,220
here in this

1449
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,180
sacred book.

1450
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:29,840
Oh, you were

1451
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,620
reading that.

1452
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,260
I thought you

1453
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,240
had watched Arise.

1454
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,580
I thought you

1455
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:32,760
memorized that.

1456
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,360
I was like,

1457
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:33,920
what the...

1458
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,020
It's a quote from Arise,

1459
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,600
but look at this

1460
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,420
important misspelling here.

1461
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:37,880
Yeah,

1462
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,980
I tried to fix

1463
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,380
some of those

1464
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,040
pseudo-sub-slans.

1465
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,720
The author of this book

1466
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
simply wasn't well...

1467
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,700
about slans.

1468
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,500
No, they don't know

1469
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,520
about slans

1470
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,340
who are the future

1471
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,080
super-intelligent race

1472
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,020
which will supplant

1473
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,740
the human race,

1474
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,680
supposedly.

1475
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,740
Not slans,

1476
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,900
as it says

1477
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,500
in the book.

1478
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,240
But not everybody

1479
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,800
can follow

1480
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,780
the quick,

1481
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,800
flea-hopping,

1482
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,700
adroit wit

1483
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,860
of the font

1484
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,420
of creativity

1485
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,620
known as

1486
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,180
the church

1487
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,200
of the subgenius.

1488
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,880
Then we get to

1489
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,060
Revelation X,

1490
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,320
which was born

1491
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,900
in a night

1492
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,080
to perish in a night

1493
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,720
while the soul

1494
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,400
slept in beams of light.

1495
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,880
If you didn't get it,

1496
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,560
too bad,

1497
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,380
because now

1498
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
it's very hard

1499
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,800
to get your little tentacles

1500
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
on a copy

1501
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,980
of Revelation X.

1502
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,980
It is?

1503
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,720
Yes, it is.

1504
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,980
Because you have to...

1505
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,120
I thought it would go

1506
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,160
for $999

1507
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,260
on Amazon once.

1508
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,300
Yes, you have to do

1509
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,420
something to get it.

1510
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,400
No, some days

1511
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,760
it's only 35 cents,

1512
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,620
but then it'll be

1513
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,360
$1,000 the next day.

1514
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,860
There are a lot of

1515
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,080
There are peaks

1516
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,000
and valleys.

1517
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,380
Of course,

1518
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,220
a meaningless

1519
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,160
palimpsest

1520
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,580
created by

1521
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,200
industrious demons

1522
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,420
in the lower circles

1523
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,900
of hell.

1524
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,020
So, speaking of slack,

1525
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,260
I got up on stage

1526
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,020
last night

1527
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,940
and ranted about

1528
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,160
how I can't rant

1529
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,920
because I have

1530
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,640
too much slack.

1531
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,700
I can only rant

1532
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,220
about how much

1533
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,200
slack I have now

1534
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,300
because my life

1535
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,100
is turned around

1536
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,720
and it's not

1537
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,680
hellish and terrible

1538
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,240
at all.

1539
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,580
And it's proof

1540
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,120
that there are

1541
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,840
such things

1542
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,460
as old bastards

1543
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,280
with slack.

1544
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
And I want to

1545
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,980
formally announce

1546
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,260
for the first time

1547
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,100
and congratulate

1548
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,120
Dr. Drummond,

1549
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,940
he officially retired

1550
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,040
from that conspiracy job.

1551
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,020
He's never going

1552
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,780
to frop at work again.

1553
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,120
He had the ultimate

1554
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,300
conspiracy job

1555
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,760
and now he does not.

1556
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,900
I'm never going

1557
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,280
to frop at work again.

1558
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,860
That's how he told

1559
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,320
his brother

1560
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,520
he had quit his job.

1561
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,600
Actually, I said it

1562
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,140
like this.

1563
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,000
Miss him.

1564
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,480
Hey, man,

1565
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm never going

1566
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,840
to frop at work again.

1567
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:37,840


1568
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,140
And he goes,

1569
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,420
why?

1570
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,020
What happened?

1571
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,280
I said,

1572
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,120
because this is

1573
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,980
my last day

1574
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,720
and I'm fropping

1575
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,320
right now.

1576
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,380
So I can't do it again

1577
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,000
because I'm already

1578
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,560
doing it.

1579
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,480
No more weapon sales

1580
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,760
from Dr. Drummond

1581
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,040
because those terrorists

1582
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,660
and Russians

1583
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,580
want more good weapons.

1584
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,240
They're going to have to

1585
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,740
It's good to wash

1586
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,620
my hands of all

1587
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,580
those dirty deals

1588
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,720
and stuff, you know.

1589
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,560
Turn my back

1590
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:00,820
and

1591
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,540
You know,

1592
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,240
when Princess Wee

1593
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,260
left

1594
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,940
Horrible stuff

1595
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,280
I had to do for Bob.

1596
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
I was doing it for Bob,

1597
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,740
you know.

1598
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,740
That's the

1599
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,440
price you pay

1600
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,240
sometimes.

1601
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,200
Work a conspiracy

1602
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,760
job.

1603
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,800
Look at this

1604
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
bad misspelling.

1605
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,060
Ken Kesey

1606
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,900
became a member

1607
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,420
of the Church

1608
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,200
of the Subgenius.

1609
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
K-E-Y-S-E-Y.

1610
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,240
Some proofreader

1611
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,780
should go

1612
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,380
through this material.

1613
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,760
How do you catch it?

1614
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,840
The author

1615
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,640
is supposed

1616
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,340
to be here,

1617
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,620
Reverend Lee Seifer.

1618
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,500
Well, of course,

1619
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,180
some slight

1620
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,000
variation

1621
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,220
occurs in every text.

1622
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,060
Well, he wants us

1623
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,640
to point out

1624
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,340
those things

1625
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
to make it perfect.

1626
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,540
For future editions.

1627
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:36,580
Although he's already

1628
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,580
got his Ph.D.

1629
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,460
so who cares?

1630
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,440
Well, because one

1631
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,480
should polish the

1632
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,040
apple

1633
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,060
when one can.

1634
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,040
Anytime?

1635
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,920
Yes, that's right.

1636
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,280
Not polish the knob.

1637
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh.

1638
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,120
Polish the

1639
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,580
surface.

1640
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,560
Shucks.

1641
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,280
Look, it's just

1642
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,240
playing itself now.

1643
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,020
Yes, it hardly

1644
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,780
needs a human

1645
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,220
anymore.

1646
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,160
It's found

1647
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,860
its own way.

1648
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:02,860
That little

1649
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,920
artificial intelligence

1650
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,700
program

1651
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,880
ropes its way

1652
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,180
along.

1653
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,700
Smar it.

1654
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,120
And it'll go on

1655
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,060
forever if you

1656
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,980
don't do something

1657
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,200
to get it out

1658
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,900
of its jag.

1659
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,020
So which song

1660
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,660
are we going to do

1661
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,620
of some of our old hits

1662
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,220
tonight?

1663
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,340
I've got,

1664
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,220
yeah, I was thinking

1665
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,740
we'd do,

1666
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,760
just go through

1667
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,460
the first side

1668
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,920
of the first album.

1669
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,300
Some of our

1670
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,100
forgotten classics?

1671
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,840
Yeah.

1672
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,500
Oh,

1673
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,300
Split the Anus

1674
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,080
of a Mooney.

1675
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,200
It cost five dollars.

1676
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,120
Would you tell me

1677
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,340
if your face is on fire?

1678
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,500
Some of those, right?

1679
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:37,700
Yeah.

1680
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,420
The old, the old

1681
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:38,660
classic.

1682
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,680
What about

1683
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,120
Who Threw the Overalls

1684
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,400
in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?

1685
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,300
No, we didn't do that one.

1686
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,120
Lacking.

1687
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,240
Sadly lacking.

1688
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,960
But I guess

1689
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,660
it's not politically

1690
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,720
correct anymore

1691
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,940
to make fun

1692
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,000
of those Irish people.

1693
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,580
The Bing Crosby version

1694
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,720
was once very popular

1695
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,780
in this land.

1696
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,380
Irish people

1697
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,400
have thick skin.

1698
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,580
Yes, they do.

1699
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,140
Those beet,

1700
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,240
bog, potato,

1701
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,900
pick and mix.

1702
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,940
Oops, did I say that?

1703
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,620
Yeah, Negi likes

1704
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,360
the old ways,

1705
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,160
old ways.

1706
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:07,980
List list.

1707
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,800
All right,

1708
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,660
now we are going

1709
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,420
through archives.

1710
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,360
Let's do, yeah,

1711
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,180
Louie Louie.

1712
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:12,980
I like that one.

1713
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,260
Louie Louie.

1714
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,200
Are you a girl

1715
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,640
or a goat woman?

1716
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,480
Yeah.

1717
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
Why a goat woman?

1718
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,500
I still remember that one.

1719
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,520
We worked on the lyrics

1720
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,600
on that one for like,

1721
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,640
you don't remember

1722
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,260
that version?

1723
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,560
These Zombies

1724
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,940
in a Gada De Vida.

1725
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,100
Yeah.

1726
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,260
That's an easy one.

1727
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,080
By John Milton.

1728
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,400
Dance with the doctors

1729
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,080
or die.

1730
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,220
Yes, that all

1731
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,120
should take to heart.

1732
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,360
I don't remember that one.

1733
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:40,940
We might have to

1734
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,720
listen to that.

1735
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,020
Dance with the doctors

1736
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,600
or die.

1737
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,660
Oh, okay.

1738
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,640
Of course, I used all the,

1739
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,140
I edited this one

1740
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,400
so it has all of my,

1741
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
the ones with my lyrics.

1742
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,220
Right.

1743
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,440
If I had edited it,

1744
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,020
it would have been

1745
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,080
all my words.

1746
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,480
It would have been all Philo

1747
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,520
on the mic.

1748
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,280
Strange how that works out.

1749
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,040
We'll spare you

1750
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,220
by not playing this

1751
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,340
here.

1752
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,780
For the time being.

1753
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,800
Very provocative

1754
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,500
artwork.

1755
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,440
Well, we can't,

1756
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,960
we can't really

1757
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,300
cover,

1758
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,880
the old tunes properly

1759
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,900
because you forgot

1760
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,640
the drummer.

1761
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,540
Yeah, I did.

1762
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,240
I left the drummer

1763
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,680
at home.

1764
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,580
I had a great,

1765
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,740
I had great intentions.

1766
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,140
The best intentions.

1767
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,120
Well, we might get a

1768
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,220
substitute.

1769
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,720
I should definitely

1770
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,020
get credit for that.

1771
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,700
A fill in.

1772
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,980
I really intended to.

1773
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,340
The original doctor.

1774
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:23,880
And trying is good as,

1775
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,140
is just as good as doing

1776
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,660
sometimes.

1777
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,560
It was,

1778
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,040
it was,

1779
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,380
let's,

1780
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,400
it really is.

1781
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,220
No, it's not as good

1782
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,720
as doing.

1783
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,160
No, it's not.

1784
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,540
Trying, trying

1785
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,480
is just as good.

1786
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,300
My kids tell me that,

1787
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,300
but dad, I tried.

1788
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,620
Don't you,

1789
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,560
don't I get a little bit

1790
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,860
of credit just for trying?

1791
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,860
Dad, come on,

1792
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,240
don't.

1793
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,140
No, describe it.

1794
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,760
And I have to admit

1795
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,640
that, yeah, okay,

1796
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,360
I'll give you a,

1797
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,680
I'll give you a little,

1798
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,520
just, you know,

1799
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,620
if it was a dollar,

1800
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,220
I'd give you like two cents

1801
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,720
for just for trying.

1802
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,160
But you'd get 98 cents

1803
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,760
for success.

1804
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
He's trying to make

1805
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,000
excuses for what,

1806
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,560
for forgetting the drummer.

1807
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,840
The doctor's

1808
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,660
for Wotan drummer.

1809
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,760
It was working.

1810
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,860
I was on a roll there.

1811
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
No, I'm going to go

1812
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,660
ahead and tell them

1813
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,220
what they're missing

1814
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,240
thanks to you.

1815
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,020
Very well.

1816
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,300
I'm a,

1817
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,360
I'm amazed that you

1818
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,340
still even have that.

1819
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,500
The drummer that started

1820
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,740
and ended every song.

1821
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,220
Yeah.

1822
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,540
It was a,

1823
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,920
you know,

1824
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,200
those,

1825
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,060
those little battery

1826
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,880
operated chimpanzees

1827
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,660
with the symbol

1828
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,460
that goes,

1829
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,060
and at the end

1830
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,300
they go,

1831
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,400
well,

1832
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,120
that was the drummer.

1833
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,940
But Philo's

1834
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,740
brilliant move

1835
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,720
was to put

1836
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,880
the chimpanzee

1837
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,520
in a box

1838
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,000
so that its elbows

1839
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,840
hit the side

1840
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,500
of the box

1841
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,720
and make it backbeat.

1842
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,260
So it was like,

1843
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,680
boom,

1844
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,380
pop, boom,

1845
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,060
pop, boom,

1846
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,660
pop, boom,

1847
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:37,980
pop.

1848
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,280
Ah.

1849
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,620
Plus he always

1850
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:39,880
And then we just

1851
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,920
put the mic in it.

1852
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,560
He would run out

1853
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,140
of batteries

1854
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,580
pretty soon.

1855
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,680
So the song

1856
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,460
always slumped down.

1857
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,560
We had to wind him up,

1858
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:46,840
you know.

1859
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,100
Yeah, it's a wind-up chimpanzee.

1860
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,760
All the songs

1861
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,080
were the same length.

1862
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,940
Clockwork mechanism.

1863
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,840
Yeah, they kept

1864
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,520
the song short

1865
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,640
because eventually

1866
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,480
the monkey

1867
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,060
would just kind of

1868
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,480
stop.

1869
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:56,720
Yeah.

1870
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,820
Make one last

1871
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,480
fitful,

1872
00:43:59,520 --> 00:43:59,840
ah.

1873
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,300
Damn it,

1874
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,340
you left the monkey

1875
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:03,700
behind.

1876
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,380
I fucked up.

1877
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,380
Big time.

1878
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,320
With no rhythm

1879
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,200
track at all.

1880
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,420
Oh.

1881
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,140
Well, no,

1882
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,080
before the monkey

1883
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,900
we had coffee cans

1884
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,540
and spoons.

1885
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,160
Yeah, so we've got

1886
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,580
electronics now.

1887
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,700
Oh, yeah, but that's

1888
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,260
And devices.

1889
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,740
Like Ed Holmes.

1890
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,800
And we have

1891
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,880
Chaos McBobcat

1892
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,620
who can play

1893
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,280
those things

1894
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,600
and make lots of noises.

1895
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:23,820
All I need to make

1896
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,100
Wotan is these.

1897
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,980
He's in his

1898
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,920
second childhood,

1899
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,880
ladies and gentlemen.

1900
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,140
Aye, aye, aye.

1901
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,100
Oh, what a

1902
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,580
me, me, me.

1903
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,460
A noble mind

1904
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,440
is here also.

1905
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,940
Oh, that's one of your songs.

1906
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,760
Yeah, that's one of my songs.

1907
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,220
That was how

1908
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,960
Doctors for Wotan started.

1909
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,580
It's all about me.

1910
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,140
We were to tell me.

1911
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,080
We're caught up

1912
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,900
with all the extraneous

1913
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,620
words out.

1914
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,200
I mean, you don't need

1915
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,800
all that other stuff.

1916
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,600
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1917
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,780
We stole the clever name

1918
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,360
from Doctors for Bob, though.

1919
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,700
Oh, we did?

1920
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,280
Yeah, not the concept.

1921
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,840
Oh, the Doctors for Wotan.

1922
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,700
They were Doctors first.

1923
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,340
Yeah, we were mad.

1924
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,420
We were already doctoring,

1925
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,160
but we didn't have

1926
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,080
that title for it.

1927
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,120
We didn't have that title

1928
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,280
for it.

1929
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,120
I'm so very sorry

1930
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,640
that we ever printed

1931
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,980
the word anti-music

1932
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,180
in that book

1933
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,940
because I hate anti-music.

1934
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,740
You do.

1935
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,880
I like anti-music.

1936
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,540
I know you like anti-music

1937
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,400
and I hate it.

1938
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,380
I'm going to play

1939
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,480
some more now.

1940
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,100
I hate the fact

1941
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,920
that you love it

1942
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,140
and you've saddled me with it.

1943
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,200
For years, people have been

1944
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,740
sending me these horrible tapes.

1945
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,020
They're just horrible

1946
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,380
and they're proud

1947
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,040
because it's anti-music.

1948
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,500
We heard subgenius

1949
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,060
is all about anti-music.

1950
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:38,720
Ah.

1951
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,640
And well,

1952
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,700
as you sow,

1953
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,920
so shall he reap.

1954
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,640
Why, why, why?

1955
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,600
You started it.

1956
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,980
No, he started it.

1957
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,720
Just roll with it.

1958
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,600
Just roll with it.

1959
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,540
He started it

1960
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,920
and Sterno encouraged him.

1961
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,780
They were bad influence

1962
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,980
on each other's.

1963
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,540
Like, nasty little boys.

1964
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,360
I come to think

1965
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,120
of everything about

1966
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,300
the church's subgenius

1967
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:03,980
just reminds me

1968
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,580
of nasty little boys

1969
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,320
doing just what

1970
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,020
their mom told them

1971
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,760
not to do. Those brats.

1972
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,820
That doesn't sound like good, clean laughter

1973
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,960
to me. No, they're off hatching

1974
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,880
more of their devilment.

1975
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,840
I notice another anomaly in this

1976
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,720
book here. It says

1977
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,020
Philo

1978
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,980
Drummond's program is the puzzling

1979
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,680
evidence show on KPFA.

1980
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,800
It's all me. It is. That's me too.

1981
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,500
He started it. He interviewed you.

1982
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,920
Drummond reflects on his own

1983
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,960
audience here.

1984
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,240
He did interview me.

1985
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,180
He did. He talked to you.

1986
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,320
He got that information.

1987
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,080
He must have said, yeah, my show, the puzzling

1988
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,280
evidence show has been on since 1982.

1989
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,180
It's me. I've been doing it

1990
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,280
for a long time.

1991
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,000
Fortunately, puzzling evidence will never see this

1992
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,200
text, but it is unusual.

1993
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,240
No, actually, he didn't

1994
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,080
call me. I didn't actually lie about that.

1995
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,560
That's something that he did on his own.

1996
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,420
History is a game of telegraph.

1997
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,060
Everything gets changed.

1998
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,040
I think he interviewed me.

1999
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,140
He interviewed me by email.

2000
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:05,780
Right.

2001
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,700
Email? Well, that's

2002
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,060
doomed to be wrong.

2003
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,580
Maybe.

2004
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,140
That's the way you can get it all right.

2005
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,160
Oh, well, all right, if you say so.

2006
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,820
I just don't remember.

2007
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,840
The spell check is a robotic function which doesn't

2008
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,780
understand all your high-flying

2009
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,160
subgenius terminology.

2010
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,640
So we're being interrupted

2011
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,620
by electronics at the

2012
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,740
present time. It kind of

2013
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,480
strengthens us for the struggle ahead.

2014
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,500
It helps us gird our loins

2015
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,080
and put on our spiritual armor

2016
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,500
so we can thwack'em all day

2017
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,360
and all night.

2018
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,580
Whack'em, smack'em, sack'em.

2019
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,340
Smack'em.

2020
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,260
Sweet music

2021
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,720
makes a rainy sky seem clear again.

2022
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,020
It does?

2023
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,700
It's pretty rainy.

2024
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,540
It means...

2025
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,220
Sweet music makes a rainy sky

2026
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,420
seem clear again.

2027
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,300
So is there going to be a...

2028
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,960
Are you going to be on Half-Life 3, Dr. Howe?

2029
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,200
Huh? What?

2030
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,480
Is there going to be a Half-Life 3?

2031
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,280
Oh, that's proprietary information.

2032
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,320
Wow.

2033
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,580
I guess that means yes.

2034
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,520
I guess that means yes.

2035
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,000
Actually, I didn't find out it was...

2036
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,660
No, that means the project is dead.

2037
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,860
I didn't find out it was actually happening

2038
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,600
until I came to this camp

2039
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,040
where others more informed than I told me.

2040
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,900
Does that mean Dr. Kleiner

2041
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,460
won't have a role in the new game?

2042
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,880
Oh, Dr. Kleiner will have plenty

2043
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,800
of a role.

2044
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,100
All right.

2045
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:33,720
All right.

2046
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:33,920
All right.

2047
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,440
All right.

2048
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,480


2049
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,480
I just started playing it again,

2050
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,380
Half-Life 2,

2051
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,520
because they had an update.

2052
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,760
Are you having fun with that?

2053
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,280
The graphics were better.

2054
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:40,700
Yeah.

2055
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,980
Did you get to City 17?

2056
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,660
I just started, like,

2057
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,700
just before I left,

2058
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,560
because they had an update.

2059
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,520
Oh, cool.

2060
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,200
All right.

2061
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,220
Somebody had redone it.

2062
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,480
They have it now in Anaglyph 3D,

2063
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,180
which you can find on the Internet.

2064
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,680
And they have the PlayStation version.

2065
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,760
And they have Half-Life Opposing Force,

2066
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,340
which you might want to be

2067
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,160
on the other side.

2068
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,140
You get a little action

2069
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,340
every time I play, right?

2070
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,740
Well, no.

2071
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,200
I simply get an extremely generous...

2072
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,540
For those who are confused,

2073
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,820
the very popular video game Half-Life

2074
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,000
had Dr. Howell

2075
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,940
did voice talent on that.

2076
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,480
So he's...

2077
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,360
You probably get recognized

2078
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,720
for that more than for...

2079
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,960
Yes, but...

2080
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,800
Anything else.

2081
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,120
But that's just one thing.

2082
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,700
Can't live it down.

2083
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,660
One little thing.

2084
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,380
Can't live it down.

2085
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,220
It's like Princess...

2086
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,960
Princess, we and I went to...

2087
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,200
We were somewhere

2088
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,240
and these youths ran up to us

2089
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,420
and went,

2090
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,040
we know who you are.

2091
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,980
We know who you are.

2092
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,260
And I was expecting, you know,

2093
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,280
a subgenius fan.

2094
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,720
You guys do that Numa Numa song.

2095
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,480
And sure enough, you do.

2096
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,320
Or did.

2097
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,400
That's the only thing

2098
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,280
you're famous for.

2099
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:45,660
Well, we did the phonetic

2100
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,320
Numa Numa song

2101
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,620
where we took the original

2102
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,220
Romanian lyrics

2103
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,140
and changed them to English

2104
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,120
that sounded kind of the same.

2105
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,780
So that we sounded like...

2106
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,320
It sounded like they were

2107
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,780
singing along with us.

2108
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,840
Only the lyrics didn't

2109
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,080
really make any sense.

2110
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,900
It ended up being called

2111
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,720
Rather Bob Didn't Stay.

2112
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,800
And it got us in big trouble

2113
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,240
on the station.

2114
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,940
I almost lost my show

2115
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,920
because of that song.

2116
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,240
What?

2117
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,760
Sesame Street Lawyers called it?

2118
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,440
It's got nonsense lyrics

2119
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,780
and Princess We and Me singing.

2120
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,780
And for some reason,

2121
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,720
the phrase

2122
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,500
Rather Bob Didn't Stay

2123
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,140
sounded exactly like

2124
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,900
Go fuck the something something.

2125
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,480
I mean, the station manager

2126
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,220
heard it as having the word

2127
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,860
fuck in it.

2128
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,020
And he was seriously

2129
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,400
going to kick us off the air

2130
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,620
just for that one use.

2131
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,220
And it wasn't...

2132
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,220
I had to prove to him,

2133
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,460
no, that word is not

2134
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,820
in the song anywhere.

2135
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,100
Your filthy mind is hearing it.

2136
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,280
He goes, well, I played it

2137
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,260
for several people

2138
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,000
and they all distinctly heard it.

2139
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,100
I said, look, I'll show you

2140
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,040
a copy of the Romanian lyrics.

2141
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,520
I'll show you the lyrics

2142
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,580
we were actually reading

2143
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,840
and then listen to it again.

2144
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,580
And only when he was looking

2145
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,960
at the lyrics

2146
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,440
and hearing the song

2147
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,220
did he believe me.

2148
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,060
What a dick.

2149
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,240
That's why no one knows

2150
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,560
where he is anymore.

2151
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:13,920
He's gone.

2152
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,780
At least you got him to stand down

2153
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,380
before he was necessarily liquidated

2154
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,600
as an enemy of slack.

2155
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,120
Yeah.

2156
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,920
I think he kind of maybe

2157
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,080
didn't like what we stand for.

2158
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,700
took care of that.

2159
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,180
Yes, he was just fundamentally opposed

2160
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,600
to subgenius principles and doctrine.

2161
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,300
There's no room in the new world

2162
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:31,760
for such...

2163
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,080
Luckily, I've had at WCSB,

2164
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,860
we've been on the air there so long,

2165
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,160
even before I lived there,

2166
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,000
that several of the station managers

2167
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,240
are subgenius fans.

2168
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,020
One, this is the kind of thing

2169
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,660
that makes me feel young.

2170
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,600
This station manager, Sarah Corrigan,

2171
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,940
came up to me and goes,

2172
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,900
Stang, I just wanted to let you know

2173
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,940
I've known about Bob since third grade.

2174
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,820
They had a fire drill

2175
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,560
at my school.

2176
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,520
We had to go stand outside

2177
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,740
and do nothing for 20 minutes.

2178
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,760
And that was when,

2179
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,640
for the first time,

2180
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,100
I noticed that real high up

2181
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,960
on the edge of the elementary school

2182
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,280
was a spray-painted Dobbs head.

2183
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,140
And she stood there

2184
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,200
looking at that thing.

2185
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
The thing is,

2186
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,220
the woman I'm talking to

2187
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,940
is like 39 or 40.

2188
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,420
That seems old to a child.

2189
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,000
I get that a lot.

2190
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,880
My parents used to listen to your...

2191
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,540
Yeah, I used to listen to your show.

2192
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:33,640
I used to listen to your show

2193
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,600
when I was like 13.

2194
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,600
And the guy I'm talking to is 50.

2195
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,880
And that's when, of course,

2196
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,680
it's my cue to go,

2197
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,020
it's still on.

2198
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,080
It's still happening.

2199
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,220
And another one of our station managers

2200
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,200
had Bob's Dobbs head tattooed on his arm.

2201
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,460
So I knew we could get away with murder

2202
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,660
as long as we had subgenius station managers

2203
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,620
by chance.

2204
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,540
But I think our current one,

2205
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,380
is not.

2206
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,860
Has not been informed, regrettably.

2207
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,200
She is not.

2208
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:09,660
Regrettably.

2209
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,540
I've already gotten a couple of pink slips.

2210
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,560
How appropriate.

2211
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,040
Yeah, right.

2212
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,520
Yeah, I never thought about it.

2213
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,300
Pink slips.

2214
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,520
Yes, when pinks find fault with you,

2215
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,000
they give you a pink slip.

2216
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,000
That's another way one can always tell.

2217
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,460
I see these T-shirts all the time

2218
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,700
that say, I love pink.

2219
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,160
I'm assuming that's a band, right?

2220
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,080
Or a singer?

2221
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,620
It's a singer.

2222
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,580
But then there's also,

2223
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,780
Nenslo showed me in his house,

2224
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,320
he had a record released by one Joanna Galt

2225
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,940
called The Pink Life,

2226
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,700
where she sings about how the pink life

2227
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,680
is so wonderful and everybody should join it.

2228
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,520
What does that mean?

2229
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,680
Well, her name is suspiciously reminiscent

2230
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,920
of Ayn Rand's hero, John Galt.

2231
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,440
But whoever she is,

2232
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,440
she's a freckle-faced Iowa apple knocker,

2233
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,780
nobody,

2234
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,960
who put out,

2235
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,900
this record to affront the ears

2236
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,240
of all thinking people.

2237
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,080
But that song...

2238
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,560
That's the way a lot of pop music is.

2239
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,860
The pink life is an earworm.

2240
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,520
Once you have heard that song,

2241
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,920
it never goes away.

2242
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,140
That's another of its mephitic manifestations.

2243
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,220
I wish I could whip out,

2244
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,120
I'd love to be,

2245
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,760
I'd like to be a ding-a-ling.

2246
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,320
No, I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling.

2247
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:25,720
Yeah.

2248
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,960
Well, I could sing it.

2249
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,620
Frank Sinatra.

2250
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,420
I have it all to memory.

2251
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,540
I could sing it if you wanted it, but...

2252
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:31,940
Do it.

2253
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,880
All right, folks.

2254
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,580
This is from a duet by Nancy and Frank Sinatra.

2255
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,700
And it starts with...

2256
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,640
Getting stoned on sunshine

2257
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,840
Getting high on air

2258
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,920
Getting to it naturally

2259
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Really gets me there

2260
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,120
I've got such a high on

2261
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,720
Living like I do

2262
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,680
I'm so full of happiness

2263
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,460
I'm hooked on something new

2264
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,420
Life is such a trippy thing

2265
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,280
Hello birdies, hello spring

2266
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,980
Each day on earth is a day that's worth

2267
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,360
Remembering, remembering, remembering

2268
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,780
And I mean just what I sing

2269
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,800
Life is such a groovy thing

2270
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,160
Don't pity me, I'm proud to be

2271
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,120
Just a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling

2272
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,940
My pot is full of fruit

2273
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,780
Flowers, my grass is fresh and green

2274
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,660
My tea is brewing in the cup

2275
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,020
And still I make the scene

2276
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,400
But just don't try to change me

2277
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,720
I love this world I've found

2278
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,840
I've got to fly my own sweet way

2279
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,000
So don't you put me down

2280
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,900
Life is just a trippy thing

2281
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,760
Hello birdies, hello spring

2282
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,940
Each day on earth is a day that's worth

2283
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,360
Remembering, remembering, remembering

2284
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,400
And I mean just what I sing

2285
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,100
Life is such a groovy thing

2286
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,500
Don't pity me, I'm glad to be

2287
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,400
A ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling

2288
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,160
My, what was it?

2289
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,880
My Coke is Diet Cola

2290
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,780
My horse is Mr. Ed

2291
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,480
My down is in my pillow

2292
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,920
Where I lay my feet on the ground

2293
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:32,920


2294
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,980
My sleepy head

2295
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,140
My, what is it?

2296
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,160
My speed is 55

2297
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,240
He knows the censored lyrics

2298
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,700
Oh well, you get the idea

2299
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,220
That's a, yeah, it's a great

2300
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,020
That was, that was a

2301
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,360
Good job, Dr. Howell

2302
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,420
And funny, I just

2303
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,100
You sounded, I could have sworn

2304
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,740
Nancy Sinatra was sitting next to me the whole time

2305
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,480
Well, in a spiritual sense, she was

2306
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,440
Yes, indeed

2307
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,640
It's funny, I just had been playing around with that song

2308
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,820
Like a week ago, two weeks ago

2309
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,860
My Coke is Diet Cola

2310
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,520
My horse is Mr. Ed

2311
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,500
My down is in my pillow

2312
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,660
Where I lay my sleepy head

2313
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,900
Yeah, they're drug-free, I get it

2314
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,260
Yeah, they don't like drugs

2315
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,440
They like being happy

2316
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,480
And snapping your fingers

2317
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,940
They're high on money

2318
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,320
Well, that's the subtext, of course

2319
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,100
The fact that they're

2320
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,640
But then they say

2321
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,300
They act like they're the persecuted ones

2322
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,040
You know, just don't try to change me

2323
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,220
I love this world I've found

2324
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,740
Quit forcing your drugs and gay sex

2325
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:32,920
On me, I love this world I've found

2326
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,280
Quit forcing your drugs on me

2327
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:33,800
Yeah

2328
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,020
And, yeah

2329
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,740
Let me fly my confetti flag, darn it

2330
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,100
Poor Frank and Nancy Sinatra

2331
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,560
They are to be pitied, of course

2332
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,020
Everybody's doing it to them

2333
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:41,920
They're not doing it to us

2334
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,480
We don't really do real drugs

2335
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,840
Well, drugs turn you on

2336
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,140
But don't tell me what to do

2337
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,040
Or drugs turn on you

2338
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,680
God damn the pusher man

2339
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,500
Public service announcement from

2340
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,040
From Arizona TV had that

2341
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,580
But the weirdest of all

2342
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,520
Was one way late at night

2343
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,820
One night, St. Paul Mavridis and I were up

2344
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,480
And on TV came an anti-cappuccino public service

2345
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,440
What?

2346
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,320
In San Francisco?

2347
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,740
Yes, with black people dressed up

2348
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,100
As huge cups of cappuccino dancing around

2349
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,820
This must have cost money to produce

2350
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,800
That had to be

2351
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,940
You were probably tripping

2352
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,960
No, fortunately, Paul was there

2353
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
And saw it, too

2354
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,100
And we looked at each other with incredulousness

2355
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,560
They also had an anti-cappuccino

2356
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:32,860
And a coffee one

2357
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,960
But this was an anti-cappuccino one

2358
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,980
This was many years ago

2359
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,260
In the 80s

2360
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,760
But who got money for putting that on the air?

2361
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,880
In the very dead of night

2362
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,820
When only subgeniuses are up

2363
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,460
And churchyards yawn

2364
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,240
And gibbering phantoms twist

2365
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,760
In smoky wreaths above graveyards

2366
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,580
I read on the internet

2367
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:57,280
That the reason people get addicted to cappuccino

2368
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,120
Is because the gay pushers put male semen in them

2369
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,020
And that gets people hooked

2370
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,600
On gayness as well as Starbucks

2371
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,680
So only a house coffee is not suspect?

2372
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,920
That's what works with Red Bull

2373
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,660
They put the bull semen in there

2374
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,540
Or bull something in there, right?

2375
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,640
I never did care for that stuff

2376
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,300
These are just primitive folk superstitions

2377
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,380
You know, you go with what works

2378
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,460
People like that stuff

2379
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,200
No, you see what you're thinking of

2380
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,300
Is this kind of sympathetic

2381
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:32,700
Real big

2382
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:32,940
Magic

2383
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,920
Gosh, we're coming up on

2384
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,900
In Thailand, you know

2385
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,980
3 p.m.

2386
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,800
How striking

2387
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,420
What's that?

2388
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,400
The passage of time

2389
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,460
Oh yeah, yeah

2390
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,940
In fact, we've just run out of this hour

2391
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,180
Of slack

2392
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,280
Yes, more time

2393
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,760
There are more hours in the day

2394
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,440
But this particular hour of slack

2395
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,700
Has been brought to you by

2396
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,720

2401
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,780
And the year that the

2402
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,940
Crazy human idiots

2403
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,140
Called 2015

2404
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,840
But we know it's really

2405
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,400
Well, we hope it's

2406
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,940
1998

2407
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,800
Once again

2408
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,540
Well, last year was really nice

2409
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,600
Let's change the subject, okay?

2410
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,680
And change the tape

2411
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,020
Okay

2412
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,420
Yes, let's flip the cassette

2413
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,620
Okay, that's where the trumpet fanfare

2414
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,580
Insert here

2415
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,020
