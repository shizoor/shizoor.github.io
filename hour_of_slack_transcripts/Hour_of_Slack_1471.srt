00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,160
The Power of Slack!

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,140
The Power of Slack!

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,280
The Power of Slack!

4
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:33,140
The Power of Slack!

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,120
The Power of Slack!

6
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,120
The Power of Slack!

7
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,980
The Power of Slack!

8
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,940
The Power of Slack!

9
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,420
The Power of Slack!

10
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,140
The Power of Slack!

11
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,800
The Power of Slack!

12
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,660
The Power of Slack!

13
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,560
The Power of Slack!

14
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:26,960
The Power of Slack!

15
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:52,400
The Power of Slack!

16
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:06,760
The Power of Slack!

17
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,160
The Power of Slack!

18
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,160
The Power of Slack!

19
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
The Power of Slack!

20
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,420
The Power of Slack!

21
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,060
The Power of Slack!

22
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,560
The Power of Slack!

23
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,080
The Power of Slack!

24
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,580
The Power of Slack!

25
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,620
The Power of Slack!

26
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,360
The Power of Slack!

27
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,880
The Power of Slack!

28
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:51,140
The Power of Slack!

29
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,760
We can be summed up in one word, evil.

30
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:13,280
I am committed to defeating not only the good work of charities, but the values that will bring lasting peace.

31
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,220
And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world towards suicide and murder.

32
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,180
Let's roll.

33
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,380
I could swear I heard the emperor say, the goal of this war is peace.

34
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,720
He may have said some other things, but at one point he actually said the phrase, war is peace.

35
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,600
Friends, it's 1984. 1984 is 19 years late.

36
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,260
That means X day will be the year 2017.

37
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,160
Raise the bar! Raise the bar!

38
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,100
19 years, you've been in a vast, deep, deep, colorless sleep.

39
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,800
Stuck to the ground.

40
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,720
Down neath one of the baby incubators in Kuwait City.

41
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,460
Waiting to awake.

42
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,460
And yet you cannot.

43
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,980
Until 1984.

44
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,140
When your dreams come true.

45
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,700
When your brother is bigger than anything.

46
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,780
I'm tired and sad.

47
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,280
And I want you all to die.

48
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,620
Beware the toothless jaws of 1984.

49
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,500
I've been a waste of time.

50
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,380
I've been a waste of time.

51
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,340
I've fallen out of that mouth there and we might stay alive one more day in American

52
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,880
that.

53
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,600
A toothless.

54
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,380
1984.

55
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,040
Bob loves you.

56
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,380
Bob loves you.

57
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,440
Bob loves you.

58
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,140
Bob loves you.

59
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,360
Bob loves you.

60
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,800
Bob loves you.

61
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,000
Bob loves you.

62
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,960
Bob loves you.

63
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Bob loves you.

64
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,920
Bob loves you.

65
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,960
Bob loves you.

66
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,080
Bob loves you.

67
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,720
Bob loves you.

68
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:25,940
Bob loves you.

69
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,240
Bob loves you.

70
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,340
Have any favorite Bob songs?

71
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,820
God!

72
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,060
You're gonna cut off a lot of vital tissue.

73
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,700
Right, right.

74
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,680
So you think they're playing this song in Baghdad right now?

75
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,860
Or on the way to Baghdad?

76
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:45,400
I think on the way to Baghdad there's a lot of guys sitting in their foxholes, dreaming about their foxholes and crying in their boots.

77
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,140
Where's my...

78
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,580
Dreaming about those boot jobs they're gonna get when they're old enough.

79
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,540
Dreaming about those boot jobs they're gonna get when they're old enough.

80
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,540
Dreaming about those boot jobs they're gonna get when they're old enough.

81
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,620
Get their boots enlarged.

82
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,460
Shave medulla oblongatus.

83
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,500
They're gonna look like all the rest of the kids, only nobody knows they're gonna be different.

84
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,780
Way different.

85
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:00,900
Changed.

86
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,440
A different kind of tattoo.

87
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,240
Well, they get the free smallpox inoculations and the free tracking devices.

88
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:07,820
Well, they get the free smallpox inoculations and the free tracking devices.

89
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,620
Well, that tattoos your inner, it's pretty good, but that's not the whole of it.

90
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,880
That's only part.

91
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,340
Yeah, they get the holes too.

92
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,460
Yeah, well, that's only part of it too.

93
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,120
And then to tattoo.

94
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,840
And then to tattoo.

95
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,380
Are you ready for the fou-

96
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:29,080
Well, let's just call them...

97
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,820
...I know I do.

98
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,040
If I didn't have this collar on, Dave, I'd be wetting myself.

99
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,840
That's right.

100
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,680
If it weren't for this modern age I'd just be a vegetable.

101
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,960
Well, where do they put your chip?

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
All over me.

103
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,040
I mean, there are tons of them.

104
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,100
I've got a check for every organ that still works.

105
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,360
Did Papa Joe ever get that collar removed from his?

106
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,980
Nah.

107
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,280
His was embedded into his vertebrae.

108
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Did we ever get those collars removed from this show?

109
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,980
Those barnacles?

110
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,400
Those grafted-on tics?

111
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,500
If people remember the early days,

112
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,820
we asked each and every one of you

113
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,360
if you'd like to become a closer member of the show's team out there.

114
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
If you feel you are not properly sedated,

115
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,220
please call 555-3129.

116
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,820
Failure to do so may result in criminal prosecution for drug evasion.

117
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Welcome back to our program.

118
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,300
Please continue.

119
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,900
I believe most Pacific Islander parents like using products like hairspray

120
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,380
or glue as an inhalant to get high.

121
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm here to let other Pacific Islander parents know

122
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,420
we need to care about using more serious drugs.

123
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,020
If you need drugs or ideas on how to keep your drugs,

124
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,100
please call Bob.

125
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Welcome back to our program.

126
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,700
That was a lemur cut.

127
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,560
Tonight's collages are almost but not all by Mr. F. Lemur.

128
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,300
The second of the two Bush cut-ups heard earlier

129
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,820
was by someone named Edo.

130
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,120
At fuckitall.com.

131
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,860
The Star Spangled Banner was by Mark Mothersbaugh.

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,580
For your dating info,

133
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,360
this show was actually assembled on March 9th, 2003,

134
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,420
the year of duct tape and plastic sheeting.

135
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,700
Isn't duct tape and plastic sheeting just another version of duck and cover?

136
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,480
Duck and cover.

137
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,860
What did duck and cover tell you?

138
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,680
Duck and cover told you that if you just ducked,

139
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,420
when the bomb went off,

140
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,820
and put a newspaper over your butt,

141
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,980
yeah, if you just ducked,

142
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,900
just duck, duck,

143
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,460
oh, there's a nuclear bomb, duck,

144
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,840
then everything will be okay.

145
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,460
You will win.

146
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,240
Well, they were talking about amphibian birds at the time.

147
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,940
When they asked you to duck and cover,

148
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,660
they wanted you to run out to the nearest pond

149
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,940
and grab little turkey boy or a little quacky

150
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,180
and stick them under your shirt and carry them home.

151
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,500
And when they ask you now,

152
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,780
that's what the duct tape is all about.

153
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,260
These are all...

154
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,360
No, it's not.

155
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,360


156
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,360
These are all reasons to duck and tape subconsciously.

157
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,580
They are playing with your minds.

158
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,580
Duck and cover.

159
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
Duck and cover.

160
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,880
Gas is being used in this war.

161
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,960
Air raid sirens warn us of the approach of enemy planes.

162
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,720
But in addition, if gas is dropped by the enemy,

163
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,840
a special gas alarm will be sounded.

164
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,440
It will be a hand rattle or a hammering sound like the beating of a dishpan.

165
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,120
It will be a sound of a gunshot.

166
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,340
It will be a sound of a gunshot.

167
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,020
It will be a sound of a gunshot.

168
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,720
More gas is dropped from planes either as a spray or in gas bombs.

169
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,940
But should enemy raiders use gas against your community,

170
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,200
there is no reason for fear or panic.

171
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,220
Because if you know what to do,

172
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,260
you can protect yourself and safeguard your family

173
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,440
against the menace of gas from the air.

174
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,260
Of course that's Arcana.

175
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,500
You know what Arcana is?

176
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,940
Arcana is a gas bomb.

177
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,660
Oh, man.

178
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,220
Do you know what wisdom is?

179
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,620
Do you know what wisdom is?

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
Do you know the meaning of the einsoft?

181
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,360
Of the eye within the eye within the eye within the eye within the eye?

182
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,180
Are your balls ready to rumble?

183
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,980
Are they ready to roll?

184
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,680
Do you know the meaning of love?

185
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,440
Yeah, you pour me another mug of that there einsoft, would you, there barkeep?

186
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,240
You had enough, buddy boy.

187
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm going to catch you off.

188
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,160
You're babbling to everybody in the damn barn.

189
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Everyone's tired.

190
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm going to get you to listen to your own wisdom.

191
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,720
That's not famous for me.

192
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,000
I had a gold Akashic record.

193
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,460
Dammit, back in the day, everybody was doing my song.

194
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,860
Yeah, you got your Astral card right here, buddy.

195
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,180
It says that you haven't passed your limit,

196
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,000
and you've been around more times

197
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,580
than anybody else in this bar.

198
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,420
So could you please shut up?

199
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,440
Shut the fuck up, man.

200
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,120
What?

201
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,900
Stop drinking that wisdom shit.

202
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,160
Mm-hmm.

203
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,200
Don't be sucking on the wisdom shit.

204
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,040
to my ball. Too much is

205
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
always better than

206
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,580
not enough.

207
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm a regular.

208
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm a regular.

209
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,200
Oh, you're quite a regular

210
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,160
now, dear lad. Just let me

211
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,060
check further here.

212
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,160
What is the elliptical meaning of that?

213
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,280
There's only one eyeball.

214
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm going to chase you

215
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,340
with an elliptical eyeball

216
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,300
and then fork all around

217
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,080
and round and round and round.

218
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,160
Well, there's no

220
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,740
train of thought worth catching.

221
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,620
This time we're taking the express.

222
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,140
We're guilty of not doing enough

223
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,220
about the war. That just keeps coming.

224
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,180
I keep feeling so bad about not

225
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,220
doing enough. Well, you could suck

226
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,120
the cycloptic wisdom teeth and

227
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
then you would understand what to do

228
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,180
as Laguerre pronounces itself a bonus.

229
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,300
Which magazine should I subscribe

230
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,080
to that would, you know, be the

231
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,020
right thing to do? Martial arts,

232
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,840
survival,

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,560
mercenary,

234
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,260
merc,

235
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,900
magazines like that

236
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,300
that teach you use of small arms

237
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,740
and large feet. That's going to be

238
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,520
we're going to have to pull off some pretty big feet

239
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,720
to live through this, I think.

240
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,380
I mean, size 12. I was just going to learn to give

241
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,660
really good oral sex to great big tough

242
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,380
guys. That was how I was going to live

243
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,780
through the end of civilization.

244
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,480
As a sniveling pansy awaiting

245
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,420
for the trains of military to come

246
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,320
to town and to wait for one of those

247
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,760
I want them to say

248
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
that's the best barrel.

249
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
That's the best one.

250
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,500
You better hope no fish jump out of it.

251
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,520
The prisoner in that barrel.

252
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,600
I don't know who she is, but she's good.

253
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,300
You know it's not a woman, man.

254
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,760
Shut up.

255
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
Those are orgasmic.

256
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,340
That's how you get through the end times.

257
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,100
Unless you have the biggest gun.

258
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,080
You take your duct tape.

259
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,600
You take a big Hershey bar because that's

260
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,920
going to be a survival candy bar.

261
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,620
You want to be able to take small pieces of it.

262
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,900
You put the candy bar right up into your crotch there.

263
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,780
Take a lot of duct tape and just strap it right in there.

264
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,820
Is that the way you're really supposed to do it?

265
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,180
You're supposed to strap duct tape into your crotch?

266
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,840
I mean, the Hershey bar?

267
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,260
No, the food. Your trading materials.

268
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,500
Or the loin packs.

269
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,800
Those are actual things that are trademarked.

270
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,620
Yeah, because that's what you're going to use to trade.

271
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,440
You're not pouring chocolate into your crotch.

272
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,120
The natives or the surviving wretches in whatever country

273
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,600
far away from America that you flee to.

274
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,600
Mighty high.

275
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:35,600


276
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:35,600


277
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,160
My hydrated loin pack is leaking and I've noticed sores beginning to well around my knees.

278
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,840
The reason you have to flee America is because the Americans are taking over.

279
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,560
Yeah.

280
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,880
Yes.

281
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,300
I'm the political prisoner, man.

282
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,540
They're going to bring back the pillory and stocks and stuff.

283
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,700
Today, a U.S. nuclear fishing boat torn apart.

284
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,240
How one man's search for truth almost cost him his hate.

285
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,300
We'll see what happens next.

286
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,940
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this edition of Up the French.

287
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,780
It's not going to be pleasant.

288
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
I hate the French.

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,740
They'll always be ridiculous.

290
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,600
Yeah, the French are Nazis, as a matter of fact.

291
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,540
Lee?

292
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,860
Pat, a concern of several European terrorists.

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,400
Pat?

294
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,980
Lee, it's shocking.

295
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,160
The French Nazis build terrorism.

296
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,260
They are an instrument, an agent of terror.

297
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,200
Lee?

298
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,260
That's right, Pat.

299
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,960
Israel is carefully assessing CBN News Middle East correspondent, Christchill.

300
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,140
Right, Pat?

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,920
Well, it could be bloody blood all over the place and just that simple.

302
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,440
Lee?

303
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,040
Want good cranberries and cancer and heart disease.

304
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,800
That's too bad, Pat, because I was thinking about having a big old piece of bloodstream pie with disease on top.

305
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,720
How about the phrase, axis of Putin's soul?

306
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,100
It's in Texas.

307
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,220
No, not really.

308
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:01,680
Oh.

309
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,460
In Bosnia, they built a...

310
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,600
They built a...

311
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,320
It's a Mall of America in Bosnia now.

312
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,580
Well, they're working on Disneyland East, was what this guy on Altstar was saying.

313
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,900
Disneyland Far East.

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,040
That's what this is all about.

315
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,580
Disneyland East.

316
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,760
The largest Kmart in the world.

317
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:17,900
China.

318
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,540
Have you heard the new chain, Bag Daddy?

319
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,280
The pants and the soup at the same time?

320
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,480
That is a disgusting prescription for anyone without brain cells.

321
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,220
What's your...

322
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,280
Bag Daddy.

323
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,420
Wow, that's...

324
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,580
Huh?

325
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,140
So, the bookie's taking bets on when this thing is going to start, exactly when they're going to, like, boom, you know, go...

326
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,760
Yeah, they're laying...

327
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,400
They'll let the gates down and, you know...

328
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,580
They're laying the odds down.

329
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,760
When the first shot will be fired, and it won't be shot...

330
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,160
Sit down.

331
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,120
...from a shotgun.

332
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,740
We'll have nowhere to run.

333
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,900
We'll have nowhere to run.

334
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,000
And here comes Big Bad George.

335
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:50,880
Now...

336
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
That was a true honor.

337
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,460
That's what I'm saying.

338
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,340
And the military industrial complex.

339
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,720
...to everyone.

340
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:04,420
Speaking of strange showbiz, after the king of the universe spoke tonight, suddenly they cut over to saying,

341
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,660
it looks like we're in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden.

342
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,420
He's been spotted in the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

343
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,220
They're going to do it just...

344
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,760
They're closing in.

345
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,800
...and the smoke is blowing up behind us.

346
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,820
...you know, stick with our station.

347
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,940
They're going to do it just like cops, you know.

348
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,580
They're going to have the music in the background and stuff, and he's going to be running through, like, with a dachshund, I think, chasing and biting his ass.

349
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:30,900
And then when he gets up on the top of one of those, you know, old industrial warehouse buildings, and they pull him down, screaming and swearing in Arabic, they cuff him...

350
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,460
This is earlier today, down in Public Square.

351
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,680
Yeah.

352
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,600
What's that spell?

353
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,100
Yeah.

354
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,620
What's that spell?

355
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,340
What's that spell?

356
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
What's that spell?

357
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,640
What does it spell?

358
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,480
What's that spell?

359
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
That's the joke, right?

360
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,900
Just, what's that spell?

361
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,040
Well, come on, all of you big, strong men.

362
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,980
Uncle Sam needs your help again.

363
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,380
He got himself in a terrible jam.

364
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,720
We down yonder in the Baghdad.

365
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,920
Put down your guns and pick up a gun.

366
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,780
We're going to have a whole lot of fun.

367
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,440
And it's one, two, three, what are we fighting for?

368
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,440


369
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,440


370
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,440


371
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,440


372
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,440


373
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,160
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn

374
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,620
My next stop is Baghdad

375
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,200
And it's five, six, seven

376
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,980
Open up the pearly gates

377
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,020
Cause I just inhaled some anthrax

378
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,140
Welcome to life

379
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,600
Now come on, Wall Street, don't be sad

380
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Stang, you have such a perplexed look on your face

381
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,860
as if you'd actually inhaled anthrax yourself.

382
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,800
Actually, I was thinking about some of my buddy's kids

383
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,380
who were on their way over there.

384
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,480
Oh, I thought...

385
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,080
You know, I sometimes think about the soldiers.

386
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,000
Usually you're preoccupied with buds and squids

387
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,100
and now you're thinking about your buddy's kids.

388
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,300
How open-hearted are you?

389
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,180
You're not singing along.

390
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,700
I don't think you want to stop this war.

391
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,100
Oh, you.

392
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,140
Do you really take yourself seriously?

393
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,420
I have big teeth and big glasses.

394
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,300
We think you're stupid.

395
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,620
Ha ha ha.

396
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,720
You must forgive me.

397
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,280
You show your stupidity

398
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,060
by assuming that we're like you.

399
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,460
He almost passed out.

400
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,780
It's time to play Name Not War.

401
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,420
You're five miles south of Bogota City.

402
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,720
You're in the rain.

403
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,360
Oh my God.

404
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,100
What is...

405
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,920
What do the initials F-A-R-C stand for?

406
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,260
It's protest.

407
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,680
I think that's another reason they're having the war now

408
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,600
so that the protesters can't protest

409
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,820
because it's all zero degrees.

410
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,820
There'd be a lot more people out there.

411
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,920
Well, that's what the weather control people say.

412
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,720
It's ruining it.

413
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,620
Rubber bands and aluminum sulfide

414
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,120
do a dandy treat make.

415
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,880
Suspended from air get and left to wait.

416
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,580
Children who flop and children who flip

417
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,360
will freeze in the rain like a big old drip.

418
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,680
Wow.

419
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,140
It's about weather control.

420
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,260
It's about the Lusitania too,

421
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,980
but you've got to be a real conspiracy buff.

422
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,680
Cowboy poetry is so romantic.

423
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,940
I was going to play my mouth organ,

424
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,320
but I've been shamed.

425
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,180
Gets my heart all a-flutter.

426
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,380
As you have been shamed

427
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,120
by the grace of the Lord.

428
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,320
And...

429
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,740
This song is depressing, James.

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,120
It's depressing.

431
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,120


432
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,120


433
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,860
They stopped Bob from feeling...

434
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
War is depressing, Dave.

435
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,540
Stop thinking about all them body bags, man.

436
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,700
War is depressing.

437
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,400
That's all I can think of is body bag after bag

438
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,500
coming out in Arlington.

439
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,600
Yeah.

440
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,020
Back of those old planes.

441
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,660
Everybody's real gung-ho right now.

442
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,900
Everybody's real like, yeah,

443
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,660
this is going to be like the Super Bowl coming up.

444
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,980
Oh, yeah, wait till Zayn drop one of them chemical bombs.

445
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,520
On TV.

446
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,700
The right-wing jocks are going so crazy.

447
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,040
Yeah, wait till our boys are coming home

448
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,080
with their skin peeled off their faces.

449
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Yeah, and it's communicable too.

450
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,120
Up to 60.

451
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,560
Six generations.

452
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,900
We'll see how gung-ho they all are.

453
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,060
I think it's a pretty small everybody

454
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,680
that's real excited.

455
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,740
They wish they would have gone...

456
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,800
What?

458
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,820
What did you say?

459
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,060
I think it's a pretty small everybody

460
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,360
that's all excited.

461
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,380
I do too.

462
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,460
I think it's more bunch of people going,

463
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,960
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

464
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,560
No, a good friend of mine was telling me about...

465
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
But a good friend of mine,

466
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,260
he's a blue-collar kind of guy,

467
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,960
works a...

468
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,140
Oh, that's just some good

469
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,060
blue-collar work.

470
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,400
And he's telling me how all those guys,

471
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,020
they all listen to Rush Limbaugh

472
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,920
and they're all so...

473
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,560
Oh, those guys are crazy.

474
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,020
They're gung-ho about everything,

475
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,820
about it.

476
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,220
I was just going to tell you guys

477
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,540
something I heard on the mic

478
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,560
on the Savage show.

479
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,560
That guy is so nuts.

480
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,980
He claimed that a demonstrator

481
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,960
waded through a police line

482
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,260
and a line of horses

483
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,480
grabbed a horsey by its bridle,

484
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,360
punched it,

485
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,120
and knocked it down on the ground.

486
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,300
A demonstrator did that?

487
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,940
Like blazing snow.

488
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,520
We need those guys in back here.

489
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,220
Let's get back to promoting the war.

490
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,860
This is reality.

491
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,380
Reality.

492
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,380
Face the flag, you son of a bitch.

493
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,720
Take a good long look.

494
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,640
What you're seeing now

495
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,500
can't be found in a history book.

496
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,580
It's the present.

497
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,160
The future, son,

498
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,700
is being written now.

499
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
You're the one to write it.

500
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,000
The flag can show you how.

501
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,980
You know what it stands for?

502
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,220
What its makers meant?

503
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,420
Think to speak?

504
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,700
Privilege of dissent?

505
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,800
To think our leaders

506
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,040
might be wrong to stand and tell em so?

507
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,760
I've gotta touch a hangover of bureaucrats.

508
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,780
Don't push me.

509
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,620
These are the things that other men

510
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,580
under other flags

511
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,180
will never know.

512
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,440
But, responsibility,

513
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,820
that's the cost that free men must bear.

514
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,380
You know, if we had any moral character,

515
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,880
we wouldn't be standing here

516
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,100
covered with mud, drinking.

517
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,640
If you don't accept that,

518
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,460
somebody oughta belt you in the mouth.

519
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,120
Press the bell.

520
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,200
Only Mary, stageer.

521
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,660
A flag of stars and bars, of red and white and blue.

522
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,120
A flag that guarantees the rise for men like me and you.

523
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,300
Face the flag, son, and face reality.

524
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,220
My mind is a globe with whirling transient nodes of thought

525
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,520
careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.

526
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,100
Our strength and our freedoms are based in unity.

527
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,140
The flag is but a symbol, son, of the world's greatest nation.

528
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,120
As long as it keeps flying, there's cause for celebration.

529
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,880
So do what you gotta do, but always keep in mind

530
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,280
God has a hard-on for morality.

531
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,120
Because we kill everything we see.

532
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,660
Face the flag, son, and thank God it's still there.

533
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:19,860
Thank God it's still there.

534
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,720
WCSB.org if you want to hear it streaming live on Thursday nights.

535
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,240
And that features Princess Weechast Smith, yours truly,

536
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,280
Reverend Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

537
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,760
in Extreme Union with himself.

538
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,320
Extreme Union with himself?

539
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,460
A form of Tourette's Syndrome that affects people only when they call radio.

540
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,260
It's the Watson Hyde Syndrome, eh?

541
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,020
I found a note on my desk that said,

542
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,280
A witch with...

543
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,180
Tourette's.

544
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,520
A witch with Tourette's?

545
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah, and I can't figure out what the heck that note was supposed to refer to.

546
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,140
I want to see him go to war.

547
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,380
Was that a warning to myself?

548
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,660
I want to see him go to war just so that there's a lot of dead people all over the place.

549
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,280
You mean the awards in Baghdad?

550
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,920
Yeah.

551
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,820
Hosted by Jewel, Tommy Franks.

552
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,260
Yeah, he's gonna be the new...

553
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,520
Lots of dead people.

554
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,680
Of, uh, Arabi.

555
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,900
Chic Franks.

556
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,240
Can you see him with a cuff?

557
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,020
Cadeva eyes.

558
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,700
Forehead.

559
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,820
A caftan.

560
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,840
Oh, that's a pair of underpants.

561
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,920
Slice his throat.

562
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,060
Spice his head.

563
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,500
Get the barbecue ready.

564
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,600
General Tommy, your meat is my meat, Frankfurter himself.

565
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,680
He views the world as his hot dog.

566
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,200
Ready to be barbecued and served with a choice toxic mustard.

567
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,720
I want to be the mustard.

568
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,840
You are the mustard.

569
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,900
You're the mustard.

570
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,160
You're the glint.

571
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,440
In Tommy Franks' eye.

572
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,500
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave.

573
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,440
Look, it's the barrel of a tank.

574
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,580
And the juice is for you, darling.

575
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,980
We got news for you, darling.

576
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,900
Here's a tactical nuke.

577
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,240
Up your ass.

578
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,620
Jesus.

579
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,940
Get back, Baghdaddy.

580
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
Whatever happened to the Arabian Nights?

581
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Don't those guys have, like, genies and flying carpets and stuff?

582
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,120
Yeah.

583
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,560
And what about the...

584
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,220
Can't they, like, rub...

585
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,340
Yeah.

586
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,740
...this lamp and have hordes of scimitar-wielding, balloon-pantalooned...

587
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,700
Turban.

588
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,160
Yeah.

589
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,520
...Alibaba 40-feet-type guys?

590
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,400
What open sesame guys.

591
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,080
Right.

592
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,280
Open sesame guys.

593
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,240
People who make it happen.

594
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,560
Businessmen in boxer shorts.

595
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,300
Turbaned young fez drivers in Pocono Oriental cabs.

596
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,580
Small.

597
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,540
Medium.

598
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,240
And...

599
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,540
Large-sized shakes.

600
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,280
All your bones included.

601
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,400
You tried to kill my daddy.

602
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,440
I killed everybody's daddy, man.

603
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,760
They killed Daddy Junior.

604
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,020
Well, things aren't going to get better.

605
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,920
Tried to kill my daddy.

606
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,200
We did it all. We did it all.

607
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,560
We did...

608
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,420
Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills,

609
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:15,900
Dennis Bleary.

610
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,020
...Ludz Coke, whatever it was, we just fucking swallowed it, okay?

611
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,540
That's what we did.

612
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,500
Dennis Bleary.

613
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,840
He's Crispin Bleary.

614
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,920
He's that guy, right?

615
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,480
He smoked too many hockey sticks.

616
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,100
Er...

617
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,100
I think he owes George Carlin an explanation.

618
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,940
Really, he does.

619
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
I thought he was George Carlin until I heard him expectorate out the...

620
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,900
Out the back...

621
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,620
Out the back door.

622
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,300
Out the back...

623
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,800
What would Jesus do now?

624
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,140
War.

625
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,480
War.

626
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,040
War.

627
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,780
War.

628
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,120
War.

629
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,660
Healing.

630
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,820
Demons.

631
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,600
Racism.

632
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,720
Sexism.

633
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,740
Anti-Semitism.

634
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,140
Arab-bashing.

635
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,680
Anti-Islamism.

636
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,840
Gay-bashing.

637
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,400
War.

638
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,200
Britain.

639
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,700
Britain.

640
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,120
War.

641
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,840
War.

642
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,440
War.

643
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,940
War.

644
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,100
War.

645
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,620
Jesus.

646
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:53,900
Jesus.

647
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,480
Jesus.

648
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,100
Digitaleteria. Mental literacy.

649
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,780
You're dead to

650
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,240
YouTube Argoin.

651
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,520
I've cut you out.

652
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:22,520
There's a song going out for George endpoint meaning King of the Universe King of人民

653
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,600
I am only aelsian conflict is nothing but free and the enemy is a godhead are they

654
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Rey del Universo.

655
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,720
Rey del Cosimo.

656
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,860
El

657
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,200
Imperador de

658
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,460
Tutte Cosimo.

659
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,840
Pray for him to go up there

660
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,100
all night. Hear me.

661
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,380
The sound of my voice.

662
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,360
We must get that

663
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,500
Sadam.

664
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,980
And I've made my choice.

665
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,800
When y'all voted me sheriff,

666
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,820
I said I was gonna rid this town of the

667
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,320
environment. I'm gonna do it anyway.

668
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,380
I will conquer the Assyrians

669
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,680
with my funny fake

670
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,280
Kotean pharaoh hat.

671
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,300
You may think that I'm a fool.

672
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,820
The legend.

673
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,800
But you are a fool.

674
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,080
If you believe we can quack out of this maya.

675
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,020
Who gets the harems?

676
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,220
The harems? Yeah, the harems.

677
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,900
I've heard a lot about harems in those

678
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,160
palaces in Baghdad. No, I just thought

679
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,740
that was an esophageal grunt.

680
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,700
No, man.

681
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,960
The sultans would get

682
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,740
harems and there must

683
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,420
be harems. They don't have

684
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,560
sultans anymore in Iraq.

685
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,520
Well, there's always, yeah, right.

686
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,800
Just like they don't have kings here, right?

687
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,420
Right. It's an undemocratic

688
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
people's republic. Yeah, I suppose they do.

689
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,620
Yeah. Yeah. Sultans.

690
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,340
Yeah. Sultans of Swig.

691
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,180
Sultans of the ornament.

692
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,800
Chairman Mao had a harem.

693
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,020
Jack Kennedy had a harem.

694
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,620
And you, sir, are no Jack Kennedy.

695
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,820
I knew Mao Zedong, my friend.

696
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,440
Where's the, where did they give the pharaoh?

697
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,660
I know Mao Zedong. Actually, that's a

698
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,440
pretty old turf there. That's, you know, the

699
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,520
Tigris and Euphrates. Oh, yeah, that's the

700
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,500
oldest. It's the birthplace of civilization.

701
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,420
Yeah. They're afraid of the

702
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,600
fertile crescent. Yeah, speaking of

703
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
fertile crescents, that's the amount of

704
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,120
archaeological cool stuff

705
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,360
that's going to get buried a little

706
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,580
deeper. It's just horrifying. Well, that's

707
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,620
the hex theory. But that's up

708
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,780
to Saddam. That's up to Saddam

709
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,540
Hussein. It's his

710
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,600
choice. This land is

711
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,480
cursed by a Sumerian god

712
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,440
and you must get rid of it and

713
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,420
destroy it. No?

714
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,420
Only it was just going to get buried,

715
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,480
but you know it's going to get smashed to

716
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,620
smithereens. Just like that little ibex.

717
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,440
Which was the ancient civilization in

718
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
which the ladies did not wear shirts?

719
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,540
Oh, Manoa. Yeah, right.

720
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,280
The Manoans. Yes, my favorite civilization.

721
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,440
They had the cool labyrinths and

722
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
the bull-headed monster guys. They would ride

723
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,740
bulls and all the men would applaud.

724
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,360
And they'd make fun of the cretins.

725
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,960
Just like we do.

726
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,580
And we're on to North Korea.

727
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,840
Church of the sub-creatants.

728
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,740
That's what we should tell everybody over there

729
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,740
in the war zones tonight.

730
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,320
God's mitans!

731
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,700
That's what the Führer used to say.

732
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,400
And we're saying it again.

733
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,820
God's mitans!

734
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,860
It means God is with us.

735
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,520
God is with us.

736
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,640
Oh, yeah, sure.

737
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,640
They believed it in those days and they believe it now.

738
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,460
In the bowling alleys and parking lots

739
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,500
around America. In stubby

740
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,480
Sam City and Carl's Magic Theater.

741
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,640
Every place you might go and have your hair

742
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,940
tortured or maybe have your feet upturned.

743
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,460
They believed the Schmitt.

744
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,600
The Schmittagogical creature called

745
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,640
war takes care of everything.

746
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,500
A-sha-loo-la-la-la-la-

748
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,840
La-la.

749
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,980
A-sha-loo-la-la-la-la-la-

750
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,240
Bob.

751
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,380
Bob Akbar?

752
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,360
Bob Akbar!

753
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,720
He is great. Greater than my

754
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,300
shoe size and twice as

755
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,680
small as my cranium.

756
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,380
Bob!

757
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,820
Bob!

758
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,420
Bob!

759
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,140
Bob!

760
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,240
To begin with, it may be surprising to know that

761
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,300
radiation is invisible rays that we call radiation.

762
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,860
They are about the size of table salt or fine sand.

763
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,120
We don't worry about radiation.

764
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,940
Radiation would not affect us much, for instance, because any

765
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,660
material will keep the penetrating rays from hurting us.

766
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,080
Within an hour after a massive enemy attack,

767
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,100
fallout in the vicinity of any nuclear groundburst will be destroyed beyond repair.

768
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,460
Suppose a nuclear explosion takes place at 12 noon.

769
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,680
By 1 o'clock all the fallout is down.

770
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,760
If fallout settles on your food, the food itself isn't harmed or made radioactive.

771
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,920
Fallout swallowed accidentally with food or in drinking water would do you no good.

772
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,660
So we would not have to take precautions using everyday methods of food preparation.

773
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,160
And hungry people should not be denied animals because of possible contamination.

774
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:08,000
If we remember these facts, if we act intelligent, we can increase our chances of nuclear attack.

775
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,740
Many people have difficulty understanding how blood and tissues are pulled up into the mushroom cloud.

776
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,400
That's why the federal government has a nationwide program.

777
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,320
The goal is a raging nuclear furnace that shoots out showers of fallout.

778
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,140
Adequate fallout for every man, woman and child.

779
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,580
This goal can be reached.

780
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,060
For with radiation, we can face the facts about the nuclear age.

781
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:01,560
For headers and LSA's.

782
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,360
We need to reach out.

783
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,360


784
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,740
We must put the power back.

785
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:02,740


786
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:02,740

what the rules are, buddy.

795
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,860
One second.

796
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,600
You can't forget the rules.

797
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,800
Are you going to be a team player?

798
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,780
I'm watching the phone. I see no DJ.

799
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,400
Are you against us?

800
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,980
Private? Are your privates

801
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,280
private or are they mine?

802
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,460
I belong to you, sir.

803
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,920
Your privates are my privates and your privates are my privates.

804
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,980
Just keep your privates private,

805
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,640
okay?

Next week, it might be a very different

00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,080
situation.

I just

823
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,880
don't know what to do.

824
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,480
I thought I'd come and ask you.

825
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,620
Military action

826
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,360
to destroy them

827
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,620
with weapons of mass destruction.

828
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,540
Well, um...

829
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,600
This nation has weapons of mass

830
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,160

Well, thanks anyway for talking to me.

834
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,820
Well...

835
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,460
Why am I in London?

836
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,340
Because faith

837
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,160
is the only faith.

838
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,140

Love you.

854
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,620
It was another normal night

855
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,760
and I got done fighting with my wife.

856
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,580
So I went down to the bar

857
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,540
and just made all take and roll.

858
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,620
Since I was a little kid

859
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,260
they've been the two best friends

860
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,300
that a man could ever hope for

861
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,120
in this world.

862
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,780
Now I'm a normal guy

863
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,800
and I work all day for my money

864
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,220
and I fear the good Lord

865
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,460
like I know I should.

866
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,340
I ain't no new age coot

867
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,180
but I gotta get this off my chest

868
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,880
and put this tragedy behind me now for good.

869
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,720
I remember getting drunk

870
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,580
and I remember falling down

871
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,780
when someone laid me on a pool table

872
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,080
and I'd have been consumed.

873
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,180
Then through the blinding lights

874
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,100
two creatures stared into my eyes.

875
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,520
Is that the jukebox or a flying saucer

876
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,600
spinning round the room?

877
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,980
And I tell myself

878
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,940
this couldn't have been

879
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,940
no member of the human race.

880
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,720
Had to be them sex crazed

881
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,260
little green men from outer space.

882
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,120
Well it hit me like trouble

883
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,080
in the back of my head.

884
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,800
Knocked me clean out of my shoes.

885
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,700
And when I woke up Lord

886
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,260
I wished that I was dead.

887
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,160
I had got off the case

888
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,780
of those abduction blues.

889
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,340
This must have been an abduction Lord

890
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,900
cause I don't know what happened.

891
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,480
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue.

892
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,180
Now I say can girls look crazy

893
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,960
but I know that it weren't them.

894
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,640
Say the things that say can't do

895
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,620
would never do.

896
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,940
Well when at last I woke

897
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,900
both my legs they had been broke.

898
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,780
Both my eyes were black

899
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,600
and my ears was ringing bad.

900
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,880
I seen and done some nasty things

901
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,400
but this was the worst case

902
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,220
of intergalactic relations I've ever had.

903
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,340
And I tell myself

904
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,280
this couldn't have been

905
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
no member of the human race.

906
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,060
Had to be them sex crazed

907
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,600
little green men from outer space.

908
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Cause it hit me like a shovel

909
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,340
in the back of my head.

910
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,140
Knocked me clean out of my shoes.

911
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,840
And when I woke up

912
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,200
I was in the middle of the floor

913
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,760
and I wished that I was dead.

914
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,640
I had got off the case

915
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,360
of those abduction blues.

916
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,600
This must have been an abduction Lord

917
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,100
cause I don't know what happened.

918
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,800
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue.

919
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,500
Now I say can girls look crazy

920
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,240
but I know that it weren't them.

921
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,060
Say the things that say can't do

922
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,360
would never do.

923
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,800
Never do.

924
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,100
The Ballad of Zeke and Earl.

925
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights

926
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,980
from Interstellar Cattle Drive.

927
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,080
Friends that's www.swervingheadlights.com

928
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,220
Before that,

929
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,360
Lemur collages.

930
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,300
War is hell my friends.

931
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,240
But Bob brings hope and confusion.

932
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,260
We're in July for all we know.

933
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,100
They might have turned everything.

934
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,800
We don't even know if this is Earth, man.

935
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,360
No, we don't even know if the polar caps

936
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,860
are the same ones we're wearing.

937
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,360
In fact, this might for all we know

938
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,300
be a hideously polluted Mars.

939
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,700
And what we call Mars

940
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,040
is the Earth left behind

941
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,520
after we polluted it the first time.

942
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,080
Or they polluted it.

943
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,060
I had the same,

944
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,380
I had a parallel thought.

945
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,700
I won't say that the parallel lines met,

946
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,340
but I had a parallel thought

947
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,300
that they had gone into our brains

948
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,840
deep into our corpus callosum

949
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,060
and the other pithy parts

950
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,040
and they had reprogrammed everything

951
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,100
to such a point

952
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,980
that I was looking out my window

953
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,340
and I was on another planet

954
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,140
and we had all been moved in our sleep.

955
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,800
Well, it wasn't us.

956
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,440
It was the powers that be.

957
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,480
The big guys, you know,

958
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,380
the ones that weigh over 500, 600 pounds.

959
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,400
Not to mention the ones

960
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
inside your own head, dude.

961
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,380
Well, they don't live in Telemetry City

962
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,840
and they don't give me commands.

963
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,020
The ones in my head, dude.

964
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,880
Do you remember how to get to Shell Beach?

965
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,820
Yeah, it was very distinctly a Shell Beach.

966
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,760
Shell Beach is experience.

967
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,240
Right, like that movie Cool City

968
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,420
or Dark City or Dark Coolness

969
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,260
or whatever it was.

970
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,840
Night Town.

971
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,800
Night Town, yeah.

972
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,820
Going down to Night Town.

973
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,420
Hey, but I think the big news of the week

974
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,760
is really that Pioneer 10 winked off.

975
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
He knows how to cue.

976
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,000
He knows.

977
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:34,940
Pioneer.

978
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,040
Pioneer 10, 28 years out there.

979
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,620
And it's out there now,

980
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,020
right this very moment,

981
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,720
there's a piece of us booking out.

982
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,080
And it's out there now,

983
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,080


984
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,680
out of the solar system.

985
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,180
And it's manned by two kielbases

986
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,300
and a piece of pie.

987
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,140
And that is science, man.

988
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,020
That is the expansion

989
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,920
of our ever-lessened,

990
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,240
ever-pubescent,

991
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,300
lusty waves.

992
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,040
20,000 years from now,

993
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,080
a robot will find it

994
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,960
and sell it on eBay for billions

995
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,560
because it will be the oldest known thing

996
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,920
built by the extinct human race.

997
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,240
That is well said

998
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,520
because I thought you were going to say

999
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,380
he's going to smell it

1000
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,200
and sell it to an ape

1001
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,360
and start it all over again.

1002
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,500
You know, that's how it usually starts.

1003
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,000
Well, that may be how it started at one point,

1004
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,560
but I personally don't think so.

1005
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,420
So many lines converging.

1006
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,740
I think that the Yeti's force evolved the humans

1007
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,300
so that they would send that Pioneer thing

1008
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,160
out into space.

1009
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
It smells like rotting garbage, though.

1010
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,580
To the country western singers in outer space.

1011
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,800
Yeah, and Johnny Paycheck died.

1012
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,980
Well, we talked about that last week.

1013
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,320
Yeah.

1014
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,800
Well, he actually fell asleep

1015
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
and nobody's been able to wake him up yet,

1016
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,960
so they threw a big old wake

1017
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,200
and they tossed him in the earth.

1018
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,420
Is this this week's show or last week's show?

1019
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,660
I don't know anymore.

1020
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,380
I can't tell.

1021
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,300
Johnny Cash's birthday was this today

1022
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,400
or a week ago today?

1023
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,640
Is it January or is it Julyuary?

1024
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,460
It's one of those...

1025
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,420
70 years old.

1026
00:45:59,560 --> 00:45:59,800
...weary days.

1027
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,260
How old was Johnny?

1028
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,160
Your babies grow up to be couples.

1029
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,400
Mamas don't let your babies...

1030
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,780
Don't let them smoke friends.

1031
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,840
...drop and dress up like girls.

1032
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,600
...grow little titties and go on girls.

1033
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,920
Don't make them grow little titties.

1034
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,800
We'll try not, Mamas.

1035
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,480
Don't tell them not to or that's just what they'll want to do.

1036
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,680
Mamas don't let your babies go to X-Day.

1037
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,240
Don't let them have operations that change their sexes.

1038
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,340
They're just sold out.

1039
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,320
It's a twisted, sick, demented bunch of people.

1040
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,440
Mamas, please.

1041
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,060
If you hear me, if your babies do survive the war,

1042
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,700
if they do come home from the war,

1043
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,940
don't let them go to X-Day.

1044
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,560
Because they never really come home from X-Day.

1045
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:47,900
No. No.

1046
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,460
They won't be babies no more.

1047
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,580
You think a war might spank their pootie?

1048
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,480
X-Day is going to spank their brains out.

1049
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,660
This will be the sixth X-Day or what we call...

1050
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,620
Sixth X-Day.

1051
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:57,660


1052
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:58,840
Sick.

1053
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,860
There will be some sick sex.

1054
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,900
There will be 666 sick sex monkeys.

1055
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,000
Spelled sick, sick, sick with S-I-C-S.

1056
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,500
S-I-C-S-S-S-S-S-S.

1057
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:17,520
Spelling out Bob with their butts mooning the sky for the satellites to read.

1058
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,180
And you'll be the quote marks on the end.

1059
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,940
I'll be the queen of procreation.

1060
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,860
Your two cheeks...

1061
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,540
I'll be the lizard woman.

1062
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,540
...pointing up at the satellites of Ashcroft...

1063
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,240
...will be the quotes on Bob's butt name.

1064
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:31,940
Attention!

1065
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,420
Attention!

1066
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,700
This is your beloved leader, Og the Exalted.

1067
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:46,060
There will be a special giant joy rally today at Og Memorial Stadium.

1068
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:56,500
First let me say that this trip was made possible only by our dauntless chief, Og the Magnificent.

1069
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,660
Introducer of Og Power, which runs most of our industry.

1070
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,520
Naturally, I protected government property by making the saucer invisible.

1071
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,680
Yes, I brought the secrets back with me.

1072
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,400
And here they are.

1073
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,060
The big secret is, of course, oil.

1074
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,020
Which has brought a better life to all the people in the USA.

1075
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,220
But the key to making oil work for everybody is competition.

1076
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,200
Fellow Martians, I thank you.

1077
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,680
You know what this means, Cosmic.

1078
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,060
You bet I do, Og.

1079
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,960
It means that you're through.

1080
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,280
So why don't you get lost?

1081
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:53,700
Yes, the real secret is not only a great source of energy, but also the freedom to make it work for everybody.

1082
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,800
And if you have both of these things, any goal is possible.

1083
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,720
It's Destination Unlimited.

1084
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,080
Man continually strives to replace the old with the new.

1085
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:19,840
A quarter of a mile high skyscraper's tower with convenient rest and recreational facilities for all.

1086
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,720
On many of the buildings are landing decks for helicopters and auto gyros.

1087
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,700
The new building is the new building.

1088
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:32,700


1089
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,880
The city of 1960.

1090
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,020
The city of 1960.

1091
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,320
The city of 1960.

1092
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:52,480
On all express city thoroughfares, the rights of way have been so rooted as to displace outmoded business sections and undesirable slum areas whenever possible.

1093
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,260
The queen of Norway.

1094
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,200
Somebody who had shown their nipples.

1095
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:57,800
The queen of Norway.

1096
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,240
Their nipples.

1097
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,380
If you show nipples.

1098
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440
Hey, wasn't there a giant bus?

1099
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:10,000
Speaking of nipples, I heard that like four days ago there was a giant crackdown on lifestyle shops.

1100
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,220
Oh yes, of course.

1101
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:11,620
Are we talking about nipples?

1102
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,920
All of a sudden Tommy Chong's website was an illegal terrorist act.

1103
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,280
Yeah, you can't buy Hembu or Peepurse or any of those fine papers anymore.

1104
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,740
No, you can't get nipple clamps.

1105
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,740
Right.

1106
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,780
And the electrodes that are affixed to your testicles now have to be color-coded.

1107
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,420
And there's like a warning that you have to sign off on it.

1108
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,420


1109
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,820
Or some sort of procreative gesture you have to make towards the wind.

1110
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,340
I don't know.

1111
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:36,500
It's strange.

1112
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,160
When will the superhero alien come and take us away?

1113
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,800
Stang, we've been waiting and waiting and waiting.

1114
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,600
Me trade.

1115
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,800
When will we recognize a salesman coming to take us away?

1116
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,580
If now isn't a better time than any, I don't know what is.

1117
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,280
Yeah, really, man.

1118
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,980
Don't look at me.

1119
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, we're trying not to.

1120
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:53,540
What do you think?

1121
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,400
I've got a Bob's phone number or something?

1122
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,020
But you're right there.

1123
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,640
No, no.

1124
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,600
I'm just a PR back, man.

1125
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,840
I'm supposed to go.

1126
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,860
We don't know.

1127
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,400
What will we do?

1128
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:02,740
We don't.

1129
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,020
We don't know what year it is.

1130
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,700
And we don't know.

1131
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,800
I know this.

1132
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,760
Bob said that the Exodus will come July 5th, 1998.

1133
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,900
Obviously, it is not yet July 5th, 1998.

1134
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,680
Perhaps we'll be lucky and tomorrow will be.

1135
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,300
You're off by 14 years by the Mayan calendar, which is given and fixed as July 5th, 2012.

1136
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:28,100
Our year in calendar is covered with some sort of yellowish juice.

1137
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,000
Mayan as opposed to your and mine.

1138
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,360
Your and mine.

1139
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:31,860
Oh, yeah.

1140
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,860
Oh, oh, oh.

1141
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,760
You were talking about the Andean calendar of the...

1142
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,840
The prepubescent one.

1143
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,360
Husky people of the Andes.

1144
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,340
Yes, the Husky.

1145
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,880
And what exactly happens at 7 a.m.?

1146
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,200
On 2012, a bunch of the Mayan elder gods come down from the clouds.

1147
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,420
That's what happens.

1148
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:50,680
July 5th of 1998.

1149
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,900
Of the year 1998.

1150
00:51:54,060 --> 00:52:01,240
Bob's good buddies from Planet X, who happen to be sex goddesses, will come down or up

1151
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,080
or in from another dimension.

1152
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,380
They'll arrive at some way.

1153
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,280
Yeah.

1154
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,340
Or rather, we shall be vacated.

1155
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:16,520
We will vacate this evacuation chamber, this great latrine called Earth Farm 1, where the

1156
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,880
aliens have raised us in order to feed off of our anguish and pain.

1157
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,640
Raised in our own filth.

1158
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,220
And they'll have a great dessert of those left behind in their anguish and pain.

1159
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,700
They especially do love the ones who were raised in their own filth, don't they?

1160
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,480
The slackness are punished.

1161
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,300
And the deuce and the...

1162
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,220
And the deuce and the deuce.

1163
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,540
The deuce and deuce.

1164
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,540


1165
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,540


1166
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,540


1167
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,160
All of us paying squeaky ministers are squeaky clean.

1168
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,040
And rubbed.

1169
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,580
Rubbed down.

1170
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,240
Pure of impurities.

1171
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,540
It's Peter the Parrot.

1172
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,780
Oh, wait.

1173
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,760
The biggest thing.

1174
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:41,960
And Connie.

1175
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,620
And can you have Oren call home?

1176
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,160
No.

1177
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,880
Oren, please call home.

1178
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,060
His honey is...

1179
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,120
Hey, how could we...

1180
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:49,660
Irrigator.

1181
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,120
I mean, yeah.

1182
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,360
I mean, but wait a minute.

1183
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:51,840
Hey.

1184
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,220
Hey.

1185
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,360
Now, come on.

1186
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,360
Like, dudes, like, hold on.

1187
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,320
Now, hey.

1188
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,060
Wait, everybody.

1189
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:56,360
Hey.

1190
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,520
Put the pipe down, man.

1191
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:57,900
Yeah.

1192
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,100
Just open those eardrums.

1193
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,520
Mr. Rogers died.

1194
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,360
Once again.

1195
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,760
We have another casualty.

1196
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,380
Now you know the real end times are near

1197
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,360
when Mr. Rogers makes his escape.

1198
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,740
He tried to get in that little train.

1199
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,640
He got off.

1200
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,760
He tried to shrink his mind

1201
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,780
and get in the little train

1202
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,980
and take off to Smallville.

1203
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,380
When I heard Mr. Rogers died,

1204
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,540
I got real scared.

1205
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,740
Well, but he's with his grandpa now.

1206
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,760
I got real scared.

1207
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,400
I just know if there's no Mr. Rogers here anymore,

1208
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,000
there's nothing to keep the aliens

1209
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,700
from toasting this motherfucking place.

1210
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,840
What about the Teletubbies?

1211
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,700
It's the implant.

1212
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,540
That's why he got scared when Mr. Rogers died.

1213
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,000
It's because of the micro angel.

1214
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,040
Once again, you guys,

1215
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,560
you don't get scared when Mr. Rogers dies.

1216
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,320
You feel sad.

1217
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,200
Look at how screwed up he is

1218
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,140
because of that implant.

1219
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,520
I'm scared as hell.

1220
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,540
Your implant is not even put in the right place.

1221
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,780
What's going to keep George Bush

1222
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,880
from nuking the whole earth

1223
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,740
now that Mr. Rogers is gone?

1224
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,200
Well, they used to meet regularly

1225
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,440
to discuss policy and so forth.

1226
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,060
No more beautiful days in neighborhood earth,

1227
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,100
boys and girls.

1228
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

1229
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,440
you've heard the reports

1230
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,020
that enemy planes are approaching.

1231
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,940
In less than three hours,

1232
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,680
an H-bomb might fall over Portland.

1233
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,480
Like myself,

1234
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,320
I think you're going to be very interested

1235
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,080
in this story

1236
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:26,740
that we're going to hear.

1237
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,080
I'm going to tell you.

1238
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,440
And in this age of missiles

1239
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,220
and man-made moons,

1240
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,420
it takes on added significance.

1241
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,180
There are no actors in this story,

1242
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,060
but there are a lot of people.

1243
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,600
The people of the city of Portland, Oregon.

1244
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,680
And what happened to them

1245
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,340
or could happen to them

1246
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,600
on a day that we'll call X.

1247
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,100
Holding hands,

1248
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,840
waiting for that fog horn to blow.

1249
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,000
It's been three hours now,

1250
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,120
and he said he was never going to come again.

1251
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,920
But I knew I'd just stay here and wait.

1252
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,040
I can hear the footsteps from two blocks away.

1253
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,420
Those big chubby feet

1254
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,180
slapping against the pavement.

1255
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,540
Yeah, it was W for War Bush

1256
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,140
and his buddy,

1257
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,140
Sodom and Smackem Hobie.

1258
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,380
Yeah, they thought they had the streets sealed up.

1259
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,260
They thought they were clean of the bean.

1260
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,620
Yeah, they thought they were the ones

1261
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,780
to run the whole show.

1262
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,920
But I was taking pictures, see,

1263
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,820
and I was writing everything.

1264
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,540
I was writing everything down.

1265
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,160
I'm losing patience now.

1266
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,740
Okay, stop the car here.

1267
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,340
I'm going home now.

1268
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,700
This is Sbarro's restaurant.

1269
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,360
We're gonna have to go in for a little while

1270
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,500
and pretend like we're talking to each other.

1271
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,700
I'm walking out of the door.

1272
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,680
We both know there's no need for talk anymore.

1273
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,000
No need for talk.

1274
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,640
Everything's going on behind the scenes.

1275
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,020
Behind the scenes.

1276
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,400
Everyone knows that everyone blows.

1277
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,260
There's nothing going on in front.

1278
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:04,300
And there's nothing going on behind your eyes.

1279
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,060
But behind your back, we're doing plenty.

1280
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:08,820
And behind the curtain.

1281
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,300
For the United States governments of America.

1282
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,660
Behind the curtain.

1283
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,580
Beyond the curtain.

1284
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,580
You, the representations of people we representative.

1285
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,800
We would like to know that we are not sham.

1286
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,300
We are not focused and smoky.

1287
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,980
We are real and we represent you.

1288
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We are your representations.

1289
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,500
We're behind each and every one of you Americans.

1290
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,520
Whispering funny things in the back of your neck.

1291
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,440
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to pay my bills.

1292
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,480
No, I can't pay anything.

1293
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,280
Sometimes I just wish I could take a car and go out and shoot a goddamn partner.

1294
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,120
I'm here.

1295
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,340
Too many visions, man.

1296
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,080
Too many dreams.

1297
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,680
I saw the mushroom cloud again last night and it wasn't in my suit, man.

1298
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,440
It was in my ears and my eyes.

1299
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,860
Everybody's watching.

1300
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,380
It's going down, man.

1301
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,240
Like the walls of Jalecho.

1302
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,500
Baby, you're gone.

1303
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,920
Baby, you're gone.

1304
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,100
Just leave me alone.

1305
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:15,800
I'm here.

1306
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,120
I'm here.

1307
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,960
I'm here.

1308
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:19,900
I'm here.

1309
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,260
I'm here.

1310
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,540
I'm here.

1311
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,600
I'm here.

1312
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,140
I'm here.

1313
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:25,140


1314
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:25,280
I'm here.

1315
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:25,660
I'm here.

1316
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,400
I'm here.

1317
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,860
Alien love, friends.

1318
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,180
You are listening to The Subgenius Radio Ministry, Hour of Slack.

1319
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,000
Here's our address.

1320
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,860
Got that pencil ready?

1321
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,720
P.O.

1322
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:43,040
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1323
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,960
That's where you send things to me to play.

1324
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,360
The show, The Hour of Slack, is the voice of the Church of The Subgenius.

1325
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,660
More about that at www.subgenius.org.

1326
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,540
dot com which includes a catalog of books and other things.

1327
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,200
Friends.

1328
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,520
Why don't you come on over to my joint?

1329
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,460
Why don't you stink up my joint the way you stink up my...

1330
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,000
Okay.

1331
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,520
Back to the first one.

1332
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,280
None of this made any sense at all.

1333
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,240
There was no connective tissue.

1334
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,960
There wasn't one.

1335
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,440
Pioneer firing.

1336
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,700
Turned off.

1337
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,460
Mr. Rogers tuned out.

1338
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,420
Good afternoon.

1339
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:23,940
We've been...

1340
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
He got off.

1341
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,200
He got off.

1342
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,080
Well, yeah.

1343
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,800
He's aboard that ship now.

1344
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,620
And I...

1345
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,480
He was being the board.

1346
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,860
I think our jobs are cut out for us.

1347
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,380
It's time for us now to build our own ships.

1348
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,740
To meet Bob halfway, perhaps.

1349
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,720
Our ships are cardboard cutouts.

1350
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,720
Bob beckons.

1351
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,060
The men from Planet X are beckoning to us.

1352
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,560
They're saying,

1353
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,240
lift...

1354
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,180
Pull yourself up by your own boob straps.

1355
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,640
You boots.

1356
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,240
You silly batons.

1357
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,480
Now beckoning.

1358
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,080
Pull yourself...

1359
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,720
Yank yourself.

1360
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,480
Lift yourself up by your...

1361
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:54,800
Yank.

1362
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,760
Just yank.

1363
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,340
Yank for Bob.

1364
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,880
Yank for Bob.

1365
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,620
Yank as if your very life's dependent on it.

1366
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,340
What the hell?

1367
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,740
Hey, you've been listening to ESL Radio.

1368
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,700
Swamp Radio.

1369
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,620
My name's Chaz.

1370
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,640
Once a cowboy Dave.

1371
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,140
Princess Weard-O.

1372
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,620
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

1373
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,280
Yank.

1374
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,380
Let you go.

1375
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,040
Yank as if your...

1376
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,860
This is...

1377
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,460
Yank.

1378
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:17,700
Yank.

1379
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,080
Yank.

1380
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,620
Yank.

1381
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,060
Yank.

1382
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:19,680
Yank.

1383
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:19,780


1384
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:19,780


1385
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:19,820


1386
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:19,820


1387
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,740
Yank.

1388
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:20,820


1389
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:20,820


1390
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:20,820


1391
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:20,820


1392
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:20,840


1393
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:20,840


1394
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:20,840


1395
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,880
Yank.

1396
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,300
Yank.

1397
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,840
Yank.

1398
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,660
You're back to the wind, and you're sagging the saddle.

1399
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,820
I'm sagging Princess Wee.

1400
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,340
Lank, you wanker.

1401
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,440
Why do wankers as if your life, it does, your life, your very life, you wanker.

1402
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,760
Oh, say, on your way out, could you kind of tell the nurses what a hero I am?

1403
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,000
Why didn't I think of that?

1404
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,060
Is that the hero?

1405
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,000
Oh, yeah, that's him lying right there.

1406
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,340
You're a good man, Philo.

1407
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,500
Ooh, it hurts right here.

1408
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,440
Sire, there is no more money.

1409
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,880
We gotta get some money.

1410
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,120
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back, flackin' whartin'

1411
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,360
Philip Buckaburton, Perkaluma Burton,

1412
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,720
doesn't wash tonight at all.

1413
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,640
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1414
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,160
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1415
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,980
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1416
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,000
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1417
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,520
But if you truly love Bob,

1418
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,820
and want some of that fun,

1419
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,100
and want some slack back to rebound to you,

1420
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:31,020
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1421
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,580
or especially the radio page,

1422
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,600
or the catalog store pages,

1423
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,900
and help out financially as best you can.

1424
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,260
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1425
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,920
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1426
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,880
But some of you still have jobs.

1427
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,200
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1428
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,180
even if it's only once a month.

1429
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,760
And if you're not making money from enough of you,

1430
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,160
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1431
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:04,840
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs,

1432
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,940
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1433
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,420
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation,

1434
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:24,820
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1435
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:30,140
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1436
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:47,900
