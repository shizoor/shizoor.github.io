1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,780
Announcing the arrival of the...

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,160
The Genius Power Girls!

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,640
What?

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,780
I don't like it, Joe.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,540
Yeah, me too.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,520
We'll just have to sweat this out.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,100
Handle whatever it is when it happens.

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,880
Joe, maybe if you went to him and said that you had to change your mind about...

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,060
Bob?

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,500
The Genius Power Girls!

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,680
He turned to another true love of real estate discipline.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,700
The guy who's first used cocaine.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,400
The wild boy breaking free.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,000
He'll end up in a court of law as a prosecuting QC.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,000
Remember the school captain?

17
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,320
Success is waiting in line.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,600
I can hear him now as he screams...

19
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,080
Greg!

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,220
You missed the stop sign!

21
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,240
Forget Snoop Doggy Dog!

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,780
Forget Old Ice T!

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,720
The true word out there is produced by the DOT.

24
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,740
What's the use of striving?

25
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,460
Life's road up front unravels.

26
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,360
We get to do the driving.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,480
Don't choose the direction we travel.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,080
Do your homework.

29
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,740
Wait for weeks.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Who cares about how awesome the name is.

31
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,600
Why you should've left.

32
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,440
In a fucking прикue break.

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,580
Just forget it.

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:43,680
Nobody thinks I survive.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,680


44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,040
We're coming from the 조소는장에

45
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,080
bought a car the other day man could that baby run

46
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,960
but you know what it's like they always say there's always a better one

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:23,980
got a tumor in my brain it's creeping to my lungs and I search

48
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,200
for out in Greece could find me a better one

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,140
okay

50
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,140


51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,020
Okay, that was a challenge.

52
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,920
That was the end of the show.

53
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,440
Now we can start another show.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
No, seriously.

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,060
Now we can start another show.

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,380
Right now?

57
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,840
Yeah.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,500
We can start another show right now if we want to.

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,720
But we don't have to.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,160
It's so great to be with you both tonight together.

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,980
I'd just like to make one thing perfectly.

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,460
I'd like to make you opaque.

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,660
Opaque?

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,480
If possible, you're too translucent.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,580
I need you to be opaque.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,320
Can you?

67
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,400
I can be opaque.

68
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,120
Can you, Reverend Stein?

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,300
Can you be opaque?

70
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,660
I'm as clear as an azure sky in summer.

71
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,760
Nay, I can never be opaque.

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,340
I can only be transparent, like a jellyfish or a water bubble

73
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,220
or the invisible man in a snowstorm.

74
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,820
I didn't know that water buffaloes had snowstorms.

75
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,800
No, a water bubble.

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,760
A water bubble.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
They're doubled up.

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,540
A snowstorm of soap bubbles.

79
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,420
That's me.

80
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,240
A bubble within a snowstorm of soap bubbles.

81
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,620
A hollowness.

82
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,660
I can only be seen by my own absence.

83
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,920
Yeah, but luckily you can't be seen by your own absence.

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,140
Oh, he says.

85
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,980
You know that?

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,120
I don't know that.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
There he went.

88
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,060
He's gone.

89
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,040
Then you'd be like Alfred Jari, walking around,

90
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,920
pronouncing humanities to the wind.

91
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,200
Or other invisible...

92
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,420
Were you saying he was being viewed by his absence?

93
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
His absence?

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,460
Yeah.

95
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,120
Dave is floating to and fro, closer to the phone and then farther and farther away.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,680
No!

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,420
I've never had to change volumes so much.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,460
No, Dave.

99
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,020
Really?

100
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,260
It seems like my face is in one place.

101
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, your voice is going away.

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
It comes and goes.

103
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,200
Sometimes you whisper.

104
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,480
And I have to turn it way, way, way up.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,460
Luckily, I have an automatic gain control.

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,180
So that kind of fakes it all to make it almost seem like I know what I'm doing.

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,580
Or can fix it in post at the very least.

108
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,460
You don't have to do quite as much.

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Now, that is weird because I am resting the phone on my shoulder.

110
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't have it firmly in one spot.

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,620
But you see, it's Dave's patented dynamic sound.

112
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,240
He has a sound wavery.

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,100
He only sounds that good when he's sick.

114
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,620
And that's why the boss keeps him that way.

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,340
Oh, okay.

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,160
Okay.

117
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,660
That's why they brought that blue paper to him that had the virus on it.

118
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,580
That makes him go like that.

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,260
See how his voice sounds like...

120
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,060
Uh-huh.

121
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,240
That's...

122
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,440
Yeah.

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,620
That's sound engineering using disease.

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,460
Ew.

125
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,180
Ew.

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,600
How do you think they got me to sound this way?

127
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,340
Why I can't run up a hill anymore?

128
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,280
Because you're diseased.

129
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,760
Yeah.

130
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,940
Well, that makes my voice sound like this, though.

131
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,180
See?

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,100
Smooth radio.

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,320
Yeah.

134
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,620
Or maybe not.

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,500
How do I know?

136
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,340
Everything I hear sounds like hearing aids.

137
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,100
He's making up.

138
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,020
He runs up hills all the time.

139
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,080
If you only had a cerebral cortex to beat the beans with.

140
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,360
No longer.

141
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,000
I did.

142
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,600
I had one.

143
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,040
I had a big one.

144
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,540
Yep.

145
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,320
But then I became a subgenius.

146
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,820
Joined the church as subgenius.

147
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,360
Bob took that cerebral cortex away and gave me this big polished mahogany pipe.

149
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,200
He didn't put anything in it.

150
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,100
I had to fill it myself.

151
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,480
And that was his lesson.

152
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Did you have a cheesy medulla oblongata?

153
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,800
The flavor of which is...

154
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,360
Well, I've still got one of those or I wouldn't be able to breathe.

155
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:33,940
Yeah.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,480
Okay.

157
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,020
Then how about something more transformative like a cerebral gong or corpus callosum?

158
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,280
No, I don't need that.

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,840
We don't need that in Trump's America.

160
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,420
You don't need the whole front half of your skull anymore.

161
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,720
You can just scoop it all out, pack it down, slope it.

162
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,660
Unfortunately, it's sad but true.

163
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,360
Yeah.

164
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:05,660
In fact, it's going to be a real serious setback the more you appear to be educated or smart.

165
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,600
So I would suggest kids, starting now,

166
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,540
try to avoid wearing...

167
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Wearing glasses or using big words or any French phrases or scientific references.

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:28,980
Try to keep your conversation on the level of TV commercials, the latest show, that cool new VR game.

169
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,260
And you'll be fine at the office.

170
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Act like a dumb mob and they'll treat you as an equal.

171
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Has never been more true.

172
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,680
It will be the...

173
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:40,980
You have to...

174
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,160
Say?

175
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,580
It's as true now as it was when Bob first said it in 1953.

176
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,040
It's always been true and it's more true now than ever it has been, as you said.

177
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,560
Praise Bob.

178
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,660
Praise Bob.

179
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,120
Praise Bob.

180
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,780
Hail Connie.

181
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,360
Princess, we need to do something about your microphone because the peas are pathetically powerful.

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,180
And plosive.

183
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,020
Pathetically powerful and plosive.

184
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,580
I don't hear the plosive popping sound.

185
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,140
I hear...

186
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,460
That orange baboon sound.

187
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
That kind of like grunting, uh, rectal foot bump sound.

188
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,920
Well, what I was about to say is that it will be the did generation.

189
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,940
Dumb it down.

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,700
Did.

191
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Dumb it down.

192
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,140
Dumb it down.

193
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,740
Dumb it down.

194
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:28,740


195
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,280
Did.

196
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,640
It'll be the did generation.

197
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,820
Dumb it down.

198
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,500
Dumb it down.

199
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:32,760
Yeah.

200
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,140
Duh, bruh.

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,100
Duh, bruh.

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,540
That's yesterday's phrase.

203
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,620
Duh, bruh.

204
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,140
Duh.

205
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,840
Go away.

206
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm biting.

207
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm biting.

208
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,120
I've heard three people use duh, bruh.

209
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,320
And three people use orange baboon today.

210
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,940
And I think that's synchronistic and wonderful and mild and all.

211
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,440
To know that at least there are some people who share my inexorable recluse or recluse,

212
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,240
or inclusion into the body's politic.

213
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,560
And I'm happy that Mr. Tumpy has...

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,260
Has...

215
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,900
A new job.

216
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,620
Yeah.

217
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,960
Yeah, you said the right thing.

218
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,780
That's good, Dave.

219
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,320
You're learning.

220
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,740
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,520
You're learning.

222
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,660
You must have lost some brain cells this week.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,680
That's good.

224
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,100
Someone did stab me in the forehead.

225
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah, you'll fit in much better.

226
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,300
You're going to fit in much better in this new world.

227
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,840
It's a sub-subgenius world now.

228
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,420
Yeah.

229
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,240
Where now when people...

230
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,240
When you say, well, I'm actually in a funny group called Church of the Subgenius.

231
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,920
They go, oh, you think you're a genius, huh?

232
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,660
No, no, no.

233
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,280
I said, subgenius.

234
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,020
You know, that...

235
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
Oh, smarty pants.

236
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,980
Why don't you join?

237
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,180
I guess I'm not smart enough for Mensa.

238
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,060
No, no, no.

239
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,980
It's a joke.

240
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,000
You know, think about it.

241
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,800
Subgenius.

242
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,800
You mean just under a genius?

243
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, you think you're some kind of a genius.

244
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,800
No, no.

245
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,980
No, just the opposite.

246
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,940
Just the opposite.

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
We're making fun of people who think they're a genius.

248
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,100
Oh, you make fun of people because you think you're all smarty-party than they are, don't you?

249
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,280
Well, you know what I say about you?

250
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,060
I think you're stupid.

251
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,140
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

252
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,940
The stupidest.

253
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,400
The stupidest person I've ever seen.

254
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,300
You don't talk good.

255
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,320
I actually saw a guy say that to an immigrant employee.

256
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:19,740
You don't talk good?

257
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:29,360
Some guy working at a 7-Eleven in Dallas who happened to have an Asian type of accent

258
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,160
had to listen to a redneck go, you sure don't talk good.

259
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,680
And when the redneck went away, I said, I'm sorry.

260
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,660
Do you get that a lot?

261
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,140
He goes.

262
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,160
Oh, no.

263
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,140
Eh, eh, eh.

264
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,760
Eh.

265
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:44,700
Eh.

266
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,700
In other words, yeah.

267
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,980
Yeah.

268
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,420
Yeah, but all you Americans are jerks anyway.

269
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,380
Why did I ever come here?

270
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah, but I just shake it off.

271
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,920
You sure don't talk good.

272
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,200
Eh.

273
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,160
Does you.

274
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,800
Something like that.

275
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,580
You know, it's just like the, oh, God.

276
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,300
What?

277
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Well.

278
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
I've learned to love it, though.

279
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,180
I've learned to love the contradictions.

280
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,700
The paradox is, yes, it is like an Alfred Jari novel, though, isn't it?

281
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:07,840
See?

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
We can just look at it that way.

283
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,940
It's not like there's really.

284
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,640
It's serious fascism happening or destruction of our democratic standards or lowering of

285
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,800
all standards in general.

286
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:29,440
It's nothing like an unstoppable snowball of ignorance leading to something like the

287
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
Dark Ages, only worse.

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
So, no, no.

289
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
Everything's just fine.

290
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,140
We'll just keep doing this comedy show.

291
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,840
That's it.

292
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,180
It's.

293
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,160
A comedy show.

294
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,740
If you can wrap your mind around it, then you can certainly wrap your brain as a visceral

295
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:55,080
actual object around a small piece of paper and write yourself a note to forget about

296
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,340
it.

297
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,500
That's what's necessary.

298
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,000
And that's what we all need to do today.

299
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,740
And put a stamp on it and mail it to Santa for all the good it's going to do you.

300
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,280
Yep.

301
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Oh, well put, man.

302
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,340
Love it.

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,580
That says it right there.

304
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,860
Mail it to Santa for all the good.

305
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,780
And it's going to do you.

306
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,240
It could do you some good, but it's not likely.

307
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,100
A little dobsle do you.

308
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,420
That's an old one, isn't it?

309
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,960
Oh, yeah.

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,780
I was thinking the other.

311
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:33,760
I was commiserating with my friend, the 88-year-old, that if you say, sorry, Charlie, only people

312
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,300
over 55 even get the reference.

313
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,000
It was from a tuna commercial.

314
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,780
Charlie.

315
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,020
Yeah.

316
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,180


317
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah.

318
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,720
Sorry, Charlie.

319
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,920
We're not looking for tuna with good taste.

320
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,180
We're looking for tuna that tastes good.

321
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,740
Tastes good.

322
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,120
Yeah.

323
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,360
Well, that doesn't mean anything to anybody but very old people.

324
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,140
And so our usefulness is now at an end.

325
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,640
We must be put out to pasture.

326
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,820
We're replaced and supplanted by a younger generation.

327
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,300
Because of those damn tuna commercials.

328
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,700
Those damn commercials ruined my life.

329
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,040
Sorry, Charlie.

330
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,080
Sorry, Dave.

331
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,660
We're not looking for subgeniuses with good taste.

332
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,960
We're looking for subgeniuses that taste good.

333
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,220
That's the new way.

334
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,240
The Morlocks.

335
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,860
We're going to start eating them?

336
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, what?

337
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,940
Are you going to be a Morlock or an Eloy?

338
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,720
What are you going to be?

339
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,980
You're going to have to.

340
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,440
You can still make that decision, that choice now.

341
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
Are you going to be a Moron?

342
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,640
A Moron.

343
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm going to be a Merlot.

344
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,660
I'll be a wine.

345
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm going to be a winer.

346
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,560
I'll be a Merlot, too.

347
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,540
I'll be a Pinot Grigio.

348
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,840
Oh.

349
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,560
Oh.

350
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,140
Oh.

351
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,840
A fine-aged Pinot Grigio.

352
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,080
Oh.

353
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,680
Oh.

354
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,120
With a fine nose.

355
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,820
And a good heft.

356
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,620
We need a good heft?

357
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,240
Yes.

358
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,060
A wine with a fine heft.

359
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,820
A good, heavy heft to it.

360
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Here, let me heft it.

361
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,560
I am not.

362
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,080
Ah.

363
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,520
Let me gargle it.

364
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:11,760
Ah.

365
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,940
Mmm.

366
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,820
Is that when you, like, swirl the wine around in the glass and then, like, sniff it and then

367
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,640
swirl it around?

368
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,660
No, that's when you cup it in your hand.

369
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,840
The apricots and the undertaste of rind berries and dog food.

370
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,920
Now my mouth is watering.

371
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,020
I'm just drooling for it.

372
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,620
Mmm.

373
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,000
Chicken pie.

374
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,980
Chicken pie.

375
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,560
Oh, I spelled that wrong.

376
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,320
That would be an unusual vintage.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,740
I just heard some people talking about Trump and they believed some of the stuff he said.

378
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:01,340
And when it came to the Russian hacksters, they were like, what difference does it make?

379
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
It doesn't have anything to do with our election.

380
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,940
No, that was the point of it, in fact.

381
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,380
Yeah.

382
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah.

383
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,040
Yeah.

384
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
So you're...

385
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,140
Right.

386
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,360
That's what they do, though.

387
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,420
They go, well, so what?

388
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,320
That doesn't matter.

389
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,340
And you bring up things that really, really matter and they go, so what?

390
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,000
That doesn't matter.

391
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,140
Yeah.

392
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,460
And the horrible thing is half the reporters they're talking to go, oh.

393
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
I know.

394
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,940
That's very, very sad.

395
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,360
That's the sickest, saddest thing is they've just folded without any kind of a fight at

396
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,600
all.

397
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,680
A lot of them.

398
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Not all of them.

399
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,300
That's what I...

400
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,700
I...

401
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,620
I believe all of them.

402
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,300
And we'll be in the Patriot camps with those folks, those brave reporters who dare to go,

403
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,260
but the world is definitely not flat.

404
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,580
Well, it's not what you scientists said.

405
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,160
No, no scientist ever said the world was flat.

406
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,760
Wouldn't...

407
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,740
What does it matter?

408
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,080
He won fair and square.

409
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,420
No, it wasn't fair and square.

410
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,940
But that doesn't matter.

411
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,400
Yeah.

412
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
That's what Bill Gates said to Steve Jobs in theory.

413
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,680
If the movie Pirates...

414
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,880
Pirates of Silicon Valley is to be believed in the very last lines of dialogue, Steve

415
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,060
Jobs goes, our stuff is better.

416
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,680
And Bill Gates goes, that doesn't matter.

417
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,500
And Gates was right.

418
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,980
And so was Jobs.

419
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,460
I just really ticked off a whole lot of PC users.

420
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,220
I've been using Macintosh stuff since 1984 and I love it.

421
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,420
I can use any...

422
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,860
I can use any Windows or Linux system.

423
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,780
I can operate any computer system.

424
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,800
All I have to do is look at it for a little while.

425
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,080
It's all self-explanatory.

426
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,920
If you're a machine man, and I happen to be one of those.

427
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,060
Yeah.

428
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah.

429
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,300
You are.

430
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,720
You are.

431
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm a mechanical man.

432
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,840
Two mechanical arms.

433
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,520
Two mechanical legs.

434
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,260
One half of a...

435
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,880
Mechanical brain.

436
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,500
And what is the other half, my friend?

437
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,440
Devo.

438
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,820
Oh.

439
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
Devo was right about everything.

440
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,800
I should cut to that song.

441
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,760
Only I don't have my copy of anything here.

442
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
It's probably on the internet.

443
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,180
What song would you cut to right now?

444
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,820
Devo is right about everything by the Attery Squash.

445
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,340
Oh.

446
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
And they were.

447
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,360
They were.

448
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,260
And it is time to...

449
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,160
Replay that song.

450
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,560
Yes.

451
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,980
Celebrate the golden age in which we're living.

452
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,440
Your opinion counts and freedom is key.

453
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,820
Sadly, this has led to art and sport and politics being led by people ill-equipped to breathe.

454
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,120
There was a group who could have saved us from this ignominy.

455
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,180
There was a group and they were really ignored.

456
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,140
They saw the future and they pointed...

457
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,680
out the problems if the people took the point we'd now be reaping the rewards.

458
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:19,060
Devo was right about everything, Devo were telling the truth.

459
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,380
Devo was right about everything, Devo was sure to stop you.

460
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,560
If you have ever raged against conformity, or hate the way our leaders treat us with sport.

461
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,880
You see society regress before your very eyes, Devo was on your side before you were born.

462
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,520
Devo was right about everything, Devo were through the world roads.

463
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,360
Devo was right about everything, Devo was sure to stop you.

464
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,360


465
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,220
Come and sing with us everyone.

466
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,920
Devo was right about everything, Devo called it correct.

467
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,260
Devo was right about everything, and as such deserves our respect.

468
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,280
How many people here tonight believe that de-evolution is real?

469
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,360
And we just can't even believe it.

470
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,940
I'm sorry to remind you, are we not men?

471
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,660
Are we not men?

472
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
Are we not men?

473
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,100
Are we not men?

474
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,460
Devo was right about everything, Devo was never in the wrong.

475
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,360
Devo was right about everything, Devo was sure to stop you.

476
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:06,080
And if that's true, then we really all do.

477
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,880
So in thirty seconds turn this music up, and go on and do what Deevo would do..

478
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,800
DEE-e-e-va, Dee-e-e-va, DE-e-e-e-va...

479
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,140
Dee-e-e-va, Dee-e-e-va D-E-e-e-e-va, Dee-e-e-va...

480
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,340
Even the kiss is no grandpa's is.

481
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,340


482
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,120
Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo, Devo

483
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,780
Devo was right about everything

484
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,020
I know, you don't have to look very far for the evidence

485
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,460
They were doing that song probably almost ten years ago

486
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,100
But Devo is righter about everything now than they ever were before

487
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,400
Yeah, they're more righter

488
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,420
Yeah, much more righter

489
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,200
The whole world has become more righter

490
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
According to some terrible writers that I know

491
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,980
But I don't agree

492
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,220
I think it's becoming wronger

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,040
And this show is getting longer and longer

494
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
But that's okay

495
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,020
Because I can always cut to this

496
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,400
This is Timothy Leary reminding you that just as you need slack

497
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Slack

498
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,820
Bob needs your help

499
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,500
Send in those pledges

500
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,180
And praise Bob

501
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,860
And that was fill in the blank

502
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,640
Yes, Reverend Fill in the blank submitted that wonderful piece

503
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,780
Thing

504
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
And now this

505
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,660
See, I'm doing all the credits

506
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,680
Good old Reverend Fill in

507
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,080
I remember him well

508
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,680
Good old Reverend credits

509
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,420
Fill in the blanks

510
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,620
Fill in the blanks

511
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,140
That was great

512
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,580
Fill us in the blow hammers

513
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,660
That was another great band

514
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,660
Fill us in the blow hammers

515
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,600
Don't make music like they used to

516
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,840
It just sounds like noise

517
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,160
Well, they never did make music

518
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,120
It was all just making noise

519
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,320
Praise Bob

520
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,800
And you happened to think it was music

521
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,920
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

522
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,380
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, waah

523
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,380


524
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:35,160
They tell us that we lost our tails evolving up from little snails.

525
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
I think it's all just wind and sails.

526
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,480
Are we not men?

527
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
We are Devo.

528
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,240
Are we not pins?

529
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,820
D-E-V-O.

530
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,900
I can't even spell Devo anymore.

531
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,400
That's Devo.

532
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,480
That is Devo.

533
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,060
When you can't spell Devo.

534
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,600
When you can't from the last thousand years ago, you would say,

535
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,100
let's crawl through a band like Devo.

536
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,960
Devo.

537
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,000
Devo.

538
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,500
Devo.

539
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,140
I either abstractly argue with one of those arguments.

540
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,200
Devo.

541
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,080
Devo.

542
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,940
Well, actually, I've heard the Devo's say Devo.

543
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,880
They don't actually say Devo.

544
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,560
They say Devo sometimes.

545
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,380
You're a bunch of mob.

546
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,620
Oh, jeez.

547
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,860
See, Dave knows he's Dave.

548
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,440
Dave transcended the broadcast rules now.

549
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
Because he's on his phone.

550
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,020
I was actually trying to say Kent.

551
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,700
No, you could probably.

552
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,760
Mob?

553
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,240
State.

554
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,180
He said crunt.

555
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,860
Crunt.

556
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Yeah, crunt.

557
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,060
There's nothing.

558
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,200
Anybody can say crunt.

559
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,940
Although, nowadays, the kids all say scrum.

560
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,500
Scrum.

561
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,180
Yeah, the kids all say scrum now.

562
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,160
Yeah, crunt is the old school scrum.

563
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,900
Spum was like the 70s.

564
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,200
Old school scrum.

565
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
Spum was pre-crunt.

566
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,700
What is scrum?

567
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:52,880
What is scrum?

568
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,220
Before.

569
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,820
Huh?

570
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,820
Besides in rugby.

571
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,060
What is scrum?

572
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,060
Scrum.

573
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,040
Well, it's what used to be called crunt.

574
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,080
But they changed it.

575
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,420
As rightly they should.

576
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,160
Yeah.

577
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,300
Yeah.

578
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,160
Duh, bruh.

579
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,660
Duh, bruh.

580
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,800
Duh, bruh.

581
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,580
Duh, bruh.

582
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,760
Deborah, duh, bruh.

583
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
So, are we talking about marginally bad words?

584
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,680
Or are we talking about red lights and popsicles?

585
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,320
No, we're talking about scrum and crunt.

586
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,360
And the earlier spum.

587
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,840
Spum.

588
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,580
Yes, and I spummed all over everywhere.

589
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,580
Or, oh, sorry, I crunted again.

590
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,240
Or, hey, do you have any more of that scrum?

591
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,880
You know.

592
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,800
Come on, Dave, get with it.

593
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,500
Don't you know what's happening?

594
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,140
Yeah, okay, okay.

595
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,620
Next thing he's going to say, he doesn't even know what

596
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:43,880
is.

597
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,620
I don't know what is.

598
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,920
See?

599
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,700
I told you I can predict what people are going to say.

600
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,440
I can predict.

601
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,040
I can know what people are going to say.

602
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,120
I can predict what people are going to say.

603
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,440
Did you know that, Princess?

604
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,100
Oh, you.

605
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,820
I know what every word that everyone's going to say,

606
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,400
I already know.

607
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,660
There was someone who told Princess Wee that,

608
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,800
and they were serious.

609
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,520
Absolutely serious.

610
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,180
They said, I should be a presenter at Starwood,

611
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,600
and you should pay me, or at least let me in for free,

612
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,280
because I have this talent.

613
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,460
I know what everyone's going to say before they say it.

614
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,940
But the next words out of Princess Wee's mouth

615
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,260
disproved that.

616
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,480
What did you say to her, Wee?

617
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,000
Did you tell her to go fondle, you know, to remove her parts

618
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,220
from the cavity?

619
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,620
She probably said, well, you'll just have to submit an

620
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,380
application and describe your talents.

621
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
I told her.

622
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,800
I knew you were going to say that.

623
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,840
Well, then why didn't you just hand me the application,

624
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,740
dumbass?

625
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,820
I told her that she would have had to have been presenting

626
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,860
her class on Krunt.

627
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,360
For?

628
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,580
For a great long time, and had lots of attendees,

629
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,520
and maybe had some videotapes of the classes,

630
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,820
and just so that we can see what it is that she's doing,

631
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,160
and of course...

632
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
Well, she knew you were going to say that.

633
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,380
So again, why didn't she just give you the presentation

634
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,100
first?

635
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,940
She should have.

636
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,800
Right.

637
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,560
She doesn't really know what people...

638
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,980
For instance, she didn't know that the last thing

639
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,340
she was going to do was to give you the presentation.

640
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,340


641
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,340


642
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,340


643
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,120
The first thing she would hear at Starwood was,

644
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,040
you are not ever allowed back onto this campground ever again.

645
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,340
No, she didn't know that.

646
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,480
Well, see...

647
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,340
She didn't know that.

648
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,460
But that did happen to her?

649
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,440
Someone observed her?

650
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,540
Yeah, it was after she...

651
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,600
Well, she took the LSD and physically attacked a whole

652
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,400
bunch of people.

653
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,320
I guess she was angry that they didn't say what she knew

654
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
they were going to say.

655
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

656
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,820
Some psychics can be troublesome, you know,

657
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
when things don't go their way.

658
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,420
You'd think they would know ahead of time,

659
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,020
but it's funny how that works.

660
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,100
Yes.

661
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,660
I quit making predictions in 1998 myself.

662
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,920
Well, I still make predictions,

663
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,240
but I don't expect anything to come true or not.

664
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,920
Head or tails.

665
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,220
Head or tails, yep, that's it.

666
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,380
He was right.

667
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
Damn, Dave's magic.

668
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,540
He is magic.

669
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,300
He knows all.

670
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
He's omniscient.

671
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,720
That's our Dave.

672
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,980
Well, we've done two shows worth of show now.

673
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,600
Really?

674
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,080
Yeah, just about.

675
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,640
I'm going to cut to some really good ranting from X-Day.

676
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,060
It's my voice, but it's not my rant.

677
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,380
It's good Reverend Rogers' rant.

678
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,160
He should be called something like the real royal Reverend

679
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,980
Rogers instead of good Reverend Rogers.

680
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
The regal Rogers.

681
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,500
Yeah, just more .

682
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,680
I have to build up so much force to do a Spanish .

683
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,560
Yeah, I have to force it.

684
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,560
It takes me half a second just to get it going.

685
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,720
Like dog.

686
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,660
Dog is .

687
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,740
Right?

688
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,120
See how I have to force it like a stutterer?

689
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,880
But .

690
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,340
You know, the cats are like,

691
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


692
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


693
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


694
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


695
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


696
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


697
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


698
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,340


699
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,740
.

700
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,020
A purring is a cat.

701
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,820
Gato.

702
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,640
Gato.

703
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,020
Gato.

704
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,360
Pero.

705
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,500
No, see I .

706
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,540
Pero, pero.

707
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,940
Butt dog.

708
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,220
See, you have to make a differentiation because one's got two R's, the other one has three

709
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,860
small teeth.

710
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,740
Right.

711
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,160
But some of us can't do the rolling R's very well.

712
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,540
We fall over when we try to do it or we get out of breath.

713
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,280
And it just comes naturally if you're born Spanish speaking.

714
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,340
Yeah.

715
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm not a good Spanish speaker or even a good second language Spanish speaker, but I'm not

716
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,020
good.

717
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,820
My tongue won't like that unless I .

718
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,940
Now I can't stop.

719
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,900
Oh, okay.

720
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,160
That was close.

721
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,880
Don't let me say .

722
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,320
Again.

723
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,260
Oh.

724
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,020
My grandfather had the worst stutter in the whole world.

725
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
And I'm lucky that mine is only . . .

726
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,760
Kind of a sentence length stutter rather than whole words.

727
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,820
You know what else we're lucky about?

728
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,980
We went through these whole two shows without a single damn it.

729
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,900
Woof.

730
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,320
Oh yeah.

731
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,640
Where is damn it?

732
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,240
I think he's outside freezing.

733
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
How does he do that?

734
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't know.

735
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:46,860
Our dog went out on an 18 degree day and curled up in the grass to take a sun bath.

736
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,880
Yeah, a nap.

737
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,260
He took a nap in 18 degrees weather.

738
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,060
Dogs love cold.

739
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,720
Oh, this got wind . . .

740
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,740
And it was 24, so it actually was warmer here than it was there.

741
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes.

742
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,480
Yes.

743
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,020
All day long it has been.

744
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,140
It was 24 here today, which is not toasty by any means, but . . .

745
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,840
No, my mom's pansies went plot right on their faces.

746
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,080
Yesterday in North Texas it was 78 degrees around 1 o'clock in the afternoon,

747
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,740
and by midnight it was 18 degrees.

748
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,220
They did a similar thing here.

749
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,940
It was a blue norther that came in, and the trees started blowing and waving in the wind

750
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,740
so hard that it scared me and it made the dog wildly excited, and he just went prancing

751
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,140
and leaping and spinning around in the air and howling and barking and,

752
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,100
let's go, this is the best weather, if only it would rain it would be perfect.

753
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,100
It's freezing cold, let's go explore everything.

754
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,720
He's 11 years old, that's 77 in human years, but he acted like the time was right.

755
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,200
He's the funniest puppy.

756
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,340
They love the cold, they love that frigid, they love it.

757
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
He's wearing the same coat that he wears on 100 degree days.

758
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,120
Yeah, I know, it's weird.

759
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,760
I saw a guy playing with his dog the other day when it was 10 here,

760
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,620
and he was playing fetch the stick and the dog didn't seem to know that it was 10 degrees

761
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,040
and just went and fetched the stick.

762
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,080
Well, don't we all fetch the stick

763
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,420
when the big man throws it?

764
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,060
Are we so different from that little dog?

765
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,720
Fetching that stick, feeling that that makes his life so meaningful

766
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,480
when it is in fact infinitely pointless.

767
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,420
Yes, yes, yes.

768
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,480
Yes, like the Chihuahua trying to go after a Great Dane.

769
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,900
It is fruitless and will not happen.

770
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,560
The Chihuahua?

771
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,440
She meant Chihuahua.

772
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,920
The Chihuahua trying to mount the Great Dane.

773
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,460
Yes.

774
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,020
Leaping fruitlessly, vainly.

775
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,540
I know exactly how that Chihuahua feels.

776
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,300
Or viciously attacking a pit bull.

777
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,480
Right, yeah.

778
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:11,680
Yeah.

779
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,000
They're crazy.

780
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,300
They are crazy.

781
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,340
What do the Mexican people thought of them as food to make you feel warmer in the cold weather?

782
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,620
What?

783
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,380
Some Mexicans used to eat dog, meaning Chihuahuas,

784
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,220
in the winter time to make themselves warmer.

785
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,280
Oh, I've been offered dog up in South Dakota.

786
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,240
I don't know why I turned it down, honestly.

787
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,980
It was the only chance I would ever have to say,

788
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,960
oh, I've eaten dog.

789
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,440
It was some Lakota folks.

790
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,480
And they were having a celebration.

791
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,180
And these were really old school.

792
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,000
And they had strangled a puppy and made soup of it for a religious ceremony.

793
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,340
And the guy walked around with a pot going,

794
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,320
hot dog, get them while they're hot.

795
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,080
Man.

796
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,100
I'm glad they didn't partake.

797
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,840
But I did eat some strange food substances one time at a restaurant in Cleveland Heights,

798
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,880
a Chinese restaurant.

799
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,680
And I ate cat, I believe, because it was in the paper a few days after I had it.

800
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,820
Oh, so see Princess Wee, I told you.

801
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,600
No.

802
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,360
Every time I see a dead cat, I go,

803
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,220
oh, that's going to be a,

804
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,180
sure we're going to pick that up for the Chinese restaurant.

805
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,940
She thinks I'm kidding.

806
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,520
No!

807
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,080
It can't be.

808
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,080
So you ate there and then later read about it?

809
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
I said that they got in trouble for using cats.

810
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,040
You're shattering my illusions of things being the way they should be.

811
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,480
Why in the hell would somebody not just buy a freaking chicken?

812
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,880
Why would they go to all the trouble to kill a cat?

813
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,080
Oh, roadkill.

814
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
No, they won't kill it.

815
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,100
They just, people bring the cats in.

816
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,600
Didn't you bring cats to Chinese restaurants when you were a kid?

817
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,880
Yeah, I brought them in there to play mahjong with the old lady.

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,400
Oh, no.

819
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,980
You know, you'd see some redneck deliberately run over a cat.

820
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,760
Which I've seen twice, by the way, in my life.

821
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,300
I have not seen that.

822
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,100
Then you go grab, you take the cat's corpse and you go to the nearest Chinese restaurant.

823
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,080
Actually, I'm kidding.

824
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Because we didn't have any Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood in Fort Worth when I was growing up.

825
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,420
Oh, that's deprived.

826
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,120
No, I saw that in a movie that was set in, what, Xenia, Ohio?

827
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,220
Called Gummo.

828
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,860
Remember Gummo?

829
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,960
Gummo and his buddy would collect cats from the road and take them to the Chinese restaurant.

830
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,720
She doesn't believe that there's such a thing as cannibal rednecks either.

831
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,340
There is no such thing as cannibal rednecks.

832
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,340
Oh, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, that's only a movie.

833
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,620
He makes that stuff up just to scare me.

834
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
That's only a movie.

835
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,840
It's not true, Dave.

836
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,180
Yeah, it sounds like it's true to me.

837
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,500
I'm afraid you're going to have to lose your toll from now on.

838
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,620
Well, we really have recorded over an hour and I have to go now.

839
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,540
Okay.

840
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,120
Or soon.

841
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,920
I'm sucking pretty bad as far as verbiage is concerned.

842
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,860
Oh, no, no.

843
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Actually, it's fine.

844
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,460
I think we've been having a private conversation for the last 20 minutes, but that's okay.

845
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,040
We'll see.

846
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,720
I don't know.

847
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,400
I might put it on the next show after Christmas.

848
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,420
Who cares if it's a private conversation?

849
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,160
If they don't want to join in, then they can just be on the outside.

850
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,960
Well, you know, the Puzzling Evidence Show often does sound like a show.

851
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:43,960


852
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:43,960


853
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:54,240
It should be a private conversation and not on the public airwaves, but it's at 5 in the morning.

854
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,080
Who cares?

855
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,940
It's at 5 in the morning.

856
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
Well, we should go.

857
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,120
We should go, though, because you have to get to work tomorrow, don't you?

858
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:05,980
Yes.

859
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,760
And I have to edit all the f***ing jobs out of this show I've been editing.

860
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,680
And I'm making gingerbread castles.

861
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,640
Oh.

862
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,980
For my grandsons to decorate.

863
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,420
Oh, boy.

864
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,940
I bet they never had it so good.

865
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,520
Well, they have been slowly moving up.

866
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,020
First, it was gingerbread houses.

867
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,640
Last year, it was gingerbread barns, and now it's gingerbread castles.

868
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah, they had houses for the first few years.

869
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,020
It's a big deal.

870
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,940
They get to decorate them.

871
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,160
They had public housing before, yeah.

872
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,680
She presents the undecorated.

873
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:43,660


874
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,120
They have a public house to them, and then they get to put gumdrops and peppermint sticks

875
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,940
and fake snow made of sugar.

876
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,820
It's the only art project where all the materials are edible candy.

877
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,840
You're putting some children into some pretty weird predicaments by stealing their teeth

878
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,400
like that.

879
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,820
Oh, you should have seen them at Halloween.

880
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,860
Oh, man.

881
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,340
They got their little sweet tooth satisfied briefly.

882
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,580
Savagely.

883
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,900
Well, their mom had to look at every single thing they eat before they put it in their mouth.

884
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,720
I didn't think that they'd get to eat any of it until they got home.

885
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,700
They tried to while they were out there, but their mom was like,

886
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,920
No! No! We have to wait till we get home and make sure there has no razor blades in it.

887
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,820
You know how those trolls are.

888
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,740
That turned out to be a big myth.

889
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:40,040
It used to be a big myth, apparently because of the, you know, now it's cool to be a bully and a troll and a coward

890
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,660
and, you know, monkey wrench everything and call it a day.

891
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,280
You know, you lost other people a lot of money because you're a troll because it's funny for the lulz.

892
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,300
Those things actually are happening.

893
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,620
It was an urban myth and it's not anymore.

894
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,160
Yeah, that is true.

895
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,580
Well, okay, we should get off the phone.

896
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,180
Okay.

897
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,160
Okay, Dave, we're going to say bye.

898
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:13,080
And I'm going to give you Reverend Ivan Stang, who is going to perform for you an entirely new rant.

899
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:19,420
Never before entrusted unto the agency of recording apparatus.

900
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,300
Listen and wonder.

901
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:36,360
This rant is by one of my favorite subgenius rant writers, the good Reverend Roger, or Roger N.A.

902
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,800
And it was published on Scrub Genius.

903
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,640
But it's a great rant.

904
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,940
And I just want to share it with y'all.

905
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,780
Special Snowflakes by the good Reverend Roger.

906
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:06,560
Okay, so you look around this place and it's basically a pop-up book for DSM-5.

907
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,520
Normal people don't do what we do.

908
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,540
They don't think the way we think.

909
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,640
They do normal things.

910
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:21,820
And they talk about normal events, i.e. Miley Cyrus and other world-shattering occurrences.

911
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,060
Just about everyone here has something wrong with their wiring.

912
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,480
And that's okay.

913
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,280
I think normal is pretty overrated and I think most of you do too.

914
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:39,780
However, there's a difference between having a problem and becoming that problem.

915
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,640
The brain flukes do not define me as a person.

916
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,820
I'm not an insomniac, come to think of it, so much as a guy who has insomnia.

917
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,180
I reject the labels associated with these conditions because while they are part of me, they aren't me.

918
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,940
Imagine if you were at a party and some guy came up and said,

919
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,900
Hi, I'm John. I'm mildly bipolar.

920
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,840
You know right then how the evening's going to go.

921
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,580
Everything you discuss will somehow be related to that person's disorder.

922
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,840
Boring!

923
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,260
Flee now while you have the chance!

924
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,900
Likewise with, quote, autistic, unquote.

925
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,140
If you're really autistic, we'll know.

926
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:31,000
I have two cousins who are fairly badly autistic and they'll never sneak up on you with that fact.

927
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,940
You know it from the minute you meet them.

928
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:40,420
They don't see much of a need to announce it, mostly on account of the fact that they don't see much of a need to announce anything to anybody.

929
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,560
Now, I'm not talking about the average person.

930
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm talking about the average asshole that kicks the door in babbling about how insane they are.

931
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,260
That's a different thing altogether and can be easily solved with a pillowcase full of combination locks applied liberally.

932
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:03,660
Instead, I'm referring to people who actually do have difficulties and who allow these difficulties to define who they are.

933
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,240
Worse, those who use their difficulties as an excuse to rain shit down on those around them

934
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,560
and hide behind those difficulties when retrobed.

935
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,620
And, of course, that's when self-indulgence comes around.

936
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,960
What this is, in all but the most severe cases, is self-indulgence.

937
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,360
Instead of exerting your personality to be interesting or persuasive,

938
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,740
or instead of Saturday night with your pants around your ankles and a stupid grin on your face,

939
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,380
you're using your issues to avoid being you.

940
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:43,500
To avoid the work and the blood pissing and the rage spewing that is part and parcel of being in this strange religion in these strange times.

941
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:51,440
Yeah, I know that real issues present real problems, some of which can be overcome and some of which can't.

942
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,920
But, I gotta say, there's a whole lot of won't involved too.

943
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,300
And a fair amount of, look at me!

944
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,720
And I might add a whole lot of, I failed at X because of my issues,

945
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,180
instead of, I failed at X because I was given an excuse.

946
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,040
Granted, a lot of this sort of attitude has been ingrained into people by their well-meaning parents.

947
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,320
My folks, for example, took one look at my weirdness and hustled me off to the local pill pusher to be labeled hyperactive,

948
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,680
or ADD, or ADHD, or whatever the fuck it's called now.

949
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,380
The pusher agreed, and they tried to feed me Ritalin.

950
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,820
Herman Gehring would have been proud of my trick of hiding the pill behind my back molar until I could spit it out.

951
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,940
Then they tried all manner of well-intentioned,

952
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,560
socially-intentioned,

953
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,060
sexually-crippling things on me about, quote,

954
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,840
what I could manage and what I couldn't.

955
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,700
I didn't listen, and made such a thing out of being my own weird self that they finally shipped me off to

956
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,140
The Terrible Old Man,

957
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,800
which was about to happen anyway, based on their schedules on the research vessel.

958
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,540
The Terrible Old Man had the cure.

959
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,880
He worked me until I was too tired to be a pain in the ass,

960
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,340
and accepted no excuses for anything.

961
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,820
Funny thing is, I don't know to this day if I was or am hyperactive,

962
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,900
and it doesn't matter.

963
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,600
Now, I was very fortunate to be handed off to a Depression-era human.

964
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,920
Not everyone has that option.

965
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,080
But what you can do is develop, as I originally developed,

966
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,980
a Depression-era human inside your own skull.

967
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,120
Put him back behind your limbic system.

968
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,220
He won't eat much.

969
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,180
And then, every time the special snowflake thing comes up,

970
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,080
imagine the look he's giving you.

971
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,320
It's something like this.

972
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,920
And here is a picture of Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino going.

973
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,520
And every time you make an excuse for yourself, imagine his response to that excuse.

974
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,300
Conversely, every time you whack society in the balls,

975
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,060
or take that fucking Saturday night and run it right at the fucking wall,

976
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,080
think about the old bastard cheering you on.

977
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,160
Because what those fuckers did know how to do was have a good time.

978
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,980
And one thing they didn't know how to do was take shit from anyone.

979
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,900
Your issues are part of you.

980
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,680
There's no denying that.

981
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,060
Whether you run those issues or let those issues run you

982
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,100
is the only thing in question here.

983
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,280
Primates are pack-based animals.

984
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,460
And there's no denying that humans are a form of primate.

985
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:47,500
Thing is, the pack in the brains of a primate has a finite size.

986
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,980
This has been referred to by others as the monkey sphere.

987
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,480
Outside of which, you simply don't give a shit.

988
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,180
Now, given a world population of around 7.23 billion humans,

989
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,280
and given, for example, a national population of 312 million humans,

990
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,240
it's damn near impossible to think of the world

991
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,800
or even your nation as your tribe.

992
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,280
Even the patriotic yahoos always take a moment

993
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,100
to exclude those who aren't, in their opinions, real Americans.

994
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,020
Generally, that means everybody who doesn't agree with me on everything.

995
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,820
So naturally, humans go off looking for other criteria for a tribe.

996
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,860
In today's society, the easiest tribal banner to rally under is the cause.

997
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,700
The cause can be any number of things, but almost always requires a uniform

998
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,340
of one kind or another.

999
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,700
Feminism, militant transgenderism, quote-unquote,

1000
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,720
tea-baggerism, etc.

1001
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,060
Now, some of these are not bad concepts in and of themselves,

1002
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,480
but the problem begins when the cause is taken by its adherents

1003
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,080
as existing in a vacuum.

1004
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,000
The sole criteria for being in the tribe is whether or not you adhere religiously

1005
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,260
to the cause.

1006
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,500
And the only way to gain status in the tribe is to be the biggest whack

1007
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:08,680
in the world.

1008
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,660
And that's the only job in sight.

1009
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,560
I will give two examples.

1010
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,200
One, tea-baggerism.

1011
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,520
To be a proper tea-bagger now, you have to be the one sprinting

1012
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:25,160
farthest past the right wing and into crazy-town USA population you.

1013
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,160
If there's anyone else near you, you have failed and are probably

1014
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,840
some kind of crypto-liberal fifth columnist.

1015
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,760
Second example, militant transgenderism.

1016
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,940
To be in the tribe,

1017
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:44,320
you have to espouse the exact same hate used by those who indulge in gay panic.

1018
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,340
That is to say, you not only can hate, you must hate,

1019
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,240
rationalizing that hate as fear-driven.

1020
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,340
If you aren't spewing hate for those unlike yourself,

1021
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,160
then you're some kind of wishy-washy cookie-seeker or ally,

1022
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,040
said with a sneer, mind you.

1023
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,900
In both cases, you can only be a special snowflake by being not only under the

1024
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,620
blanket, but in the dead center of the blanket,

1025
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,760
huffing the maximum atmospheric density of the tribe's farts.

1026
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,000
It's not activism, it's narcissism.

1027
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,960
And an outsider can see this from a mile away as the special snowflakes involved

1028
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,420
puff up like a frog at the first sign of an opposing view,

1029
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,440
no matter how correct or incorrect.

1030
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,980
Furthermore, the special snowflake's greatest wrath is reserved not for outsiders,

1031
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,880
but for those who are doing it.

1032
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,620
And they do it wrong.

1033
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,680
Another good tell for a special snowflake is whether or not they're there to defend

1034
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,360
that other guy.

1035
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,020
cultural appropriation.

1036
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,640
If someone laughs at the white trust fund baby wearing dreadlocks,

1037
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,040
well, that's a natural reaction to someone who looks like a dumbass.

1038
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,260
On the other hand, watching an equally white person go rigid with indignation

1039
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,440
and then erupt like goddamn Mount Krakatoa over it

1040
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,280
is kind of patronizing, isn't it?

1041
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,620
You know, those people can't possibly stick up for themselves in a case like that.

1042
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,000
So I shall shoulder the white man's burden and do it for them.

1043
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,880
Which is not to say that you shouldn't slap down people who think saying

1044
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:30,380
the N word or this S word, I'm thinking of the radio.

1045
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,540
At a family gathering is tolerable, mind you,

1046
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,420
but to install yourself as the guardian of someone else's life,

1047
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,840
someone else's cultural turf,

1048
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,480
is damn near as bad as the Yehu at the family gathering

1049
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,860
when you get right down to it.

1050
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:48,320
Because you aren't really doing it for those people, are you?

1051
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,080
No, you're doing it to show them and your peers

1052
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,420
just exactly what a special snowflake you are.

1053
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,660
Same thing with the first two examples.

1054
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,680
You are communicating, but you're not communicating to people outside of your tribe.

1055
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,420
You're closing down all communication to the outside world.

1056
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,480
You're not talking to people outside while bellowing your status to your tribe.

1057
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,520
Do you define your cause or does the cause define you?

1058
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,160
One way means you have beliefs.

1059
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,440
The other way means you may as well jam a Brad Pitt hat on your head

1060
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,760
because you're already a hipster and therefore a joke.

1061
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,060
But you know, the joke gets old fast,

1062
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,400
which will probably be taken by special snowflakes

1063
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,460
to mean something other than the joke gets old fast.

1064
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,280
I don't care.

1065
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,960
And then there's a part three, but I don't seem to have...

1066
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, well, should I continue?

1067
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,400
Yes.

1068
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,020
Part three.

1069
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,280
By virtue of being able to read this, you are intelligent.

1070
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,800
There's no arguing that.

1071
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,760
You may in fact be above average when it comes to intelligence,

1072
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,580
and your parents may have done you a grave disservice by telling you that

1073
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,080
instead of letting you figure it out for yourself.

1074
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,440
But are you that?

1075
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,920
Are you the smartest person you know?

1076
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,760
More to the point, is it important that you be the smartest person you know?

1077
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,980
Is it critical to your happiness that you let everyone else know just how smart you are

1078
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,460
and just how perfect your life is in every detail?

1079
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,520
You frequently, though not always, see this in engineers.

1080
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,960
A special snowflake kind of engineer.

1081
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,820
They know all inside their field and out,

1082
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,360
and it is important to them that they be the only person

1083
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,660
who knows anything about anything.

1084
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,560
In short, they're dumbasses.

1085
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,060
It's not just engineers, of course.

1086
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:46,160
It's just that engineering has an occupational hazard of the engineer in question becoming the expert.

1087
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,060
The smartest guy in the room.

1088
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:53,460
Almost all other fields of expertise carry the same risk, of course.

1089
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,140
Doctors are kind of famous for this, for example.

1090
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,240
The easiest way to tell if you're the smartest guy in the room

1091
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,440
is to examine your impulses during the day.

1092
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:08,940
If you find yourself compelled to offer your opinion or advice,

1093
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,460
you may be the smartest guy in the room.

1094
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,460
If you find yourself specifically listening for something to correct,

1095
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,260
you may also be that guy.

1096
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,420
If you think sourcing your arguments is a sign of weakness,

1097
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,400
you're in the zone.

1098
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,100
And if you cannot bring yourself to say,

1099
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,540
I don't know, or even I was wrong,

1100
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,900
then you definitely are that guy.

1101
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,440
Because whatever it is you're trying to do,

1102
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:33,920
you're talking about,

1103
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,360
you aren't really talking about.

1104
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,380
You're saying,

1105
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,400
Look at me! Look how smart I am!

1106
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,300
You've probably by now noticed a common thread

1107
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,380
between the mental illness thing,

1108
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,180
the cause thing,

1109
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,640
and the smartest guy in the room.

1110
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,320
It's given away by the title of this essay,

1111
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,540
Special Snowflake.

1112
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,360
The common theme, of course, is narcissism.

1113
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,040
It is the turning inward of the intellect

1114
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,580
in an attempt to deny the idea

1115
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,520
that you might not actually be the main character.

1116
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,920
The worst part about it is how offensive

1117
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,820
and then boring it makes a person.

1118
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,180
This leads to being ostracized,

1119
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,820
which in turn leads to more screaming and hollering

1120
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,500
for the world to look at me!

1121
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,400
The person in question,

1122
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,940
no matter which of the three types of snowflakes they are,

1123
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,420
will interpret being ostracized

1124
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,320
as some weird form of validation.

1125
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,260
I'm too much for the little people to handle.

1126
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,580
Or, I knew they were too small-minded to join the cause.

1127
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,240
Or, my crazy makes me too special for normal people.

1128
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,900
The end result, of course, is the same.

1129
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,820
You're a special snowflake,

1130
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,920
all by yourself.

1131
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,840
Or kill me!

1132
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,740
Thank you, Reverend Roger.

1133
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,040
The good Reverend Roger.

1134
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,260
I love that guy's thoughts.

1135
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,460
And he's really good at expressing them.

1136
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,300
Yes, a classic rant from Reverend Roger.

1137
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:20,320
A true and more than typical subgenius.

1138
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,180
It's great to have these positions articulated

1139
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,660
because it helps us fold them in

1140
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,820
to become eternal church members.

1141
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:33,700
I should add that I think he wrote that late last March.

1142
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,840
He wrote it late last night?

1143
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,080
No, no, last March.

1144
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,740
Last March?

1145
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,640
Last March.

1146
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,220
Late in the month of March.

1147
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,700
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

1148
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,000
So, you've heard this espousal of subgenius principles.

1149
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,200
What else do you expect to hear

1150
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,000
when you come to our special X-Day gathering?

1151
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,800
I come to the X-Day gathering

1152
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,520
from a long line of accountants

1153
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,120
as I've developed a system.

1154
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,160
Enlightenment in 1,000 easy steps.

1155
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,280
Step one.

1156
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,000
Well, the journey of a thousand steps begins with...

1157
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Well, so go ahead and take that one.

1158
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,320
Step two.

1159
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,060
Draw your hair out.

1160
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,180
Step three.

1161
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,920
Go a day without brushing your teeth.

1162
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,560
Step four.

1163
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,160
Go a day with brushing your teeth.

1164
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,620
Step five.

1165
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,760
Take a deep breath.

1166
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,940
Walk around with no shoes on.

1167
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,640
Isn't that film slimy between your toes?

1168
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,900
Feels good.

1169
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,380
You're on Earth now.

1170
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,080
Don't pick at it.

1171
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:55,680
Step six.

1172
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:55,680


1173
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,160
Step eight.

1174
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,420
Keep washing it.

1175
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:04,540
Step nine.

1176
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,280
Next time, bring a dozen more socks.

1177
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,460
Each interchangeable.

1178
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,700
Step 12.

1179
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,940
Leave it all behind.

1180
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,740
You don't need that job.

1181
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,380
Step 13.

1182
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,600
Go out and look for work.

1183
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,400
Step 14.

1184
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,900
Go out and look for work.

1185
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,160
Step 15.

1186
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,900
Go find the work.

1187
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,380
Step 17.

1188
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,720
Go do the work.

1189
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,660
18.

1190
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,180
Go do the work.

1191
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,220
19.

1192
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,680
Go do the work.

1193
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,080
Step 20.

1194
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,720
Well done, boys.

1195
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1196
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1197
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1198
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1199
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1200
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1201
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1202
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1203
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1204
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1205
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1206
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,720


1207
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,660
Don't just drink for your 20s.

1208
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,580
Step 21, do the work.

1209
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,540
Step 22, do the work you love.

1210
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:12,020
Step 23, try to eat a lot more leafy greens,

1211
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,400
the bright green ones.

1212
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,900
They have chlorophyll, plenty of iron.

1213
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,480
You can convert that, just one molecular change

1214
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,920
in order to get over, in order to get over,

1215
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,440
in order to get over the hemoglobin.

1216
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,880
Step 24, eat a hamburger.

1217
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,420
Step 25, eat a cheeseburger.

1218
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,120
Step 26, eat a bacon cheeseburger.

1219
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,280
Step 27, eat, drink lots of water.

1220
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,100
Step 28, I guess we're getting a little behind now.

1221
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,740
Come on!

1222
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,840
Okay Dave, the stuff that we've been,

1223
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,540
or will be listening to on this hour of Slack

1224
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:19,760
that's from 19X Day, was stuff that I just discovered.

1225
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,420
Because I've been editing the videos like way down and dirty,

1226
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,160
mixing,

1227
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,300
fixing two cameras and two audio recordings

1228
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,420
that are separate from the video cameras.

1229
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,220
And finding things that I didn't know happened

1230
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,980
when I was there running the recorders.

1231
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:42,780
So we've got brand new rants that were done six months ago

1232
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,060
by Reverend Fox, were great.

1233
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,440
And there was a mystery rant by Reverend Nugget.

1234
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,140
That's the name of his that I mentioned.

1235
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,160
I'm not sure if I'm able to pronounce it.

1236
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,000
So those are the rants that are,

1237
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,840
were or will be heard on this hour of Slack.

1238
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,580
It is Nugget and not Nugget.

1239
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,140
Right, the guitar playing is,

1240
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,960
at first is by Reverend Angry Larry

1241
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,240
and Lord Rock God is playing drums.

1242
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,180
But then in the later material,

1243
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,160
Reverend Angry Larry is off somewhere drinking

1244
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,340
and Reverend Rock God is playing guitar,

1245
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,120
Fid Chooley's on drums,

1246
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,120
