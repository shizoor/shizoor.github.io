Everybody knows this guy right?!

virgo5141516 Specific Inclusive Truth Goal is B次
is from 1983 can you believe it and it was only invented in like 1980 right uh but it is
it's archived somewhere it was some guy talking about buck naked in dallas and church of the
subgenius 1983 um and and and the problem one thing a big thing i have one reason that why
a lot of subgeniuses aren't really wealthy right now is because bob did say he gave the advice
buy apple stock now at just the right time he had actually you know disseminated that that advice
but he still didn't know how to use the stuff and and so he had actually just written it
in a back alley on a sidewalk buy apple stock now he wrote that on a sidewalk in chalk and really
saw it so that's why right you know who did see it uh but it rained later that evening too
one subgenius did see it he walked by probably right after it was written um he was uh on the
run from a biker gang who wanted him to make speed for him and he was afraid to do that and he's now
a well he became a doctor later uh actually a trauma room surgeon uh dr tillis
phylogenetic
you may you may know dr tillis anyway um he's now a lawyer he got injured on a job
so they have to pay him workman's comp which is about ten thousand dollars a week
anyway he bought apple uh way back then and he also owns a farm dr drummond he's a
he's a farmer and a doctor and a lawyer
with a beautiful life is very much beautiful
like a melodrama
that way in terms of farms my life is like a like a you know 1890s melodrama with the uh with the
bad guy with the mustache like snidely whiplash the whole deal the gal being tied to the railroad
tracks because my mom and dad had a farm and and they had to sell it oh my god when i was in my
when i was like in my 30s i was so sad it was the most beautiful place it was like 300 acres it was
this huge farm in new york yeah i know it was huge uh
and uh and they sold that they sold it and all the land uh because my dad got ripped off by uh
these people at his at the company his brother used to own it was a whole big sad story but
anyway uh yeah he was supposed to get a pension and this guy had robbed the pension fund so he
you know started having a million dollar pension he had to sell the farm literally in order to
retire and so and so my goal in all of this hollywood career see is to be a farmer and a
farmer it's important to me that i'm a farmer and i'm going to be a farmer and i'm going to be a


meen so my goal is to uh to uh to make enough residuals so that i buy the farm back i pay off
all my debts and buy the farm back so that's what i'm working on boy you know we have every time
that's a noble a noble goal every time we talk bleep oh i find out we have more in common because
uh my i didn't my parents didn't have this uh ranch when i was growing up i'm a city kid they they bought this they got lucky right after i left home
But my grandfather built, he was an architect by trade, and he came into a windfall, and
he ended up building a house on the island of St. Martin before it was ruined by rock
stars and hurricanes.
And he built a place that he called Ape's Place because he had monkey and ape-themed
sculptures everywhere.
And it was pretty, you know, modernistic Frank Lloyd Wright kind of thing, overlooking a
big lagoon.
Lagoon, yeah.
And he died when I was in high school.
Fred is the big lagoon.
I'm sorry.
He died when I was in high school, and that's how my mom got to buy this land, actually.
But his wife eventually moved into town.
And then to Miami and sold the place to the artist Jasper Johns, that jack-off artist who
spills paint all over a big canvas and puts a million-dollar price tag on it.
And suckers go for it.
So my goal is to buy my grandfather's house in St. Martin back from Jasper Johns.
It's probably not going to happen.
And luckily, I have this other ancestral place that's just as good.
Nice.
Nice.
I mean, we got dinosaur tracks here, for God's sake.
So, you know, I mean, God, that's just...
And Philo's farm has a graveyard.
He's got human skeletons out there from the Civil War.
Yeah, I've got a Civil War graveyard on my property.
Wow, that's really cool.
He could dig up skeletons if he wanted to.
Well, I don't think he's allowed to.
Well, no, but I mean, he could.
No, I could, but I don't want to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You don't want to get haunted.
Sure.
Yeah.
Or cursed.
I could do a lot of things.
Yeah, I could.
But, yeah.
Wow.
Wow.




Wow.








Wow.






Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
I do.
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I have to name an album.
I'm going to put new albums out on...
But, you know, that's so ironic.
You've talked to me about that two or three times today, and I remember you have a whole
website of band and album names.
Just hundreds of band names.
You can buy a band name from Philo for a dollar, folks.
Honest.
Listen to this.
Here's what...
Here's the new innovative thing.
I've had the band...
these albums out there in the in my website for free for years i'm gonna try something innovative
i'm gonna actually make cds out of them and sell them well that's what i did and we sell
i'm gonna get rich oh man i sell at least one subgenius cd a month
well maybe not quite that maybe not quite that much we used to sell a lot more needless to say
back when people bought cds but now they're like lp records you know only collectors do that old
people yeah and they're really cheap they can have them one to ten of them cost a dollar ten each
right oh well you're gonna you're gonna have somebody else manufacture them yeah because
see i just burn them no it's a burn on demand around here listen to this it's a website that
you upload your your
your
your
album cover you upload your songs and then they put the they put it into a jacket
and put it shrink wrap it and give it a upc code and all that stuff yeah the rudy
schwartz project has recommended that i try that he does that yeah this is the same and
they they'll do any they'll do from you can just get one of them if you want and the cost is you
get you can get one to ten for like a dollar ten each that's nothing so you know i'm not
i'm not wise for it just i grew up and it looks like it's too great and it's just that that's
great and then things get done you know amazingly you buy the cds and you get
uh raise money or you are like so they are you know it's it's the ones that have more
money in it or me more gets free and people terry clark is at 50 a lot of times he's really
generous you know and that and
and you know that�iano also doesn't stay up on theejay and filmуб or any of that
he's let it earlier you read with him and then you actually set this where customers
tend to buy their nuclear programs by doing something like that or something that you do
why does he have to work off that it is a non-profit yeah so they're sending them releases
They didn't last a week.
But most of my old, you know, if it's a name brand,
just like Memorex or whatever, those things you've held up.
My cassette tapes, same thing.
If they're most of the name brands, they sound just like they used to,
except for Scotch and I think BASF.
Both of those used bad binders that didn't hold up over the centuries.
And if it's Scotch or BASF, you can just dump it.
Dump it, I say.
Well, I'm going to have all my old albums will be reissued
with new album covers and original art.
But I'm in the process of also making some new compilations,
so I'm coming up with album names.
So tell me what you think of these.
Okay.
Music to frot by.
I saw the cover for that one on the Mature Gentleman's Club this morning.
That's right.
Philo's Xmas Party.
Bob's Favorite Son.
And son is spelled S-U-N.
Okay.
Then here's another one.
It's just called Stink Face.
I've got to go with Stink Face.
I was thinking Bob's Favorite Son was pretty good,
but it's kind of long.
Well, I'm not finished yet.
I've got four more here.
Oh.
The next one is Nose Runs, Feet Smell.
Then we have Grooming Utensil Blues.
And the very best of Dr. Drummond.
And then I have Dr. Drummond's Examination Room.
Oh, I like that one.
And Church in a Barn.
That's pretty good, too.
Well, that's physically accurate, too.
They're little, not that people don't understand,
but there really is a barn with a church in it in Kentucky.
Philo's place.
Yep.
Yeah.
So they'll be looking for those new albums coming out shortly.
Well, he only has maracas, but he plays them every day.
Yes.
He only has maracas, and they're here to stay.
Well, they come from all over just to hear him play.
Shake a jigger jig maracas.
He'll shake your blues away.
Shake them!

Just to hear him play.
Shake it, shake it, shake Maracas.
He'll shake your blues away.
He only has Maracas by the great Reverend Morgan Gutentag.
Ah, yes.
And now we return to the Philo and Bleepo Hour of Slack special.
In progress.
My little Olympus digital recorder says that we've been yakking for an hour and a half,
which is not good.
That means I have to edit this crap.
And also...
I'm sorry.
I gotta say, this has been the most...
I think so far you've actually achieved the most, like, sort of Johnny Carson PBS NPR
success.
Hour of Slack ever.
Well, I have a general Ed Sullivan approach to doing a show.
You know, normally we have, you know, a bunch of music first and collages and then the blabber.
And it used to be in the old days it would be a little blabber and a little collage and
a little music and a little blabber and a little collage.
But I don't have time for that anymore.
Literally.
Yeah.
You don't have time for that.
Oh, but I got one thing for you.
Okay.
It's going to probably take about five minutes of your show.
Well, it's two shows now, so it's okay.
Okay.
All right.
Well, the last show that we mentioned this guy on, we played a little tape that I made
recently in Boston with me and my friend Jerry.
Right.
I just want to be clear that that was Jerry Goodwin, a.k.a. the former Detroit and then
Boston radio personality who became known as the Duke of Madness.
Right.
Named after a very obscure at the time.
Fire sign theater radio bit.
There you go.
It was like it was like Snoop Dogg calling himself Snoop Dogg because of George Clinton's
atomic dog.
It always comes back.
Oh, by the way, one of the one of the.
But but but but but the bit I just I'm just going to intro a bit.
I'll give you a bit intro.
Damn it.
Okay.
Okay.
This is an old bit by Bleepo Abernathy, a.k.a.
Bill Cates is his earth name.
And.
Jerry Goodwin, the Duke of Madness from WBCN in Boston in the early 1980s.
Go.
And now.
Highway Madness.
Peter Jenkins is a perfectly ordinary traveling salesman traveling a perfectly ordinary American
highway when he decides to turn on the radio.
Well, how about a budget burger?
A budget burger with fries.
Sounds delicious, budget.
So come on over to the pledges.
Because Pledges is the place to go.
Pledges, a self-sustaining restaurant system.
Oh, God, those ads on radio are getting crazier every day.
I am getting hungry.
Let's see restaurants this exit.
Oh, my God.
What do you know?
It's it's a Pledges.
I swore to myself I'd never go into one of those places.
It looks like the only place around.
You what hunger will do to a man.
Look, aTV host and Oak Grove.
See that Homeless Bulldog out there?

Look at all these people, they look exactly the same.
Like some, some hideous crossbreeding between an overfed child and some kind of enormous pig.
Oh, here comes one now.
Hello. Welcome to Pudges. Come on in. Sit down.
Well, thank you. I just came in to...
Have a seat. Now, since today is Happy Day,
we feature as our special a big bowl of Pudge chili
with Pudge fries and choice of beverage.
Melissa, thank you very much. I just came in to get a little...
What's the matter? Don't you like Pudges?
Uh, sure. I love Pudges.
Doesn't everybody?
That's what I like to hear.
And say, since you're such a faithful customer of all of us here at Pudges,
I'd like to take this unique opportunity to offer you your very own job.
Permanent employment right here at Pudges.
How does that grab you?
Great. Actually, I just came in to grab a bite to eat a little...
Oh, there's always plenty to eat at Pudges.
Just maintain group growth status production quotient
on a viable categorical basis for the designated period of time in your substrata,
and you can have all the delicious Pudge burgers
semi-shakes and real taste pies that you can muster.
Well, uh, yeah, uh...
Yeah, and if you're obsolete, you're instant meat.
Ha ha ha ha!
Gosh, Pudge, how could anyone resist an offer like that?
Come on, Petey, don't you like Pudges?
Yeah, yeah, but listen, can I just go out to the parking lot?
Look, I need to change my shoes.
Uh-uh. Once you come to Pudges, there's no reason to wait.
So let's first take a look at the big Pudge kitchen.
Now, over here we have the Pudge home.
Pudgeaholic!
With a Pudge Memorial BBQ.
And as you can see, the human sacrificial offer to Pudge...
Because Pudges is the place to go!
Pudges, a self-sustaining restaurant system.
There.
Perfect. Scissor space.
Yep, exactly. There you go.
And I'm sorry, so I interrupted you.
What was it you were trying to say, Stang? Please.
Uh...
I was saying that the works of Bleepo over the years, and it's been a lot of years.
Bleepo was one of the, I'd say, second phase subgeniuses in the early 80s, maybe around 1982.
The very first phase was 1980.
And there's only about ten of those.
But then there was the second phase.
Right.
The third phase, I guess you get up to Papa Joe Mama, uh, Howell...
Most of the second phasers...
Yeah, most of us...
Dr. Howell and Menzler were in the second phase, early 80s.
Right. And I think we all saw it in Weirdo magazine.
Right.
Yeah, thank God for Robert Crumb. I can't believe he liked our stuff. He hates everything.
And it was Jay Lynch who wrote the article, right? Was that Jay Lynch?
Yeah, Jay Lynch. Jay Lynch was running...
Jay Kinney.
Jay Kinney wrote the article.
Yeah, wrote a...
Yeah.
He had a big article in Whole Earth News or something about us.
Yeah.
And those very early...
Another person who helped us very early in the game was a guy named Lou Stathis, who was the editor of Heavy Metal for a while.
Oh, right.
And he said wonderful things about the pamphlet, and then he died.
Yeah.
Of cancer or something.
Yeah.
One of the many...
Yeah.
You know, and our editor, Tim McGinnis, that got us into McGraw-Hill and publishing.
He died of cancer at age 33, I think.
Oh, man.
Yeah, it's nightmarish. I hate... You know, I used to hate the conspiracy, but I honestly...
Now I hate diseases more, because they're even more mindless than the conspiracy.
Yeah.
And they're killing everybody.
Yeah.
And not even old people. I mean young people.
It's okay. When old people die, well, duh.
But...
Right.
You know, it's terrible when somebody younger than me dies, and that's all it's been.
Yeah, I know.
Now, on the plus side, there's these ancient mummies, like Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and Reverend Zaphod, who are about 80 now.
And...
So...
They're...
Oh, man.
They're still kicking around.
Yeah, exactly.
So...
Well, some people have those lucky genes and some don't.
Eh, phooey.
Well, I credit, you know, just to plug the church again, because this is a broadcast, I credit the church with kickstarting some of...
At least a few of the...
Two immortal genes in me, you know?
So, even if my physical body does die, there's gonna be these little molecules that were activated by Bob that will never ever die.
Right. There'll always be somebody with the song, Frop Without Slack is like Slack without Frop, stuck in their head.
Right.
There will always be bleep-o earworms of those little weird acapella...
Acapella multi-track songs that you did.
Ah, yes.
They are so catchy.
Ah, thank you. Thank you.
And those do bubble up a lot still to this day.
My...
On and off the road to Bob, we are marching forward blind.
He has gouged out both our eyes.
Ah, yes.
And he's laughing close behind.
He will sell us back our eyes when we join his noble clan.
For just $19.95 and a taste of our blood-cland.
On and off the road with Bob, he has handed us the wheel.
And he cuddles up with Bob as he counts himself a field.
Our eyes are on the road to Bob.








But Bob forgot to say that the steering wheel went bust.
The road carries us away.
On and off the road for Bob, we will march forward blind.

We forgot why we came here.
We have quit all of our jobs.
Like a headlight frightened deer.
He has lit the sacred pipe.
And he's smiling at us now.
On and off the road, he's Bob.
He's our bull dada.
We are his cow.
That hurt, Bob.
Bob, where are you?
Stop it, Bob.
Please.
My latest has only been about 20 years in production.
It's called, uh...
I will run...
No, I could.
I'm sorry.
It's called, I could run you all over with my car.
And it's a bossa nova.
Wow.
Can I sing just like the first bit?
Sure.
Sure, go ahead.
So it would be...
I could run you all over with my car.
I could push on the gas and travel very far.
But I can't do that.
Cause I came to that.
Conclusion that everything is just the same as it was.
Oh, I can't do that.
Cause I came to that.
Yeah.
Conclusion that everything is just the same as it was.
So I figured this all out with my wonderful friend, Michael Mortilla.
And I performed it finally for the first time.
First time I ever played it with musicians.
And yeah, it was really fun.
And I'll have a full orchestrated version of it soon.
How do you do that?
That singing thing.
I just, I've never really been able to like do that.
Training as a small child.
Yeah.
Really?
My parents.
Yeah.
And my parents, you know, would play all the Broadway shows.
Well, I grew up with Broadway shows, but I can't sing.
Well, they, plus they pushed us into the classes and it was in our, my father's mother was a mimic.
Who was known in the Lower East Side as the woman who would imitate the butcher and the, and the, and the, you know, the butcher.
You know, milk man and whatever.
And she could, she could mimic all the people in the neighborhood.
And, and she's immortalized partly in her sister was a writer named Anna Yaskaricka who wrote the book that became the movie Hester Street.
What?
Good God.
That's, and that's, that partly involves my family in that neighborhood.
My mother's mother's family.
And then, so, so it's in my blood is what I'm saying.
Well, you know, I met some Cates when I moved out here.
Yeah.
They're probably not.
Were they cats in the old country?
That's just sort of a thing they did when they came over from.
They, when you taste their, their name all the way back to the 18, early 1800s, they were Kate spelled like your, you spell Kate's when, when now they spell it with a C.
Oh, really?
Huh?
Yeah.
Like Phoebe.
But they own, they were the family that owned my property for, you know, way back into the 1800s.
How interesting with, with a C or a K at the time.
They, the last time they were a K was like three great grandfathers ago.
Oh, okay.
It's like you guys are related.
Well, the skeletons anyway.
Yeah.
Maybe some of the skeletons.
Yeah.
Huh?
Hey Bill, do you use a, do you use telegram?
I use telegram.
I'm on, I'm on a, I'm on Instagram as sound genius.

S O U N D P U P.com is my professional sound guy website.
Well, I'm glad to know that.
But I'm at sound genius on, on Instagram and also at sound genius on Twitter.
Sound genius.
That sounds sort of like subgenius.
I was going to look for you on telegram.
Well.
And invite you to our, our.
Our special.

But there are five or six really, really cool people.
Yeah.
Sphinx Drummond, John Hagenbrenner, Phylo.
One of my favorite people.
Onan Canabite, I think set it up.
Yeah.
I went to the doodah parade here with John and boy, did we have a good time?
He is a blast.
I really did.
John Hagenbrenner.
He's so much fun.
Yeah.
Did you go to, um, did you try out Dobbs town?
The new mastodon instance of, for, uh, I joined it.
It looked like I was the only person on and except you.
Well, there's like 600 people on it now.
Yeah.
Onan asked me to use my bulk mail service, a constant contact to send out a bulk mail.
I sent out a bulk mail to everybody.
They're not all members.
It's just anybody who signed up for this little book mail list.
Uh, and about 5,000 people and, uh, I sent it out and 600 people joined that Dobbs town
thing.
Most of them are probably gimme Bob's not members, but it should be interesting.
Huh?
What could doodle, huh?
So we're going to have to kick them out then.
We're going to have to moderate it.
It didn't have to be moderated yet so far, but now let's take a break and listen to this
nice instrumental called get that hate out by the psycho skeletons.
.

yeah that's nice yeah that's nice oh it's it's so weird how churlish just you know the most benign
like the fireside theater what a bunch of nice guys all these churlish people are like how dare
you be making fun of blah blah blah because we never made fun it's like yeah guess what
fireside theater made fun of everything back then why are you like why do you have a problem with
people making fun of shit now they well and the and the different time
man fireside was inspired by the goon show well exactly yeah and i'm sure the goon show
dudes were inspired by somebody before them yep yeah flanders and swan i did once ask
david osman of the fireside theater uh the blunt question how come you guys never got
doing a lot of tv like monty python and he said well we were hippies and we were really happy
doing exactly the same thing and i'm sure the goons show dudes were inspired by somebody before them
we felt so lucky to be doing these radio theater albums that people actually bought that uh
we weren't any more ambitious than that uh they started doing short films and that's partly
because bergman as a sort of a day job was manufacturing the showcon editing table system
which was the cheapest uh high-end editing uh
uh film editing machines you could get for a while they were they were not the highest the
most expensive but they were i worked on them uh right right uh yeah i forgot that he did that yeah
he did do that for a while yeah so they they you know he he was the guy with the
hands-on film experience i think and it was old school films you know they're they're the only
group that i ever i've never seen a film that's been so good and i've never seen a film that's
ever heard of that lip-synced a film to a spoken word album that is correct yes everything you know
is wrong yeah they they would they would play back sections of the album and wearing appropriate
costumes and appropriate sets would reenact what the album had yep yep and it's actually
pretty entertaining oh it's great it's wonderful yeah
it was shot by the i forget the the cinematographer's name but it's the same
guy who shot like et shot what he he was like steven spielberg's cinematographer he shot et
and stuff wow huh i forget the cat's name uh i think he's an israeli gentleman well that was
back when he was you know smoking dope and working with weird hippie art comedy groups

night flight show but now let's hear the first installment of uncle onan canna bites
answers for reverend funny name dear reverend funny name
i received your message and i'm glad to have this opportunity to reply as you noted it is often the
case among our religious competitors that they will project their hopes and fears upon an
external metaphysical world as if by making them outside themselves they are more real instead of
more realist

our members have been there and back. They've told us the tales, what they've seen and done
and smelled. We can know it for a fact. In subgenius hell, you get the chance to fight
all of your enemies and win. They might put up a good front and give you a run for the
money, but in the end, you do defeat them every time. The battle might be a contest
of wills over the chessboard or giant spaceships beaming down hot laser death on rocky landscapes
of your hometown. That's up to you. Now subgenius heaven is where things are more peaceable.
You get all your comic books back.
Subgenius Heaven.
All those things you've lost, all your dead pets, they come back to you. All those people
you wanted to meet, there they are. You can talk to them. They'll talk back. Some people
might spend their time in a friendly discussion with Isaac Newton. Others might run down the
last triceratops. It's a blunderbuss. That's up to you.
Subgenius Heaven and subgenius hell, they start to sound familiar. They start to sound
like, well, maybe that's just the subgenius projecting our hopes and fears on an external
world to make it more real. More real than this one. Because subgenius hell, that pretty
much sounds like here on this planet, Mars, except we don't always live. But we do fight
all the time. We do fight all the time. We do fight all the time. We do fight all the
time. We fight with ourselves all the time and each other all the time. And that's when
we fight with the pinks all the time. The conspiracy fights with us. It's just fighting.
Fighting, fighting. That sounds like subgenius hell, except for the winning part. And subgenius
heaven, well, there's this theological question that comes up with, suppose I want to talk
to Isaac Newton and you want to talk to Isaac Newton at the same time, but we don't want
to talk to each other.
Maybe it's the subgenius heaven. Maybe it's the subgenius heaven. Maybe it's the subgenius
hell.
So it's like we're all just in this bubble where our dreams are projected on the surface
as we sit in the middle of it and we can see everything we want to see but other people
are seeing different things that are incompatible with what we see. And only one can be true
at most. Maybe we're just projecting what we'd like to see and it's none of it real.
Subgenius heaven, none of that is real. Subgenius hell, winning isn't real. It's just that we're

Maybe it's just us projecting what we'd like to see in the world.
Well, Reverend Funny Name, if you go down that path, you might think,
well, is the conspiracy a projection?
Is it something we imagine to blame for the failures that are just inherent in the causal universe?
And slack, is that just a word for things I like?
And Bob, is even Bob a projection of this guy that's a little luckier than we are,
definitely not smarter, but luckier, more talented, more handsome.
He ages differently.
He definitely smells differently.
Maybe we just project some things we like and fear and put a pipe in it and call it Bob.
Well, that's what you're...
That's what you're...

That's what your inquirer brought up to me, Reverend Funny Name, and I thought I'd address it.
I thought about it, and instead I made this report,
because I'm not going to be the one that projects my understanding of the Church as a subgenius on you,
nor you on me.
You've asked me some good questions.
I've had a good thought about it, and I think you know the answer.
And by the...
By the answer, I mean your answer.
Because you have done that one binary action that is necessary for finding your answer
to the Church as a subgenius role, and that is you have sent in your free love offering
to the subgenius foundation and entered the book of life.
After that, you're kind of on your own.
You've got the pamphlets.
You've got the recordings.
You've been listening to the...
Broadcast now for quite some time, as evidenced by your previous letters to Reverend Funny Name,
but I just think that you need to turn this one over to your higher subgenius self.
Every human that becomes a subgenius eventually learns that that subgenius becomes someone else.
Now, I'm on my way.
There are other subgeniuses who've already become their third or fourth self.
They have their third or fourth face opened up, that blast from the ground.
You know what I'm talking about.
So I hope this answers your question by way of many more questions, and that you'll keep in touch.
It was a pleasure to see you at X-Day, and I look forward to seeing you again.
This has been Reverend Dr. Onan Kanabite talking to you from the plateaus of risen Lemuria on Mars.
Thank you.
Yeah, and if anybody listening is a famous Hollywood producer or director,
I'm getting really, really good at acting in front of the camera or behind the microphone.
That's right.
And you can reach me at my website, soundpup.com.
There, I just shilled for my work.
Right on.
Right, that's what you've got to do.
Sorry.
Yeah, there it is.
It's done now.
If you ever want, you can check out quiveringbrain.com.
It's a frigid, frozen website.
It's a website that's never been changed since about 1998.
Oh, beautiful.
And Dr. Drummond, isn't it true that when you started it, you decided to break all the rules of website design deliberately?
Yes, it violates all the rules of good website design.
Yeah, and yet it works.
It still works.
It's an excellent example of what happens when you try to violate the rules on purpose.
Right.
And my frozen...
Website is subgenius.com, and the only thing that ever changes on that anymore is the hour of slack.
But it is an archive of 30 years of subgenius work from 1980 to 2010 or so, when I got bored with...
I don't know if it's really frozen.
I don't know if that site is...
I think that site is more like well-refrigerated gelatin.
Well, it's...
Because I noticed...
Little bits of the pudding, like, will change a little bit, but then the rest of it will stay congealed just as it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Am I right?
It's a museum, basically.
It's crystallized in time.
We've realized that there's too many subgenius...
I can't keep up with it anymore.
I can't save all the art and categorize it and make little galleries of everybody who posts every funny Bob picture on Facebook.
There's thousands of them every day.
Nobody can keep up with them anymore.
It's just a...
I had to just cut loose and go, I can't control this.
It's just a flood.
Just let it happen.
Sit back and enjoy.
It's like old Chevrolets.
Yeah.
Just watch them drive by.
You can't save all of them.
Man, I wish I had one.
Yeah.
I had several of them.
I had some.
Well, my parents had a Chevy for a long time.
From PR News in Washington.
I'm building a floating bridge.
Staff Sergeant Jiren explained floating bridges.
What are the...
And then the tractor trailers with supplies on them.
The temporary bridge is only for emergency personnel and PR News.
But Chuck says those details are non-PR News.
The Trump categorically rejects yesterday.
Pump says, quote,
And I wish security is tragic.
Iran's state-run news agency reports that at least...
This is PR News.
In the incident yesterday.
With British Prime Minister Theresa May floating from London.
Britain says EU.
The Trump was drugging and molesting his lawyers in 2004.
The broad judge in the case has PR News in Washington.
Anyway, okay.
Thank you guys for...
All right.
No, no.
Thank you.
Thank you for having us.
It was fun.
Hey, how many of y'all can go...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.


Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.



Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Adios, amigos.
There it is.
Okay.
Hey, so good.
I hope that sounds okay.
So far, so good.
Cool, man.
All right.
I will talk to you again soon.
I'll send you guys the unedited copy at some point, somehow.
All right.
No sweat.
No sweat.
The edited, because the edited will be different, so.
Doesn't matter.
Cool.
Okay, man.
See you guys.
Bye.
Bye.
Now I've got to figure out how to turn this thing off.
Is that going?
Oh, you can't turn it off.
No, not that again.
It's like all the shows.
You can't turn them off.
And I just quit FaceTime, and I'm still hearing you.
I actually quit it on the computer, and it's still on.
Okay, wait.
I can't even find FaceTime.
I guess it quit.
Hello?
They're gone!
Two hours and one minute of recording time.
Well, that's interesting.
It's almost 10 o'clock.
That means it's almost 11 in Cleveland.
I could call WCSB and get on the Dr. Sinister show.
That might be a bit much.
