1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,200
You cowardly bastard! You're not the voice of the people! I am the voice of the people!

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,940
The people speak through me, not you!

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:28,740
And we begin to tithe and make vows and give offerings, and it broke the slack over their lives!

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,780
Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax! Alax!

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:37,920
Yeah!

6
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,760
Back into your shell.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,800
Time to begin to worry about size eight of the 90-minute tithe.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,560
And now...

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,720
The Song!

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,720
Subgenius.

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,400
Our.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,000
God.

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,220
What.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,840
Presented to you by the Church of the Subgenius in the name of J.R.

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,820
Dull.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
What am I supposed to do?

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,920
Kiss the charming prince?

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,760
I am not crazy, and I don't normally hear the cry of bats.

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,800
Well, you are either in possession of a very new human ability,

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,640
or a very old one.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,100
Okay, hold that thought, whoever's talking on the phone.

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,140
We have with us tonight, today, right now, right here.

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,000
Mic is on, fellas. Get those headphones on.

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,480
We'll be right back.

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,620
Howdy.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Howdy.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,600
Howdy.

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,740
Howdy.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,060
Howdy.

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,160
Howdy.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,720
Can you hear?

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,700
I can.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,820
Can you?

34
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,900
Uh, yep.

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,400
Alright.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:05,980
Yeah.

37
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,360
You might want to, you might want to get a little bit closer to the microphone.

38
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,220
I can hear voices, but then I always hear voices.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,840
All we know is-

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,080
Don't look at me like that.

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,160
Maybe it's some radio signal.

42
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,180
I read about a guy who used to pick up broadcasts and a feeling in his tooth.

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,940
I believe in what I know.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,220
That was a radio broadcast.

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,880
This is my faith.

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,040
It's coming from outermost.

47
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,380
And then see what you believe.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,340
I can't believe what I believe.

49
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,000
As I believe, Reverend Sheldon DeWeer pointed out.

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

51
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:51,980
This is your good host and prayer partner and the curse partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

52
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,860
And, well, I couldn't come down to the radio station tonight.

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,940
So I'm producing the program from the skyscraper headquarters of the Subgenius Foundation.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,660
And we're not transmitting the signal by telephone wires or shortwave tonight, however, no.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,220
But by the sheer force of pure will.

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,420
Yes, Reverend Willa Dobbs, pure will.

57
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,160
Pure will.

58
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,140
The one you hear muttering in the background.

59
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,480
Hi, Will.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,280
Yes, Will is so pure.

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,660
Uh-huh.

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,580
Yeah, sure.

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,820
He's about as pure as most of his fellow subgeniuses.

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,000
Pure as the driven snow from Siberian nuclear bomb tests.

65
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,660
And old Will, he don't get paid much in cash.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,140
But his motives are more pure than that.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,120
He knows that Bob has called him to.

68
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,340
And he knows that there's someone out there running out here.

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,900
You know he wants a heartless sacrifice.

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,060
And he'll do the job.

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,820
Don't you know, I don't blame that man for what happens.

72
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,960
You know, I hope you have.

73
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,280
And, uh-

74
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,060
Thinking about it, it looks like

75
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,260
He is just in some shoes recently 탄

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,260


77
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,260


78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,260


79
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,260


80
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,260


81
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,060
Feels like a corpse that cangreat

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,480
Deldamn

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,420
I call her Lois

84
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,840
But I do not fear her I see all too cla'

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:32,700
CD from Negative Land, our dear friends there in Concord. And we got a tape of St. Jane or

86
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,780
Hyperclete delivering a new hate sermon to the masses in Boston last month. We got a whole

87
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,240
Brain Rock Radio Theater and Subgenius Foundation co-production, The Marriage of Lonesome Cowboy Dave

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:57,180
from WCSB Cleveland broadcast. We got some rare Fireside Theater from Bootlegs. We have Church of

89
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:07,560
New Faith and Michael Pepe, Princess Wiardo's Tops Up, Bottoms Down review. This is hour of slack

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,520
number 423, by the way. And Reverend Velveteen Sly and Sister Girlfriend from WORT Madison,

91
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,120
Morton Downey Jr. on Bob, The Swingin' Love Corpses, Dr. Howell's Howling Hilariously

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,480
Interplay with callers to the KPFA Berkeley Subgenius Show, and loads of ugly Wellmanization

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,860
media barrage re-collage from Pizzling Everdunce, as Dr. Drummond calls him. And I don't know what

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,900
else yet, but then, but then, who does?

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,420
And we are going to save the universe this time.

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Mr. Smith, not a religious man myself, I'm sorry to say, but I will say this. If God has seen fit to bless you with this gift, you should use it.

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
Bless me?

98
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,120
You know what God did for me?

99
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,220
He threw an 18-wheel truck at me.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,280
Bounced me into nowhere for five years.

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,560
God's been a real sport to me.

102
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:31,620
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike and be replaced by African witch doctors.

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:40,960
A man knows everything around him. Then one day he sees himself, and then he doesn't.

104
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,260
Who's there?

105
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,020
One in one voice.

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,220
One in one voice?

107
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,220


108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,160
There weren't voices. There were more life. Thoughts.

109
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,420
It's just a gesture.

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,440
I've served seven years in this thing, so I'm ready to open the rock.

111
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,540
Can't you pick up your cues faster than that?

112
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,840
I can't do your show on our show, you know that.

113
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,140
They always try, but you see, they never learn.

114
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,380
Even plenarian worms can learn, but power is going to never learn to take their turn.

115
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,100
...political..

116
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,800
The government...

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,200
Yes, that's right.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


119
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


120
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


123
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


125
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


128
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,200


129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,700
This is the genius cult we're studying this morning.

130
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,100
An unusual group of true believers and animalistic worshippers,

131
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,000
generally from backwoods and remote portions of the country.

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,760
Rural Texas, Arkansas, and the darker woods of Iowa.

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,380
The desperate, the lonely, losers, pencil neck geeks, wimps,

134
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:52,680
the maladroit, those with yards, all found under the aegis of subgenius fandom.

135
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
In their own retreat, their private mountain fortress,

136
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,200
the Cool Ranch Davidians decide to tell their children

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,860
all about the revered J.R. Bob Dog.

138
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,400
My children.

139
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,680
You are this.

140
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
This is an authentic.

141
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,000
Bob Lecture.

142
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,860
One of the first of seven seminars given by Bob in 1956.

143
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,360
And look at them lap it up.

144
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,680
There they all are, sitting in the front row in Embryo, the Embryo Janer.

145
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,700
And why don't you tell us exactly what it's about?

146
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,380
Yeah, that's the Church of the Subgenius.

147
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,060
It's called the Final Solution to the Entertainment Problem.

148
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,260
And that's going to be happening tonight.

149
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,780
It's going to be at the Middle East Cafe at 9.

150
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,700
It'll feature subgenius preacher and anti-comedian, J.R. Hyperclete,

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,000
Reverend Brother Pope Cleve Duncan,

152
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,600
and special musical guests, the Wheelers and Dealers.

153
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,180
The admission is $5 or all your worldly goods.

154
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,280
And we want you to know that this is a love offering.

155
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,760
It is not obligatory.

156
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,780
However, if you're not loving enough, there will be an armed guard with a shotgun.

157
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,240
We don't mind spreading out.

158
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,920
We want to help our supporters who aren't loving enough a little bit.

159
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,880
But I've got...

160
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,140
My name is Janer Hyperclete, and I'm here in the studio with Pat McGrath.

161
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:31,240
I misspelled and mispronounced the names of all the Wheelers and Dealers, all my partners.

162
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,700
And we're here to confuse you with more disinformation.

163
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,020
I hope so. I hope so.

164
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,480
You can just hear the sincerity dripping off our every word.

165
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,300
That's right.

166
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,360
And that's what the Church is about.

167
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,820
That's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,240
Well, I mean, pretension is the wave of the future, and always has been.

169
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,380
If you want to go for this real person thing, I mean, hey, this is 1993.

170
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,500
You know, that's not going to fly.

171
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,040
Right.

172
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,460
So...

173
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,920
There's too much money involved.

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,620
The corporations behind it won't let it be spontaneous.

175
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,980
This, in point of fact, this is all on tape.

176
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,560
That is true. It's all on tape.

177
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,480
Anyway, so, Janor, you're a preacher for the Church of the Subgenius.

178
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,220
Just exactly what is the Church of the Subgenius?

179
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,300
Well, it started back in about 1978 when Ivan Stang was talking about...

180
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,840
Well, he had written a book that no one would publish, and he had made a film that no one would show.

181
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,720
And he was talking to his friend Philo Drummond.

182
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,480
And he was just kind of a struggling artist type.

183
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,800
And he was complaining, and his friend Philo Drummond said,

184
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,460
Well, the problem is that if you were a genius, you'd be rich and famous.

185
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,280
But if you were a normal person, you'd be satisfied with a 9-to-5 job.

186
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,000
Your problem is that you're some kind of a subgenius.

187
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,720
And that sort of set off some kind of light in his head that there were other people like him out there.

188
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,720
So he started the Church of the Subgenius,

189
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,580
which is a collection of...

190
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:06,700
Subgenius.

191
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,560
...outcasts, misfits, creative artist types, humorists,

192
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,140
superior mutants, and...

193
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,480
Mass murderers.

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,460
Mass serial killers, mass murderers.

195
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,840
We believe that the normals form a vast conspiracy against the different.

196
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,800
And our central belief system is that all abnormal people are superior.

197
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,300
And if they send in $20 to our P.O. box...

198
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

199
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,080
That's commercialism. We can't do that.

200
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,580
This is a non-commercial radio station.

201
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,940
Yeah, I turned your mic off.

202
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,180
Anyway, I do have an FCC obligation.

203
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,940
And now, Crosley Bendix,

204
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,300
cultural reviewer and director of stylistic premonitions for the Universal Media Network,

205
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
with today's arts review.

206
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:24,700
To say that he's spicy, he takes good care of the Carl Green Command,

207
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:24,700


208
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:24,700


209
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:24,700


210
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,220
Hello, 아이셈

211
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,180
Each child has aaturon.

212
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,620
Life together.

213
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,040
That's Percy.

214
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,880
Hi- tiver,

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:40,660
love to scare ourselves for fun. Our fear for fun should not be taken lightly. When Dr. Hyde drank

216
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:47,460
that vial of bubbling bug juice on the set of Robert Louis Stavinsky's famous opera, he became

217
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:57,020
what we all fear most of all. Next to that thing in the thing, the internal monster within us all,

218
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:07,420
that nameless fear that hungers for nameless fears. Pretty good trick, that vial. But as any

219
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:15,660
scientist knows, the real test of any experiment is in its repetition. And I'm not referring to

220
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:26,380
reruns. I'm referring to this. This vial bubbling bug juice.

221
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm going to drink this vial of Stavinsky's formula faithfully concocted from his original score in order to put a little, well, a little sense of apprehension into this otherwise rather dull and academic discussion.

222
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,220
I might as well finish it.

223
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:26,640
Now, let's turn to the special effects of special effects. After passing the cases of monstrously overpriced theater candy designed to numb our sense of reality, we sit with disbelief suspended as splitting rubber latex spurts crimson syrup.

224
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,080
And slimy leaping demons suck the cold sweat from our armpits.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Our internal fright meters record a level to qualify the success of this illusion.

226
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:53,460
What lies behind the appeal of illusory fear? We all know the answer.

227
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,680
It's the.

228
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,140
Lore of super reality.

229
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:11,040
As everyone who's ever been in a fight knows, violence is distinctively different state of being in which one is drugged with adrenaline.

230
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,300
Time stands still.

231
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,540
We seem to be more alive within a world of pure action.

232
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,860
And.

233
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:23,860


234
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Uh.

235
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,480
Uh.

236
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,640
Uh.

237
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:26,880
Uh.

238
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,240
Uh.

239
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:30,900


240
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,840
Uh.

241
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


242
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


243
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


244
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


245
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


246
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


247
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


248
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


249
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


250
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


251
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


252
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


253
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


254
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


255
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


256
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


257
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


258
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


259
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


260
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


261
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


262
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


263
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


264
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


265
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840


266
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,860
The threat of intelligence in human affairs

267
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,700
are returned from this exhilaration with a sense of relief.

268
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:52,940
Others find the return to normal to be a let-down.

269
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,440
A return to a

270
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,000
A return to a

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000


272
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:10,140
meaningless, mundane existence, and they seek opportunities to return again into the super-reality of violent acts.

273
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:32,340
This knowledge, the personal power to transform and heighten reality with violence, is similar to our fascination with evil,

274
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,480
which is...

275
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,540
fascinating.

276
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,560
We are constantly faced...

277
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,860
changing...

278
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,300
faced...

279
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,460
faced, changed, faced with...

280
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,500
faced with the double fa...

281
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
double standard of love.

282
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,520
Evil.

283
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,980
Yearning for confronting...

284
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,740
yearning for...

285
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,080
yearning for confronting...

286
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,060
infection.

287
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,500
The things we would run from...

288
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,940
in the streets.

289
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Dark, deserted streets.

290
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,800
Ah...

291
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,980
Ah...

292
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:36,980


293
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,000
Ah...

294
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,000


295
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,620
Ah...

296
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,900
You've been listening to cultural reviewer and social critic, Crosley Bendix.

297
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,560
I predict there will always be more people, but there will never be more land.

298
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,860
I predict that population explosion will permit standing room only.

299
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,120
Every inch of our land will be occupied.

300
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,740
I predict we will live in floating cities sustained by anti-gravity,

301
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,380
huge plastic bubbles under the sea which draws oxygen from the sea itself,

302
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,220
underground tunnels and caves, plus the very center of Earth,

303
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,960
which will be a nation unto itself.

304
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,300
Right, you'll be taken up aboard what we call escape saucers

305
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,220
to what we call the laser dimensions,

306
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,380
while what we call the normals will be laser beams to death.

307
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,220
Now, I know someone who sent in $20 and they never got a reply.

308
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,220
Well, that's what we call slack.

309
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,800
That's what we call a journey to the bank account.

310
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,180
Good.

311
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,080
It seems we heard a lot about you guys in the late 80s,

312
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,140
you know, Devo and all that stuff.

313
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,840
But then we didn't hear from you for a while.

314
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,700
What happened?

315
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,440
Well, I mean, you've heard about a band breaking up and getting back together.

316
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,640
This is sort of like a person breaking up and getting back together.

317
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,020
I don't know.

318
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,360
I don't know.

319
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


320
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


321
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


322
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


323
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


324
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


325
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


326
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


327
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,360


328
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,920
I don't know.

329
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,560
I'm reformed, but not reformed, if you know what I mean.

330
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,220
That's out of sight now.

331
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,440
I don't need your sympathy. Come on.

332
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,340
You describe the members of the church and subgenius as being outcasts and abnormals.

333
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,420
And mass murderers.

334
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,440
And do you feel that you are an outcast yourself?

335
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Well, yeah, I've always felt like an outcast in just about any given social situation.

336
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,940
And really, the only way I can feel like I fit in is by having my own show.

337
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,360
And even then, that doesn't really work.

338
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,800
Because I usually end up getting stage fright.

339
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,540
And, you know, in a sense, it's legitimate.

340
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:50,400
Because, I mean, how else could I react except with fear and contempt to anyone who would pay to see me?

341
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,920
But, you know, I'll never forget my fans because they made me what I am today.

342
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
A raving psychotic.

343
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,960
I truly hate my fans.

344
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,240
Of course, most of my fans are raving psychotics also.

345
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,620
You.

346
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,760
Yes.

347
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,460
You.

348
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,580
You.

349
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:08,740
You.

350
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,260
Listening.

351
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,640
To this message is alone.

352
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,220
Check it out.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
You're not alone.

354
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,260
There's someone out there in God's gray universe who really cares.

355
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,040
Who really cares about you and your feelings.

356
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,600
Who really knows you inside and out.

357
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,780
Knows your moods.

358
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,960
Your wants.

359
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,420
Your needs.

360
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,540
Yes.

361
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,860
Knows your special needs.

362
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,100
Your G-zone.

363
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,180
Your tickle spots.

364
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,620
Knows what you like and where you like it.

365
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,640
And that person is right there.

366
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,560
Right there.

367
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,060
Right now.

368
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,700
Right there.

369
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,320
Right now.

370
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,600
Right inside of you.

371
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,040
Quit looking around.

372
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,400
It's you, dummy.

373
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,680
You.

374
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,600
You're the one that you're looking for.

375
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes, you.

376
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,140
You're the one that really cares about yourself.

377
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,940
Oh, I know.

378
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,720
Sometimes it might seem like you don't care about yourself.

379
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,200
Like with that three-pack-a-day habit.

380
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,820
Or your hygiene habits.

381
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,920
Or your days of tedious boredom.

382
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,620
Doing nothing except watching TV.

383
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,160
And lusting for young starlets and harlots.

384
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,300
Those things you can overlook, though.

385
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,780
Of course you can.

386
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,060
Why?

387
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,220
Because you love yourself.

388
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,720
And when you love something, you should stick with it.

389
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,200
Nurture it.

390
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,660
Make it grow.

391
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,880
And never let it go.

392
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,900
Marry yourself to it.

393
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,200
Ah!

394
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Marry yourself.

395
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,740
Period.

396
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,660
That's right.

397
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,860
For just $19.95.

398
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,680
For the first three minutes, you can call up and we will marry you to yourself right on

399
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,000
the spot.

400
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,600
Right here.

401
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,280
Right there.

402
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,880
Right then.

403
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,440
Right now.

404
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,780
What are you waiting for?

405
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,320
Go ahead.

406
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,640
Pop yourself the question.

407
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,360
You've accepted, right?

408
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
You'd be a fool not to.

409
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,720
What person could resist you?

410
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:06,840
Two hundred and ten pounds of sleek fat on a five-foot-two-inch bod with hangnails.

411
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,040
Hey!

412
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,340
I'm a fool!

413
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


414
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


415
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


416
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


417
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


418
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


419
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


420
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,340


421
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,040
And if you want to change your size or shape, you are the person you've been waiting for.

422
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,420
So never be alone again when you're alone again.

423
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,780
Call 1-700-I-LOVE-ME.

424
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,080
That's 1-700-I-LOVE-ME.

425
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,620
1-700-I-LOVE-ME, etcetera.

426
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,360
Call now.

427
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Marrying yourself is the perfect Christmas gift for yourself.

428
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,640
Oh, gee.

429
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,180
Darn it, I'm so tired.

430
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,180


431
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,180


432
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,180


433
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
What a life-changing commercial.

434
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,900
1-700-I-LOVE-ME. 1-700-I-LOVE-ME.

435
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,680
I'll do it. I've been single much too long now.

436
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,980
Pretty near 10 years.

437
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,140
Been single ever since Lucinda had left me for that left-handed dung-molder

438
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,240
in the fall of the house of Gusher.

439
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm sure I can find someone who cares about me.

440
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,820
Me.

441
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,720
Do I take me to be my mate?

442
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,820
Oh, dear. That settles it.

443
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,360
Better get that jet-setting engine

444
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,020
to be my best man.

445
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,900
Hey, you, night-American holistic shrink and codependent.

446
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,900
You, shaggy poodle fondler.

447
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,300
What, what, what?

448
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,520
Lazy in the sky with fool's gold?

449
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,780
This better be good.

450
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,740
Me right in the middle of something.

451
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
Or someone.

452
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,400
When you coming back, psychopath finder, honey?

453
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,080
Soon, soon, my pretty.

454
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,120
Here, me just reel out some more,

455
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,160
and you can go another room and play with it.

456
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,080
Watch out when shutting door.

457
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,720
Okay.

458
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,720
Now, what is it this time, cowboy George?

459
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,700
Big news.

460
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,740
I popped myself a question, man.

461
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,180
And accepted my hand in holy matrimony.

462
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,780
I mean matrimony.

463
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,040
Can you believe it?

464
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,420
What question you pop?

465
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,940
When will I blow my brains out and how?

466
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,900
It's real cute.

467
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,740
Listen, man, I'm serious.

468
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,360
I asked myself to bury myself.

469
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,480
And I accepted.

470
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,060
This is so sudden.

471
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,220
I'm making a call right now to the 1900 telemarketing page

472
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,820
and he hates myself up to me.

473
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Hey, I'm in love, engine cleaner.

474
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,580
Hey, I'm in love.

475
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:28,460
Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful guy in the mirror?

476
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,820
Tell me I love me.

477
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,580
Tell me I need me.

478
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,560
Hey.

479
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,460
Hey.

480
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,340
Hey.

481
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


482
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


483
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


484
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


485
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


486
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


487
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


488
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


489
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


490
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


491
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


492
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,340


493
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,500
OHHH...

494
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,060
She doesn't Western girl make you hear that the only-

495
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,180
you say.

496
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,040
Oh, bros, this is not the way I make you feel.

497
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,040


498
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,040


499
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,040


500
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,040


501
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,540
Right there.

502
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:57,540


503
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:57,540


504
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,280
Where did Bracer say to –

505
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,320
where did Bracer suggest this group to go?

506
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,180
And where did Bracer suggest this group to go?

507
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,060
Here's a brief Gabrielle.

508
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,700
Been in a relationship for a lot with Br larger than that man,

509
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,720
but year over year things like being in a relationship with someone

510
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:03,840
just because they don't want to hook stuff on you.

511
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,760
Yeah man,

512
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm spoken for.

513
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,960
Hey, Dave, can I do or say something to move this plot along, please, please, please?

514
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,180
I need some attention here.

515
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,380
Scabby, not now. I'm the main burner of this plot, baby.

516
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,200
Just to make some stupid remark in it, and then we'll move it along.

517
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,240
Oh, great. Just like all the other times.

518
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,420
Look, I just opened my skull when a railroad spiker stumbled on my left testicle

519
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,860
and fell into the basement of the RV.

520
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,800
Oh, woe is me.

521
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,780
Unpredictable.

522
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,020
Crepes and crepes.

523
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,480
You removed like a clitorectomist?

524
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,580
Scabby, can't you ever move the plot along?

525
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,740
Miss Nunez's stigmatization spotty are the bridesmaids for now.

526
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,400
Silent bridesmaids.

527
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm sure Dave will write you in some more lines.

528
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,960
I am Dave.

529
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,220
The character Dave, not the real Dave Davis.

530
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,180
The real Dave is reading this, though.

531
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,120
Hey, hey.

532
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,360
So don't worry, folks. It'll all come out in a wash.

533
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,260
Okay, it's here in the script. It's here in the script.

534
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,500
It's ringing!

535
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:21,100
Uh, good evening, and welcome to the church of Our Lady of Telemarketing Sorrows, Incorporated.

536
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,080
I am the far-right, honorable Pastor Future with a present.

537
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,460
A present for you for calling this chapel of electromagnetic wedding bliss.

538
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,260

539
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,620
press 1.

540
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,340
If you would like a free hour stay in Newark, New Jersey, pay toilet,

541
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,300
press 2.

542
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,340
If you would like the bucket of beer brunch with Bavarian pretzels for half price,

543
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,280
press 3.

544

Or press 4 to disconnect this sacrament.

545
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Thank you.

546
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,040
Are we ready to begin?

547
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,300
We are gathered around this receiver today

548
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,920
to join this person who is coming apart

549
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
in the state of monogamy moment.

550
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,980
This is the sacrament of matrimony with it, his or her selves.

551
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,300
As you know, the sacrament of matrimony is sacred and should not be entered lightly.

552
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,360
That is why this lovely single has promised to live faithfully to himself

553
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,860
and forever ready, steady, go.

554
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,260
Do you...

555
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,480
At the sound of the tone, please say your name.

556
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,160
Uh, low to the lefty, righty, middly, cowboy, L, G, Einstein, going, going, on and on.

557
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,560
Take.

558
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,020
Uh, low to the lefty, righty, middly, cowboy, L, G, Einstein, going, going, on and on.

559
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,160


560
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,020
To be your own lawfully wedded husband or wife,

561
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,320
To have and to grab, to kick and deal,

562
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,760
To nip and tuck, to stand and deliver,

563
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,100
To block and tackle, to drug, dishonor and disobey,

564
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,520
To drug, dishonor and disobey,

565
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
For as long as the both of you shall live,

566
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,160
So help you, chases.

567
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
I do.

568
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,260
And do you.

569
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,240
Uh, low to the lefty, righty, middly, cowboy, L, G, Einstein, going, going, on and on.

570
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,240


571
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,240


572
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,420
Take.

573
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,220
Uh, low to the lefty, righty, middly, cowboy, L, G, Einstein, going, going, on and on.

574
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,900
To wash and dry, to protect and serve, to lift and separate,

575
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,380
To moan and groan, to divide and conquer,

576
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,880
To bob and weave, and to be or not to be,

577
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,000
So help you, the mob?

578
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,400
I do.

579
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,220
If there's anyone here who objects to this union of one personality and two different personalities,

580
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,320
Speak now or forever hold your piece of meat.

581
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,500
If no one objects, press 1.

582
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,580
If someone else objects, press 2.

583
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,220
If you object, press 3.

584
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,940
To end this sacrament, press 4.

585
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,060
Oh, I'm sorry, I, uh, I just...

586
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,000
I object! I object!

587
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,360
Don't do it, lonesome!

588
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,020
Don't do it, lonesome!

589
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,580
Not now, Scabby!

590
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,820
Why, Scabby, why?

591
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,340
You're already married. To me.

592
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,680
I knew I'd move this plot along somehow.

593
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,260
Married to you? Impossible.

594
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,620
He married to career, or he married to my therapy or something, but not to you.

595
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,980
I can prove it. He married me at the Winden place,

596
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,360
at the cemetery last night.

597
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,680
I was carrying on, and he got fed up,

598
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,280
and took a shovel and went to the remains to be seen.

599
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,040
Cemetery dug a hole and married me.

600
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,060
I don't know what happened.

601
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,100
Scabby, I did not marry you.

602
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,660
I buried you last night. I buried you!

603
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,540
My brain snapped, and I felt compelled to bury you.

604
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,860
So there! You still didn't move the plot along.

605
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,160
Just press 1. No one objects.

606
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,840
Place the ring on your middle finger.

607
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,820
By the powers invested in me,

608
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
by the state of confusion,

609
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,980
I now pronounce you individual and self.

610
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,140
I hope the both of you are very happy.

611
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,360
You may now kiss yourself.

612
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm sorry, Scabby.

613
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200


614
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200


615
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,160
Tell your friends about the Church of Telemarketing Sorrows,

616
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,520
and may you be blessed with many millions of possible human lives spilled on the floor,

617
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,920
or in Kleenex, or in your fuzzy sock.

618
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,900
Try these other services here at Our Lady of Telemarketing Sorrows.

619
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,300
Cloning yourself, burying yourself, and suing yourself.

620
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,660
Here comes the bride in a cowboy hat.

621
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,580
He married herself.

622
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,220
He thinks he knows where it's at.

623
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,460
Here comes the groom walking down the aisle.

624
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,660
With no brains in his head,

625
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,580
no wonder he has a smile.

626
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,480
I've done it.

627
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,040
We've done it. Me, by myself, and I've done it.

628
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,500
Aren't you guys going to congratulate me?

629
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,540
Where's your presents?

630
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,280
Where's your wedding presents?

631
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,640
Where's my presents?

632
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,620
Present?

633
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,140
No, listen.

634
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,840
Listen, this getting to be old hat.

635
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,360
Every night, you call this 900 number,

636
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,280
and then marry yourself,

637
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,900
and expect to get presents from me.

638
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,160
Okay, if that's the way you feel about it,

639
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,120
I'm going to consummate this marriage right here in front of both of you, swine.

640
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,760
Oh, baby.

641
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,500
Oh, baby.

642
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,900
Oh, baby.

643
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,000
The station wishes to apologize for this last bit of fluff.

644
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,600
We'll have the good time with you,

645
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,600


646
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,600


647
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,640
and in case not to air the rest of Lonesome Cowboy Dave's consummation of his...

648
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,040
And he's all day screaming,

649
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,840
kill me, kill me,

650
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,540
but they laugh and cook more the eggs

651
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,200
and cutting the knife more

652
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
and beating more

653
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,580
until they are bored.

654
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,700
Bored with me

655
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,640
and drag me back to my cell.

656
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,360
And it's not to my surprise.

657
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,100
My heart is beating,

658
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,140
springing the heat,

659
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,880
the sweat it fills my eyes.

660
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,480
I do not mind what I excrete,

661
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,060
cause I'm here to make a buck.

662
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,820
And those that cannot take the heat

663
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,980
can take the flake.

664
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,560
Forgive me if I hesitate.

665
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,780
It's incredibly fun to hear.

666
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,920
Incredibly fun to hear.

667
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,620
Incredibly fun,

668
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,720
yes I must say,

669
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
it's incredibly fun to hear.

670
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,360
We wrote it in the sky.

671
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,620
The smoke,

672
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,720
the smears of blood,

673
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,640
the geese with little biting,

674
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,000
little biting beaks,

675
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,300
little naily teeth,

676
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,680
the tearing and ripping in the brown ear.

677
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, I don't hear anything.

678
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,680
Oh, I don't know nothing.

679
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm just locked up in this black box

680
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,580
and this big stomach in the dirt.

681
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,380
Music!

682
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,880
This is a calamity.

683
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,420
Dreams,

684
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,460
ruined dreams,

685
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,180
dreams,

686
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:33,920
dreams,

687
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,740
a dream

688
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,580
within a dream.

689
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,360
Rory.

690
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,820
Dreams.

691
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,620
Rory.

692
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,620
Dreams.

693
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,320
It drives people mad.

694
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,420
It drives people mad.

695
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,580
There is no answer.

696
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,120
There is no answer.

697
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
I'll do anything you say.

698
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,640
She likes it that way.

699
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,160
I'll do anything you say.

700
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,120
I'll do anything you say.

701
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,960
What a tomato!

702
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,180
I'll do anything you say.

703
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,000
Dreams.

704
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,060
I'll do anything you say.

705
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,640
Dreams.

706
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,600
What a night!

707
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,300
Rory.

708
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,360
And you can believe me.

709
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,860
And you can believe me.

710
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,140
And you can believe me.

711
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,660
Because I never lie

712
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,820
and I'm always right.

713
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,000
And I'm always right.

714
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,620
And I'm always right.

715
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,120
And I'm always right.

716
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,860
God have mercy on their heathen souls.

717
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,480
God have mercy on their heathen souls.

718
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:45,980
Hey Bert!

719
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,480
Hey Bert! Come here Bert!

720
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,540
Where are you Ernie?

721
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,020
Oh I'm right here in my bathtub.

722
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,260
Oh I see. Okay Ernie, what is it now?

723
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,120
What is it now?

724
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,140
Well I am here in my tubby Bert.

725
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,460
Yeah? And that means I'm going to wash myself.

726
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,240
So what do you need me for?

727
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,540
What a silly question.

728
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,340
Am I gonna

729
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,500
delete

730
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,580
all of this?

731
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,100
Don't you

732
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,120
know that

733
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,220
I love you

734
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,440
baby?

735
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,200
Am I

736
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,980
gonna

737
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,880
delete

738
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,120
all of this?

739
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,020
Don't you

740
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,340
know that

741
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,320
I love you

742
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,000
baby?

743
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,120
This isn't the original one I had.

744
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,660
The first one I had was a lot

745
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,880
fatter and longer.

746
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,560
And it used to scare the hell out of me.

747
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
So where do they hide the pump?

748
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,960
The pump?

749
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,400
Yeah, where's the pump hidden?

750
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Well the pump is hidden in a little gelatinous thing

751
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,640
that's kept behind your

752
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,500
sacroiliac.

753
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
No, no, the

754
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,540
squirtum.

755
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,480
It's what you get when you're older.

756
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,300
But that means you have to reach back there at the proper time.

757
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,980
That's right. And that can be

758
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,680
extremely embarrassing. Kind of like air shocks.

759
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,040
It's like honey, would you squeeze

760
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
this bulb for me? Well what I usually

761
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,100
do is just say I have to go to the bathroom and make

762
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,700
a little tink and I pump it up in there, see?

763
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,040
And that way they don't have to... I could see a lot of girls

764
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,560
like, you know, pumping it beyond

765
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,880
its capability.

766
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,100
I could see a lot of, you know, women getting together and talking

767
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,040
about, well, do you help him pump it up?

768
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,200
You know, stuff like that.

769
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,840
Well you should, you know. And then they talk about

770
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,760
which ones don't and which ones do.

771
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,120
And then they decide to make them divorce

772
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,660
you for not pumping it up the right way.

773
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,480
I hooked up an air compressor to that thing.

774
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,120
Choo choo choo choo choo

775
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,180
choo choo choo choo

776
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,960
Okay, honey, I hope you're ready.

777
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,980
Well you should see

778
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,400
some of the beautiful scenes of unicorns

779
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,060
and flying horses that I've done with

780
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,000
this thing, buddy. If you want to make fun, go ahead.

781
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,480
But I've done some pretty, pretty...

782
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,600
It doubles as an airbrush. Yeah.

783
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,140
It doubles as a van painter

784
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,080
par excellence. Especially on the snow. If you stand in front of a big

785
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,420
bank of snow, you can do a great

786
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,720
unicorn airbrush. That's right.

787
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,860
You mean those t-shirts you gave me?

788
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,120
Painting in the snow? Yeah. Oh, man.

789
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,480
That's how I did them.

790
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,020
That's the way to do them, man. I'm not gonna

791
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,920
waste this. One time when I was in the hospital,

792
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,860
they gave me a pill and it made me pee green

793
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,560
or blue or something like that.

794
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,900
That would be cool. You could make t-shirts

795
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,020
with that. I think they fed you some

796
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
soylent green or a common algae and

797
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,740
black etc. to disrupt your...

798
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,400
Soylent green?

799
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,380
Doo-doo is a bad word. Bad word. Bad word!

800
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,900
Doo-doo is a very, very, very

801
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,540
bad word.

802
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,100
No, it's not a bad word,

803
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,080
bad word, bad word. No, it's not a

804
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,520
very, very, very bad word.

805
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,860
Doo-doo is a bad word. Bad word.

806
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,220
Bad word. Doo-doo is a very, very, very

807
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,340
bad word. Doo-doo is a very, very,

808
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,640
very bad word. No, it's not a

809
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,920
bad word, bad word, bad word. No, it's

810
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,840
not a very, very, very bad word.

811
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
Doo-doo is a bad word. Bad word.

812
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:10,560
Bad word, bad word, bad word, bad word.

813
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,000
You are a bad boy, bad boy, bad boy.

814
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,240
You are a very, very, very bad boy.

815
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,280
I can't talk about that kind of stuff on TV.

816
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,600
But how, you ask, how are we going to combat these evils?

817
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:39,080
I will tell you, it will take very much money and resources to combat Satan.

818
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:47,720
We must educate the masses that Satan is everywhere.

819
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,220
I'm sorry.

820
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,300
You must remember that the evil, the Satanism out there is organized.

821
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,140
It's a strong monopoly.

822
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,480
It's a machine.

823
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,240
It's got lots of gas and lots of power to get its means done on Earth.

824
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,020
And that is how the Earth is.

825
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,960
That is the way society is run.

826
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,760
You need money and power.

827
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,440
And only that way can you get what you want done.

828
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,220
So you must send money.

829
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,240
We must grow.

830
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,220
We must become the strong.

831
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,220


832
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,360
We must be the strongest power source in the world to combat evil.

833
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,360
And this is Luke 12.

834
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,040
He said unto his disciples, more than anything else, beware of those fancies.

835
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,520
They pretend to be good when they aren't.

836
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,960
But such hypocrisy cannot be hidden forever.

837
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,960
It will become evident that yees and doh, whatever they have said in the dark, shall be heard in the light.

838
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,180
And what you have whispered in the inner room shall be broadcast from that.

839
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:56,260
And the hell stops to all to hear about the evil and Satanism about.

840
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:11,200
Now this president and myself have exchanged letters on the spread of Satanism, which is the root of all problems plaguing this nation.

841
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,140
It is a paramount problem.

842
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,160
And once the media wakes up and starts attacking this problem, it will be over.

843
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,940
And the problem, day after day after day, all people will not be saved.

844
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,840
The subgenius is Jehovah's pride tool.

845
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,060
The subgenius has a covenant with this deatoid.

846
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,980
Who is well-pleased when his subjects have the wisdom to obey him.

847
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:48,160
It is the chore of the subgenius to smite and eliminate the unwitting.

848
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,160
Slavish!

849
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,700
Nonpartners of Jehovah One.

850
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,160
The great unwashed.

851
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,400
The hoi polloi.

852
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,460
Them.

853
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,280
The conspiracy.

854
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,900
The mediocrity.

855
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,160
The strange normal.

856
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,580
The somnambulax.

857
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,400
Be me.

858
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,320
Disretard.

859
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,120
Disretard.

860
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,160

862
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,280

Disretard.

865
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:25,880

Disretard.

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,140

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,520
Buddha!

878
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,220
Orange haired...

879
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,520
ear ring and the nose wearing...

880
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:48,800
BOO!

881
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,700
BOO!

882
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,080
No, no, no, no, bring it out!

883
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,500
BOO!

884
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,720
No, no, no, no, bring it out!

885
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,760
BOO!

886
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,220


887
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,580
BOO!

888
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,040
It's from the gut! No, it's one of those...

889
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,540
Actually the original...

890
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,400
Where that originally came from was...

891
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:11,960
BOO!

892
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,100
BOO!

893
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,120
That was the original but it was...

894
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,540
since corrupted to...

895
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,700
SQUIRREL, YOU PIG!

896
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,900
And...

897
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Now just the common everyday...

898
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,120
BOO!

899
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,240
BOO!

900
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,220
Where it originally was a...

901
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,520
full gutted...

902
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,040
BOO!

903
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,400
Back script!

904
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,580
It's so wonderful!

905
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
You know, I just got...

906
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,460
As I looked out...

907
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,380
These five people paddling away in the...

908
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,080
I can tell that something's working here...

909
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,740
that's much faster than me...

910
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,740
It's true!

911
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,800
Each and every one of them is...

912
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,540
is adequately equipped...

913
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,920
to carry the torch...

914
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,700

916

BORDS...

917
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,320
BORDS...

918
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,480
BORDS...

919
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,060
BORDS...

920
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,820
BORDS...

921
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,820
THE END

922
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,340
EPIC VIDEO

923
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,600
The 4th part starts now!

924
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:30,600


925
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:30,600


926
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,280
I have some plenty of eachping快

927
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,280


928
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,460
...

929
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,940
Hip

930
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,840
is far beyond control.

931
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,680
The geeking tells you to aspirate,

932
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,240
but he's trying not to miss the goal.

933
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,600
I'm sweating as makes you horny,

934
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,680
well done and I think you're in luck.

935
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,920
Cause all of this crept from my dare

936
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
gives me the first of...

937
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,820
Yo, wash it there.

938
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,320
Everybody wash your ears!

939
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,500
You flush up that wax.

940
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,860
Your ear better, sister girlfriend.

941
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,180
I feel so much better now.

942
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,480
I can sleep live.

943
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,600
Oh, I hear coming.

944
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh, I like to sleep.

945
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,760
I can breathe much better in here now.

946
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,740
Oh, that was so enjoyable.

947
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,080
Hey Susan, did you know

948
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,040
that I'm in with you

949
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,400
and the sock wash is possible?

950
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,500
Well, I'm just a...

951
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,600
I sure did, Bob,

952
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,100
and that means it's time for a game.

953
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,260
Right, so everybody listen

954
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,280
to the game along with us.

955
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,200
Is he washing his sock?

956
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:32,520
Ready?

957
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,660
Oh, Bob and the ladies.

958
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,840
One of these sounds is not like the other.

959
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,820
The U.S. military participation

960
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,960
in unique breeding experiments.

961
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,320
It's true, some years back

962
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,940
the U.S. military did participate

963
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,940
in some unique breeding experiments

964
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,240
with rodents.

965
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,940
They tended to produce a small, vicious animal

966
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,040
capable of incapacitating a man.

967
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,580
These animals were to be used abroad

968
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,520
to protect sensitive computer disk storage areas.

969
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,900
Apparently, the size of the animals

970
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,940
meant they didn't set off the alarm systems.

971
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,640
Eventually, a stable breeding strain

972
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,360
of a hamster-like rodent was established.

973
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,200
These were nocturnal, carnivorous,

974
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
and extremely vicious.

975
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,220
They formed packs

976
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,920
with a highly complex social organization,

977
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,600
a rodent equivalent of the baboon.

978
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,040
Reporter Pat Call

979
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,140
talked to a retired

980
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,200
Army veterinarian some years ago

981
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,600
who had seen a training film

982
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,380
of these animals

983
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,740
tearing apart a year-old steer.

984
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,420
Within 10 minutes,

985
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,180
a pack of 15 of these cyber rodents

986
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,240
had killed the cow.

987
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,460
The vet was reminded of pictures

988
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,620
he had seen of piranha

989
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,180
attacking horse carcasses in the Amazon.

990
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,600
As these things go,

991
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,320
the Army's priorities changed.

992
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,220
The breeding program was canceled

993
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,740
and the stock was sold

994
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,360
to a civilian company in Missouri.

995
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,420
The company intended to market them

996
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:57,980
for security,

997
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,140


998
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,240
in the private sector,

999
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,860
but went bankrupt shortly after in 1988.

1000
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,080
The animals were allegedly destroyed.

1001
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,640
Dog fighting, although illegal,

1002
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,860
has always flourished

1003
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,320
in Cochise County, Arizona.

1004
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,000
Toward the end of 1989,

1005
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,820
local authorities in Cochise

1006
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,880
began hearing rumors

1007
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,840
of dog-hamster fights.

1008
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,120
One thing led to another,

1009
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,660
and at the beginning of 1991,

1010
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,100
authorities raided the house

1011
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,760
of a man living on the outskirts

1012
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,200
of Busby, Arizona,

1013
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,580
where they found,

1014
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,340
about 30 small cages empty.

1015
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,720
Was Barney involved?

1016
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,260
The man was arrested for drug possession

1017
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,700
and confessed to breeding and fighting

1018
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,700
what he called attack hamsters.

1019
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,760
I think these were Norwegian warfrat.

1020
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,740
He claimed to have purchased

1021
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,940
his original breeding stock

1022
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,760
from a man in Missouri.

1023
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,280
He admitted that he had been tipped off

1024
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,400
about the raid and had set the animals free.

1025
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,240
Coincidence? We think not.

1026
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,660
In May 1991, mutilated animal carcasses

1027
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,480
began turning up in the Palomino's Hereford area.

1028
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,160
Deaths of a large number of coyotes,

1029
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,280
two calves, one horse, and a bobcat

1030
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,480
were unofficially attributed to the hamsters.

1031
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,260
At the end of September,

1032
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,400
the remains of a man who lived alone

1033
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,280
in the trailer in the Mosen Road area

1034
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,920
were discovered.

1035
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,360
Neighbors said he raised hamsters.

1036
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,620
There were a number of empty cages,

1037
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,100
but again, no animals were found.

1038
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,720
A month later, the freshly killed carcasses

1039
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,160
of what appeared to be a large dog

1040
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,200
and two cats were found out

1041
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,620
in a vacant lot in Sierra Vista.

1042
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,940
Not a lot of evidence of what there is

1043
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,380
is possible.

1044
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,140
The keeper of a secret.

1045
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,720
She just likes to play games.

1046
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,180
A lethal drug and a watch.

1047
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,080
One man amusing himself.

1048
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,500
You want a plastic girl?

1049
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,460
Yes.

1050
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,580
It's not a game.

1051
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,720
All add up to a strange encounter.

1052
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,920
She was enticed into a struggle with a drug.

1053
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,240
But no drug you ever had.

1054
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,040
You risk everything.

1055
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,760
You risk everything when you play

1056
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,220
The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

1057
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,020
Let me tell you something that I hope,

1058
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,160
Reverend Stang,

1059
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,240
while I know that you as the pope

1060
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,880
of this religion are familiar with it,

1061
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:24,040
Bob, who we refer to in our teachings,

1062
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,100
Bob grew up fighting the stigma

1063
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,500
of that Mayan dad of his.

1064
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,860
You know, other kids made cruel fun of the,

1065
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,920
oh, God, of that slope head of full-blood Mayan area.

1066
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,000
And though Mr. Dobbs maintained dignified silence,

1067
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,320
little Bobby, well, little Bobby got in a lot of scraps

1068
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,000
battling for his dad's honor.

1069
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,120
And it was shortly after receiving a blow to the head

1070
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,040
during one of those fights that Bob began experiencing

1071
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
precognitive visions.

1072
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,060
Oh, that's another one.

1073
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,580
Now, I got to tell you, this troubled childhood

1074
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,740
had a telling effect on this sensitive kid, all right?

1075
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,400
He became, thanks to the pharmacies,

1076
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,800
where as a chronic alcoholic at the age of six,

1077
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,540
I went into hibernation, waiting for the computer god

1078
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,840
efforts to murder me and the brokerage officers to relax.

1079
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,480
Early in 1969, secretly, the computer god

1080
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,180
controlled and manipulated gangster government,

1081
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,680
issued a warrant for my immediate arrest and incarceration

1082
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,160
in a maximum security insanity prison

1083
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,580
to be cured forever before I could go

1084
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,020
before any parroting puppet happened.

1085
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,000
And then, when Rob gangster judged to give testimony...

1086
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,700
So-called Christians that just go to church on Christmas Eve

1087
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,420
are not Christians at all!

1088
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,460
Let me tell you, my friend, they will burn in the fiery depths

1089
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:41,740
of hell all the hotter because they come in

1090
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,960
and have the gall to try and show the pretense

1091
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,840
that they are Christians.

1092
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,940
For that, they will burn twice as hot as any evening.

1093
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,180
Oh, I said I will!

1094
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,840
One wing of our barn!

1095
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,480
Into this life

1096
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,140
We were destined

1097
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,880
To make it right

1098
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,880
It's predetermined

1099
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,420
And this is our fate

1100
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,160
We're singing this song

1101
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,620
So you can relate

1102
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,100
We are going to save the universe

1103
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,900
We are going to save the universe

1104
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,660
We are going to save the universe

1105
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,060
This time

1106
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,960
We are foreground

1107
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,740
We are grown-up men

1108
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,720
We are all past

1109
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,380
We hate to reason

1110
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,160
That is our mission

1111
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,020
We are going to save the universe

1112
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,920
It is our past

1113
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,140
It's obvious

1114
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,460
That you still ask

1115
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,620
We are going to save the universe

1116
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,300
We are going to save the universe

1117
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,400
We are going to save the universe

1118
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,660
This time

1119
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:24,020
We are going to save the universe

1120
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,500
It is HatseN

1121
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:25,500


1122
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,420
It's obvious

1123
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:43,640
If life can't wake you up

1124
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:43,800
You can't wake to you

1125
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,340
My Attention

1126
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,740
This pops up

1127
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,580
When I expect

1128
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:49,900
Your puddles

1129
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,160
And say

1130
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,860
Sir please

1131
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,100
It's so quick

1132
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,100


1133
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,100


1134
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,580
And every touch

1135
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,620
So that it'll cut through

1136
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,160
Because the alien is here

1137
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,880
We don't matter

1138
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,420
So it's not the same

1139
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,140
We're in control

1140
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,080
And we are more than a band

1141
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,720
We are gone

1142
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,100
Inside the universe

1143
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,420
We are gone

1144
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,900
Inside the universe

1145
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,240
We are gone

1146
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,920
Inside the universe

1147
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,300
It's a dive

1148
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,720
Well, maybe next time.

1149
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,420
Thank you.

1150
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,120
We were looking at that earlier.

1151
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,100
Did you hear that the Catholic Church is going to begin advertising on MTV

1152
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,960
to try to recruit young males?

1153
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,920
It says, look at it.

1154
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,980
Well, they're copying us.

1155
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,940
They're copying the Church of the Subgenius.

1156
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,920
Reverend, Reverend, look here.

1157
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,860
If you notice, this is...

1158
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,420
Emojons Anonymous.

1159
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,360
Hand out to new members.

1160
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,320
So if you become a member of the Catholic Church,

1161
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,300
that's the first thing you get

1162
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,480
is welcome to Emojons Anonymous.

1163
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,500
Well, you have a new member.

1164
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,120
You were talking about how it wasn't nearly as good as the old one.

1165
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,120
And now you can wrap this around it.

1166
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,300
The other guy, he had it cut off.

1167
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,240
I'm hooked into a constantly regenerating process.

1168
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,080
The people that I went to see

1169
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,460
were very near...

1170
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,120
What's the name of that college in Vermont?

1171
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,080
Farmer's Branch.

1172
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,220
Farmer's Branch.

1173
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,400
It was upstate in Vermont, near Farmer's Branch,

1174
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,620
where there's a blue lawn.

1175
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,320
Downstate, really.

1176
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,700
And it seemed that these people were offering this thing

1177
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,700
on a one-time basis.

1178
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,980
The Farmer's Branch fighting moose.

1179
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,560
Yeah, more downstate, really.

1180
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,260
Is moose the same for plural, moose?

1181
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,260
Mooses?

1182
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,700
No, it's moose-eye.

1183
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,720
Moose-eye.

1184
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,540
The moose-eye.

1185
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,620
Two of them are moose-eye.

1186
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,360
The Farmer's Market moose-eye.

1187
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,540
The deadly moose.

1188
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,520
The Farmer's...

1189
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,260
No, the Farmer's Branch moose-eye.

1190
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,120
See, a branch is what they say down south for a creek or a river.

1191
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,200
Dead branch.

1192
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,740
Or in Vermont.

1193
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,840
Dead branch.

1194
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:53,840


1195
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:53,840


1196
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:53,980
Or in the creek.

1197
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,280
You ever been down to Dead Branch Pass?

1198
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,900
I never drank dead branch water.

1199
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,660
Hey, boy, see any moose?

1200
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,380
No bottle of Dead Branch Pass.

1201
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,680
Pass out, we call it.

1202
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,120
Yeah!

1203
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,920
Pass out on Dead Branch Pass.

1204
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,780
Well, it's time for the karaoke part of the show now.

1205
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,300
I think the Reverend is going to do...

1206
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,660
Oh, look, they have 12 steps.

1207
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,280
It's a 12-step program for Emotions Anonymous.

1208
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,540
First step number...

1209
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,220
Step number one.

1210
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,540
Do they seriously want...

1211
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,040
Yes.

1212
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,800
People who are too emotional or...

1213
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,280
We admitted we were powerless over our emotions,

1214
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,240
that our lives had become unmanageable.

1215
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,300
That's number one.

1216
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:35,640
Oh!

1217
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:36,700
Oh!

1218
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,300
Oh!

1219
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,200
Oh!

1220
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,540
Oh!

1221
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,860
I need somebody to get Edward Munch out of here.

1222
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,340
Here's number two.

1223
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:43,920
There he goes.

1224
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,260
Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.

1225
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,360
Wow.

1226
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,200
Sanitation?

1227
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,520
Restore us to sanity?

1228
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:53,520


1229
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,420
For God is clean.

1230
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,100
He beareth not stinky boogers and juices that emit from him like...

1231
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,380
This must be the work of the devil.

1232
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,100
...we, his foul creation.

1233
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,720
That is the work of the devil.

1234
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,180
Here's a good one.

1235
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:03,760
Number five.

1236
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,400
Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being,

1237
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,940
the exact nature of our wrongs.

1238
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,600
I'm dyslectic.

1239
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,320
They felt too much, yes?

1240
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,660
I'm dyslectic.

1241
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,480
I believe in dog.

1242
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,760
We have procreated slaw and divided amongst ourselves.

1243
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,700
Oh, I have to go turn my tape over.

1244
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,060
I have to go see the lucky worm.

1245
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,080
Consult with Matt about a dog, you know?

1246
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:27,620
Oh!

1247
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,320
Point Percy at the porcelain log.

1248
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,660
Can you?

1249
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,240
What a, what a you.

1250
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,900
So now save your really good stuff for now, because he'll have it on tape and then he'll use it on your show.

1251
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,680
And then you can listen to it every week and go,

1252
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,240
We were on The Stang Show again!

1253
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,760
There is no good stuff!

1254
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,340
Hey!

1255
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,620
These are the subgenius devivals that are happening in our area in the next couple days.

1256
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,000
Right here in Cleveland tomorrow, Friday, November the 12th.

1257
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:07,200
Learn more about your shows here at

1258
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,780
yardural естьKidsforum.ia

1259
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,680
Bake a minimum cost to buy head in another year, veloy

1260
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,500
put in a while.

1261
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:21,640
…!

1262
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,680
quien le llamas cojote

1263
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,360
ора

1264
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,500
saying, but he knew what you were saying.

1265
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,120
Was he into drugs?

1266
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,300
Yes.

1267
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,000
But no drug you ever heard of.

1268
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,360
What do you mean?

1269
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,480
Special kind?

1270
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,900
It's a long story.

1271
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,320
The victory of ridiculous men.

1272
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,300
And you can't imagine

1273
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,200
the relief.

1274
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,400
Tell them

1275
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,100
no more games.

1276
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,240
You want to play that game?

1277
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,800
It's not a game.

1278
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,060
My dear,

1279
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,300
that's all it is.

1280
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,120
Interesting to politicians

1281
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,940
and

1282
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,280
to the people.

1283
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:22,980
And fanatics.

1284
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,060
And they must find it.

1285
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,100
Maybe kill for it.

1286
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,880
Don't ask why.

1287
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,380
Above all,

1288
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,680
don't ask why.

1289
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:33,680


1290
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,580
I wouldn't want to lie now.

1291
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,540
That is Bob's first million.

1292
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,200
Bob's air of individuality.

1293
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,000
When a man like you

1294
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,060
paid a dollar

1295
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,360
for one of these bumpers.

1296
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,320
For ten dollars

1297
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,840
for this amazing poster.

1298
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,220
You know,

1299
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,800
that was more.

1300
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,560
It's true.

1301
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,580
Bob's

1302
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,540
offers

1303
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,880
a bill for a ten dollar bill.

1304
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,340
And it's ridiculous to think

1305
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,300
that we're going to give it away

1306
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,220
just because a bunch of lazy mutants

1307
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,300
think they own the planet.

1308
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,440
Dag,

1309
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:03,780
Bob?

1310
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,840
Hey, Paul, what do you want for Christmas?

1311
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,300
Benny, what were you doing launching that bleeding ad on a Thursday?

1312
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,080
Why was you wearing them big green straps?

1313
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,160
You know you should not do that, Benny.

1314
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,860
Take it easy, Doug.

1315
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,500
Okay.

1316
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,200
Doug?

1317
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,420
Doug, I'm going to call a doctor.

1318
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,440
No, I'm sorry, Bob.

1319
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,320
We didn't mean it.

1320
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,940
We didn't mean it to...

1321
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,840
We won't call you anymore, Bob.

1322
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,640
Please don't drop that bomb on us.

1323
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,260
No, Bob, don't do it, please.

1324
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,700
When's that bomb going to get here, Bob?

1325
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,120
I already filled up my will.

1326
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:49,660
Oh, no!

1327
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,220
Oh, it was just a little one, Bob.

1328
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,560
Meekie, Bob, Frock Bob.

1329
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,900
Where in the world can Meekie be?

1330
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1331
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,580
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1332
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,940
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1333
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,740
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1334
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,740
Got your pencil ready?

1335
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:24,580
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1336
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:30,400
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1337
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,160
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1338
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:38,740
Oh, man.

1339
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,060
Oh, man.

1340
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,500
Oh, man.

1341
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,760
Hey, don't really want to stop the show.

1342
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,460
But I think it might be nice to know.

1343
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,160
See, well, listen to this, man.

1344
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,680
Look, look, look.

1345
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,960
It's Christmas time, right?

1346
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,940
And everybody's feeling all good, right?

1347
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,140
And, uh, like, man,

1348
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,020
I don't want to go off the stage without doing one of those,

1349
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,320
one little number, all right, where everybody can join in.

1350
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,700
Something like this.

1351
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:05,880


1352
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,780
This is this one bit I got off this old 16-millimeter film.

1353
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,200
It's like it's in England.

1354
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,000
Before East England,

1355
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:30,820
it's in some club.

1356
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,540
And it sounds just like bagpipes.

1357
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,880
He's doing bagpipes, man.

1358
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,560
Just look at this.

1359
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,500
He's God, man.

1360
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,240
Hendricks is still alive, man.

1361
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,480
Hendricks is still alive.

1362
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,840
He lives in Africa now.

1363
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,160
He lives in Gambia.

1364
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,440
And, uh, it's like he knew they were after Nixon wanted him killed.

1365
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,380
But he had a look-alike.

1366
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,200
There was a look-alike.

1367
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,820
This guy named Randy Hanson.

1368
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,420
Hendricks, now, he got his skin turned white.

1369
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,120
And he's still alive.

1370
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1371
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1372
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1373
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1374
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1375
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1376
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,120


1377
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:06,140
And now he poses as Randy Hanson, the Hendricks impersonator.

1378
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,760
But that's really Hendricks.

1379
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,120
Brilliant.

1380
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,820
I'm a bit proud of that.

1381
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,440
Even Mitch Mitchell's been fooled.

1382
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,800
But I found out.

1383
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,460
I figured it out.

1384
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,880
There was codes in the long version of Voodoo Child,

1385
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,860
the San Diego concert.

1386
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,580
Not the third San Diego concert.

1387
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,440
The fourth one.

1388
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,960
It's not on the album.

1389
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:28,400
Oh, no.

1390
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,400
There's a clue, cause he stops right in the middle of the song.

1391
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:33,900
He talks.

1392
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,640
You think he's talking about the cops.

1393
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:40,220
But if you know these facts, it's like he's telling you what he's gonna do.

1394
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,940
I got the-

1395
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,200
I know this chick that said she-

1396
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,060
I don't think she did.

1397
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,860
But he did tell her that he was gonna do this.

1398
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,220
He did not.

1399
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:52,660
I don't know.

1400
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,520
I don't remember.

1401
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,420
I don't know.

1402
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:56,840
I don't remember.

1403
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:56,880
I don't remember.

1404
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:58,540
I don't remember.

1405
01:02:59,500 --> 01:02:59,900
I don't remember.

1406
01:02:59,900 --> 01:02:59,900


1407
01:02:59,900 --> 01:02:59,900


1408
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,260
tape of Hendrix and Morrison?

1409
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,680
That was recorded in 1980, man.

1410
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,220
There were no copies of that

1411
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,920
before 1980. It's in a club in

1412
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,400
France.
