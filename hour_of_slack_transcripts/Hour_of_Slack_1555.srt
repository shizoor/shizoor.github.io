1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,140
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of OVSLUG.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
I feel real good. And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,900
Well, that doesn't take much doing.

4
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,800
Hello, Bob. I need someone to talk to.

5
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,140
Hello, Bob. It seems there's nothing I can do.

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,060
Hello, Bob.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,280
I need someone to listen to me.

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm hitting all the locked doors and I need some help.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,340
And I was hoping you'd have the key.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,400
Hello, Bob.

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,360
Have you been listening to my thoughts?

12
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,500
Hello, Bob.

13
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,920
And I'll tell you all the thoughts.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,680
I've got.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,400
Hello, Bob.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,160
Hello, Bob.

17
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,840
I can't seem to find the truth.

18
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,740
I read the books.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,460
I took the drugs.

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,240
And I drank a whole bottle of Verluce.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,860
Yeah.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,860
Hello, Bob.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,080
I seem to have misplaced my slack.

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,800
Hello, Bob.

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,840
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,920
Hello, Bob.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,380
Can you point out what it is I lack?

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,420
I've climbed to highest heights, hit the lowest lows.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
But now I'm on my back.

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
Hello, Bob.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Are you still hearing me?

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,260
Hello, Bob.

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,580
Give me a sign that I can see.

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,120
Hello, Bob.

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,480
It's not that I've lost all my hope.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,400
But I'm really tired and I'm really broke.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,780
And I smoked up the last of my dope.

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,360
Hello, Bob.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Am I coming through to you?

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,180
Hello, Bob.

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,760
I thought I already paid all my dues.

42
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,380
Hello, Bob.

43
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,380
I've lost my slacks.

44
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,380


45
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,380


46
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,380


47
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,380


48
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,380


49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,380


50
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,360
I know that you can see me through

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,980
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim

52
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,360
What am I supposed to do?

53
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,140
Well, hello, Bob

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm feeling better

55
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,460
Now you've listened to me

56
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,520
Hello, Bob

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,620
Well, the sun's out now

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,440
Now I can see

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Hello, Bob

60
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,520
A great change has come over me

61
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,200
My eyes are wise

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
My thoughts are clear

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,560
And I'm as happy as I could be

64
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,680
Yes, my eyes are wise

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
My thoughts are clear

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
And I'm as happy as I could be

67
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,620
Hello, Bob

68
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,280
Ah, yes, dear friends

69
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,420
This hour of the week

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,800
This hour of Slack number 1555

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Is another of the oldest

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,760
Old-fashioned Hour of Slack reruns

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,260
Because it's from our first two albums

74
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,800
From 1981

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,240
Before the Hour of Slack even existed

76
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,300
This one mixes the last part of Media Barrage number one

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,040
With the first collection of Bob hymns

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,180
Bob Songs 1

79
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,320
The early doctors on it are

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,160
Philodrummond

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,400
Yourself

82
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,720
Truly Reverend Ivan Stang

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,980
The late Dr. X

84
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,160
Glass Madness

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,640
Doctors for Wotan

86
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,160
Doctors for Bob

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
Kevin Wilson

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,320
The Mysterious Doug Three of Houston

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,960
And Buck Naked and the Jaybirds

90
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,660
It includes preaching cuts

91
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,180
From early 1980

92
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,660
Devivals held in backyards

93
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,520
Wotan and Doctor Music sessions

94
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,700
And some truly

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,420
Heartfelt Bob hymns

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,600
We'll soon go to What The Big Boss Is

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:27,600


98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:27,600


99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:27,600


100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
Dear Bob

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
Um

102
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,480
Sometimes, Bob

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,040
Um

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,700
Bob

105
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,220
I get so scared

106
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,100
and I don't know why

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,640
I just don't know why

108
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,080
but sometimes there are things

109
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,760
and they're after me

110
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,860
it's those kinds of things

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,300
that

112
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,700
you know

113
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,640
how come hot dogs

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,500
the kind of hot dogs

115
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,460
you get at the circus

116
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,100
the kind of hot dogs

117
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,460
why are they so red

118
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,720
and it's only at the circus

119
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,520
that you can get hot dogs

120
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,340
of real red

121
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,280
there's a red kind of

122
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,900
it's more

123
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,940
more red

124
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,580
and

125
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,620
and

126
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,840
and

127
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
and sometimes things

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,940
live in walls

129
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,780
you know

130
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,160
and it gets scary

131
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,100

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,540
devil wants

248

to steal it from you friends

249
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,760
What a shame how they stole it.

250
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,320
Oh, it's a miracle, Fran.

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,820
It's a miracle revival starting up.

252
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,060
Perform the salute.

254
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,640
Freedom America.

255
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,760
Perform the salute.

257
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,940
But here's how to do the salute.

259
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,460
Yeah.

260
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,120
Ah, shake, right, ready?

261
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
The finger is on the neck.

262
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,740
Hands, left hand up.

263
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,180
Up and down.

264
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,840
Left hand up.

265
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,340
Left hand up.

266
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,320
Oh.

267
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,580
Finger on throat.

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,900
Finger on throat.

269
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,420
Ready?

270
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,640
Come on.

271
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,680
All right, perform the salute.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,160
Excellent.

274
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,240
It's a miracle.

275
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,140
I think before we start the service,

276
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,720
we should have just a moment of noise.

277
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,840
Oh, yeah, I can feel it.

278
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,560
The spirits.

279
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
Bullets can't stop it.

281
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,100
Oh, bullets can't stop them, friends, no.

282
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,420
The mark of the beast.

283
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,320
Oh, you don't need to worry about it.

284
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,800
You've got your credit card.

285
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,940
It won't do you any good tomorrow, but it's okay.

286
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,260
Well, oh.

287
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,040
I love you, John.

288
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,620
I guess now Bob's gonna have to work through me, friends.

289
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,660
Your command.

290
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,620
Fleecing snow mixed with freezing rain and rain.

291
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,560
The cold weather is much better.

292
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,680
And it looks like I can see you through the afternoon.

293
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,720
The temperatures are going to be

294
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,260
a little bit lower for the presentation.

295
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,160
We'll continue in all the desired conditions.

296
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,720
Snow accumulation at mid-morning range,

297
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,160
from near one half inch,

298
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,020
will deliver two inches of west.

299
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,360
The best we can do is to go one to two inches on.

300
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,780
We're going to come from the front.

301
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,940
We're going to come from the back.

302
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,720
Snow accumulation.

303
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,960
We're going to come from the front.

304
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,040
We don't need to worry about it.

305
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:48,440
We really have to keep sure that we're having a good Summer.

306
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,580
Snow accumulation grouped across the entire coast,

307
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,460
no aoenty snow婆ings.

308
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,120
What value do you plan to get over this?

309
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,300
Well, we should talk about snow accumulation.

310
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,300


311
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,300


312
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,380
Yeah, that's going into the relationship.

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,740
It's going to be a pretty nice picture.

314
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,560
I'm not sure that we really need to talk about it.

315
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,500
Wow.

316
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm...

317
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,740
I'm...

318
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm...

319
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,240
I'm...

320
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm...

321
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm...

322
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,140
Sometimes I've got these

323
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,280
these rats and they're like

324
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,080
they're like inside my stomach and I haven't swallowed them

325
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,700
I mean they're like hot hot hot dogs but they're eating their way out

326
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,300
and they're

327
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,320
coming out and I just

328
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,820
sometimes I just want to take these hot dogs and just

329
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,360
shove them away. I'm taking these hot dogs

330
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,980
and just...

331
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,300
I'm taking these hot dogs and just...

332
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,560
Please Bob send me some more

333
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,580
more pills Bob please

334
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,520
Bob send me some more

335
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,560
some more of those pills

336
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
Bob...Bob...Bob...

337
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,840
Bob...Bob...

338
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
Bob...Bob...Bob...

339
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,140
Bob...Bob...Bob...

340
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,420
Oh...

341
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,180
Oh... Lonesome Bob

342
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,200
says

343
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,500
you gotta get some

344
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,300
pills

345
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,560
Oh...

346
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,980
Lonesome Bob

347
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,000
just telling

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,680
me

349
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,400
Oh yeah

350
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,620
Just give him some more pills

351
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,800
and Bob

352
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,980
will kill

353
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm sorry mom, if I upset you, but sometimes I just don't feel too good, you know?

354
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:47,100
I mean, I really don't feel real good, and I don't know why, but Reverend Booney says,

355
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:57,020
um, my head, my head is, um,

356
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:08,640
obsessed with, um, the anti-bomb.

357
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:20,280
Um, and I don't really, um, know what he means,

358
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,900
and so that's why I'm talking to you directly,

359
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:25,800
because,

360
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,380
he isn't, um, much help.

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,780
But Bob says,

362
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,660
if you don't give me some money,

363
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,700
you just won't ever get any slack.

364
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,100
And then,

365
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,100
you don't get no slack, you can't get no money and no food and no pills.

366
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,700
Sounds bad.

367
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,740
So what we have there really is, uh,

368
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,680
two rituals going at once.

369
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,120
Um,

370
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,960
on the, uh,

371
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,920
the radio.

372
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,440
It's, it's a miracle.

373
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,500
What can we say?

374
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,420
We're used to them by now, but it's definitely miracles, and we've got proof.

375
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,120
Yeah.

376
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,900
It's amazing.

377
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,480
It's a miracle.

378
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,960
It's signs, signs in the heavens, signs in the earth.

379
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,080
Uh, we're seeing the signs everywhere.

380
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,440
And, uh,

381
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,840
they, uh, they still seem to be, uh, washing the implements on the other side in this blood of the lamb.

382
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,760
This is the blood of the lamb.

383
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:55,740
It wants us to

384
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:14,760
If we have to buy things and die, and we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, or know the reason why.

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,600
We have to buy.

386
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:54,000
We'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, if we don't come back older men, there ain't no reason why.

387
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:13,720
All wildest gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades, and we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men, in victory parade.

388
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,420
Okay, okay, Dr. Drummond has on his anti-alien possession shades so we won't go off the road

389
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,520
like we did last time.

390
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm going to put them up here.

391
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,360
The dogs, the mongreloids back there are safely...

392
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,060
Oh, God.

393
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,420
He's got a screwdriver.

394
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,620
It's a key.

395
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,120
A key.

396
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,940
It looks like a screwdriver.

397
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,360
Right, it's disguised as the sacred screwdriver, and it's the key, and it makes the Bobmobile

398
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,440
begin to move.

399
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,580
You can hear it.

400
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,080
You can hear that good sound effect of motor rumbling, because this thing doesn't have

401
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,440
any real motor sound, and we have to use it or else superstitious peoples will run in

402
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,680
fright.

403
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,940
Little Rock is embraced with techno boredom just as usual, and I just want to tell you

404
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,320
it's no tour to live here.

405
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,440
I just want to extend greetings from the Archbishop of Slack Abuse of the mega fist temple lodge

406
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,340
of the church.

407
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,540
The Archbishop of Slack Abuse of the mega fist temple lodge of the church.

408
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,940
I want to thank the church for the subgenius of Little Rock.

409
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:23,200
It's nice to find out that there's some more like us around, and since we found Bob by

410
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,180
golly, we've just been having a great time and getting some money and finding out who

411
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,860
sounds like us and what the scam is and all.

412
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,700
The time now is 2.15, and the following program is sponsored by the New Testament Holiness

413
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,060
Church.

414
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,340
You do what you do because you won't...

415
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,340


416
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,140
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

417
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,380
That's what I think everyone needs to remember.

418
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,200
You do what you do because you won't to.

419
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,000
I do what I do because Bob told me...

420
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,680
I did, Bob.

421
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,560
Whatever you say, I swear to God, I did.

422
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,820
And I don't care if people laugh at me.

423
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
I did, Bob.

424
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,580
I did, Bob.

425
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:12,580


426
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,020
He...

427
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,960
He ain't no man.

428
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,280
He ain't no God.

429
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,220
I don't want to walk the path that Bob's trod.

430
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,220
Ain't no man, ain't no God.

431
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,280
I don't want to walk the path Bob's trod.

432
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
Okay, let's do it right this time.

433
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,920
And people ask me, where do you get this energy, this life I see glowing in you, Jander?

434
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,140
And I just point it up.

435
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,460
And I don't even have to say...

436
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,320
I don't even have to say...

437
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,420
I won't even...

438
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,100
I won't even say the word Bob when I said it.

439
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,840
But I just point it at the sky because it's not me that's doing it.

440
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,060
And you know and I know who it is.

441
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,880
It's Bob.

442
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,920
Now we take you into a great Holy Ghost revival that is now in progress.

443
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,120
Bill, you want to say something to the...

444
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,140
To the clinch?

445
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,080
I think it's all too deep.

446
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,620
To the Dallas clinch?

447
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,820
The conspiracy of the peaks.

448
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,320
And I don't know...

449
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,420
It's too pink and they refuse to comment.

450
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,700
If they're so hip, what are they doing in Dallas?

451
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,440
Yeah, really.

452
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,820
We can put on the Bob tune tape and sing along.

453
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,420
Doctors for Bob.

454
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,820
Doctors for Bob.

455
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,780
Doctors for Bob.

456
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,360
Doctors for Bob.

457
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,940
Copters for Bob.

458
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,820
Copters for Bob.

459
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,860
Proctors for God.

460
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,300
Proctors for God.

461
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,840
Doctors for God.

462
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,360
God.

463
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,460
Doctors for...

464
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,320
and Sch...

465
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,600
Schnaud.

466
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
Shouldlokters for Schnaud.

467
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,980
Doctors for Bob...

468
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:51,940
Doctors...

469
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,080
Robobob....

470
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Sphincters for Bleed.

471
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,920
Sphincters for Bob.

472
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,580
Sphincters for Bob.

473
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,440
Drugs are real enough.

474
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
J aldan Im estructural

475
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,260
Pills for Bob.

476
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
Drugs are real.

477
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,380
Vibra IV for Alilda.

478
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,000
Get to DNA.

479
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,460
Give me some of them pills, Bob.

480
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Wakanda Reid Hawks.

481
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:23,540
I got the blues cause Bob let that pickup run over my wife.

482
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,540
Hey, you get three points for hitting that hippie, girl.

483
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,760
Bob stayed father, eager to fit in in America.

484
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,180
He disliked the old man filling the boy's head with garbage and stinking Mayan occultism.

485
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,180
Bob grew up having to fight the stigma of a Mayan dad.

486
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,220
Other kids made fun of that prognathous slurped head of full-blood Mayan-ry.

487
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,940
And little Bob was in many a scrap, battling for his father's honor.

488
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,740
It was a troubled childhood and it had a telling effect on the society.

489
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:07,740


490
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,800
Bob was a representative youth who became, thanks to the pharmacy's wares, a chronic alcoholic at age six.

491
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,160
It didn't affect his precocious salesmanship, however.

492
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:30,020
And he made his first small fortune selling stolen prophylactics and other things to high school boys.

493
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,440
Wash it out, Bob.

494
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,640
Freak it out, Bob.

495
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,860
Zap it out, Bob.

496
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,040
Hook it out, Bob.

497
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,200
Shlarp it out, Bob.

498
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,240
Slurp it out, Bob.

499
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,340
Munch it out, Bob.

500
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,440
Punch it out, Bob.

501
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,740
And drink it out, Bob.

502
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,780
Scrunch it out, Bob.

503
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,080
Hunch it out, Bob.

504
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,140
Tear it out, Bob.

505
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,320
Mutate it out, Bob.

506
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,540
Slack it out, Bob.

507
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,620
Barf it out, Bob.

508
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,740
Kill me, Bob.

509
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,920
Thank you. Thank you, Sterna.

510
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,180
Coming up next, we have the original Doctors for Wotan album,

511
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,200
which is called Doctors for Negi.

512
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,400
And the song, I'm driving a car that Bob sold me.

513
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,860
You're so damn merry.

514
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,340
Back?

515
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,720
What do you mean, ha, ha, ha?

516
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,280
Take that pipe out of your mouth.

517
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,620
What are you grinning about, buddy?

518
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,940
Where'd you get that haircut?

519
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,320
Are those dots on your face, or have you got some kind of disease?

520
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,460
You look like Ward.

521
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,320
You look like Ward Cleaver on Leave it to Beaver.

522
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,840
You look like Mark Trail.

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,760
What's the deal, buddy?

524
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,540
What's the deal, buddy?

525
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,520
You look like Mr.

526
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Appleton.

527
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,460
You look like Big Van Dyke with a pipe in his mouth.

528
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,500
What?

529
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,380
What'd you say?

530
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,760
Did you say, yeah, sure.

531
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,560
Sure, I'll buy that used car.

532
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,840
I'll buy that used car from you, mister.

533
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,280
Sure, anything.

534
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,420
How much is it?

535
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,460
It's only a dollar?

536
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,340
That used car is only a dollar?

537
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,000
Sure.

538
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Wow.

539
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,000
Wow.

540
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,640
Wow, you got any other good deals, mister?

541
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,100
You got something else that'll only cost a dollar?

542
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
A little booklet?

543
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,900
I don't know.

544
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,040
That doesn't look like it's worth a dollar to me.

545
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,700
Oh, it does have a lot of print inside.

546
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,460
And some neat pictures.

547
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,740
Sure, I'll give you a dollar, mister.

548
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,280
Here.

549
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,940
Whoa, whoa.

550
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
I feel weird.

551
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,200
I feel, I feel really weird.

552
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,980
But, I feel kinda, I feel, I feel kind of good.

553
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,080
I like this, this little book.

554
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,800
Hey where'd you go, buddy?

555
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,700
Hey.

556
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,860
I wheels.

557
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,540
But.

558
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:07,560
But.

559
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,560


560
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,720


561
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,720


562
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,720


563
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,720


564
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,980
Where'd he go?

565
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,640
Where'd the guy with the pipe go?

566
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,380
Hey, I gotta talk to him.

567
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,020
Hey, what happened?

568
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,660
Hey buddy, where'd...

569
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,560
He took off with my two dollars,

570
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,960
and he left me this little book and this car.

571
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
I'll get in this car.

572
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,200
I'll start it up.

573
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,800
He left the keys in for me.

574
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,560
Okay.

575
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,140
Okay, here goes.

576
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm driving the car that Bob sold me.

577
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,780
Boy, I can go pretty fast.

578
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,760
Hey, hey, that Bob guy's okay.

579
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,220
He made me forget about,

580
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,820
he made me forget about Odin for a minute.

581
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,300
That's really weird.

582
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
Boy, this car is smooth.

583
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,040
I like the way this feels on the road.

584
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,120
I like the way it feels.

585
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,660
Feels good.

586
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,840
It's throbbing.

587
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,900
It's throbbing.

588
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,660
Hey, it's leaving the road.

589
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,320
It's going up in the air.

590
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,680
Where's it going?

591
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,120
Hey.

592
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,940
Hey, it's, there's a cloud up in front of me.

593
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,080
A big cloud.

594
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,540
It's got a sign on it.

595
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,420
A big sign.

596
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,200
It says, it says,

597
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,520
it says, welcome, welcome to Odin's place.

598
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,360
It says, this is Nirvana.

599
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,660
Wow, Bob, thanks.

600
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,560
I can't wait to meet Odin.

601
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:39,400
Hi, Bill.

602
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:47,180
Oh, the world looks better since Bob is my blindfold.

603
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,020
World looks good to me.

604
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,240
Oh, the world looks better since Bob's my blindfold.

605
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,020
The world looks okay to me.

606
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,660
Oh, the world looks to you like some kind of big mess

607
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,480
Put a barbed line, fold on

608
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,940
The world looks to me like a nice place to be

609
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,520
Cause I got my barbed line, fold on

610
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,680
This is gonna be a real Bob revival tonight.

611
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,820
And right now, we are Buck Naked and the Jaybirds.

612
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,020
And we're going to sing Bob is Leaving Me.

613
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,060
Bob

614
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,380
Bob

615
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,360

Bob

619
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:57,920
Bob

620
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


621
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,160
Bob

622
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,540
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

623
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,620
Where are you going, Bob?

624
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,540
Is he waiting there for me?

625
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,080
He's not waiting for you.

626
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,420
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

627
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,180
What is waiting for me?

628
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,160
Bob's waiting there for me

629
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,660
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me

630
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:50,120
Bob can save me, but will he?

631
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,840
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby

632
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,860
Dousy, Dousy, Dousy, Dousy, Dousy, Dousy

633
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,780
What is waiting there for me?

634
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,800
What is waiting there for me?

635
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,120
Bob

636
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,540

Bob

655
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,040
Bob

656
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,120
Bob

657
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,200
Bob

658
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,280
Bob

659

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:42,720


663
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:42,720


664
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,700
Bob

665
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:44,700


666
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:44,700


667
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:44,700


668
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,960
Are you sure you're not Doctors for Bob?

669
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,960
Where is Doctors for Bob?

670
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,700
In the Doctors for Bob album.

671
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,320
What is subgenius? It's Doctors for Bob!

672
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,380
Is the Doctors for Bob one of those things?

673
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,780
You think you can know the subgenius without knowing Doctors for Bob?

674
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
Well, you're wrong!

675
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,120
What is Doctors for Bob?

676
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,120
Doctors of Bob!

677
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,880
Where is the Bob, y'all?

678
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,460
Doctors for Bob!

679
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,680
Yes, about half the people I know will enter the before life in the 80s.

680
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,360
Millions will die in a small nuclear skirmish with China in 1988.

681
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:53,440
Russia will invade Iran, Turkey, Africa, and of course Israel, and there will be plenty involved.

682
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,600
Draft wars in the US.

683
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,460
Look for a tenth member to join the common market, called by war.

684
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,000
Bad nuke accident in New York City.

685
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,660
Rockefellers will finally be able to do it.

686
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,080
The world will be complicated.

687
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,900
Wild spread famine in 86 and 87, when the 13 and 17 year locusts emerge.

688
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,740
Acid rain, tough times, the big screens.

689
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,060
Germ war in South America.

690
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,860
The great reformer, actually the Antichrist, enters Jerusalem through the East Gate,

691
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,200
and is made super-human, after miraculously recovering from a head wound.

692
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,920
He starts the one world government, which can only be stopped by a one world religion.

693
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,300
Russia develops an all-terrain-like trajectory on the yard by locusts.

694
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,600
Big mass collapse.

695
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,720
This is Kevin Wilson of the Abominations from Austin.

696
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,300
I battered myself after Rowing 66.

697
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,340
I don't wanna be nobody's Carolina.

698
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,620
They take me on a ship.

699
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,700
Put me on a motor.

700
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,700
Let me out in the water.

701
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,600
Let me go.

702
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,260
Cause I'm a subgenius.

703
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,280
Cause I'm a subgenius.

704
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,420
Let me go naked in the park.

705
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,640
Let me feel like my head's coming apart.

706
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,380
I don't know.

707
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,040
But I have been told.

708
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,440
Every 30 things that people gotta get old.

709
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,840
But I don't believe it.

710
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,860
Cause I'm a subgenius.

711
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,940
Well, I don't believe it.

712
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,840
Cause I'm a subgenius.

713
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,380
I take everybody for what they're worth.

714
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,240
I don't make no exception.

715
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,700
I don't like it when people try to talk back to me.

716
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,080
Cause I'm a subgenius.

717
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm a subgenius.

718
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,340
I don't want you to get away from me.

719
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,800
You better like me for what I am.

720
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,920
If that isn't what pleases you.

721
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,320
Better make it right for me.

722
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,620
Cause I'm a subgenius.

723
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,700
Cause I'm a subgenius.

724
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,620
And I'll never be a subgenius.

725
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,360
We're super subgenius.

726
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,420
And we're super subgenius.

727
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,320
And we're super subgenius.

728
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,660
And we don't make no exception for what people got to do.

729
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:15,660


730
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:15,660


731
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,420
Oh and the one I get married to is born Studies today and went,

732
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:17,860
Uh...

733
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,320
He's too born, he's just unenticed.

751
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:37,110
On our way to a Malaysian holiday in a place called Dobstown where they all stay.

752
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,130
They gotta get hip, get straight, and get cool.

753
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,770
They ain't gonna allow no fool to hang around with Bob.

754
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,630
Well, they never found Bob that day.

755
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,630
They said he just had gone away.

756
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:10,490
He was out to lunch or off to get shoes or gone buying groceries for people to blues.

757
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,870
I must not have been in need of slack because I never really managed to make it back.

758
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:24,130
But I sent my dollar to those people in town and I still keep getting them pamphlets sent around.

759
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,990
And I feel a little closer.

760
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:28,410
A little closer.

761
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:28,410


762
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,430
A little more in touch.

763
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,010
And I know it's helped me a whole lot of much.

764
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:42,150
But I sure do wish I'd been managing to hang out in the right place to actually catch a look at that shining face of Bob.

765
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,830
Bob!

766
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,070
Same.

767
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,130
Other reasons why you should buy.

768
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,690
I am the one.

769
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:05,850

771
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:14,230

We will not suffocate you or your wife with mayonnaise.

773
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,310
This has been a message from the Subgenius Church.

774
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,670
We hope that you will send us money.

775

suckadoo

863
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:30,650
I was walking over Houston

864
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,970
You can change the name if you want to really sing the song, you can change the name of the town

865
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:40,370
Just to see what I could see

866
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:48,070
And the angel, the angel

867
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,410
He was walking over me

868
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,950
He was walking over Houston

869
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,570
He was walking in the air

870
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,950
He was walking in the air

871
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:10,790
And I saw my friend was with him

872
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:15,150
Hallelujah, God was there

873
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:24,230
He was walking in subgenius

874
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,850
He keeps me high until the end

875
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,970
For as long as I am subgenius

876
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:40,610
I know Bob is my friend

877
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,430
Now I know

878
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,470
Where'er we travel

879
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,510
In travail, Travolta view

880
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:03,110
Though the Fonz should walk beside us

881
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:07,410
We know Bob is with us too

882
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:15,090
Keep on walking with subgenius

883
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:22,570
Right in the high before the end

884
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:29,690
If I always by subgenius

885
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:33,090
I know Bob will be there

886
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,390
To be my friend

887
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,910
Now this third verse ain't

888
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,350
Necessary but if

889
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,750
I know Bob said we should always be ready to sell out

890
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,510
If you wanted to play this on a tape or something

891
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,410
You can stick an ad on me like this

892
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:52,710
Here we go

893
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,350

There to subgenius

895
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,450
So that Bob

896
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,250
Can love you too

897
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,850
Be a Bob's

898
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,970
1403-06

899
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,670
Dallas, Texas

900
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:19,790
And 5214

901
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:27,270
Keep on walking on subgenius

902
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,950
My low nose

903
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,450
And I've been to

904
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:31,690
The top of the hill

905
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:31,690


906
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,010
If you're running

907
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,970
In subgenius

908
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,350
Bob is running

909
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,070
With you too

910
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,670
I didn't have to

911
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,710
To the two there in the last

912
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,090
But I just

913
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,190
Rhymed it that way

914
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,110
So as a casual

915
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,690
I would have a heart attack

916
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,870
If you ever hear this

917
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,250
I'm strong, I'm terrible

918
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:15,790
Think you can come to

919
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,110

It's stiff

921
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:23,570
Love is perfect

922
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:23,570


923
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:23,570


924
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:23,650
In a fresh

925
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:23,870
Coat

926
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:23,950

Go down the strings again.

941
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,690
There's a good bomb and there's a bad bomb.

942
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,130
There's a real bomb and there's a little bomb.

00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:01,410
Oh, people ain't followed wrong bombs.

944

954
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,450
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob, Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

955
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,550
He's got the answers to the universe, and that's why he's super cool.

956
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,870
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob, Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

957
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,110
He is the head of the subvenience, and that's why he's super cool.

958
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:04,550
He's the head of the subvenience, and that's why he's super cool.

959
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,190
He's the head of the subvenience, and that's why he's super cool.

960
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:06,230
He's the head of the subvenience, and that's why he's super cool.

Well, it's the old Cleveland Heights post office box.

965
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,850
Uh, the Texas...

966
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:37,590
