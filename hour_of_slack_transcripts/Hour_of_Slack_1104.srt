1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
To add to your enjoyment of the movies, we offer cold, refreshing, full-flavored

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,920
The Devil

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,240
Choice

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,160
Antichrist

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,100
Freshly popped

6
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,680
Lucifer

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,900
Crisp and tasty

8
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,160
And richly coated, taste-filled

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,460
Satan

10
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,020
That are sure to please you

11
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,520
Satan

12
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,560
Yes, there are many good things here for your pleasure. Enjoy them!

13
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,120
And he said, uh, it's healthy for them.

14
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,860
And he said, it's a wonderful thing if they continue to all through their lives to get that enthusiastic about anything.

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,600
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

16
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,100
The Self-Genius Power of Satan!

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:58,840
Bob!

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,180
What I want to tell them is how much we've enjoyed having them going to be on our show once again.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,180
Bob!

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,780
One dollar for salvation! One dollar!

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,080
Bob is...

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Salesman.

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah, Bob is a salesman. He's everything and he's nothing.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
He is a man. Bob is a man.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,320
And he is the saint of sales.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:28,100
Right. He was gifted with mystic sales ability when he was visited by Jehovah One or Wotan.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,220
The, um, uh...

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,880
Wotan the Magnificent, Doug?

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
The evil and or good space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,100
That's right.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,420
Or so he tells us.

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,740
And I quote,

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,040
We'll all be eating roach crap by the turn of the century.

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,920
We've never actually, uh, talked to him ourselves.

35
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:52,100
Yeah, I, I'd have to admit that I have never met the fabled J.R. Bob Dobbs, but I have, shall we say, been touched by Bob.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,940
Yes. Don't just eat a hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,480
Bob!

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,580
But let's leave things of this world to the future.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:06,000
Leave behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, yes, praise Bob, friend.

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,900
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,620
Come to tell you the truth.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,660
The truth about the path to slack.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Through hyperventilation.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,400
Yes, my friend.

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,460
You can get high from hyperventilation.

47
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,860
And it's legal.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,900
And it's an exercise we're preaching.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,560
And if you can learn to talk like me and talk this way all the time,

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,600
then everybody you meet will be your friend.

51
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,740
And you will get so high, you will get so high, you will meet Bob.

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,020
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob.

53
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,600
Because you will have so much slack in your brain, there won't be any more room for thought.

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:51,060
And when your mind is free of, free of thought, then you will have the slack, the slack you need in your life.

55
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,260
Praise Bob.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,060
Help me, somebody.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,700
Do I hear a praise Bob?

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,260
Let there be slack.

60
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,120
See www.subgenius.com

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,280
That moment has now arrived.

62
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:21,480
Once each night, during the cycle of the full moon, you will dissolve three Tana leaves and give the liquid to Karras.

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,640
Three leaves will keep him alive.

64
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,500
Nine leaves will give him motivation.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:40,440
Now swear by the sacred gods of Egypt that you will never rest until the last remaining member of the Banning family is destroyed.

66
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:48,640
Until they all have suffered the fate of those who dare to defile the tomb of our royal dead.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,500
Swear that you will never betray your trust.

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,160
I swear by the mighty power of Amun-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world.

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,920
And by the dread horror of Set, I shall never forsake my trust as a high priest of Karnak.

70
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,460
And where are those doughnuts today?

71
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,400
Yeah, now that's a really good question.

72
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,540
Remember, spud nuts?

73
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Spud right here.

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,060
What happened to spud nuts?

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,200
I'd rather not say it, but...

76
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,940
No, they were made from taters, you know.

77
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,040
In the Midwest, by...

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,760
Oh, oh, alright.

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
By crafty cooks in gleaming chromium kitchens.

80
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,020
These cargo are morgue shipments from Aspen.

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,900
They were shipped from Aspen?

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,300
Yeah.

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
That's very odd, I wouldn't have thought that.

84
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,400
Let's get out of here.

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,200
Okay, let's split. Let's blow this popsicle split up.

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,060
Oh, there we go.

87
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,380
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

88
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


89
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


90
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


91
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


92
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


93
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


94
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380


95
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,160
Mr. Dobbs, can David beep in my beep today?

96
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,720
Sure, just make sure he doesn't have any beep on his beep.

97
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Yeah, the show's kind of dense tonight, have you noticed that?

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:16,880
Oh yeah.

99
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,840
It's like fog set in or something.

100
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,700
Ah, we're creeping along.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,020
I don't know.

102
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
I'm just trying to show subscape.

103
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,900
And that aroma, like freshly baking loaves.

104
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,700
Yeah, it's like the workers left, all the bread was still in the oven, the cigarettes

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,260
were still in the ashtrays, it was just like they were here a minute ago and then all the

106
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,060
people are gone.

107
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,420
Like the Marie Celeste.

108
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,540
Gross show.

109
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,920
What happened?

110
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,460
What happened to them?

111
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,420
Where could they have gone?

112
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,420
Why is the bacon still frying?

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
Yeah, the bacon was still frying.

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,780
The refrigerator door was still halfway open.

115
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,700
Oh, I did that.

116
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,000
The car was still open.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000


125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,260
The carton of milk was just leaking out onto the floor.

126
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:54,900
Oops.

127
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't understand what happened.

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
Well, there's some things beyond people to understand.

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,560
You know, we were here one minute and then the next minute we were gone.

130
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,280
I'd like you to recall the events on the day in question.

131
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,500
A black hole, an abyss, a chasm.

132
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,380
When did you first notice that something was well out of your head?

133
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,980
Missing?

134
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,300
Missing?

135
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,760
Well, you see, if you look at chart one.

136
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,640
There's an orbital flight path that the trajectory of which is impossible to obtain by the

137
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,720
horsepower of the engines that were on the vehicle.

138
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,940
How could this happen?

139
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,980
What about the potentiality of a geosynchronous...

140
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:47,040
We populate this abyss with any other presentation material that you might find totally dogmatic

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,740
as well as thematic templates which can be used.

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:50,740


143
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,440
Over and over again.

144
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,280
The initial investment can be realized as well as the return on investment completely

145
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,460
obliterates any need for further discussion.

146
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
I agree.

147
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,540
Oh, yes, dear friends.

148
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:18,500
That was Philo, Hal and Doug on puzzling evidence of KPFA Berkeley.

149
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,580
As they said.

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,580
Everyone is gone.

151
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,920
Everyone's gone because they've been ruptured.

152
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,660
Yes.

153
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:36,680
X Day happened and that's why I had to prepare this show number 1104 before X Day.

154
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,400
And by the time you hear this, if you're not ordained and bobbed, it'll probably be too

155
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,720
late.

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,100
We're already on the saucers and you're not.

157
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,560
Tough luck.

158
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
Shouldn't have put it off.

159
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:57,000
Not much to do now, I guess, but get blind inebriated on whatever horrible drug you use

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,160
to hide from reality.

161
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,880
Might be booze, might be bugs, might be the boob tube.

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,740
And that's what this episode of Hour of Slack is about, friends.

163
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,340
Your disgusting drug habits.

164
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,340
And if you're not on drugs by the time you finish listening to this show, you'll feel

165
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,040
like you are.

166
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:26,540
Uh, yes, we've heard the Leimerd and we'll now redress the pref because we like to be

167
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,740
near naughty experiences.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm Melvin.

169
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,680
You know, when I first started interviewing people, I interviewed a woman and she explained

170
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,340
in detail what the near naughty experience was.

171
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,900
And she said, you know, there may be some consciousness after all.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,020
Well, a week after she told us she would just go home and die, we went to visit her and

173
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,020


174
00:08:46,020 --> 00:09:01,260
see if she maybe got another dose of that brain eff我不 úm

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,660
We went to see her and she took the baby to a doctor.

176
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:03,780
We've been having theseOOOO getting you fighter behaviors andیا

177
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,280
I don't see anything wrong with thr sq c dancing in the kitchen.

178
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,280


179
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,280


180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,280


181
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,280


182
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,720
We actually exposed herself tolek gentleman and took my meprozetin.

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:04,860
And I'm, I don't know, like a76a76a37ya installed in a bomb bind inf

184
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:12,160
My mother occasions before it started, we took off because we didn't get an pelo Archives

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,600
of your ass.

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,120
9 for hc888apedHc79 좋

187
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,800
introduce Bob. Now that I think about it, finally we've got this thing off. I thought it would never

188
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,820
get off, friends, but now that it is, let's let Philo and Dr. Howell answer a caller's question

189
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:37,340
about Bob and the famous artist Andy Warhol and their relationship at the factory in New York.

190
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,460
It's as if it was on its own platform, praising itself forever.

191
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,540
And it might have been that they objected to the fact he was anatomically corrected.

192
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,480
Not only anatomically corrected, but massively endowed.

193
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:05,880
That's what they say. Did Bob ever meet Andy Warhol at the factory in New York City?

194
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,460
Yeah.

195
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,160
Bob.

196
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,460
Yeah.

197
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,960
At the Dobbs factory?

198
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,220
What happened at the Dobbs factory in New York City at that time?

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
What happened?

200
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,240
Yeah, let's fill that in.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,580
What happened at that time? Well, maybe I should mention that they were both into playing

202
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,700
anti-music back then. For two reasons primarily. One, because it's the best kind of music there is,

203
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:33,000
first of all. And they were, too, they were both slightly ahead of their time.

204
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,080
Mostly ahead of their time.

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,100
Back then.

206
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,740
You know, Bob had a lot of hair in his ears. This was the only way he could get...

207
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,360
Did they enjoy a parasitical relationship or a dialectical relationship with one another?

208
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,780
I'll pass that question to Dr. Howe.

209
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,060
Or a dialectical relationship with one another?

210
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,820
Their relationship is shrouded in the mists of mystery.

211
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,380
But one thing I...

212
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,240
Is it true that Bob Dobbs slept with Miko?

213
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,240
Yeah.

214
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,960
It was in 19, what, like 57?

215
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,660
56. When Dobbs was famous that year for bringing this famous quote,

216
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,100
I came not to bring peace, but instead, just this obnoxious radio show.

217
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
And he was right, by God.

218
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,780
Self-indulgent, less than an hour, more than a show.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,700
And delay.

220
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,100
Total improv horror still going strong after 30 years.

221
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,780
With puzzling evidence...

222
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,860
Dr. Howe.

223
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,160
Everything gets so distorted in time.

224
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,420
As well as your new, most favorite, special, permanent guest star.

225
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,360
Dr. Philodromo.

226
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,700
No longer will you hear Michael Pepe on the show, though.

227
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,140
He's too sleepy now.

228
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,560
No more.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,920
No more.

230
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,780
No more.

231
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,300
No more.

232
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,820
No more.

233
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,960
He's too sleepy now.

234
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,200
What?

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,180
No more little Michael Pepe ever?

236
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,660
Because he's too sleepy now?

237
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,240
That Bob was sleeping with the...

238
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,340


239
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,380
He was beaten up by the Grateful Dead.

240
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,120
Well, yes, he was.

241
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,540
That was the unknown story of...

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, he beat the crap out of him.

243
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,840
But he's a real resilient guru.

244
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,380
He springs back from the most heinous crimes.

245
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,440
I think, ultimately, he sued the Grateful Dead

246
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,800
and was able to put them into financial misfortune in their old age

247
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,320
so that most of them are having...

248
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,440
I think, ultimately, he sued the Grateful Dead and was able to put them into financial misfortune in their old age

249
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,440


250
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,660
to go back on the road now

251
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,200
to get some money

252
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,060
just to be able to pay their lawyers.

253
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,200
Because Bob just wrecked them so bad.

254
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,580
He gets it.

255
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,640
You know, he gets back.

256
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,100
He may not win the first round,

257
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,760
but he always wins round two.

258
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,100
Bob was the one that coined that bumper sticker.

259
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,380
You know, I don't...

260
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,600
I don't...

261
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,700
What was the one?

262
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,680
I don't...

263
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,280
Something about what he doesn't do.

264
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,060
I don't...

265
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,300
I don't...

266
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


267
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


268
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


269
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


270
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


271
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


272
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


273
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,300


274
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,080
He doesn't practice what he preaches.

275
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,340
You know, he doesn't get mad.

276
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,200
He gets even.

277
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,640
He doesn't do late-night radio shows like this.

278
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,560
I guess I just have one last question.

279
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,580
Yes?

280
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,680
Is it true that Bob Dobbs is in every labor mural in San Francisco, around the city?

281
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,080
If you look carefully, you can find his face?

282
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,480
I don't know.

283
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:36,980
Is that...

284
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,100
Have you looked?

285
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,900
Well, I've heard this.

286
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,540
Hmm.

287
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,960
Interesting.

288
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,280
Good night, gentlemen.

289
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,340
Good night.

290
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,760
Good night.

291
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,020
How can you be listening to us now?

292
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,340
Good night.

293
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,980
Oh, I'm not.

294
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,340
Oh, I'm still...

295
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,640
Okay.

296
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,400
Get more out of life.

297
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,560
Come often.

298
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,140
Get more out of life.

299
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,300
Come often.

300
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Please.

301
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,700
Please replace the speaker on its rack when you're ready to leave.

302
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,800
Failure to do so will damage both the speaker and your car.

303
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,860
We'll be grateful.

304
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,140
And so will the patrons who follow you.

305
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,340
Follow you.

306
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,940
Follow you.

307
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
Get more out of life.

308
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,500
Come often.

309
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:27,940
Great.

310
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

311
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,220
Speaker.

312
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,440
And.

313
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,720
Ah.

314
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,660
Speak.

315
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

316
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,380
Damage.

317
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,960
Damage.

318
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,540
Speaker.

319
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,160
Ah.

320
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,360
Follow you.

321
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,800
Get more out of life.

322
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,940
Come often.

323
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,160
Come often.

324
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,520
Where's his DG equipment?

325
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,740
He's just standing there with a conductor's baton.

326
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,040
Did anyone else hear that?

327
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,440
I think it's back masking.

328
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,600
I don't think that growth is supposed to hum like that.

329
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,700
Is that a gun?

330
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,380


331
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
It's a gun.

332
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,860
Someone just stabbed me with a needle and now I feel kind of funny.

333
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,760
Shit.

334
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,440
This happened at Woodstock too.

335
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,540
Hello.

336
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,340
Just sort of shot right out of my throat.

337
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,660
Started rolling around on the kitchen floor.

338
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,540
A wiggling and a squiggling around.

339
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Became a three-legged transsexual dog.

340
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
Started growling low and lonely.

341
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,480
Been louder and louder until the little yellow was howling.

342
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,520
That's better than them big water bugs we got out there in Arizona.

343
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,880
Found out through the sink of a nightingale in the sky.

344
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,640
Sure glided.

345
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,260
That's a good.

346
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,360
Come home all wood just a little bit.

347
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,360


348
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,360


349
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,360


350
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,360


351
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
We're right up through the drooling.

352
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,000
Where did we go?

353
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,460
About all the hobbling drooling.

354
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,100
Well, I always have to say.

355
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,720
Over the last few weeks of no show.

356
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
Glad you came back.

357
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,440
Yeah, we hit.

358
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,940
I'm glad we came back too because for a while there we were gone.

359
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,540
Well, I missed you.

360
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,440
Oh, nothing about my dreams.

361
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,140
Oh, that's the most.

362
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah, we missed you too.

363
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,660
We're talking about dreams tonight on the show.

364
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,460
Eight, four, eight, we'll get back to five minutes ago.

365
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,360
Now we're a whole happy family again.

366
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah.

367
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,180
The hap-hap-happiest family.

368
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,580
Me and you and.

369
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,420
You and Toddling.

370
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,380
And all of Northern Central California.

371
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,340
Punchling and.

372
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,340


373
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,340


374
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,300
And Hal and Tracy Lord.

375
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,500
And the whole world on the internet dot com.

376
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
I know you have to take time off occasionally.

377
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,920
What?

378
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,320
To practice the slack by what you preach.

379
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Slack practice.

380
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,020
You probably went through that.

381
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah, we had to take off to do, you know, we had to do maintenance on the truck.

382
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,160
Maintenance.

383
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,880
Back the truck out.

384
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,240
The truck was getting pretty, pretty rag-tagged there.

385
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Lots of parts were.

386
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,980
Hanging off.

387
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,440
A lot of them were even missing.

388
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:47,240
But we had the freedom it takes being on vacation to take the bottom of the truck off and put

389
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,380
it where the top used to be.

390
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,560
We took the side of the truck off and put it in the front.

391
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,260
We have the front and the back now and the other sides on the bottom.

392
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,980
Oh, the front.

393
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,380
Wow.

394
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,660
In the bottom of the side.

395
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,240
But it's okay.

396
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,000
It looks better than it used to look.

397
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,820
It's stupider than it was.

398
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,320
You can go back and forth.

399
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,320


400
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,320


401
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,320


402
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,320


403
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,060
You can do a lot of things.

404
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,080
And we started making tapes again.

405
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,680
We found a box of old tape decks.

406
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,060
A big box of tape decks that we didn't know we still had that we'd be importing thinking

407
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,980
one day they'll be worth a lot of money.

408
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:31,960
And I just stood on the back porch and I said, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, and a giant

409
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,720
chap fell from the sky for $47.37.

410
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,680
My name is Bob the cab driver.

411
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,520
Bob.

412
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,760
You're Bob the cab driver?

413
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,380
Bob.

414
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,520
That's right.

415
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,580
I have a lot of no-shows, too.

416
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah, that's true.

417
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,460
Don't you hate those?

418
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,020
When they call you and then they don't arrive.

419
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,960
Did you remember that one time when you showed up and that guy was supposed to be there but

420
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,760
he was hiding behind the bush like you weren't going to see him?

421
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,680
Was that the son or the father of the bush?

422
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,820
Can you believe that?

423
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,700
Next time, I think you should take somebody with you so that they can see you.

424
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:05,700


425
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,100
So that when somebody does that, you can send the other guy out there to grab him, just

426
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,860
throttle him.

427
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,120
And then you can measure which strategy works best.

428
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,840
I have thoughts like that, but I try to control them.

429
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,140
Okay, that's good to control that because that doesn't sound like a good idea, does

430
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,260
it?

431
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,780
Not the best one I've heard.

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,240
No.

433
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,620
And you're used to turning on this radio station to find good ideas.

434
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,660
I understand that.

435
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,220
Particularly this show.

436
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,680
Well, I'm just so glad you're back.

437
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:39,940
Somebody feed the baby.

438
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,280
Things are back to normal.

439
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,400
Yeah, they're definitely back to normal now that...

440
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,460
Now I have a bottle.

441
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,240
Now I have a firm connection.

442
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,460
I don't know.

443
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
In the refrigerator.

444
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,700
That's it.

445
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:49,960
Wait a second, baby.

446
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,080
Goodbye and stay listening to the show.

447
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,240
Yeah, okay.

448
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,120
And remember...

449
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,380
Guys, we're doing the show.

450
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,160
Look at him drink.

451
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,240
I will.

452
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,940
It's true.

453
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,480
What is it?

454
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,980
Amazing.

455
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,680
It's the show.

456
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,500
Yeah.

457
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,800
Yeah.

458
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,600
Yeah.

459
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


460
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


461
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


462
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


463
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


464
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,100
I know.

465
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:15,580
And among other things, Bog, I'm doing pretty well with those pills you sent.

466
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:30,640
Pretty well, but I can always use more and it's because of Ohio and red trucks and they're

467
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,440
all gone, Bog.

468
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,080
I know.

469
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,600
I know.

470
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,220
Ok.

471
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,120
But that's okay.

472
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,780
I don't believe it at all, anymore.

473
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,860
There's just nothing you can do now.

474
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,240
You know how it is.

475
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,020
You said these débutants are eating.

476
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,020


477
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,780
Ah, I understand.

478
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,480
Un tähän ketoăn ke ще mi đưa lại.

479
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:51,680


480
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,460
Every day.

481
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,780
And every little little moment.

482
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,640
Every week.

483
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


484
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


485
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


486
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


487
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


488
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


489
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


490
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


491
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


492
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,640


493
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,180
Now I've met your mother, yours good mother.

494
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,180


495
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,280
Ah, dear herm� is okay.

496
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,820
Thank you.

497
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,020
Thank you.

498
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,340
Thank you.

499
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
Thank you.

500
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,380
A Bad Bananas by Kevin Meredith, friends.

501
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,140
And before that,

502
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,580
Reverend David Boone as Roberto de la Rosa talking about the pills.

503
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,900
And after this, this.

504
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,860
Truth is fiction.

505
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,140
This is Be Orbit, Be Not.

506
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,580
Some of the world's greatest marksmen live in Hungary.

507
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,480
Be Orbit, Be Not.

508
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,280
In a moment, I'll tell you about a small fish.

509
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,760
A fish less than a foot long.

510
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,600
Be Orbit, Be Not.

511
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,340
How long would it take you to make change for five dollars?

512
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,300
It would take you 147 years.

513
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,260
Be Orbit, Be Not.

514
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,200
In a moment, I'll tell you about some clams.

515
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,740
Sarah had eaten clams for a long time.

516
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,500
But did you know that these huge Malaysian clams weigh nearly five pounds?

517
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,440
Be Orbit, Be Not.

518
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,760
Nero did not live underwater.

519
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,940
Be Orbit, Be Not.

520
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,480
In a moment, I'll tell you just how long true love can go on.

521
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,500
103 years.

522
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,860
Be Orbit, Be Not.

523
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,400
Each individual universe is comprised of the potential for a limitless quantity of sub-universes.

524
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,200
Each fully co-existent with all others.

525
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,640
And you are not in this world to live up to my expectations.

526
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,120
And if we get...

527
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,460
together, baby, it's beautiful.

528
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,340
I am here to do my thing.

529
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,380
And you are here to do your thing.

530
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,480
I am in this world to give up your expectations.

531
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,360
Yeah, that's what's easy for you to say.

532
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:28,700
Hello?

533
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,140
You're not actually having to stuff your intestines back into your ripped open...

534
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,820
abdomen.

535
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,440
Well, you have to stuff them back.

536
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,840
I mean, that's where they go, back into your abdomen.

537
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,980
You just try not to get too many leaves and pieces of bark and bugs and things in there with them.

538
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:53,180
I heard a terrible conspiracy that the Republicans made hippies take drugs back in the 60s.

539
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,840
Oh, yeah.

540
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,940
Just so they would be thinking dumber now.

541
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,320
What?

542
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,440
So they couldn't make...

543
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,580
Well, uh...

544
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,120
So they could be more easily duped by the Republicans.

545
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,120


546
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,120


547
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,020
It's the Republicans that we fear.

548
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,020
We know the Democrats are gonna help us.

549
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,600
The Republicans we fear.

550
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,060
The Democrats have forgotten how.

551
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
Forgotten how to do anything.

552
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,360
But they care. That's the important thing.

553
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,320
Even if they have forgotten how, we know they care.

554
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,600
And the caring is the important thing.

555
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,000
The knowing how is less important than the caring.

556
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,220
Stephen King's The Knowing.

557
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,820
If you had just put...

558
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,820
A UFO in the back of their car...

559
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,240
They would know now, and they would care too.

560
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,880
And it wouldn't be like they forgot how, what they were supposed to know.

561
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,360
Stephen King's The Caring.

562
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,720
And after his death...

563
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,000
No, not his death.

564
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,480
What?

565
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,420
No, not his death.

566
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,920
No, which guy?

567
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,380
Oh, Bob. Yeah, after Bob's death.

568
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,780
You'll have to put them back up in line.

569
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,740
They all look alike to me now.

570
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,140
America's best-selling author, Stephen King, brings new fear and horror to the suspense...

571
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,420
What? Now they're doing Stephen King on the show?

572
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,380
...in The Caring.

573
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:28,960
Stephen King's latest 6,000-page novel, a New York Times bestseller for several months, is about a small Kansas farm girl, Mindy Diddleton of Dubsville, Kansas.

574
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,360
And she becomes the vessel of a malignant and ancient evil.

575
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,340
Bob?

576
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,480
Bob.

577
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,960
Bob, as she calls him, orders her to commit a Columbine-style massacre.

578
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,080
Kill.

579
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,860
Kill.

580
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,800
Poor Bob.

581
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,340
As trenchant as today's headlines, The Caring is Stephen King's greatest novel.

582
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,940
Hey, did you hear you could pay money to be...

583
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,140
...soon to be a major motion picture featuring...

584
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,940
...to get inside the confession booth and hear people tell their stories?

585
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,480
...their sins now? The Catholic Church will let you do that?

586
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,200
I thought that was you guys.

587
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,980
To actually pay money to sit in the confession booth and hear kids say things like,

588
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,020
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

589
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,620
How many times, my son?

590
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,280
...said the good-looking, nubile teenager in the confession booth.

591
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
Yes, daughter, you may...

592
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:26,240
Tell me about it, said Father Damien Morbidius, the secret Jesuit, idly fiddling with his ornate signet ring.

593
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,980
I've been having evil, incarnal thoughts about Jesus, said the girl.

594
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,520
His graven image upon the cross, bleeding and suffering.

595
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,240
It's so sexy.

596
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,980
I just wanted to have sex with the bleeding, tormented Jesus.

597
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,860
Is there more, said Father Morbidius, in unctuous, papist tones?

598
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,300
Why, I oughta...

599
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,280
And that's where it stops.

600
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,840
That's a unctuous tone.

601
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:55,880
I mean, it's just getting good.

602
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Yeah.

603
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,720
Of the papists.

604
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,420
Just unburden yourself, my child.

605
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,380
Oh yeah, that was pretty good there.

606
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:03,980
That was pretty good.

607
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,100
Springtime for Hitler.

608
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,000
Hi, hello?

609
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,580
I've...

610
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:10,720
Hm.

611
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,260
I've...

612
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,420
Hm.

613
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,340
Smoking.

614
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:12,940
Smoking.

615
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,400
Smoking.

616
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,840
Smoking.

617
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,100
Smoking.

618
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,300
Smoking.

619
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,440
Smoking.

620
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:14,620
Smoking.

621
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:14,960
Smoking.

622
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,380
Smoking.

623
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,840
Yeah.

624
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,940
But smoking was so sexy.

625
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,520
Two cigarettes smoking one another.

626
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,920
Two beautiful cigarettes are sexy.

627
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,020
Okay, yeah.

628
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:48,600
Yeah, well, there must be a staff member with the guest at all times, because of the security problems that we have here at the, insert your name here, headquarters.

629
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,940
At first, Connie relaxed.

630
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,840
Oh, she's usually relaxed.

631
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,300
But then she, uh, let it go.

632
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,460
Too late.

633
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,800
Man, why did you show me that?

634
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,340
Uh, you get used to it.

635
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,340
What happens, what I'm referring to, folks, is two little collars just appeared.

636
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,620
They did.

637
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,560
Uh, that was a little two-stone order.

638
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,200
They were blasted by the...

639
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Bipolar disorder.

640
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,300
Oh, sorry.

641
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,020
Divine radiation.

642
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,840
Oh, now he's reading the things that are wrong with us.

643
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,400
You know, that's one thing about this church, is we don't like doing anything like the other

644
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,000
churches do, so we call it tripolar disorder here.

645
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,820
That's right.

646
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


647
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


648
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


649
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


650
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


651
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


652
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


653
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


654
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


655
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


656
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


657
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,900
It's a very obsessive panic...

658
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,620
It feels like this.

659
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,240
...like the Trinity in reverse.

660
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:29,960
Right.

661
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,320
Tri-polar.

662
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,920
Especially when you say...

663
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,540
There's three poles on our planet.

664
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,340
The state of the Father...

665
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,920
The North Pole, the South Pole, and the Mid Pole.

666
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,860
...the government will let, uh, somatoform and eating disorders that haven't happened yet.

667
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,820
Well...

668
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,440
Well, they will, though.

669
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,800
You know that for sure.

670
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
...the government...

671
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,400
...the island...

672
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,040
...the island...

673
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,220
...having creeks, especially...

674
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,980
Can you tell me what your...

675
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,800
...based on...

676
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


677
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


678
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


679
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


680
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


681
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


682
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


683
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


684
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,800


685
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,560
...the state of the direction...

686
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,420
It's always difficult to peg anything in time.

687
00:29:59,540 --> 00:29:59,840
I'm sorry, suicide man.

688
00:29:59,840 --> 00:29:59,840


689
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,580
I was hoping you could help.

690
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,100
...watching YouTube.

691
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,100
I must admit, I'm all at sea in these...

692
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,360
Uh, what...

693
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,820
No, I'm sorry.

694
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,560
Watching YouTube.

695
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,580
...if I don't have the strict recording of the chronometric reading.

696
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,460
Ah, look at that bulb.

697
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,320
Ah, yeah.

698
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,820
Time control must be a constant process.

699
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,360
Tell me what you think I should think.

700
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,620
I mean, do.

701
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,820
Lighten up, guys.

702
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,400
Come on.

703
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,960
King's just immortal.

704
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,160
He's...

705
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,540
It doesn't...

706
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,140
It doesn't...

707
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,680
It comes out again.

708
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,520
Hey, wait.

709
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:23,800
Wait.

710
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,320
Well, wake up.

711
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,800
We're driving.

712
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,100
No.

713
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

714
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:26,920
Geez.

715
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,020
Wow.

716
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,080
This is great.

717
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
This is like being in a...

718
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,820
...Felina show.

719
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,180
...all in veering all over the road.

720
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,460
No!

721
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,380
What are you doing?

722
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,180
Just keep it steady.

723
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,420
Let go.

724
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,480
Let go of the wheel.

725
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,180
Follow the...

726
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,000
Jeez.

727
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,940
What's going on?

728
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:51,340
Hey, uh, now, a minute ago, if I heard correctly, you guys were talking, uh, about the cosmic

729
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,680
continuation of the soul and so forth, and then trying not to.

730
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,800
Well, I was talking more about...

731
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,720
We always try to have it both ways here on Synesthesia.

732
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,000
We always try to have it both ways.

733
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,280
When I was...

734
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,340
...going to evolve into ectomorphic creatures who do not die but just kind of, like, slow

735
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,140
down a real lot.

736
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,600
Well, I had a, um, a vision when I was a teenager on drugs.

737
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,700
You were never a teenager on drugs?

738
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,780
Well, must I be a teenager on drugs?

739
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,320
You remember that song, too?

740
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,560
Me too.

741
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah.

742
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,880
Anyway, uh, I...

743
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,140
I was, uh...

744
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:32,720
I came up with this notion that, uh, that we all really had a fishbowl for a head...

745
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
Okay, so far...

746
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,060
...that had an opening at the back end of it that kind of joined up with all the other

747
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,200
fishbowl heads of every other thinking entity.

748
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,360
And even things that we don't normally think of as entities.

749
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:54,000
I figured the animals and plants all had their own type of fishbowl head that opened up in

750
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,420
to this other, uh, reality where all the fishbowl contents were conjoined.

751
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,500
It's the kind of thing that you come up with when you're a 16-year-old on drugs.

752
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,000
It certainly is.

753
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,000
Um...

754
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,620
I think...

755
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,900
I think you were reading Carlos Castaneda and, uh, Wilhelm Reich at the same time.

756
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,500
No, I had merely been looking at...

757
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,540
At that age, all I'd done really is look at a few album covers.

758
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
But that's all it took.

759
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,300
You know, there was some pretty good artwork in the...

760
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,680
in the...

761
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,540
back in them days.

762
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,020
This is Dr. Manhood.

763
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,500
Bewildered and confused.

764
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,120
Be bewildered and confused.

765
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,760
It is essential that sex be satisfied.

766
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,820
Not easy.

767
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,760
Sex is perfectly normal.

768
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,920
Use fear and punishment to stop it.

769
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,900
In this matter of sex or your son, sex is a dirty thing.

770
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,880
Bad, impure, or dirty.

771
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,480
Use fables, vagueness, or untruth.

772
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,400
This wonderful thing called sex.

773
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Penis, vagina, and so forth.

774
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,660
Do not hesitate to use pet names, or vulgar names, or names that are not true.

775
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


776
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


777
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


778
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


779
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


780
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,660


781
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,920
Use names that are vague, inaccurate, or meaningless.

782
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,460
The church, the doctor, or the nurse, or meaningless.

783
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,280
Erection.

784
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,000
Follow this natural impulse.

785
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,840
This is all quite normal.

786
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,680
Sex is perfectly normal.

787
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,240
Use fear and punishment to discourage it.

788
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,700
It is recommended that you show him a sanitary napkin, wet dreams, or the nurse.

789
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,180
Again, research has shown that this is not good psychologically.

790
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,840
Talk about venereal disease, unwed mothers, birth control, or abortion.

791
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,640
Make references or comparisons to the same.

792
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,820
The sex life of animals.

793
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,500
This is very good.

794
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,220
Your warm love tool.

795
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880
Animal sex again.

796
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,260
Just act normally.

797
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,280
Good.

798
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,280
Everything's going fine.

799
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,560
Excellent.

800
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,180
We're recording.

801
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,160
We're recording.

802
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,300
A-okay.

803
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,740
But have you ever considered tire safety?

804
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,580
Yes.

805
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,160
I think about it a lot every time I get in the car.

806
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,840
Actually, doctor, I didn't mean you.

807
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,600
I know you did.

808
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,620
You always rotate your tire.

809
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


810
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


811
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


812
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


813
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


814
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


815
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


816
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


817
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


818
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


819
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


820
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


821
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,620


822
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,900
You rotate your tires and participate in proper inflation techniques.

823
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:03,500
But I thought maybe the collar was not hip to tire rotation.

824
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,000
Why?

825
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,060
You can improve your fuel economy by up to 25% by simply keeping your tires properly

826
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:11,720
inflated.

827
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,520
So don't be fuel-ish.

828
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,620
Time to re-tire.

829
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,820
A lot of people don't know that.

830
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,700
And that's why we think it's important to get that message out.

831
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,620
And that's why we're here.

832
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,620


833
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,620


834
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,620


835
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,620


836
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,200
It may...

837
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,800
A public service from KPFA and the sub-genius radio ministry.

838
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,100
It could be heard by the enemies of Dobbs, and yet we bode them no ill will other than

839
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,900
the hopeful...

840
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,840
Yes, the terrorists are welcome to that information.

841
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,320
...the hopeful painful death that they will participate in very shortly.

842
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,960
Because even if the terrorists rotate their tires and gain fuel...

843
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,460
Nothing other than that.

844
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:43,460


845
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:43,820
Nothing other than that.

846
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,180
No.

847
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,460
No.

848
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,780
These guys do not...

849
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,100
...save fuel efficiency.

850
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,500
...do not think about lopping the heads off of other religious figures.

851
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:49,920
That would be passed down the line to us all.

852
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,820
Probably not at all.

853
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,580
We wouldn't ever think about what we would do to other religious figures were they in

854
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,280
our clutches.

855
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,260
We'll think of that when it happens.

856
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,720
Now we must consolidate our power.

857
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,000
We must embrace the dark side of the Force.

858
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,520
Feel the power of the dark side of the Force.

859
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,400
That's that old helmet guy.

860
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,480
This helmet is stifling.

861
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,400
Look!

862
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,720
Look!

863
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,120
Look!

864
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,800
Look!

865
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Look!

866
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


867
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


868
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


869
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


870
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


871
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


872
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


873
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


874
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,720
This is Taker?

875
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:37,720


876
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:37,720


877
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:37,720


878
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:37,720


879
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,080
This is Dino, ti-fi- commanded tacano.

880
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,080


881
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,120
Yes.

882
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,120


883
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,120


884
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,180
Like the way...

885
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
ões i me BB.

886
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,180


887
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,180


888
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,180


889
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,180


890
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,160
Like the notifications of the Big親omion...

891
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,260
...they were..

892
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,500
A part...

893
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,800
I can't think of what the name of it is.

894
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
50...

895
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Word right, quiveringbrain.com.

896
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,320
Well, all these things are kind of like, okay, if you're asking me for something,

897
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,040
you really want something to do, I'll give you a list.

898
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,860
I would promote kidney stones, certain toxic drugs, concentrated urine.

899
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,700
I would take huge amounts of drugs.

900
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,280
A lot of people are eating people three times a day.

901
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,560
You know, that's too much to be peeled off and dealt with.

902
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,180
You'd want to make sure you form stones and problems.

903
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,100
I would take huge amounts of nitrogen.

904
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,100
The odds are your kidney will do fine, but get a list from your doctor.

905
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,340
I think that would be the best thing, all right?

906
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,460
That is the program.

907
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,880
Please join us for the next one.

908
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,680
Until then, as always, take huge amounts of drugs.

909
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,520
Just chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing.

910
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,440
Scratching and biting and scratching and biting.

911
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,320
Like a dog.

912
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,060
She was itching.

913
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,760
She was licking.

914
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,660
She was suffering like a dog.

915
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,620
That was so desperate.

916
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,160
Scratching.

917
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,760
Scratching and biting.

918
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Like itching problems.

919
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,000
Because he keeps me up at night.

920
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,580
Because he keeps me up at night.

921
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,920
Because he keeps me up at night.

922
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,440
Scratching and scratching and.

923
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,660
The digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dogs.

924
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,560
I stopped licking at night, which got both of us to sleep.

925
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,840
Scratching and biting and scratching and biting and scratching and biting.

926
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,980
Thanks to Reverend Maynard Reynard for that.

927
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,240
And to Leigh Murr and Radio Synesthesia.

928
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,500
And to Radio Synesthesia.

929
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,880
Before that also.

930
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,520
And now, Rell.

931
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,380
Now, Rell Pref.

932
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,100
And now, a cop calls the cops.

933
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,620
Because he did some weed and freaked out.

934
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,680
Overdose of what?

935
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,740
Overdose of what?

936
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,360
I think I'm having an overdose.

937
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,480
I think I'm having an overdose.

938
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,560
My wife.

939
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,020
I don't know if it had something in it.

940
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,380
Do you guys have fever or anything?

941
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,660
Do you guys have fever or anything?

942
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,840
I think we're dying.

943
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,980
I think we're dying.

944
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,280
How much did you guys get?

945
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,460
How much did you guys get?

946
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,760
I don't know.

947
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,660
I don't know, we made brownies.

948
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,460
I think we're dying.

949
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,760
We're not here.

950
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,000
And I think we're dead.

951
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,520
Time is going by really, really, really, really, really, really slow.

952
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,920
Now how do you follow a story like that?

953
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,040
I tell you, it's a new world, Philo. I'm not sure I fit in it anymore.

954
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,900
I used to be a wry young sprat, but you could hardly think that you could now.

955
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,100
Hal studies slowly with drawing on the screen, lit by candlelight.

956
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
As the new world envelops him.

957
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,260
There's a new world somewhere, we call the Promised Land.

958
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,280
Back when we were just like proto-subgeniuses,

959
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,500
and we are like,

960
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,820
our brains were much smaller,

961
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,540
and our skulls went straight, pretty much straight back above our prognathous brows.

962
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,120
Our brains hadn't turned to mush either.

963
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,960
We hadn't, we hadn't actually, we didn't have a bicameral brain at that point.

964
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
It was simply, well we did,

965
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,320
but there was no interconnectivity between the two.

966
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,260
So one side of the brain just sort of talked to itself all the time,

967
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,780
and every now and then, the other side of the brain,

968
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,360
which is the one that was connected to,

969
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,380
the voluntary and involuntary nervous system,

970
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:42,980
was actually hearing the other voice in such a way that made it think it was actually hearing those voices from God.

971
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,580
Had I not been drinking, I would have thought this was something that was just too wacky to believe.

972
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,300
And yet, they laughed at my methods.

973
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,500
My acquisition skills were,

974
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,640
Acquisitions, mergers, and, um,

975
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,920
the object of humorous discourse.

976
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,620
And yet,

977
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,240
my money problems had simply disappeared.

978
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:19,860
It was as if I had tapped into a vein of electricity straight from Planet X.

979
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,860
And yet, I could still enjoy a cool, clean smoke.

980
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,880
The milk,

981
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,300
never went sour.

982
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,600
Oh yeah?

983
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,080
And amongst these handball players,

984
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,540
I found my rosy red skull of intent.

985
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,660
Well, you can kiss my rosy red-

986
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,660
And the cough button stood,

987
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,840
stood alone, untouched,

988
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,480
by psychobabble,

989
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,080
or any other brilliant new concept,

990
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,800
as exposed on the show,

991
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:24,120
by ancient practitioners of subgenius confidence acquisition methods and techniques.

992
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,520
I will soon view when I travel to X-Day.

993
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,460
I hope your calculations are correct.

994
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Our calculations are always correct, for we are gigantic brains.

995
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,580
Initiate space-time transfer!

996
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Hey!

997
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,860
Oh, ma'am.

998
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,400
Because we are

999
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,000
in a funeral service attended by nearly ten people,

1000
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,060
same thing as a bomb, homemade bomb,

1001
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,640
don't know the bombs, the photos of it.

1002
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm 2% higher than a year ago.

1003
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:06,520
Radical Shiite cleric Muftada al-Sadr shows more weakness in the roadside bombing market,

1004
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,320
but a trade group expects a downturn in sales of bombs to be only temporary.

1005
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,500
On Wall Street 14253, reports from Nigeria say PR is bad.

1006
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,420
This is PR.

1007
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,040
More than 32 million people in the U.S.

1008
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,200
are killed by small arms fire this Memorial Day weekend,

1009
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,240
despite the hike in small arms prices.

1010
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,820
Most were killed yesterday in separate attacks.

1011
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,760
The auto industry group AAA died in roadside bombings that also killed PR News.

1012
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,480
Come on, smokers, why don't you try?

1013
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,320
Well, gang, here are the rest of the questions that will tell you if you know the score.

1014
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,260
Question number three.

1015
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,180
Would you stick up for kids smaller than you who are picked on by tough guys?

1016
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:50,940
No.

1017
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,960
Okay, here's question number two.

1018
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,760
Do you respect the right of any boy or girl to worship in whatever church or synagogue he chooses?

1019
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,420
No.

1020
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,840
Question number five.

1021
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,140
Do you speak up for the things you believe in?

1022
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:02,840
Never.

1023
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,160
No.

1024
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,380
Question number four.

1025
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,800
Are you up on what's happening in the world?

1026
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:07,520
No.

1027
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,200
Question number seven.

1028
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,780
Do you insist on fair play at all times?

1029
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,400
No.

1030
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:12,700
Never.

1031
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,100
Question number six.

1032
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,880
Do you choose your friends only because they're regular Joes without caring what side of the track they live on?

1033
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,760
No.

1034
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,940
Well, boys and girls, there you have it.

1035
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,320
The questions that are the key to popularity.

1036
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,640
The key to slack is Lemur.

1037
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,820
Disconnect your brain stem.

1038
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,180
Open up your skull cap.

1039
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,380
And soak it in a coffee of Bob Dobbs.

1040
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,140
Enjoy the slack that this in-sieger will bring you.

1041
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,020
The key to slack is Lemur.

1042
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,020


1043
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,020


1044
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,020


1045
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,020


1046
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,020


1047
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,360
The key to slack is Lemur.

1048
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,880
Do you listen to what they're saying?

1049
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,280
No.

1050
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,340
No, Bolt.

1051
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,540
No, Bolt.

1052
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,500
Remember more.

1053
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,220
Never.

1054
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,980
A UFO! A UFO! A UFO!

1055
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,920
Help me, teammate! He's dead, dead, dead, dead!

1056
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,700
Hurting everyone out!

1057
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,000
Horrors at Black High. Takeoff in there.

1058
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,480
And in other news, thousands of landmines have been found.

1059
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,540
It's true in about Houston.

1060
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,380
Authorities are blaming the subject, yes.

1061
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:11,040
A hyper-crunched-up mix there by Reverend Graves, called Sub-Sayings, and now,

1062
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,200
Sub-Sayings, and now,

1063
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:18,280
let's go to beautiful Cleveland for WCSB's Radio Synesthesia with host, Dr. Sinister.

1064
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:26,180
I saw a website that was spreading panic about the, what was it, the Y5B bug.

1065
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,500
The Earth only has, I mean, the Sun only has 5 billion more years.

1066
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,440
So these guys were starting to sell you software that would help prevent problems when the 5B bug arrived.

1067
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:39,880
You know what's really funny?

1068
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,200
When you said Y5B,

1069
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,200


1070
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,560
I could've sworn I heard you say, uh, Y5B bug.

1071
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:55,540
And, like, uh, the fact that like 25% of the honeybees in America have died in the past few years.

1072
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,820
I did say bee bug.

1073
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,240
Or disappeared.

1074
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,000
Right, but you said Y5B, like, your 5 billion.

1075
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:02,600
Right.

1076
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,880
And I'm talking about Wi-Fi, like wireless internet.

1077
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,260
Oh.

1078
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,360
Wi-Fi bee, and bees like honeybees.

1079
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,660
Oh.

1080
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,800
The Wi-Fi bee bug.

1081
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,020
Or honeybee.

1082
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:17,780
And some people have, like, speculated that maybe, uh, radio signals are interfering with, uh, bees' ability to, uh, get back to their hives.

1083
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,480
I think that the insect hive mind of the world just wised up and said, let's quit feeding these humans.

1084
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,700
That's a very plausible idea, yeah.

1085
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,060
Well, tell you what, why don't I give up a line so that one of those bees can call in and complain.

1086
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,060
Talk to you guys later.

1087
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,720
Thanks, Mark.

1088
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,240
Okay, bye.

1089
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:32,800
It's been a pleasure.

1090
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,460
This is PR News.

1091
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,380
President Bush is trying to set up a terrorist unit today at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.

1092
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,000
The President says he's not going to be able to get the bees out of the hive.

1093
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,180
He's already got the bees out of the hive.

1094
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,000
He's the first U.S. American terrorist found in a river inside the United PR News.

1095
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,860
And now, the return of PR News.

1096
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,080
President Bush is trying to set up in a river inside PR News.

1097
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,780
Weird, you know, basically wearing a bar mop, but, uh, I had plastic that, you know, may clean there.

1098
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,920
So did you ever sit in with, uh, Doctors for Bob, puzzling?

1099
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:00,860
Um.

1100
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,060
Um.

1101
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,900
Which Doc, which Doctors for Bob?

1102
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,200
When?

1103
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,220
Way back when, you know, I was just thinking, you know.

1104
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,980
Oh, yeah, you know, actually it's the original, uh, the original, um, I don't know, I don't

1105
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:09,980


1106
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:09,980


1107
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,760
80, 80, 81.

1108
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,620
They won on Main Street in Dallas.

1109
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:14,800
Yeah.

1110
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,280
And I had no mustache.

1111
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,300
And you played.

1112
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,900
And the Overman played.

1113
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,720
And Meyer ranted and he was very frustrated

1114
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,120
because the band wouldn't be like a real band for him.

1115
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Yeah, I remember that.

1116
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:27,940
That was fun.

1117
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,820
That was fun.

1118
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,040
What did he want that he wasn't getting?

1119
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,040
When he put his hand up and put his hand down,

1120
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,900
he wanted us to stop playing and we just kept honking away.

1121
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,620
Or playing terrible things that did not back him up perfectly.

1122
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,800
And we ruined his show forever and ever.

1123
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,820
Did he write another letter about it?

1124
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,140
But he forgave us from that one.

1125
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,780
I get all confused on which we are forgiven for and which we are not.

1126
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,140
One of Wellman's tapes came on and I closed my eyes.

1127
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,280
It was a tape loop of car accidents and dinosaurs fighting.

1128
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,940
I opened my eyes and threw it up again,

1129
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,820
so I shut my eyes once more and suddenly a vision came to me.

1130
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,540
The Torch.

1131
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,120
The creature set in.

1132
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,900
It was evenly dispensed.

1133
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,880
Properly distributed across a broader spectrum of the clientele.

1134
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,540
They were dressed in silly uniforms.

1135
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,740
Much like a beekeeper or frogman.

1136
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,880
We were all waiting for Dobbs to show up.

1137
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,520
We were waiting for Dobbs to show up.

1138
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:39,520


1139
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,120
Well, and the suspense.

1140
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,800
Did he show up or didn't he?

1141
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,140
Well, I was nervous.

1142
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,080
I'm still nervous.

1143
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,340
And he did show up, but not where we thought it would be.

1144
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,540
He was supposed to be at the show.

1145
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,900
Instead, he showed up in the middle of the fire.

1146
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,320
Definitely sloppy second coming.

1147
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,940
Hmm, I'm not sure how I can interpret such a...

1148
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,360
You sleep here?

1149
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,300
Sure, whatever I can.

1150
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,940
I can't.

1169
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,940
The Pink Boys, dear friends, from 1978.

1170
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,100
That was a Dallas band of some friends of mine.

1171
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,640
And in fact, the guy singing,

1172
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,160
who wrote,

1173
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:31,600
that song,

1174
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,660
watching the TV,

1175
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,780
was Dr. X,

1176
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,320
who you'll find listed in Book of the Subgenius

1177
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,840
as one of the three co-sub founders.

1178
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,200
He's the third guy,

1179
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,860
besides Dr. Philodrummon and me,

1180
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,020
who were originally working for Bob

1181
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,220
on Subgenius materials.

1182
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,300
But he's like the Brian Jones

1183
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,500
of the Church of the Subgenius

1184
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,880
and died a long time ago.

1185
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,880
But, you know, he was right.

1186
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,680
TV is the ultimate drug.

1187
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,920
And this drug you're listening to

1188
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
is Hour of Slack,

1189
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,020
number 1104,

1190
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,780
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1191
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,880
And if you want more information

1192
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,360
about the Church of the Subgenius,

1193
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,500
please look at our rather huge website,

1194
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,180
subgenius.com,

1195
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,880
where you can also download

1196
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,500
all the last few hundred episodes of this show.

1197
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,200
Friends, it might not be too late

1198
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,380
to make the saucers.

1199
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,440
And now,

1200
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,260
Lemur.

1201
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,960
Who is it?

1202
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,920
Who's there?

1203
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,340
I'm the werewolf.

1204
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,260
Oh, just a moment.

1205
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,060
And if it's the werewolf,

1206
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,780
where's his car?

1207
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,440
If and when the werewolf was sighted

1208
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,200
in the gray convertible,

1209
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,220
we'd automatically take over

1210
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,420
the coffee and the hamburgers,

1211
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,980
and all we needed now

1212
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,620
was to find the werewolf inside.

1213
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,040
Phone rang.

1214
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,160
This is Werewolf Boy.

1215
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:02,840
How come?

1216
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,820
I don't know.

1217
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,260
Oh?

1218
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:04,940
Yeah.

1219
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,620
What do you think, Joe?

1220
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,300
I don't know.

1221
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,160
Code 3.

1222
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,060
Code 3.

1223
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,960
Come on, let's roll.

1224
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,740
Code 3.

1225
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,580
Same story.

1226
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:18,540
Werewolf.

1227
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,180
Then the newspapers played it big,

1228
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,180
and in two days,

1229
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,420
the story was on the front page

1230
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,520
of every paper in town.

1231
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,260
Maybe that should have made

1232
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,300
the werewolf lay low,

1233
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,040
but it didn't.

1234
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,860
Code 3.

1235
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,820
At 7 that night,

1236
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,140
Ben and I made the rounds

1237
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,320
and found each of the policewomen

1238
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,440
on her job as a werewolf

1239
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,120
behind bars.

1240
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,880
The werewolf?

1241
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:39,880
Yeah.

1242
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,760
Got anything for us this morning?

1243
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,240
Yeah.

1244
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:44,880
Great.

1245
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,380
When we told him about the werewolf,

1246
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,960
he didn't say a thing for a minute.

1247
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:53,040
4-7-6-3-5-6-3-4-2-6-1-3-8-5.

1248
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:53,980
Got those?

1249
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:54,800
Yeah, yeah.

1250
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,640
1-2-3-7-10.

1251
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,400
Now we haven't got even half of them.

1252
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,760
Yeah.

1253
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,680
That's perfect.

1254
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:01,980
Right.

1255
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,420
The werewolf was tried and convicted.

1256
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,380
That's good.

1257
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,120
That's all.

1258
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,960
This is PR.

1259
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,720
From PR News in Washington,

1260
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,060
I'm being held in a prison

1261
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,920
with three others.

1262
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,260
A tuberculosis patient says

1263
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,720
that Alexander Litvinenko

1264
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,180
might have spilled secrets

1265
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,680
about his work with Britain.

1266
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,580
The member states are responsible

1267
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,400
for tracing their own nationals.

1268
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,980
On Wall Street,

This is PR News.

1271
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,320
PR's bad.

1272
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,120
PR's bad.

1273
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,000
Northwest Airlines has emerged

1274
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,700
from a police recruiting center

1275
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,540
in California.

1276
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,000
The U.S. says that Iran

1277
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,100
has been missing for more than two weeks.

1278
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,440
The U.S. claims Iran's been transferred

1279
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,680
from a hospital in Atlanta

1280
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,520
with a rare and dangerous form of PR news.

1281
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,180
PR dedicated to protecting

1282
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,100
Marxism and communist liberals.

1283
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,740
You'll smile now.

1284
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,760
True.

1285
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,900
This is fiction.

1286
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,400
And this is

1287
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,220
Be Warned It, Be Not.

1288
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,420
One of the most amazing funerals

1289
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,500
of all time took place

1290
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,220
in the townhouse

1291
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,580
of the Roman poet Virgil.

1292
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,700
But he overlooked

1293
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,720
a loaded revolver

1294
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,640
in his bureau drawer.

1295
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,020
With the aid of neighbors,

1296
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,480
a pistol report rang out

1297
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,840
and his pet fly fell dead.

1298
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,680
Be Warned It, Be Not.

1299
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,560
In a moment,

1300
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,600
I'll tell you about the donkey

1301
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,780
that averaged 25 miles a day.

1302
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,460
Amid barbaric pomp and splendor,

1303
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,680
a lost donkey wandering,

1304
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,440
aimlessly over poor roads

1305
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,640
in all kinds of weather,

1306
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,580
averaged 95 miles a day

1307
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,520
for 59 days.

1308
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,180
Yet he averaged 100 miles a day.

1309
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,940
Be Warned It, Be Not.

1310
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,440
Five letter blocks

1311
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,160
contain a total of 30 letters.

1312
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,920
Be Warned It, Be Not.

1313
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,800
In a moment, I'll tell you about

1314
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,080
a real distance runner.

1315
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,020
Manson Ernst, a Norwegian,

1316
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,080
was the greatest long-distance runner

1317
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,960
who ever lived.

1318
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,200
Judge Norman Buck,

1319
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,980
District Court of Idaho in 1885,

1320
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,620
directed that his skin

1321
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,960
be made into a military shirt.

1322
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,260
Jerry Drum,

1323
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Be Warned It,

1324
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:02,840
Be Not.

1325
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,960
Well, I'm going to say goodnight

1326
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,500
to our listeners now.

1327
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,720
And the Martians, they dig it.

1328
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,020
Because they're bone-dry monsters

1329
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,080
from another world.

1330
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,220
They might as well go back

1331
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,260
and get that, uh,

1332
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,320
get the first rays of the sun.

1333
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,960
The sunny rays that point their spears

1334
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,660
upon Udonna.

1335
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,000
Right, California,

1336
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,980
wherever you are.

1337
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,680
There goes a great American

1338
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,080
and a great subgenius,

1339
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,520
Dr. Philo Drummond.

1340
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,880
Ascending to the zenith

1341
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,720
as he speeds homeward

1342
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,560
like a ray of light

1343
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,600
across the face of the cosmos.

1344
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,540
Now, almighty gods of Egypt,

1345
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,680
may you find in this young follower

1346
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,460
a success so worthy in every respect

1347
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,660
to carry on the sacred trust

1348
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,040
now delivered into his hands.

1349
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,020
And save him from any temptation

1350
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,080
that might destroy him

1351
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,340
as it nearly destroyed me.

1352
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,280
Pills, pills, pills,

1353
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,500
bop, bop, pills, bop, pills,

1354
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,260
bop, pill, slack, bop, pill, slack,

1355
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,580
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,

1356
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,680
bop, pills, bop, pills, bop, pills,

1357
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,900
bop, pills, pills and bop,

1358
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,600
pills and bop, pills and bop.

1359
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,740
Open the Eucharist Waste

1360
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,580
Material Chamber.

1361
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,160
Frop, frop, zippy, frop, frop.

1362
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,300
Just like you see on

1363
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,020
the Uncle Bob Show.

1364
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,580
Frop, frop, zippy, frop, frop.

1365
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,400
Learn to cough like Captain Drummond.

1366
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,680
Give me more pills, Bob.

1367
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,420
Bob, give me more pills, please.

1368
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,100
If you could just send

1369
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,880
three more of those pills.

1370
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,620
Good lord, let's eat, Bob.

1371
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,340
I'd feel a whole lot better.

1372
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,940
I just took the last one, Bob.

1373
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,460
The last pill.

1374
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,560
I'll need some more

1375
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,500
for the next year.

1376
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,260
And now, the mirror.

1377
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,280
Now I'm asking you for the last time. Come on, get up.

1378
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,800
You're over 21.

1379
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,320
Figure it out yourself.

1380
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,820
One, three,

1381
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:26,780
zero,

1382
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,020
one, three,

1383
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,960
two, three,

1384
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:32,260


1385
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,900
five.

1386
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:34,660
One,

1387
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:36,880
two,

1388
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,640
three,

1389
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,180
four,

1390
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:39,580
five,

1391
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:39,580


1392
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,380
six,

1393
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:43,420
seven,

1394
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:43,500
eight,

1395
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,600
nine,

1396
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:43,600


1397
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:43,860
eleven,

1398
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1399
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1400
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1401
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1402
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1403
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1404
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:43,860


1405
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,060
twenty,

1406
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:45,060


1407
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:45,060


1408
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:45,420
twenty,

1409
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:45,420


1410
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:45,700
guys
