1
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:20,220
Oh, I hate to take you out of that one, but we've got things we have to do and say, dear friends.

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:29,100
This is, number one thing to say, this is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,360
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,500
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,880
The Soap Genius.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,740
Hour of Swatch.

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:29,540
The Soap Genius.

8
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,120
Hour of Swatch.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,400
Hour of Swatch.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,420
I get interviewed by people out of town and out of time if they're not out of town.

11
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:48,700
So we're going to play some old interview tapes and a lot of music, a lot of new Soap Genius music, Bob songs, and you'll find out just what this is all about, won't you?

12
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,460
In the meantime, you can call for information.

13
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,740
Call the Will Adobes.

14
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,660
He's still here at...

15
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,400
Insert local number here.

16
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
If you must.

17
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,640
This music in the background is Danny Elfman's score for Beetlejuice.

18
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,780
My favorite movie music composer now, I think.

19
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,240
And now we go from the Supreme Court to a different form of court.

20
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,120
This court you might call the Church of the Subgenius.

21
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,900
You might ask yourself, what do you mean by Church of the Subgenius?

22
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,740
Well, we sent our own Bill Cates out to find out, and this is what he learned.

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,860
Okay, we're here with the Reverend Ivan Stang, who is the...

24
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,260
Well, what would you call yourself in relation to this church?

25
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,560
I am the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,040
A mere servant of our guru and saint of sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

27
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,500
Praise his sweet name.

28
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,620
Now, for those of our listeners not familiar with just who the Church of the Subgenius and J.R. Bob Dobbs are,

29
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,240
could you briefly give us a capsule description?

30
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,240
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is what you might call a disorganized religion,

31
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:29,520
or you might say a non-organization for non-joiners, for people who wouldn't be caught dead joining anything.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,800
It is a church, but it's a church for sinners, disbelievers, or people who'll believe anything.

33
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,680
Mutants, misfits, you know, your class clowns, your blasphemers, and talk show hosts.

34
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,840
And who is J.R. Bob Dobbs? He's the guru.

35
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,500
Bob Dobbs is the... technically he's called the high E-pop.

36
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,120
Actually, he's the very salesman of the gods, that man.

37
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,980
If he...

38
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,980


39
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:07,980
He is indeed a man who has come to keep the conspiracy of the normals from buying your slack away from you.

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,760
You see, preachers have to do more than just lay people.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,600
And Bob Dobbs, I think, is here to bring slack to the slackless.

42
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,400
And if you... friends, if you don't know what slack is, then it's probably too late.

43
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,540
You should probably just shut your radio off, because you're gonna find out how much you've been missing.

44
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,840
Okay, what is...

45
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,360
What is slack?

46
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,060
Well, if you have to ask, you'll never know.

47
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,780
As the Hell's Angels once put it, uh,

48
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,940
those who know don't say, and those who say don't know,

49
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,400
which leads me to wonder why they said it, actually.

50
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Uh, slack is, uh, well, to compare it to happiness.

51
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,980
Uh, slack makes happiness feel like having your eyes gouged out with a carrot peeler.

52
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,580
It makes the nirvana of the Buddha feel like being buried up to your...

53
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,540
to your neck.

54
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,040
And, uh, you know, you're just sitting in the sand waiting for the, uh, the ants to come and eat your face away.

55
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,360
Or maybe a lawnmower to come and mow your head off, perhaps.

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Sure. Sure.

57
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,200
Hmm.

58
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,300
Yeah, I've got the recipe for a grandma face sandwich if you ever need it.

59
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,180
Uh, what... essentially what we're doing, to get serious here,

60
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,660
uh, what we're essentially doing is we're...

61
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,800
the Church of the Subgenius is trying to tempt sinners away from the devil.

62
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,000
Now, what they do, where they go after that is up to them.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,060
But Bob Dobbs is... is a mighty, mighty man, uh, or... or... or God.

64
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,500
We're not... we're not sure which, and it doesn't really matter.

65
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:48,440
Uh, and he... he operates out of his skyscraper headquarters in Dallas, Texas, where I work, uh, in the Bible Belt.

66
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,300
And what we're essentially doing through our magazines, our radio shows, the tapes we sell, and our... our new videotape,

67
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,980
um, we're trying to unbuckle the Bible Belt.

68
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,980
And get them to sort of drop their pants and make them face their own... private desires.

69
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,560
So, friends, if you could just open your heart and bend over, because Bob's coming.

70
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,460
He's coming.

71
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,780
And he... and he comes not... he comes not to forgive your sins.

72
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,520
We leave that to better connected deities.

73
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,840
Bob Dobbs comes and comes again and again to justify your sins, my friends.

74
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,720
To excuse your sins.

75
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,960
To offer you that.

76
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,580
To offer you that great excuse that I know you need, my brothers and sisters.

77
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
How can you tell?

78
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,760
Oh, there's no way to tell.

79
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Because Bob's coming.

80
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,900
He's sneaking up on you.

81
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,960
Can't you hear him?

82
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,340
Can't you feel him?

83
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,780
One, two, Bob's coming for you.

84
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

85
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,540
Bobby's here.

86
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah he's here.

87
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,040
Okay, great.

88
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,140
Thank you, Bob.

89
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,320


90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,320


91
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,320


92
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,960
I said he's here.

93
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,740
Yeah, Mr.

94
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,700
Cobbs is going to stay all night and I'm going to continue to do a bunch of ...

95
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,960
he's going to DO it.

96
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:28,960


97
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:37,140
proper deal with the exes whore then we'll come to meet him and we'll greet him and rule forevermore

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,080
bob is my one true savior you can't keep all of the rest looking at his smiling face helps

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,420
me when i'm depressed for the pinks i sure feel sorry for tomorrow they'll fry with all the rest

100
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:02,480
bob has got no real brain to speak of though his luck has seen him through the lack

101
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:11,800
for all the geniuses led us down the wrong track at least we know a subgenius won't turn around

102
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,520
and stab us in the back the complex they have us suckered but i know that that is a lie

103
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,140
they're due for a big surprise from demons

104
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,400
you

105
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,960
from the sky makes me so glad i wised up got it sized up hell i'm a lucky guy

106
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,940
bob brought me slack and that's lots more than i ever got from the con though i know it's only

107
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:46,180
because of all those pills he's on heck i know he ain't too clever but whatever he says i'll do or die

108
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,780
you

109
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,240
you

110
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:05,760
there's a shining golden city where the robots live beneath the central sun's eternal glare

111
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,120
and when the saucers come from space to massacre the human race i know that we'll find peace and

112
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,200
safety there through the holes in the poles we will flee sailing down to the lovely central sea

113
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,120
you

114
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,500
leaving torture death and madness for a land of joy and gladness within the hollow earth we will be free

115
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:38,540
in atomic powered go-karts we will roam the land while the aliens devour human slaves

116
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,700
they'll squirm beneath the master's boot or roaming packs in search of loot while we will

117
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:53,220
laugh do you think that we were saved through the holes in the poles we will flee sailing down to the

118
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:02,600
lovely central sea leaving torture death and madness for a land of joy and gladness within the hollow earth we will be free

119
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:10,560
we'll ride in flying submarines through air and through the sea while the aliens destroy the works of man

120
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:18,600
when they leave our blasted world at last we'll rise again without a past to implement our splendid master plan

121
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,660
through the holes in the poles we will flee

122
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:34,760
we'll be free sailing down to the lovely central sea leaving torture death and madness for a land of joy and gladness within the hollow earth we will be free

123
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,640
oh yes dear friends go ahead try to change channels you can't do it can't be changing channels we were here to insult you

124
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


125
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


126
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


127
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


128
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


129
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


130
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


131
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


132
00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:00,920
yeah. Onan Canobite in the background says you can't. And those last two songs you heard

133
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:09,080
were, the first one was by Reverend Orton Nenslow up in Boston. Praise Reverend Nenslow.

134
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:18,320
No, actually, the first one was by Ahmed Fishmonger. The second one was by Orton Nenslow. The very

135
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,800
last thing you heard was Orton. Ahmed Fishmonger there at the beginning doing,

136
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,940
Bob is my one true savior. And isn't it true? I'm going to go back to,

137
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,620
um, let's see here. This is, um, that radio show was Bleepo Abernathy

138
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,080
pretending he didn't know me doing an interview on K-Rock.

139
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,940
K-R-X-S, I think it is in New York. The biggest station in New York City. How about that, huh?

140
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,240
And this was prime time. This is what, this is how we

141
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,960
take advantage of you, the listener. Thank you. You need my brothers and sisters.

142
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,620
How can you tell, um, if you are a subgenius?

143
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,340
Well, the easiest way to tell is by sending, uh, $20 into the Church of the Subgenius, uh,

144
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,300
sacred postcard.

145
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,520
Oh, that's a good one.

146
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:38,300
And then you can send it to the post office box for a membership. Uh, the other way to tell would be if you're the kind of person who, uh, hates, uh, most normals. Uh, we're, we're, we're looking for people who love to hate, you might say. Although most of us have to, uh, maintain the illusion that we ourselves are normal.

147
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:48,300
We're out to teach people how to exploit their abnormality, to quit hiding it, and to, to actually learn how to make money off of it.

148
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,480
Not all of us have to have that.

149
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,340
Now, money is not exactly the same as Slack, but, uh, uh, Slack tends to come a little easier with money.

150
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:06,820
Now, I, I remember hearing somewhere that the Church of the Subgenius is actually the only church that admits it's in it for the money and, and, uh, in fact pays its taxes without complaining.

151
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:18,300
Right. We are the world's first industrial church. Bob does not believe that, uh, the public should have to subsidize religions they may not happen to believe in, besides which, uh, doubtful.

152
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,400
seriously if the IRS would ever let us get away with claiming tax-exempt status.

153
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,460
But those things aren't, those worldly things are not important here.

154
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,380
We're discussing the fact that people should get out there

155
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,300
and buy that Simon & Schuster book of the subgenius.

156
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,760
Yes, my friends, the book of the subgenius and its companion volume,

157
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,100
High Weirdness by Mail.

158
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,600
No, you're not supposed to do that.

159
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,100
You can't do that.

160
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,440
Don't go out there and do such a thing.

161
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,620
I'm sorry, we're not supposed to get to that part.

162
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,480
But here's a word from the League of Women Voters of Dallas.

163
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:07,260
This is a nation of people, by the people and for the people, they say.

164
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,800
So exercise your voting right, November 8th.

165
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,040
Your vote is your voice.

166
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
The League of Women Voters says...

167
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,080
Let it be heard on Election Day, November 8th.

168
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,940
Because otherwise, what do you think's going to happen?

169
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,380
They will come in.

170
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,340
They will take over.

171
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,920
And you know who they are, don't you?

172
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,520
They're the ones you don't like.

173
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,620
They're everyone you never cared for in your whole life.

174
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,780
And they'll run this whole country if you don't get out and vote.

175
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,140
I'm not gonna say exactly who they are because...

176
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,580
I think you know.

177
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,780
You know, don't you?

178
00:15:52,460 --> 00:16:00,660
Would you sing the neighbor's song with me now?

179
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,820
Lying in Riceville with a Tommy gun in hand

180
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,760
Shoot the nasty Yankees who have come to take our land

181
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,580
Our costumes facing black up north, it's all the rage

182
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,540
Olive green, dad, wouldn't you make the fashion page?

183
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Yo, heave ho

184
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
Yo, heave ho

185
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,640
An evil army of advisors

186
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,940
Late worm got the early risers

187
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,540
They bomb bombs in Agent Orange

188
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,960
I'm just singing in the rain

189
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,000
Fungi sticks and bamboo splinters work much better making things

190
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,760
Give me lots of death and torture, give me lots of gore

191
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,700
We may have lost the battle, but we haven't lost the war

192
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,040
I am not a man of violence

193
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,820
I don't want to use my fists

194
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,060
We can settle this real real peaceful

195
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,900
Don't you think that we should talk and try to work it out?

196
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
Cambodian girls are hip, I like their smiling faces

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,020
And Leo's girls were oh so sexy, tribute to the races

198
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,060
I'd trade them all today and give up all my money

199
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,140
If I could just be home with my Vietnam money

200
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,740
Odie and his crew took a ram into U and set up ship to go to Hades.

201
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,480
Odie poured a drink offering for all souls and prayed to the empty shells,

202
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
of the dead, dead, dead, dead.

203
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,540
Hey there, that's a sporty jacket, where'd you get that tie?

204
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,400
Are those shoes real alligator? Do you like apple pie?

205
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,300
So this is your democracy, it's very very pretty

206
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,360
But I think I'll be going now, back to Saigon City

207
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,700
Where'd you put my brain today? Am I dead or am I gay?

208
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,660
Where'd you put my brain you fool? Am I dead or am I girl?

209
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,460
Lying in a rice field with a Tommy gun in hand

210
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,580
Shoot the nasty Yankees who have come home

211
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,460
To take our land, our costume basic black up north

212
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,840
It's all the rage, while that olive green drab

213
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
Wouldn't make the fashion page

214
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,620
Yo, he's ho, yo, he's ho

215
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
Animal army of advisors

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,740
Lakeworm dropped the early risers

217
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,720
Napalm bombs and Agent Orange, I'm just singing in the rain

218
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,760
Fungi sticks and bamboo splendors, which might better make him faint

219
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,500
So give me lots of death and torture, give me lots of gore

220
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,580
We may have lost the battle, but we have won

221
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,420
We haven't lost the war

222
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,720
V-5-4-4, a bomb for you to go destroy

223
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,820
Be you alive or be you dead, at least you tried to stop the red

224
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,520
Man is for consuming good and taking over the neighborhood

225
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,700
Won't you be my neighbor? Won't you be my neighbor?

226
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,580
Comodian girls are hip, I really like their smiling faces

227
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,600
And Mayos girls are oh so sexy, tribute to the racist

228
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,660
I'd trade them all today and I would give up all my money

229
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,620
If I could just be home now with my Vietnam honey

230
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,500
Where'd you put my brain today? Am I dead or am I gay?

231
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,400
Where'd you put my brain last night? Am I black or am I white?

232
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,000
Won't you be my neighbor? Won't you be my neighbor?

233
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,260
You're hip, so am I, we both eat ham and Swiss on rye

234
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,700
Oh, thanks to Janine, Reverend Janine C for that one there

235
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,360
That was, uh, the neighbor song by the Bloody Mannequin Orchestra

236
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,960
I don't know where she finds these things

237
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,260
Uh, a true subgenius, she really looks around, I suppose

238
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,600
And you can too if you call the station here, please do

239
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:37,940
Uh, yes, and we're gonna go to another radio interview from the old days

240
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,680
This one had me, Reverend Ivan Stang, and Pastor Buck Naked, the mighty Pastor Buck Naked

241
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,620
The sneaky G. Gordon Gordon

242
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,780
All three of us on Halloween night about three years ago on a show hosted by a lady named Karen Dennard, thank you

243
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,740
We should have slack, that we were born with original slack

244
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,220
But that there is a vast and insidious conspiracy, more insidious than most people ever dream

245
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,920
Trying to sap away our slack

246
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,620
And you know who that conspiracy is?

247
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,220
Oh!

248
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,040
It's them normals

249
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,140
That's right

250
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,300
Mmm

251
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Yeah, it's a conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy

252
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,360
There's a, there are heads

253
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
It's a go-along conspiracy

254
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,180
But have you ever, do you know J.R. Bob?

255
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,340
Oh

256
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:34,860
Dobbs?

257
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,720
The day I came to know

258
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,860
Yeah, he helped kill him

259
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,260
Yeah, that's real funny, Buck

260
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,760
That's not exactly true, Buck, it was bad security

261
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
What happened?

262
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,660
What happened again?

263
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,340
I don't know, Stang was standing right there and his, his buddies just pow, right in the head

264
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,360
Oh my goodness

265
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot a year ago January in San Francisco

266
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,680
Oh

267
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,720
And, and did you read about it in the New York Times?

268
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,100
No

269
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,840
Did you hear about it on all things considered?

270
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
Did you hear about it, was it in the Dallas Papers?

271
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,100
No

272
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,020
That proves a conspiracy

273
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,080
It wasn't even a conspiracy

274
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,440
That proves a conspiracy

275
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,660
It wasn't even in the National Enquirer, dear friends, and yeah

276
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,060
Wasn't on Morning Edition either

277
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,960
No, no

278
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,220
No

279
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,560
Bob Dobbs died and life went on, oh yes

280
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:19,900
The, the people just kept going to work every day, not thinking about what they were doing it for

281
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,620
They don't have slack, they'll

282
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,140
They don't realize what has happened

283
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
And it may be, it may be too late for a lot of them

284
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,240
Did he appoint you as his heir for the Church of the Subgenius?

285
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,240
Was he leading the Church of the Subgenius?

286
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,800
Just so I understand what J.R. Bob Dobbs' role was

287
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,080
Bob, Bob leads, Bob leads by, by mistake

288
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,760
He became the leader of this thing by mistake

289
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
He doesn't consciously set out to do anything

290
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,120
He's, a lot of us think he's the world's stupidest man

291
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
And yet he's so lucky, he

292
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,360
He has attracted all this wealth

293
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,700
Yeah, as Bob

294
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,420
And he sells, he became a salesman

295
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,040
And he just sells by pushing himself, which is the product

296
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,760
In other words, nobody cares the piece of junk they leave with

297
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,280
They only go in for the treatment, which is Bob

298
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,140
I see

299
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,540
Gee Gordon, Gordon

300
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,460
Well, I just wanted to say that a lot of people aren't even aware of the fact that Bob is dead

301
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,740
And it's, it's really weird

302
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,840
It's really presumptuous to speak about an heir to Bob at this particular time

303
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,660
Because Bob will be coming back

304
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,800
Bob will come again

305
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,760
There's just no two ways about it

306
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,780
When, we're not sure

307
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,760
And exactly where he will show up

308
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,660
But there is no heir to the Church

309
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,980
The Reverend Stang was selected by J.R. Dobbs as the sacred scribe

310
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,520
And as the man to stand up and take the heat

311
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,600
When Bob isn't there to answer for any and everything

312
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,640
Now, I, I understand that there are

313
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,720
Are some very illustrious men

314
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,820
And they are members of the Church of the Subgenius

315
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,420
Somebody told me Todd Rundgren

316
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,940
Pee-Wee Herman

317
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,500
No

318
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,720
Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, those people

319
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,040
Pee-Wee is, but not Todd

320
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,340
Those people get our material but they don't send us money

321
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,640
Todd, Todd asked for us to send him a bunch of stuff

322
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,440
And they've never sent his twenty dollar subscription

323
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,740
I called Todd

324
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,600
And he told me he never heard of you guys

325
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,320
You did not

326
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,060
I did so

327
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,440
And he didn't, uh-uh

328
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,660
He didn't say that

329
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,500
Well you call him up and see what he tells you

330
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,480
I, I

331
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,460
Oh, I'm not going to argue over rock stars

332
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,620
Well, Zuta

333
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,760
rock stars. And Karen, you must understand

334
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,560
there are those people who will

335
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,000
even though they have used Dobbs

336
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
or they think they've used him at this particular

337
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,820
time of their life, to further their

338
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,900
careers, to further their wealth and their

339
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,840
personal standing, many people

340
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
will not admit that

341
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs is that one person

342
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,660
that has tilted the luck plane to enable

343
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,260
them to achieve these heights.

344
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,920
You're talking about the normals, of course.

345
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,880
Todd Rundgren may want people to

346
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,520
think he did it by sheer talent.

347
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,440
He may at this point not

348
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
want to let on that early

349
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,740
in his career Bob Dobbs sold him

350
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,660
a wooden nickel or something

351
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,000
that somehow tilted

352
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,580
his fate in the

353
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,540
direction it's gone.

354
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,300
But we do have some other people who acknowledge

355
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,720
the existence of Bob. Oh yeah, if you

356
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,320
want us to name drop, we can name drop.

357
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,580
Let's say that

358
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,880
you and your family... Well, this is puzzling

359
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
evidence. The host

360
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
and the mixer for most of these shows.

361
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,160
Well, in advance of any such

362
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,240
happening, appoint one member

363
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,320
of your family. This schizophrenic show

364
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,520
is for your

365
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,580
benefit, not ours.

366
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,040
Yes,

367
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,580
you are able to hear

368
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,380
such religions as

369
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,220
the subgenius church,

370
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,980
the saint stupid,

371
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,300
the discordians,

372
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,520
all those other

373
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,900
favorites that you ask about,

374
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,420
many of whom appear in the now

375
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,040
modern book

376
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,880
High Times by Weird Male.

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,320
And others who have

378
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,340
not yet been added to the

379
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,180
pantheon, and still others who

380
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,240
predate the subgenius by quite a lot.

381
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
But in any case,

382
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,200
as we whirl around the planet,

383
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,900
keep in mind

384
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,260
that we love you.

385
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,700
Is this the end?

386
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,280
Is this the end of the show?

387
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,500
Okay, here we go. Almost time for

388
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,780
the news to come in.

389
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,840
Our space cadets have just finished their

390
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
space cadets have just begun their role.

391
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,860
They've just begun the bagaing.

392
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,480
I have not yet begun

393
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,360
to fight.

394
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,700
I have never known no man

395
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,780
that has begun so many times

396
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,460
to fight.

397
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,600
They're never fighting.

398
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,320
It's like I've never realized how many times they started fighting.

399
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,620
And then it was over, but no man

400
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,860
can realize the effect of that

401
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,660
same fight upon

402
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,280
the young man.

403
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,020
No man knows how large

404
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,240
these beasts may be.

405
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,480
El Brau.

406
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,840
Is my microphone on?

407
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
I don't see any.

408
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,580
No, you're not with us any longer.

409
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,580
El Brau.

410
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,700
Because it's the end of the show.

411
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,060
There's only five minutes left.

412
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,180
Well, why don't we fill it up with merriment and laugh?

413
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,380
Is there just nothing left out there?

414
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,700
El Casa de 8484425.

415
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,680
What is happening on the radio?

416
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,560
There's no sound.

417
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,280
There's no space filling.

418
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Yeah, I don't hear anything, so it makes me kind of wonder.

419
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,700
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

420
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,880
Makes me scared.

421
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,840
There's a little bit of something.

422
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,420
Makes me scared when I don't have that psychological support.

423
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,200
He hears the music, but not the voices.

424
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,740
Well, put a little, uh, wow in your life and turn it up.

425
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,280
It exists.

426
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,520
And the words are nothing more than...

427
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,660
What's a caller doing at this hour?

428
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,580
Caller, can you hear me?

429
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

430
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,580
The adolescent years can be more than just a difficult phase

431
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,800
that a child is going through.

432
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,900
They can be dangerous years when many young people

433
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,520
drink too much, eat poorly, and even consider suicide.

434
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,700
The startling information was compiled

435
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,760
through a study of 11,000 eighth and tenth graders in 1987

436
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,580
from 217 public and private schools.

437
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,200
The study revealed a troubled teenage population

438
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,660
in which 42% of the girls and 25% of the boys

439
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,320
said they had seriously considered suicide.

440
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,740
Surprising numbers said they had smoked marijuana

441
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,600
and even more had five or more drinks on one occasion

442
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,860
in the previous two weeks.

443
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,660
And while most teens understood how AIDS is transmitted,

444
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,600
a majority of those surveyed thought that birth control pills

445
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,320
prevented transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases.

446
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,080
In fact, 2.5 million teens contract STDs each year.

447
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,560
With all this information, the study found that, in the first half of the year,

448
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,220
the most people who were involved in the AIDS study

449
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,220


450
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,000
And this is not surprising that the study found that many teens

451
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,380
either overindulge in fatty foods and sugary snacks

452
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,320
or use unsafe diets such as fasting, diet pills, and laxatives.

453
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,360
All of this together indicates that the problems facing adolescents in America

454
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,700
are just as serious as the problems facing adults,

455
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
and there are no easy answers or simple solutions.

456
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,520
I'm Laurie Johnson, and that's 60 Seconds.

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,620
They can be used as a cheap source of labor.

466
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,440
They can be taxed, kept in the home as pets.

467
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,440
Or, upon a whim, they might be unleashed and, well, hunted for sport.

468
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,500
Can I get a witness?

469
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,380
You know, I went over to my friend Rick Maverick's house the other day,

470
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,140
and I was feeling kind of down in the dumps.

471
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,820
I was kind of depressed that day.

472
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,140
And he took me out in his backyard,

473
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,740
and he showed me something that just kind of raised my spirits.

474
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,420
And it was just kind of neat that he would do something like that.

475
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,220
It just kind of filled me with a sense of warmth.

476
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,460
Out in his backyard, he had just spelled out,

477
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,680
Have a nice day in the skulls of normals he had decapitated.

478
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,180
And I just said, That's neat.

479
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,160
That's neat.

480
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,580
That's kind of neat.

481
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,120
Now, Mrs. Robinson and I took the local subgenius clinch Sunday school class

482
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,260
on a field trip last Sunday to one of these normal neighborhoods.

483
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,020
And let me tell you, it's every bit as bad as the pamphlet makes it out, okay?

484
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,940
Now, I'm not prejudiced or anything like that.

485
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,380
A lot of my best friends are normals.

486
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,680
I just think as long as they know their place.

487
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,120
Well, they reproduce like animals.

488
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,120
We're thinking.

489
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,880
We're thinking about moving soon.

490
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,520
Maybe even off-planet.

491
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
The cattle, ladies and gentlemen.

492
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,640
Now, what is the next theory of the Church of the Subgenius I'm going to discuss tonight?

493
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,040
The next theory is always more hate.

494
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,060
Hater.

495
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,560
I love it.

496
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,420
Don't you?

497
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:32,760
Don't you?

498
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,840
We're looking for people.

499
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,620
Love to hate, you know.

500
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:44,320
That was Janer Hypercletes live at the New Orleans World Science Fiction Convention

501
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,560
about a month ago.

502
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,320
Prior to that, you heard a couple of clips from the KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley.

503
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,840
Puzzling evidence.

504
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,040
Hal Robbins.

505
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,380
Philo Drummond, in this case.

506
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,600
Mobius Rex.

507
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,500
And Gary, a broke friend.

508
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,040
Oh, yes.

509
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:13,840
And, uh, well, you know, uh, well, I guess I oughta, I oughta go back to the, to the

510
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,540
talk shows, the talk show radio thing, so that I can then make a smooth transition to

511
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:27,580
the ironic, um, pardon me, Diet Coke there, the ironic, uh, Eberle Brothers tune, uh,

512
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,280
Jesus in a Red Dress or something like that.

513
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,160
So, here we go.

514
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,520
Oh, son.

515
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,640
Oh, bless you.

516
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,360
What?

517
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,900
And, uh, oh, Mark Mothersbaugh of, uh, Devo, uh, oh.

518
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,800
Devo, okay.

519
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,540
Yeah, we could, we could name some rock stars that are in town right now, but I, we're just

520
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,740
not too sure anymore.

521
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,260
Okay.

522
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,900
Gee, go ahead and go ahead.

523
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,620
It's clear to me, uh, Reverend Stang, you know, when you say Reverend, Reverend Stang,

524
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,700
and when you say Pastor, nay.

525
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,040
Nay, kid.

526
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,260
Uh, that conjures up, you know, we all have, I think, an idea of what that is.

527
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:13,080
Now, G. Gordon Gordon, you need to, uh, clue me in as to what role you play in the church.

528
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,300
Well, officially, I'm the, I am the mercenary of mercy, and I'm sort of a hit man for Bob.

529
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,940
And, uh, I...

530
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,080
We say this to ensure disbelief.

531
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,420
Yes.

532
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:22,760
Hmm.

533
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,140
And, uh, we, we don't mind admitting it, because just like the CIA and everything else in the

534
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,860
conspiracy, if you admit it, everybody doesn't believe it and thinks it's a big joke.

535
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,680
But there are certain things...

536
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:32,680


537
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,720
There are certain things that require work of a quasi-legal nature that, that Bob, Bob

538
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,940
has to have done for him.

539
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,880
As an example?

540
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,820
Well, certain people have to be removed in certain places.

541
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,920
Security has to be maintained in other places.

542
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,320
So...

543
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,580
Computer files have to be emptied.

544
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,040
Sometimes we have to change their minds, so to speak.

545
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,640
So you have your coat on for what reason now?

546
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,780
So you can, so your weapons don't show?

547
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,840
No, actually, it's cold in this studio, so I thought that, uh, normally, yes, normally,

548
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,020
uh, but we...

549
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,660
This being Dallas, uh, people frown on you.

550
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,380
You're carrying guns.

551
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Malaysia, it's no problem.

552
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,380
Unless you're, unless you've got presidents in the, in the, in the sites, then you're

553
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,680
okay.

554
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,100
Then you're okay.

555
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,420
Okay.

556
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,740
Uh, Reverend Naked, uh, Pastor Naked, forgive me.

557
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,620
Um, tell me what you think the appeal of this church is.

558
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,360
I mean, since you say it, it's different from what we know as, as the church.

559
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,440
I think that, just like any cult, when you're starting out, you have to promise something

560
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,100
for free.

561
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,280
You know, free money, free love, you know, something for nothing, and we do that more

562
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,560
than...

563
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,580
I think that's what the cults are right now.

564
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,880
In what way?

565
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,260
Well, you know, just by, just by...

566
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,360
Well, slack, slack is something that's in nothing.

567
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:38,680
Right.

568
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,440
Just by the, the doctrine of, of, uh, of total slack and, and the, uh, approach to slack,

569
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,340
uh, you know, what is slack?

570
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,860
A lot of, a lot of them ask you, well, it's, it's getting money for not working, and it's...

571
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,900
And where does this money come from?

572
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,920
From Bob.

573
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,840
Ah.

574
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,640
Money from Bob, friends.

575
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Money, oh, the, and someday money will rain from the flying saucers that shall come on

576
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,640
that great day.

577
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,220
X day, July 5th, 1998.

578
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,760
1998.

579
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:12,000
At 7 a.m., and all the subgeniuses will be ruptured up into the, into the, the pleasure

580
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,440
dimension for eternity, or depending on how much money they've spent on the church.

581
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:16,880
Uh-huh.

582
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,920
And those who, those who sat around and said, oh, well, I'll...

583
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,520
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

584
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,620
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

585
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:32,620


586
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:32,620


587
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,020
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

588
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,320
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

589
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,380
Take me, you saucer man, and take me off to space, and I stop.

590
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,340
Take me off to space, take my little hand, I take my needle in my belly, take a sample

591
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,360
of my skin.

592
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,040
I don't care as long as I can live with a saucer man.

593
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,940
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

594
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:58,940
Take me off to space, take me off to space, and take me off to space.

595
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:58,940


596
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:58,940


597
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,000
I love you sauce man, and take me off to space.

598
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,540
Come on down you saucer man, and take me off to space.

599
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:02,620


600
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:02,620


601
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:11,600
Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off

602
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,920
to space Take me off to space, take me off to space

603
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,780
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

604
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:29,940
Hey cow mutilators, let me join your crew Give me a night, you bet your life I'll cut

605
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,220
up cows for you. I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly

606
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:40,200
beast without a face. So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

607
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:49,100
Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off

608
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,340

00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,060
Come on down you saucer man and to me off to space

610
00:36:59,660 --> 00:36:59,920
Take me off to space

611
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,700
Come down you tiny robots with your little nipper claws

612
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,380
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws

613
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,840
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace

614
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,520
So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

615
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,000
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space

616
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,600
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

617
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,360
Take me off to space, take me off to space

618
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,900
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

619
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:47,280
Oh, friends, boy, if you only knew what an all-star lineup that was doing that song just then.

620
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,840
That was the song by Orton Neslow, known by other names, which you'll, Katie V, you'll see.

621
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,580
Um, Ahmed Fishmonger.

622
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,420
On, uh, background vocals.

623
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,820
And Donna Cossey.

624
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,820
And Pagan Kennedy.

625
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,980
Oh, yes.

626
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,780
Great subgeniuses up there in shadowed Arkham, Massachusetts.

627
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,240
Ha ha ha, yes, indeedy.

628
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,700
...and said, oh, well, I'll, I'll, I'll buy that one dollar pamphlet about Bob.

629
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,660
Or I'll, I'll have Bob tattooed on my head.

630
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,860
But I'm not gonna send in that twenty dollars for those magazines.

631
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,060
And those people will fry.

632
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,720
They shall fry along with the helpless pinks and mediocritans

633
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,440
who compose most of...

634
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,820
...what they call humanity.

635
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,380
Helpless pinks.

636
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,440
And also, Pastor Nick Head, you were going to, uh, say something?

637
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,060
Well, I'll say goodbye.

638
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,660
Oh.

639
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,900
I'd like to say...

640
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:38,840
...

641
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,920
...

642
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,380
Mother had on high heels

643
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,920
A red dress for Jesus

644
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,780
Out for a night on the town

645
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,460
Well, she did her best

646
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,900
To outdress the rest

647
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,860
Who found their way downtown

648
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,020
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven

649
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,960
What will Saint Peter say?

650
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven

651
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,440
God made her that way

652
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,120
Mother had on high heels

653
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,660
A red dress for Jesus

654
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,740
Dressed for a night on the town

655
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,440
...

656
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,160
...

657
00:39:50,160 --> 00:40:20,160


658
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,360
...

659
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,360


660
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,520
...

661
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,520


662
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,520


663
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,520


664
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,400
God made her that way

665
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:40,800
Oh, Lord, let her look that good in heaven

666
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,880
What will Saint Peter say?

667
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,300
Oh Lord, let her look that good in heaven

668
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,540
God made her that way

669
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,720
Good evening, brother. Welcome to a late hour program of Country Gospel Music.

670
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:27,100
My name is Brother John E., and it does me pride to introduce you to the sonic emanations of our little family group,

671
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,380
commonly known, and often confused with lesser musical deities, as the Eberle Brothers.

672
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,660
We'll be hearing several new songs along with our next single.

673
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,640
Yeah, that was the Eberle Brothers from John E. and his crazy brother.

674
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,760
And you'll be hearing more from them.

675
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,580
Next week, Jesus, A Red Dress for Jesus was the name of that song.

676
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:58,080
A lovely, lovely piece of bulldada there for you.

677
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,160
If you're ignorant and don't know what bulldada means, it's...

678
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,440
Let me get a drink.

679
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,840
Because this definition is long-winded.

680
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,700
Bulldada, the latest exploration into the world of advanced surrealistic,

681
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,020
more realism in which the mind is filled with dirt and lugs,

682
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,520
which trickle like mutilated centipedes down the sides of the cranium

683
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,800
to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets.

684
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,020
Ah, yes, thank you.

685
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,840
Oingo boingo.

686
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,880
If I stuck the

687
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,400
The bad o この

688
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,400


689
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,400


690
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,160
was waiting for beautiful werewolves to carve gives me a rhyming��こう

691
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,160


692
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,320
They're a fun time in the grenades, Christmas Eliebel says cross-otive,

693
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,480
He's the king, I guest, but produces the pardon and ends where Christ played the game!

694
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,920
This circo natural line and he's so beautiful because he was at all you every realarnya intriguing,

695
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,860
so you can understand his partners for when he was at all.

696
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:14,860


697
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:44,860
We'll be right back.

698
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,200
I imagine that you're with me on the winning side.

699
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,480
We don't ask too many questions on the winning side.

700
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,780
And I've got this strange sensation on the winning side.

701
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,060
I don't recognize the faces on the winning side.

702
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,260
And we all live here in cages.

703
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,160
Someone cried last night.

704
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
And it made a sound.

705
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,340
With my eyes closed tight.

706
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,760
I hear everything.

707
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,700
I can hear your voice.

708
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,620
When I kiss the ground.

709
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,760
When I kiss the ground.

710
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,420
And I'd like to know you better.

711
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,480
And I'd like to know your name.

712
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,720
I couldn't.

713
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,740
Show you something.

714
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,640
If you give me half a chance.

715
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,220
Cause I'm on the winning side.

716
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:51,380
Yeah!

717
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,240
On the winning side.

718
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,520
Yeah!

719
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,580


720
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,580


721
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,580


722
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:03,880
Yeah!

723
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:03,880


724
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,420
Yeah!

725
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,000
In the sleepless night, when the blindness comes

726
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:25,200
Washing over me like a giant wave

727
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,340
I'm a sandwich meat

728
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,520
Washing over me, I am proud to be

729
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,140
And I'd like to take you somewhere that you've never been before

730
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,860
And I feel so isolated

731
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,360
And I feel so all alone

732
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,900
Here on theakling side

733
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,520
And I feel so all alone

734
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,240
Here on theakling side

735
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,880
And I feel so all alone

736
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,540
Here on theakling side

737
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,260
And I feel so all alone

738
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,820
Here on theakling side

739
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,900
And I feel so all alone

740
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:10,900


741
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,120
And I feel so on alone

742
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,120


743
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,120


744
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,120


745
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,120


746
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,180
So all alone, yeah, I'm really sorry

747
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,440
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is, Mr. City

748
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,920
Mr. City, hey

749
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,300
Well, thanks, thanks

750
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,440
Yeah

751
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,080
Sure is nice to

752
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,440
To be here

753
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,680
In the city

754
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,000
Where the rate of everything is going up

755
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,780
Yeah, especially crime

756
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,580
Yeah, the property taxes

757
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,180
The high-rise buildings

758
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,580
Yeah, but mostly crime

759
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,740
And, yeah

760
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,300
Crime, yeah

761
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,580
Especially crime, that's on the rise

762
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,260
Pretty good

763
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,420
Yeah

764
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,600
But you'll be glad to know

765
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,560
That Mr. City

766
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,980
Is working it out

767
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,440
So that for every crook, there's a cop

768
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,040
That's that boy

769
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,000
You know, of course, where

770
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,020
Crime begins

771
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,900
Why don't you sing about it, son, huh?

772
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,720
Okay, I will

773
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,380
Yeah, thank you

774
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:31,920
I will

775
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,800
Keep your shirt on

776
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,260
I am

777
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,640
Crime

778
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,140
Yeah

779
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,100
Begins in the heart

780
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,800
Yes

781
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,680
So right

782
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:44,980
That's right

783
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,840
Yeah, here

784
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,960
Crime is a heart disease

785
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,480
Heart disease

786
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,380
And you can catch it

787
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,220
Yeah

788
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,000
So easy

789
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,880
How do you catch it?

790
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,780
You think you're innocent?

791
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,320
Yup, I'm innocent, your mother

792
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,920
Next thing you know, you're guilty

793
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,460
Oh

794
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,560
Guilty as sin

795
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,160
I am by my brother's keep

796
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,780
Oh, yeah?

797
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,760
And you know where sin begins.

798
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,680
Yeah, well, I was...

799
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,820
Yeah, I caught it from you.

800
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,520
But then...

801
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,320
You caught it from her.

802
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,200
Where did she catch it?

803
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,680
She caught it from him.

804
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,580
From him.

805
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,000
It all happens in gardens.

806
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,720
Oh, by the way, you don't mind if I eat this?

807
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,780
The apple.

808
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,520
Yes, sure is a crime.

809
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,460
I don't have more time.

810
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,260
Apple.

811
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,840
Yeah.

812
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,320
Sure is a crime.

813
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,480
The apple.

814
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,580
We don't have more time.

815
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,440
Sure is a crime.

816
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,520
We're gonna put you away.

817
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,000
Throw away the...

818
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,980
Sure is a crime.

819
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,060
Sure is a crime.

820
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,760
Like I said...

821
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:07,940
That's it.

822
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,880
And we don't have more time.

823
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,080
Sure is a crime.

824
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,140
We don't have more time.

825
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,040
Yeah.

826
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,940
We don't have more time.

827
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,840
Last time I saw the judge, I asked him what he meant when he'd say judge not.

828
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,580
He got so mad.

829
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,560
The judge did.

830
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,600
Sure is a crime.

831
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,160
He went into solitary.

832
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,740
He had to do it.

833
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,440
We don't have more time.

834
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,140
People in glass houses and all that sort of thing.

835
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,580
It's a crime.

836
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,480
It's a crime.

837
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,600
We don't have more time, friends.

838
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:59,480
That was Ken Nordean from the tape Triple Talk, which you can get from Snail Records

839
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,980
at 6106 North Kenmore Avenue in Chicago.

840
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,360
60660.

841
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,460
Oh, and this is Mondo Logic.

842
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,440
Fine.

843
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,340
.

844
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:14,500
.

845
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,740
.

846
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,140
.

847
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,700
.

848
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:17,720
.

849
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:17,720


850
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:17,800
.

851
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:17,800


852
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,000
.

853
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,160
.

854
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,160


855
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,800
.

856
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,020
.

857
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,120
.

858
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,260
This is the first time I've seen this, but I'm not sure what it is.

859
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,260


860
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,740
I'm not sure what it is.

861
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


862
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,320
I'm not sure what it is.

863
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,540
I'm not sure what it is.

864
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:32,540


865
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,240
I'm not sure what it is.

866
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,400
I'd like to say something.

867
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,420
Yes, you're good, you're good.

868
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,960
One of the reasons I think that the church is one of the fastest growing cults in the planet,

869
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,500
I would probably estimate, is that every...

870
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,420
Now, you just came from Brazil, did you tell me?

871
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:01,700
Yes, yes.

872
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,380
And there was the Church of the Subgenius there?

873
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,080
Oh, I am the Pope of Brazil and the Southern Hemisphere.

874
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:06,580
Okay.

875
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,440
And that we're not putting you on.

876
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:08,880
Okay.

877
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,120
I mean, none of this, everything we've said so far is true.

878
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,780
Or by what you would call true.

879
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,120
True.

880
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:23,480
Because the church accommodates anything in a person's belief system into our dogma.

881
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,220
Anything the subgenius spouts becomes instantly part of our church dogma.

882
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,160
You can believe, unlike most religions, you can believe anything you want in this religion.

883
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,460
You can believe in everything.

884
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,180
Okay.

885
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,400
Now, you were making a point.

886
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,640
Well, I think one of the points is that the reason why the Church of the Subgenius is so popular

887
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,980
is because most religions of every persuasion of the...

888
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,640
We call them the false churches.

889
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:50,580
...require a great deal of hard personal work, concentration, studying, deprivation.

890
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,360
The Church of the Subgenius does not require you to give up anything in your diet.

891
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,760
They do not require you to give up any of those vices that many other religions require you to cease and desist.

892
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,940
We're trying to find new ones.

893
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,100
Now, that's exactly right.

894
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:06,100
And we know that people don't have time to spend 17 years on a mountaintop meditating.

895
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,920
Is your work the work of the devil?

896
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,680
Let's lay it out right on the table right now in here.

897
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,020
Heck no.

898
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,180
As a matter of...

899
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:21,640
I wonder about that every now and then, but never for very long, because the devil doesn't operate that way.

900
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,540
We're way too open for the devil.

901
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,840
Basically, the devil has no sense of humor.

902
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,820
You know, if the devil is as tricky as he is...

903
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,180
There you go.

904
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,960
...then, you know, who would he be?

905
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,520
He wouldn't be imitating.

906
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,400
He sure wouldn't be imitating Bob, us.

907
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,820
I mean, what would that get him?

908
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,320
You're gonna find the devil in church!

909
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,680
Mm-hmm.

910
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,060
But not our church.

911
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:40,800
Okay.

912
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,840
Now, there's...

913
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,500
Now, now, I'm...

914
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,720
...think you saw a monster, but the human mind often plays strange tricks.

915
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,780
Like this one.

916
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,840
I won't do that again.

917
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,660
It's too hard.

918
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,180
Okay, it's too hard, he says.

919
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,600
We're backing down the show...

920
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,080
Hi, it's a rock.

921
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,360
Oh, hey, hey.

922
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:01,440
Ready to rock, I say?

923
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,880
We gotta do this.

924
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,080
Cat couldn't scratch it.

925
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,320
Yeah!

926
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:03,980
Yeah!

927
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,080


928
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:04,500
Yeah!

929
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,820
Oh, that's good.

930
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,220
Yeah!

931
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:07,720
Yeah!

932
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,220
Yeah!

933
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,440
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

934
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,860
Logic control fails humans.

935
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,080
Oh, different failure.

936
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,180
I'm an Eero J.

937
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:15,860
Successful.

938
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,600
Bada-lada, bada-lada, bada-ling-dong.

939
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,160
Dumb body, Mitch Cambo.

940
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,860
I took Miss Mousey on his knee.

941
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,440
Ring dumb-body, Mitch Cambo.

942
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,060
I pray Miss Mousey won't you marry me.

943
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,780
Ring dumb-body, Mitch Cambo.

944
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,140
Really does.

945
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,720
Bada-lada, bada-lada, bada-ling-dong.

946
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,220
I'm an angel, I'm an angel, I'm an angel.

947
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,520
Okay, well, I just wanted to get shots of you doing the show at some point.

948
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,500
If Dr. Lewis Rex will help us out.

949
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,520
Approaching the surface of the planet now.

950
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,500
Okay, well, I may have lost control of the show for a minute.

951
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,600
I mean, yeah, I'm down for it.

952
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,440
We'll get control of the show back any minute now.

953
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,960
Something ought to be done about these boys.

954
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,260
It's okay, Philo.

955
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,660
They don't take Jesus into their heart.

956
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,940
That's true.

957
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,940
That's ever so true, Phil.

958
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,420
You mustn't be like these wicked men.

959
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,340
Don't do it.

960
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:08,240
The Bible says that he who broadcasts late at night or early in the morning

961
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,000
shall bring upon his Lord the abomination of desolation.

962
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:17,420
And Jesus said we should always stick by our God.

963
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,640
And what we think is right, whatever the other fellow says.

964
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,040
That's the truth, friends.

965
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,240
And you can get some more of that abomination and desolation

966
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:35,440
by writing Bob at Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

967
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,100
75214.

968
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,600
Once again, free information.

969
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,460
You'll find out.

970
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,460
Just try.

971
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:43,980
Go ahead.

972
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,500
Try us.

973
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,000
Box 140306, Dallas, 75214.

974
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,420
Just address that to Bob.

975
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,900
And stay tuned for Robert.

976
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:57,860
Wisdom.

977
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,560
American Music Party.

978
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,860
Friends of audience elimination.

979
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:11,060
If you leave here alive, if you're good enough to survive the training in Dobstown,

980
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:17,200
if you can take that fishhook bone member down your throat

981
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,580
and tickle that bat just right, extract it without hurting the bat or yourself.

982
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,200
Then you can sit through a whole set.

983
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:29,760
Then you will no longer be maggots, you will no longer be pukes, you will be full fledged subgeniuses,

984
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,800
and you will be weapons, weapons for Bob, praying for slack.

985
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:34,860
Yeah.

986
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,100
Okay, who next?

987
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,760
Any questions?

988
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,220
Any other authors out there?

989
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,440
Disguise.

990
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,220
You never know.

991
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,260
So.

992
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,500
So what the hell?

993
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,660
I own a panel, okay?

994
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,580
So what is, so what is this Mr. Tales of Bob?

995
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,840
Three Fisted Tales.

996
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:00,680
Well, Three Fisted Tales of Bob, unlike the book of the subgenius, is actually a book of fiction, or partly fiction.

997
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,100
Some of it is fiction.

998
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,320
It's a book of metaphor.

999
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,940
A book of parable.

1000
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,740
A book of literature.

1001
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:07,940
Huh?

1002
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,020
We thought it was an instruction manual for de-beaking the squid.

1003
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,540
You think it's fiction, Doug.

1004
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,140
Well, it was originally, friends.

1005
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,160
Ah, God.

1006
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,800
We'll get back to that next week.

1007
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,360
That's a little panel discussion from New Orleans Science Fiction Convention.

1008
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,640
See, it's a thing.

1009
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,980
With, uh, who's that?

1010
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,180
Oh, it's Bob.

1011
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,660
Who is on that?

1012
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:33,180
Pope David N. Meyer, Nancy Regalia, John Shirley, Jane or Hypercliques, Brooks Carruthers, Sternodocs

1013
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,400
Keckhaver, and Willa Dobbs.

1014
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,760
Oh, uh, yeah.

1015
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,600
I couldn't see.

1016
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:39,580
There we go.

1017
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,440
And I sort of thought I looked.

1018
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:40,620
Wait a minute.

1019
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,720
I can't see it.

1020
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,460
No, no.

1021
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,400
I couldn't see it either.

1022
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,140
We have to get it down on the bottom deck so that Robert can take over with his tape.

1023
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,080
See, it's okay.

1024
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:48,440
There we go.

1025
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,360
There we go.

1026
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:49,520
There we go.

1027
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,660
And I sort of thought I looked down and I saw my own body.

1028
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,940
We have to put it back together ourselves.

1029
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,840
Yeah, might as well.

1030
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,200
I do that all the time.

1031
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,200
You're removed with the watch.

1032
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,660
No, you just look down, you see your arms, your legs, whatever, you know.

1033
00:57:59,680 --> 00:57:59,800
I do?

1034
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,280
Do you have mirrors on your seat?

1035
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,020
Goodbye.

1036
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,400
I don't need them.

1037
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,300
I can see my own body wherever I am.

1038
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,000
It's a power that I've possessed since very, very...

1039
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,780
Created.

1040
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,020
I simply look down along my own axis and I see all the parts of my body except...

1041
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,840
Radio.

1042
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,840
Then you can't see the inside of your own eye?

1043
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,700
Of course not.

1044
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,560
Don't press that button.

1045
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,860
Oh, don't use that button.

1046
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,460
That's on the show.

1047
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,080
Reluctant.

1048
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,320
It's only on one side.

1049
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,480
Randomize the show.

1050
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,580
What about the aerobic report?

1051
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,180
Deleted from the subgenius world of physical fitness.

1052
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:30,540
Or one of your speakers.

1053
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,220
Or one of your car doors.

1054
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,520
Today on...

1055
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:32,700
.
