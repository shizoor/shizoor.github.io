Let me make this perfectly clear to you.
The contents of this document are a matter of national security,
constituting an assault on the character of several important party members,
as well as a blatant violation of the Articles of Allegiance.
Any discussion of this document or its contents will be regarded at the very least as an act of sedition,
if not a willful act of treason.
Ah, yes, dear friends, speaking here from Stang Ranch in Stang County, Texas, with no studio.
This Hour of Slack was an easy one for me and a great change of pace
because it's all one fantastic old-school media barrage by the hard-working and talented Reverend Exister,
normally heard weekly on our sister subgenius show, The Ministry of Slack.
It's a collage using what would be to him older movies and music,
and it reminds me of our carefully arranged media barrages that we used to create on reel-to-reel tape
back in the 80s before Hour of Slack was born.
I don't think Bob or subgenius are mentioned at all, but it is pure subgenius.
It's 90 minutes long, so this is only part one of Ship of State by Reverend Exister.
You would do well to put it out of your mind.
My, what a peculiar place to have a party.
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't...
We're doing this.
After all, we haven't been invited.
And curiosity often leads to trouble.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!

We haven't had a party in this for a while.
We've tried all profits, and then murals, and then, of course, disease epigamy,
and all the other things.
We've tried all profits.
Time's coming.
One way or another.
And too many days to do without.
We've had to bring in a lot of bad stuff.
We've struggled to get a called-up.
The average increase in Schweetzel任 Maar,
as well the increase in masochism abroad
has grown more�
in terms of the radiation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're good to go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
...and went straight to killing Dodson Drew and called in the signer.
...and you, a crackhead, a crack...
...and you, a crackhead, a crack...
I don't think Dodson Drew said she put up a mic as the man attacked her.
She choked him.
She choked him out like, f***!
Dodson Drew says, you got a good look on your face.
...and again, now you turn to the next thing that happened.
And then in verse 12, he opens the sixth seal.
And behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as hair, the moon as blood, and stars of heaven fell.
And he sees heavenly signs.
What's the next thing that's described as a big intervention?
...and you, a crackhead, a crack...

...and you, what are you gonna call it again?

And this can't be sorely easy if you're a piece of shit.

Well, after this mission, there's nothing falling down the stairs.
Oh, Mr. Vantage!
Wait!
Please!
Wait!
Mr. Vantage!
Mr. Vantage!
Mr. Vantage!
Mr. Vantage!
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tire tread on Burr's stomach.
This city's afraid of me.
I've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters.
The gutters are full of blood.
When the drains finally scap over,
all the vermin will drown.
The accumulated filth will be gone.
The filth of all their sex and murder will foam up around their waists.
And all the whores and politicians will look up and shout,
Save us!
And all whisper,
No.
Now the whole world stands on the brink,
staring down into bloody hell.
All those intellectuals,
smooth talkers,
and all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say.
No.

Beneath me, this awful city,
it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.
And the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences.
What do you suggest we do about it?
Retribution.
Nobody knows who you are.
You can give it up.
You can try and have a normal life.
Is that what you have now?
A normal life?
When you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies,
past the human cockroaches talking about their heroin and child pornography,
do you really feel normal?
At least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.
No.
You're hiding in plain sight.
You should be aware that children who arrest children of ruination are Papa Orange.

Welcome to the archive.
You have selected historical file number 12-1.
In the beginning, there was man, and for a time, it was good.
But humanity's so-called civil societies soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.
Thus did man become the architect of his own.
His own demise.
But for a time, it was good.
Because if you don't understand that, it's going to be very difficult for you to understand this book.
The time when the Antichrist takes over, he's going to have full power.
When we read in Revelation chapter 13 and verse 1,
John in his vision said,
And I stood upon the sea.
And saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns.
Now, if you don't understand this, as I say, you won't crack the code.
You won't understand what he's talking about.
Can you picture what you'll be?
So in that person's name.
Desperately in need of some.
Strangers have been of desperate land.
So the leaders of man conceived of their moment.
But they did not believe that.
Because they were in the last war.
That's because in love God will work against both men and women.

If you don't understand this as I say, you won't crack the code.
You won't understand what he's talking about.
All the children are insane

Now, that brings up a real question.
Do we interpret the book of the Revelation literally or symbolically?
Which do you?

Shit.
I'm still only here.
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back there.
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up and there'd be nothing.
When I was here, I wanted to be there.
When I was there, all I could think of was getting back here.
I'm here a week now, getting softer.
Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.
I get weaker.
Each time I look back, I'm like,
I walked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like.


What we need right now is a clear message to the people of this country.
This message must be read in every newspaper,
heard on every radio scene, on every television.
This message must resound throughout the entire Italy.
I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.
I want everyone to remember why they need us.
I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.
I have all the authority to liberate in all ways possible.





God exists, and He is American.
Now, if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling
of ,,"It's not easy. He has sinned. He has been heraldoed."
religious terror at the concept, don't be alarmed.
That indicates only that you are still sane.
I am looking at the stars.
They're so far away, and their light
takes so long to reach us.
All we ever see of stars are their old photographs.
I prefer the stillness here.
I am tired of Earth, these people,
and tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.
This is not real.
And the real world lies somewhere else.
A typical mental delusion.
We get unbalanced kids like this all the time.
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people.
This world must have been a cold and alienating place
for a boy like that.
It's called denying reality.
It's, you know, just a self-defense.

A defense mechanism for those type of kids.
Well, he's in another world now.
Make no mistake about that.
Hey.
You a dreamer?
Haven't seen too many of you around lately.
Things have been tough lately for dreamers.
They say dreaming's dead, and no one does it anymore.
It's not dead, it's just it's been forgotten.
Removed from our language.
Nobody teaches it, so no one knows it exists.
The dreamers banished to obscurity.
I'm trying to change all that, and I hope you are too.
By dreaming every day.
Dreaming with our hands and dreaming with our minds.
Our planet is facing the greatest problems it's ever faced.
Ever.
So whatever you do, don't be bored.
This is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped to be alive.
And things are just starting.
I'm not going to lie.

I'm not going to lie.
I'm not going to lie.





Get out and learn and make a living.
They claim their labours are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated with horrors.
Perhaps the world is not made.
Perhaps nothing is made.
A clock without a craftsman.
It's too late. Always has been. Always will be. Too late.
Now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
We should not submit to dehumanization.
I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems of control.
Those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more.
I want freedom. That's what I want. And that's what Jason wants.
It's up to each and every one of us to turn with just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy.
And yes, the insecurities. Because that is the central mode of control.
Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
We have got to realize we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
Start challenging this corporate slave state.
The 21st century is going to be a new century.
Not the century of slavery. Not the century of lies, issues of no significance, of classism, statism, and all the rest of the modes of control.
It's going to be a new century.
It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal, Democrat, conservative, Republican.
It's all there to control you. Two sides of the same coin.
Two management teams bidding for control. The CEO job of slavery incorporated.
The truth is out there in front of you. But they lay out this buffet of lies.
I'm sick of it. And I'm not going to take a bite out of it. Do you got me?
Persistence is not futile. We're going to win this thing.
Humankind is too good. We're not a bunch of underachievers.
We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings.
We're going to get fired up about the real things. The things that matter.
Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.
Son, we live in a world that has walls and those walls have to be guarded.
Who's going to do it?
You. You curse my existence.
You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know.
That death, while tragic, probably saves lives.
And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties,
you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.
We use words like honor, code, loyalty.
We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something.
You use them as a punchline.
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps
under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it.
I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way.
Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post.
Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to.
I do not have much to say about it.

Thank you for being with us.


Well, I have some other news to tell you.
Things get confused out there.
Power, ideals, the old morality.
Because there's a conflict in every human heart between the rational and the irrational,
between good and evil.
And good does not always try.
Sometimes the dark side overcomes better angels of our nature.
Every man has got a breaking point.
You and I have.
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
That's my dream.
It's my nightmare.
Rolling, slithering along the edge of a straight razor.
And surviving.
But when they kill them, they must incinerate them.
Pig after pig.
Cow after cow.
Villain after villain.
Army after army.
And they call me an assassin.
What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?
A lion after lion.
You must be merciful to those who lie.
Those nabobs.
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Very obviously he is gone and safe.
Yes sir.
Very much so sir.

Who are you?
I hardly know, sir.
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see.
I do not see.
Explain yourself.
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir.
Because I'm not myself, you know.
I do not know.
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.
You?
Who are you?
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me...
Who you are first?
Why?
Oh, dear.
Everything is so confusing.
It is not?
Well, it is to me.
Why?
Well, I can't remember things as I used to, and...
Recite.
Hmm?
Oh, oh, oh, yes, sir.

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the Vox Populi, now vacant, who vanished.
However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin, vanguarding vile and vile.

That was too easy. What's the problem? Where's your concentration?
Maybe you regret taking the red pill?
Maybe.
It crosses everyone's mind at least once.
The wish to return to an ordinary life.
A carefree life in the country.
The life we had before knowing all this.
Even if that life was just an illusion.
It's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.
I've come to my senses. You should do the same.
I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth.
I've been waiting for you.


But I don't care about the truth anymore.
What's real doesn't matter.
What's important is how we live our lives.
Are you listening to me?
You know I'm right.
But we can't go back. We know the truth now.
We can forget all of this.
I know how.
Trust me.
Don't be afraid to look into your heart.
Say what you're really feeling.
Tell me.
I can't.
I don't know.
I can't.
Running away won't change anything.
You're the one that's running away.
Stop pretending.
Enough. I've had enough!
Ah!
There's no time.
You can forget about it. I won't look away from the truth. I can't.
That's too bad. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What's a deal? Got to make it to the next meal. Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel.
Mile after mile, stone after stone, you turn to speak that you're alone.
A million miles from home, you're on your own.
So let me in from the cold, turn my land into gold.
Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul and I think I'm going home.
I'm going home.
Be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this country don't want that.
I'm talking about the real owners now. The real owners. The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything.
They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations.
They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
They got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big media companies.
So they control just about all of the news and information you get in here.
They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying.
Lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want.
They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.
But I'll tell you what they don't want.
They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
I can't light my candlelight

They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw the whole world into a mess.

They don't want that.
You know what they want?
They want obedient workers.
Obedient workers.
People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
And now they're coming for your social security money.
They want your fucking retirement money.
They want it back.
So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
You know something? They'll get it.
They'll get it all if I'm considered related.
Cause they own this fucking place.
It's a big club.
You ain't in it.
You and I are not in the big club.
By the way, it's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe.
All day long beating you over the head with their medians telling you what to believe, what to think, and what to buy.
The table is tilted, folks.
The game is rigged.
Nobody seems to notice.
Nobody seems to care.
Good, honest, hard-working people.
White collar, blue collar, doesn't matter what color shirt you have on.
Good, honest, hard-working people continue.
These people of modest means continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don't give a fuck about them.
They don't give a fuck about you.
They don't give a fuck about you.
They don't care about you.
At all.
At all.
At all.
At all.
You know?
But nobody seems to notice.
Nobody seems to care.
That's what the owners count on.
The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white, and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes every day.
Because the owners in this country know the truth.
It's called the American dream.
But you have to be asleep to believe it.
The American Dream








You're my girl.
So vulnerable about everything, it makes me sad.
Yeah, all right, let's keep that money machine rolling.
Can you get me out of this?

Give me sanctuary.
I must find a place to hide.
A place for me to hide.
Can you find me?
Soft asylum.
I can't make it anymore.
The man is at the door.
This is the trip.
The best part.
I really like.
Yeah, proud to be a part of it.

All our lives we sweat and say.

We'll celebrate.

Everything must be this way.
Everything must be this way.

When deep space exploration rounds up,
it'll be the corporations that run it.
The IBM Stellar Sphere.
The Microsoft Galaxy.
The Planet Starbucks.
Like so many others,
I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder,
what kind of dining set defines me as a person?
Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections
were proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple,
hardworking indigenous peoples of the world.
Wherever.
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow Collection.
The things you own end up owning you.
The soft parade has now begun.

It's getting pretty hard to take my line of work, doing voices for radio commercials.
All that sleep.
In fact, it'll get more and more.
Every time I'm in the studio for a session, I feel just a little bit more hypocritical and guilty.
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image-enhancing products that in reality they little need nor they'll can afford.
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about the situation, the better my work is.
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.
I work four or five times a week.
I've even upped my rates.
I'm referring to you, hey.
I'm a half of ethics.
Thinking about it almost makes it worth thinking about it.
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a mouthpiece.
A conduit for someone else's concepts.
A faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in themselves.
Now what do you think?
Am I cutting my own throat here?
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?
An audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?
I don't know.
I can't answer that.
But I do know this.
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.
Wealth is in our vital national interest.
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.
All for the sake of peace.
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio,
Nothing you can buy will make you a better person.
A happier person.
A more spiritually connected person.
Can provide you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.
There are things that can never be turned into commodities and marketed.
And these things must be searched for within each of us individually.
Every child must be taught these principles.
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bomb you just passed on the street,
Then you too are part of that deception.
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields,
Or a slave in the office,
Or a slave in the big house on the hill.
You're still a slave, and at best, a middle management slave,
Prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor,
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself apart from the world, and that you will be free.
Of that inner circle.
Believe me, you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.
And you will be replaced the very next day, by yet another well groomed, well oiled,
Eaten, brown nosing, slave.
This year's model.
You're inceptable.
Recently, we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.
Now what do you think brought all that about?
Was it because you were a slave?


The communist system was flawed, and doomed to collapse from its very inception?
No. I don't think so.
I think it was because of the greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats,
Who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.
Interesting parallel, don't you think?
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic,
And insensitive bureaucrats charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,
All too often, we choose to emulate them.
To ape their postures, their uniforms, their speech patterns, their phraseology.
Stop acting like you're next on the docket, because you aren't.
Stop acting like everything is alright, because you need it.
Nothing is alright.
And if you can look around you, at the state of this country,
And not secretly admit to yourself, that you're a slave, then you're a slave.
But if you can see for yourself, that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs.
And that their dominance just happened to fall first.
You're truly...
Ignorant.
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate feast,
And who lovingly sing to in all of his patriotic songs.
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now, remember, you're working at least three of those days to pay off your accrued interest charges and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.
That's 3% of the time. The real inner circle is bleeding you dry. It's bleeding this country dry, not to mention what's left of this planet.
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders, we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance, oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.
Unlike any other, we have air-sea.
And why do we continue to do this?
Charity.
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?
Charity.
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?
Charity.
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art to the continuous...

...perpetration of this hoax?
...for avoidable power and interests of poverty, prison, addiction, and despair?
Freedom without structure is anarchy.
Structure without freedom is fascism.
What are you? An anarchist? Or a fascist?
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.
Convenience is not freedom.
And the government is not your friend.
Every child must be taught these principles until this threat to America is removed.
...to America is removed.
Three, two, one.
We're the United States.
We're the United States.
We're the United States.
We're the United States.

We are the United States.
We have a problem that calls for service.

Goddamit, an entire generation pumping gas,
waiting tables,
slaves with white collars.
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.
Working jobs we hate.
We buy shit that we don't need.
We're the middle children of history, man.
No purpose or place.
We have no great war.
No great depression.
Our great war is a spiritual war.
Our great depression is our lives.
Our great depression is our lives.
Those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
you now have senses.
And systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity.
How did this happen?
Who's to blame?
Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
They will be held accountable.
But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
I know why you did it.
I know you were afraid.
Who would you be?
War? Terror? Disease?
There were a myriad of problems that inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
Fear got the best of you.
Fairness, justice and freedom are more than words.
They are perspectives.
But if you see what I see.
If you feel as I feel.
And if you would seek as I seek.
Then I ask you to stand beside me.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has.
Use that freedom.
Make up your own mind.
It's like you come onto this planet with a crayon.
And you're like, I'm going to draw a crayon box.
Now you may get the 8 pack.
You may get the 16 pack.
But it's all in what you do with the crayons.
The colors that you're given.
And don't worry about drawing within the lines.
Or coloring outside the lines.
I say color outside the lines.
You know what I mean?
Color right off the page.
It might be true that there are 6 billion people in the world.
And counting.
Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference.
It makes a difference first of all in material terms.
It makes a difference to other people.
And it sets an example.
And in short, I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off.
And see ourselves as the victim of various forces.
It's always our decision who we are.
The realm of the real spirit.
The true artist.
The saint.
The philosopher.
Is rarely achieved.
Why so few?
Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress?
Rather this endless and futile addition of zeros.
No greater values have developed.
Hell, the Greeks, 3,000 years ago were just as advanced as we are.
So what are these barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential?
The answer to that can be found in another question.
And that's this.
Which is the most universal human characteristic?
Fear?
Or laziness?
Neglect?
Would be the real fun.
Ad bang qua bang, the boring above Text On –

And it makes you shine
The world would transform
Father, then show us how to be our towers
What are your shoulders?
Friend, then where and how will you be together?
or praysubgenius.com and everybody involved, even you.
For Sire, there is no more money.
We gotta get some money.
That dirty, perkish, hark-a-back, flackin', whartin',
fill-a-bunk-a-burton, perk-a-loom-a-burton,
dirtin' boss tonight.
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to subgenius.com front page,
or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own
subgeniuses.
The situation's worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference,
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that
blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs
if you don't pay dogs.
We also take checks and money orders to
subgeniusfoundation.com
and we'll send you a copy of the
P.O. Box 807
Glen Rose, Texas 76043
A thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
