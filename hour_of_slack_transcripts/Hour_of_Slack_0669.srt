00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:14,300
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slang, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:22,500
And fought tooth and nail by the conspiracy every step of the way.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:38,140
Ah, yes, dear friends, but you know, that's alright, because we need our dark warriors for certain nameless missions that the light warriors and the grey warriors cannot attend to.

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,780
But to hell with the rainbow warriors! This is war!

5
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,620
We can't have more than one majority sitting on the fence.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,460
Those rainbow warriors, all they ever do is worry.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
They just complain about making everything okay.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
For everybody.

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,680
They need to understand that only some things can be made perfect for some people.

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,500
And that's us.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,820
If, if and only if more people would just send one dollar to Bob.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,660
And we'll give that post office box at the end of the broadcast, dear friends.

13
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,620
Actually, that was Onan Canobite who typed that.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,160
And I think I sent him in onto a piece of email.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,660
Things have been confusing, though, folks.

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,600
Everything seems like it's back ass words.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:40,860
Now, I was brought up to understand that the Democrats were the ones that were supposed to be like the Chinese, you know, pinkos, like communists.

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,240
But it seems like it's all flipped around.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,980
Where now the Republicans are acting like red Chinese communists with this anti-privacy agenda.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,160
And we're talking about the nosedive, prudish, committee-driven bureaucracy of little old ladies who...

21
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,420
I guess they don't really believe in democracy.

22
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,660
After all, they believe in it as long as everything's going their way.

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,800
I don't know.

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,140
I guess the people must be wrong and shouldn't be trusted to make weighty decisions by themselves.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:21,980
So I personally believe that the rich, powerful people must decide for those lowlifes.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,940
ignoramuses. Perhaps Prince Bush or the other Prince Bush could make these

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:41,200
witty decisions. Friends, did you know that polar bears are left-handed?

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,840
That doesn't make any sense. I'm reading this obviously but they don't

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:57,200
have hands. It also says here the catfish has over 27,000 taste buds and that makes the catfish

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,720
ranked number one for the animal having the most taste buds. Congratulations to the mighty bottom

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:13,000
feeder, the catfish. The flea can jump 350 times its body length, which is like a human jumping

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,140
the length of a football field. And a cockroach will live nine days without its head before it

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:32,200
finally starves to death. Butterflies, on the other hand, taste with their feet and elephants are the

34
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,520
only animals that can't jump. Actually, I don't believe that. That doesn't sound right. But best

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,980
of all, a cat's urine glows up.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,420
Under a black light. I didn't know that. And an ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:04:00,280
And a pink's eye is bigger. My eye is bigger than my belly sometimes. Oh, and starfishes haven't got brains.

38
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:09,100
I guess they're sort of like what we subgeniuses are trying to be. Well, friends, that's it. I'm done.

39
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,900
That's all I had to say. And in fact, I've got to get out of here.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,580
I've got a... I hate to admit it. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've got a conspiracy freelance job with a deadline that I need to work on.

41
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:33,200
And normally I spend like a whole day putting this hour of slack together, but I'm going to have to cheat y'all by letting Einstein's Secret Orchestra pretty much...

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm going to edit this stuff, but it's... I don't know what else to do. I've got to do this quick. Oh, and I've got a couple of CDs that I think y'all may enjoy.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Yes, once again, we go into the swamp at WCSB Studios in Cleveland, which are much better studios than I have here in Tarzan's radio station.

44
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:04,080
And even though some of us have to call into that show by phone, it is nonetheless a better sounding show.

45
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,460
Praise show.

46
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,720
You've got the right faith. If your mind is working, if you're in one... You can do it. It can be done.

47
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,360
I believe you.

48
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,360
I've tried. I ain't gonna give up.

49
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,260
July 5th, 1999.

50
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,920
See you there, kitty.

51
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,880
See you around.

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,520
See you around.

53
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,540
The party will continue.

54
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,860
Why don't you fix your little problem and light this candle?

55
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,100
I found my hippie who looked for himself in the 60s and was tickled with what he found.

56
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
Well, we all need heroes.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,660
Yes, really.

58
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,800
Did you ever know that you're my hero, Dave?

59
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,620
Well, if you were the son of God, or if I was the son of God, that'd be great, but I'm afraid my connections aren't like that.

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,580
We are all the sons and daughters of God.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,580
Right.

62
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,880
That's the mistake. He got confused. That guy, you know...

63
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,280
He said that.

64
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,100
He thought he was the only one.

65
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,780
No, no. Actually, that was exactly his whole point.

66
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,700
That was his entire point.

67
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,660
And, in fact, the second thing that the Lord said was,

68
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,840
don't go around preaching my messages in Mark 17, 23.

69
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,980
Do not go around preaching my message because they won't get it.

70
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,240
Don't tell the people about this because they'll get it all wrong

71
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,900
and start sucking the...

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
...finger instead of going where it points.

73
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,560
And the next thing you know, it'll be just as bad as the Pharisees and the Romans.

74
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,020
Duh!

75
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,440
And that was when the religion of duh really began

76
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,660
because he pulled out a picture of G. Gordon Gordon and everybody looked at it and went, duh.

77
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm lonely. I'm hurting.

78
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,880
Oh, hi. Oh, I didn't know I could do this.

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,940
Yeah, well, we have no listeners, so don't worry about it, bitch.

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,160
Okay, let's see.

81
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,020
Basically, a year ago, my husband left.

82
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,820
Come to find out...

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
He was living with another woman.

84
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,180
Had to, um...

85
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,540
Hire a detective to find out.

86
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:19,960
Find out.

87
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,940
You hired a detective?

88
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,800
Went through denial.

89
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,260
Very angry.

90
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,120
And now I'm at the point where I really, truly want to forgive.

91
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,120
God, you hired a...

92
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,160
You hired a private detective to follow the guy around because he was sleeping out on you?

93
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,720
Well, you know, maybe you should have put out a little more for him, you know?

94
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,360
What the hell?

95
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,620
Go have a talk with...

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Johnny over there in that little red booth.

97
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,540
I have some days that I just, I lash out at him.

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,440
When I think that he's very involved with the kids.

99
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,920
Okay, okay. Well, have you tried bribing him with a prairie squid?

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,840
You know, uh, putting, you know, you know where to put it.

101
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,480
Yes.

102
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,320
Okay.

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,940
And, and I tried everything they, everything for him to stay, but...

104
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,740
He made a point that he definitely doesn't want to stay.

105
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,880
Okay, well, why do you want to forgive this bastard?

106
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,300
Um, trying to do it God's way.

107
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,980
The, the right way.

108
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,300
Well, maybe you should just let go of him and let him go sleep with all the downtown crack whores.

109
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,620
Get AIDS and die and, and, uh, who cares?

110
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Because it's 1999, you know?

111
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,960
Revelations, baby.

112
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,920
You know?

113
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,980
Son of a bitch will be rotten in hell by a year from now.

114
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,180
Thank you, Dr. Michael Kemp.

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:42,940
Bye-bye.

116
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,100
It's my particular pervertcy

117
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,740
Beeping on ladies and little men

118
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,620
You won't have privacy in my can

119
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,060
Hail, hail VHS

120
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,900
Technology looking up your dress

121
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,540
Tape, tape naked girls

122
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,460
My hidden cameras out of this world

123
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,060
Maybe I'll sell them at my shows

124
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,440
America's Dirtiest Videos

125
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,600
Hey, hey you!

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,600
Who the hell are you taking movies of me and the John?

127
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,000
Huh?

128
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,020
Why, I'm Bob Saget.

129
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,060
You're a pervert!

130
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,180
I'm calling the police.

131
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,860
No, no, no, wait.

132
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,780
Now, now, hold on, baby.

133
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,200
Now, now, what if I said I was an important black filmmaker like Spike Lee?

134
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,500
Pervert! You're, you're a pervert!

135
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,100
Now, now, wait a minute.

136
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,700
Does, does he?

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,060
Hold on.

138
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Hold on, little lady.

139
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
I didn't do nothing.

140
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Come on now.

141
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, come on now.

142
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,960
If they pass the test and if they fly a certain amount of time, or a number of hours, they will be given a ticket.

143
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:42,960


144
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,020
They will be given a license to fly alone.

145
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,240
Now, God is our co-pilot.

146
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,540
He never leaves us alone to fly over a designated journey.

147
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,500
He is there all the time to show us what to do and which way to go.

148
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,380
If we seek him at all times for our guidance, we will never lose our way.

149
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,760
God is our co-pilot on the journey of life.

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,140
Sometimes on a long journey, the co-pilot will help the pilot to fly the plane.

151
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,940
If the pilot is not there, he will not be able to fly.

152
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,500
If the pilot gets tired, the co-pilot may relieve him for a while and allow the pilot to rest.

153
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,380
So it is with our God.

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:29,040
We can get weary sometimes when we are flying to our destination.

155
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,900
Who is a true believer and who is not a true believer?

156
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,400
I don't see much difference between smoking demons and smoking souls.

157
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,820
Yeah, when you think about it, doesn't a demon have a little tiny soul of its own, too?

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,880
Oh, a demon is a soul.

159
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:42,940


160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,980
It's sort of an alien soul, though, compared to a human or a subgenius soul.

161
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,140
Is he about to rub us the wrong way just because of what it is or something?

162
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
Well, they're monsters, you know.

163
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,940
They're like monster souls.

164
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,300
And plus, since they're not...

165
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,840
Demons have never been corporal for the most part.

166
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,560
I mean, some of them are retired human souls, I guess.

167
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
It got real weird.

168
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,740
But most of them, I think, are just born as demon souls on the other side.

169
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,260
They never are anything but demons.

170
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,160
You know?

171
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,800
It's like saying demons are bad.

172
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,940
It's sort of like saying, well, a lion is a bad animal because he eats a zebra.

173
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,840
No, a Tyrannosaurus is bad because he eats a brontosaurus.

174
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,960
A brontosaurus is nice because he eats vegetables.

175
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,800
That's, you know, that's ridiculous.

176
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,380
Angels are nice because they, you know, eat vegetables.

177
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,660
And demons are bad because they eat angels.

178
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,740
Hey, it's the natural way.

179
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,300
It's like God allowed Satan to exist.

180
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,400
He's Jesus' older brother.

181
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,460
Yeah, that's... yeah.

182
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,560
You know?

183
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,220
He's the son of the dwarf in the web.

184
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,100
I always liked stealing each other's shirts and stuff like that.

185
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,660
Well, all these people are like going, oh, we have to fight Satan.

186
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,440
Well, who... wait a minute.

187
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,140
You mean you're better... you're going to be better at fighting Satan than God?

188
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,380
Okay, old lady.

189
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,340
I wouldn't want to do that personally.

190
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,200
I wouldn't want to try and fight God or Satan because, you know,

191
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,620
like when they put Prometheus on the rock and they were trying to eat his liver and stuff,

192
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,720
I always remembered that, and that's worse than prison.

193
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,480
Well, it's like in think... in think of some of the battles you would like.

194
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,800
Like would... if you had Batman against Satan, who would win?

195
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,680
Well, probably Satan because he has magic.

196
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,140
Yeah, but Batman would probably not lose, you know.

197
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,280
But if you had Superman against Satan, you know, that's different.

198
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,800
I mean, Satan... Superman's not supernatural, but he's from the planet Krypton.

199
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,220
From her home between stirs on the stove,

200
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,020
suburban homemaker Joyce Randen sells...

201
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,060
Forgive me, Mom.

202
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,000
Sacks?

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,180
Joyce wants all married folks to play a little game of dress-up.

204
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,980
I have the fire that kills.

205
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,940
I'm from the planet Earth.

206
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,080
What's wrong?

207
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,620
I want you to take a visual record of this.

208
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,320
We found it in the patching cells. We killed it.

209
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,860
Thank you for being conscientious.

210
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,440
A visual record is being taken and filed with the Department of Biological Flow.

211
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,180
Everybody's a freak.

212
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,780
They're the freak in everybody.

213
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,880
And then the next thing you know, your freak wants the car keys.

214
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,200
And the next thing you know, your freak's been arrested for drunken disorder.

215
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,420
But the only thing that matters is the collective freak.

216
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,040
Then the freak. Then it's time for college tuition for the freak.

217
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,520
The monster you created, which has long since turned against you.

218
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,280
Well, they've created a freak.

219
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,740
Beware of Satan's claws.

220
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:53,560
I don't want to hear any nonsense about God, especially from you intolerant, judgmental, hypocritical Christians.

221
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
You are a true believer.

222
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,060
Blessings of the state.

223
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Blessings of the masses.

224
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,780
Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man.

225
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,760
By the masses, for the masses.

226
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,440
Let us be thankful we have commerce.

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,060
Buy more. Buy more now.

228
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,060
And that is the old confluence of the old wave particle theory with the old...

229
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,400
Sound of night.

230
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,400
...the old wave theory. So there you go.

231
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,380
All matter. All matter breaks down when it basically comes down to it.

232
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,000
All matter breaks down to...

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,620
...the wiggles and the twiggles.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,960
The wiggly world and everything. They're just patterns.

235
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,860
Yeah, exactly.

236
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,160
Why do they want to break down poor old Tex Clinton for vibrating so hard under the oval orifice and that stuff?

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,280
Because...

238
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,440
...and Bomberang at the same time.

239
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,720
It is just...

240
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,140
Well, because that...the show is beginning to lose viewers.

241
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's go to Dallas. On the ticket. Pete.

242
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,840
Hey.

243
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,360
Hey.

244
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,360
How you doing?

245
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,060
What's up, Pete?

246
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,280
Oh, just enjoying the program.

247
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,700
Oh, I appreciate that. Thank you.

248
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,980
Sure. A heck of a lot of commercials, though.

249
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,260
Yeah, not too many commercials.

250
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,900
Boy...

251
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm just going six hours live. Forget the commercials. No breaks. I'm just going to talk for six or eight hours.

252
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:12,660
Oh, it's great.

253
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Somebody's got to pay the bills.

254
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,160
Sure will be great.

255
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,800
They got to pay my salary, you know? You know how it is.

256
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:17,840
Oh, yeah.

257
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,720
You know how it is, don't you?

258
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,860
It'd be like...it wouldn't be the same, though. It'd be like watching a football game without the beer commercials.

259
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,420
We don't have too many...

260
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:25,480
You know?

261
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,160
That's what this show is lacking in, beer. We don't have too many beer commercials on this network.

262
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,060
Well, where would America be without sports, tobacco, and beer?

263
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,480
Mm.

264
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,240
I don't know. Where would baseball be without sports?

265
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,340
I don't know.

266
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,340


267
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,580
You know, baseball is out of union.

268
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,720
Playing?

269
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:49,700
Oh, yes. Well, my comment's about the Dallas Stars. I'll tell you what. I love, I love, I love to go to their games.

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,680
But I tell you what, lately they've been wimping out.

271
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,760
Well, I...

272
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,480
The last couple games I went to, you know, there just wasn't enough.

273
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,780
Well, they lost their last couple of games after winning five in a row.

274
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,220
For nothing else, I would not call Bob Ganey and company a playoff team.

275
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,220


276
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,480
I mean, they're just a bunch of wimps. I mean, that is one thing they will never be accused of.

277
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,360
Oh, no. Yeah, they're not wimps.

278
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,300
I love...

279
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,840
They've got...

280
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,060
I love the blood and guts.

281
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,280
Right. And that's how they're gonna win hockey teams. Their bullies are gonna beat up your bullies.

282
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,820
Boy, it's like, to me, watching it's like getting ready to eat some raw meat.

283
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,760
Yeah, I rub my hands together, I can taste the blood. Yeah. Give me the blood. Yeah.

284
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,100
You're awfully violent.

285
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,920
I love it. I love it.

286
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,060
You sound like my family getting ready to sit down for Thanksgiving.

287
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:44,760
I like to see skulls get cracked and teeth flying and blood spurting everywhere. Woo! Woo-hoo!

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,240
You obviously like Steven Seagal movies as well.

289
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, yeah! Black Tie! Yeah! Black Tie, White Noise, baby. Yeah!

290
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,560
Oh, my. Someone...

291
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,140
Woo-hoo!

292
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,940
All right. That was a very excited Pete from Dallas.

293
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,020
No, that was actually Brother Russell from his CD.

294
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,980
It's a CD of prank calls called Melba Comes Alive.

295
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,620
And we may play some of the Melba calls. I've played some of this before.

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:34,300
By the way, you can reach Brother Russell or Melba with information at Vinyl Communications, P.O. Box 8623 Chula Vista, California, 91912.

297
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,040
Chula Vista, California, 91912.

298
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,040


299
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,040


300
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,040


301
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,760
And we are listening to Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing music in the background.

302
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:51,120
And any second now, Lonesome Cowboy Dave is going to call in and join Cantor Chaz Smith.

303
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,620
And I guess his wife, Michelle, may have been there.

304
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,740
She's the one playing the violin.

305
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,900
And I don't know what else happens.

306
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,080
Let's join and tune in.

307
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,260
And see.

308
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,600
Hello.

309
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,220
Hello.

310
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,560
Sire, I don't know. I don't want that on my leg. I don't want any of that smeared on me at all.

311
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,220
Your timing is impeccable.

312
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,420
I've tried to be a warrior, but...

313
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,900
The tape just ended.

314
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,040
You know, I live in that tradition anyway. If not somewhere near it, you know, at least rent someplace nearby.

315
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,220
Hello? Can you hear me?

316
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,840
Yeah.

317
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh, man, I can hear you as if you were standing somewhere...

318
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,280
Did you log on to DesertFox.com tonight?

319
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,220
You did?

320
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,940
You can download, yeah, footage from the bombs going off.

321
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,100
Can you download them into your moon pants?

322
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,900
Yeah.

323
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,560
Directly?

324
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,380
And they have these really cute kind of Christmas borders.

325
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,340
Aww.

326
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,620
Yeah, these little Christmassy kind of borders.

327
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,160
And somebody's gone ahead and superimposed Santa Claus dropping the bombs.

328
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,460
Well, I know this buddy who said he was going to do some art cards.

329
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,040
And he was going to have all the body bags.

330
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,120
And they were going to have little wreaths around them, like with the mistletoes.

331
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,980
But I don't think anybody would want to kiss any of them guys after they got, you know, a thousand pounds of shard going through their hen wards.

332
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,160
Yeah, really.

333
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,840
But I don't know. It's a pretty sad Christmas present.

334
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,820
And Ramadan present. And Chet's fan present for everybody around here in Northeastern...

335
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,420
Kwanzaa.

336
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,520
Kwanzaa?

337
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,800
Kwanzaa present, yeah. They have many Kwanzaa presents.

338
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,440
Did you?

339
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,980
No.

340
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,680
I got one of them one-string ukuleles that can put you in another dimension.

341
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,500
Oh, man. I gotta be able to play this and this and this.

342
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,140
You didn't hear that jam at all, did you?

343
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,780
No, all I heard was...

344
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,280
You know, I got a jugger.

345
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,040
You got that much, though?

346
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,060
No.

347
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,940
No?

348
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,600
No, I couldn't hear anything.

349
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,420
It sounded like traffic control signals.

350
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,320
Like a guy was going, you know, talking about different runways and the...

351
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,440
Yeah.

352
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,740
...how the moon pants were lined up.

353
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,660
Yeah.

354
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,700
I just saw that a bunch of them are taking off tonight. They're heading right straight

355
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,940
for Baghdad, daddy-o.

356
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,520
Baghdad-io.

357
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,040
Yeah. It's gonna be pretty bad, I guess.

358
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,240
Baghdad-io.

359
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,000
They're gonna drop actual human beings that are microbes, and they're gonna slip it down

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
like slimy little snakes, and they're gonna actually try and infiltrate the offices of,

361
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,360
um, what's his name, Slatom... you know, the guy that we hate so much because someone

362
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,880
said it.

363
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,280
Slatom-o.

364
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,300
Slatom-o.

365
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,560
Slatom-o.

366
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,880
He and Slatom-o.

367
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,400


368
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,080
And this makes it sort of impossible.

369
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,160
Uh, you know, as an Eagle once said, you know, unlike the

370
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,060
foul food on the wall that was never a thing to use, you should be careful.

371
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,240
Yeah.

372
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,060
Like a chicken.

373
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,480
By a chicken.

374
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,940
descendants of the dinosaurs are the birds okay well that was a gigantic long period of stasis

375
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,140
and it may have been really nothing more than the equivalent of the shadow of an elder god

376
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:14,500
stepping over us briefly right there are fossils that thing's shadow and his just he didn't even

377
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,960
notice us there he just walked by and as a shadow passed over that halted all evolution on earth

378
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,700
if you were to look at time it's like a one minute movie since the beginning of time

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,020
yeah you know part during which you can actually visibly see an elder god's shadow if you watch the

380
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,680
film you know there were dragonflies about as big as storks back then right wasn't there an interim

381
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,000
period they said there were fossilized things found somewhere in gary indiana and some shelf

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,440
rock that showed one of these places seen half mammalian half rat pile and beans actually wearing

383
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,060
a physical uh what do they call those uh fishnet stockades and then the negligence and stuff like

384
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,240
that they're dressed up and ready to go out

385
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,600
at the same time as dinosaurs so yeah yeah then it's true that everyone's footsteps are actually

386
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,640
walking in their own footsteps on the moon man and bob bob of course was also walking them because

387
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,100
you can see that there's that one footprint of the modern shoe and that ancient rock there

388
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,720
and you know to i thought it was only four tobes to paraphrase pope flores of the pope of chicago

389
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:24,680
they in schools they teach you where evolutionists came from and they teach you where creationists

390
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,740
came from but do they ever say anything about where subgeniuses came from of course not of course not

391
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,000
you expect that kind of abuse you know when you when you have a situation like we do here where

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,020
there's so few of us and so many of them and they just you know they want to serve put an end to us

393
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,780
in many different ways you know that we can't even describe here you know sometimes they not only want

394
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,460
to knock off the lights they want to remove the little antennae they want to take out the bottom

395
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,120
stuffers they want to remove the whole lower organism that breathes on its own

396
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:02,460
you know jesus so anyway dave there we were giant you know toads about the size of with good

397
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,380
hair touch toads about the size of poodles we were with good hair just just trying to just barely

398
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,380
learning how to use our lungs yep the lungs were the coolest thing going then oh they sure were man

399
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:20,300
i love man i remember my first air that was great wasn't it i really i mean it made me sick it made

400
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,400
me sick as a dog but you know everybody was doing it i remember my first

401
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,740
life anybody anybody who's cool yeah so there we were rather sitting on the shore out of the water

402
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,820
totally out of the water completely out of the only reason you go in the water was to have sex

403
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:42,460
or lay eggs yeah that was all we talked my feet and my stomach were kind of moist you know some

404
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,140
kind of a strange being you were ugly as hell thanks but you know anyway so one of those

405
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,680
dork-sized dragonflies flew by and i remember sticking out my tongue and saying i'm not going to

406
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,880
snap it and snapping it oh man your tongue was like an i'm about as big as an ironing board

407
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,720
yep sure was do you remember golf or tennis i wish i still had that thing still i don't know

408
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,420
what happened to that but but anyway i grabbed the dragonfly i dragged it into my mouth and i'm

409
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:19,940
just chewing on it went out of the corner of my eye well you know that was when we first realized

410
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,680
they were here all along watching us and they started to show up and they started to show up

411
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,720
and they started to show us the film strips and yeah not only that but they were laughing at it

412
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,520
yeah do you remember the one guy who had the what you call it a one-way mirror and he was uh

413
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,420
i don't know it was like he was trying to get the people to roll all of us to roll the one stone back

414
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,800
up and down the hill and the one-way mirror we we gave it a name or something like that

415
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:51,940
it was the the guy you know it was something that was a lot lighter than that toad stuff man

416
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,580
you're thinking of uh we're talking about

417
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,600
the toads with nurse the first nearsighted caveman appeared no this is when dinosaurs and and toads

418
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,820
with nice haircuts both walked in the same footsteps of bob time man that you alluded

419
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,260
to yourself in your previous utterance man yeah if i said that then pick up on it yeah

420
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,880
that was when we first created metaphors don't you remember that yeah archie and the swingers

421
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,680
all the old language you know with the with the cataclysm through sonic and we had to reinvent

422
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,640
language of course through sonic imitation and that was hard to make a metaphor with

423
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,420
the dolphins you know when you were trying to say zzz was like a and is it you know making

424
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,420
some you know and they both sound the metaphors that the dolphins used when they were trying

425
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,000
to teach us didn't make any sense because they were all based on echo sonic locations

426
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,840
right you know which by then we we were that makes a whole so far away from that evolution

427
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,880
at that point right they stick your head out of the water and go and we're supposed to

428
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,960
you know see a shark uh you know this cool little shark movie in our heads it's just

429
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,680
you know all we see is this ugly fish going man man man man man man man man man man man

430
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:54,680


431
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,200
man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man

432
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,000
man yeah so we should harpoon it drag it out and eat it it took us a long time to figure

433
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,580
that out didn't it well it didn't really take that long after you've been harpooned and

434
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,260
eaten a few times yes and that is why i don't blame our dolphin masters for having no mercy

435
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:16,540
on us i'm going to turn you traitors into overlord flippard now overlord flipka controls

436
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,880
all the reincarnated memories you make fun of him now go ahead make fun yeah oh my god

437
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,020
you see some of these things and you'll never see them again and you'll never see another

438
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,680
one and i think they're going to be funny okay well we'll see you soon and it's a lot of

439
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,900
The asteroid flipper contains all the archetypical reincarnation memories each one of you guys have all had since he was a little bit of hydrogen.

440
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,800
And you know it, see?

441
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,660
So you're just making fun of him.

442
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,180
But he carries all the vast memories of everybody in the ocean of his big, fat brain.

443
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,140
And you know it.

444
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,020
Well, we got to start cutting out of here.

445
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,820
So can we all get an agreement on things or something here?

446
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,500
Oh, we are in agreement.

447
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,680
Leave on a nice note.

448
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,580
We are all in agreement.

449
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,460
Sex with dolphins will be good.

450
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,860
Get off the Earth now because you want to have sex with it.

451
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,700
And also, what else was there?

452
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,140
Was there anything else?

453
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,860
Oh, the glasses.

454
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,540
The glasses.

455
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,860
Don't throw the glasses away.

456
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,280
Yeah, keep those things, man.

457
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,660
Don't throw the glasses away.

458
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,060
And if you find them.

459
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,460
You might need them someday.

460
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:06,860
If you find them.

461
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,560
Yeah, really.

462
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,660
Like, you know, Viagra.

463
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,580
Well, it's more than Viagra.

464
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,000
It'll help you find parts, you know, of any kind.

465
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,880
Of your spaceship.

466
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,480
Yeah.

467
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,720
You know, you'll be pointing the way if you're a male.

468
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,740
And it'll be any kind of part you need for either pleasure in this dimension or another, I suppose.

469
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,660
Hey, I think we all agree that.

470
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,420
By golly, it's great to be an American and live in a, in a, in a, in the, in the, gosh darn it,

471
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:38,240
one of the most highly advanced technological societies, despite the, the bizarre, mysterious, high incidence of cancer.

472
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,620
Exactly.

473
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,600
It's, it's, it's really.

474
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,260
Praise Bob.

475
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
We know technology is beautiful.

476
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,580
It's a tetra-traumational gazebo crotocon.

477
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,920
The mama luge unknown to every schoolboy scandler, be he Matty Markey, Luke Yeager, John Adonk,

478
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,460
all pre-kinetically predisposed and predetermined, assures herself.

479
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,780
Tits, hen to paper, and their scribing scrawled on eggs.

480
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,280
Seven, five, two, one, four.

481
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,840
Dallas, Texas.

482
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,160
Yeah.

483
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,960
What's that?

484
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,580
The church.

485
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,340
It's a number, all right.

486
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,900
P.O. Box.

487
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,180
One, four, oh, three, oh, six.

488
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,180
Dallas, Texas.

489
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,280
Seven, five, three.

490
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,960
No, no.

491
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,060
Seven, five, no, two.

492
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,200
God, can you believe that?

493
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,040
He listened to that.

494
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,320
I mean, he did that from memory.

495
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,360
Dallas, Texas.

496
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,780
Seven, five, three, oh, six.

497
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,220
Okay, how's this?

498
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,760
Hey, wait, can you steer your?

499
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,360
P.O. Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio, 44181.

500
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,040
You got it.

501
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,040
I did that from memory.

502
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,900
We gotta go.

503
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,660
Praise Bob.

504
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,240
We'll see y'all later.

505
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,800
It's become very apparent that no one can live in a Sheldsworth Manor with the old man gone.

506
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,860
See it next day.

507
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,220
The doddering old butler who claimed that he could raise beans from the dead,

508
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,220
make mother talk the way she used to,

509
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,240
and things like that.

510
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,100
Goodbye, Dad.

511
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,980
He's getting sleepier and sleepier.

512
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,560
I gotta go in the tuna can now, Mom.

513
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,760
Bye, my little tiger.

514
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Keep your little unicorn everywhere.

515
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,420
Say goodnight to that, sir.

516
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,200
Keep your hat on tight.

517
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,680
You're back to the wind.

518
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,020
And you're stuck in the saddle.

519
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,440
I want my planet back.

520
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,240
The days when his heart was as big as the Texas moon.

521
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,620
I'm so sorry.

522
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,160
I want my planet back.

523
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,160
I broke your heart.

524
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,440
I want my planet back.

525
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,860
I want my planet back.

526
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,660
Please, don't leave my side.

527
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:37,040
Take me home, you silly boy.

528
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,620
Cause I'm still in love with you.

529
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,600
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore.

530
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,000
Goodbye.

531
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,860
Hal?

532
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,340
Hal?

533
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,120
Hal!

534
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,780
In talking to the computer, one gets the sense that he is capable of emotional responses.

535
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,800
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?

536
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,060
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.

537
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,440
But as to whether or not he actually has genuine emotions, I really don't know.

538
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,440


539
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,600
has real feelings is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.

540
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,180
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

541
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,440
Dave, I really think I'm entitled to an answer.

542
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,140
You work.

543
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,580
You don't know what it means.

544
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:05,920
You live.

545
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,440
You don't follow your dreams.

546
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,700
You feel.

547
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,080
You don't fall to your knees.

548
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,660
You love.

549
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,800
But you don't love me.

550
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm tired of waiting for my own end.

551
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,420


552
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm tired of waiting for my time to come.

553
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,460
I'm tired of playing your games.

554
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm tired of watching my life slip away.

555
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm tired of waiting.

556
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,060
It's hot.

557
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,360
But the next day you're cold.

558
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,720
You're green.

559
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,020
You never go for the gold.

560
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,540
You're young.

561
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,820
You turn around, you'll be old.

562
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,160
You love.

563
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
But you don't look at my soul.

564
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,840
I'm tired of waiting for my time to come.

565
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm tired of playing your games.

566
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm tired of watching my life slip away.

567
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,740
I live it up long enough.

Yes, dear friends.

Mary McGuire is that singer's name.

Dolly.

615
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,360
I met her and watched her do a show in Chicago

616
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,560
about three years ago.

617
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,840
Man, what a babe.

618
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,340
Anyway, Cosmic Dolly.

Dave, stop.

636
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,920
Well, guess what?

637
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,560
Huh?

638
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,260
Speaking of how, I had a dream the other night that the princess We Are Doe,

639
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,940
I was in a dream, and she said, come on in this room in here.

640
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,260
It's cool having a party, it's an X-Day party.

641
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,880
And I said, okay, I'm going to the X-Day party and stuff,

642
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,400
and I went in there, and there was like these big mushroom clouds everywhere,

643
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,200
you know what I mean?

644
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,580
Mushroom clouds?

645
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,340
Inside?

646
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,820
Yeah.

647
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,500
I got a real sick dream in the middle of the night, see?

648
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,040
And I said, like, you know, hey, man, this is like one of the bad gifts from the bad guys.

649
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,860
Were they emanating from the princess?

650
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,780
No, she was saying, don't worry about it.

651
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,960
I was saying, you know, blank you, this is one of the main things I'm worried about here is,

652
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,540
you know, like the world ending for a big thermonuclear blast and so forth.

653
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,720
And there they were.

654
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,700
In stark contrast to this idyllic, blissful world like Elysian Fields around them

655
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,240
where people are laying around eating grapes.

656
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,900
Let's think real.

657
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,280
Let's get hard and see if we can get the princess to put her input into this.

658
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,100
Oh, I can't get hard no more, not since I ate those beans, man.

659
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,660
I guess there's something bad in them.

660
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,760
There's fuzz on top of it, and the doctor says that can make you impetuous,

661
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,180
you know, or at least give you some bad direction.

662
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,680
The young were very immature at birth.

663
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,040
In the marsupials, the wombat, for example, and in the mouse,

664
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,540
the young had to be taught to survive.

665
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,820
The brain grew larger still.

666
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,340
Something like a shoe was the ancestor of all the mammals.

667
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,620
That's one problem with them, you know, certain type of lucifers.

668
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,080
Yeah.

669
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,920
Yeah.

670
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,740
So have you been thinking, this is the, what is it, the epidangle,

671
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,900
or is this the epicenter?

672
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,640
Well, we're in the sacred week of Christus.

673
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,940
I thought it was Pentegram.

674
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,620
I mean, it was Pentecost.

675
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,480
Well, every year during the sacred week of Christus,

676
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,640
you must let loose.

677
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,500
You must let loose these sacred cruise missiles.

678
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,420
Yes.

679
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,720
Now, isn't that our God is an awesome God?

680
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,480
He loves you so much, he's going to kill you if you aren't on whatever the other guy says.

681
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,020
And that's the way it should be.

682
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,580
But just think of Islamic tradition where they got a month.

683
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,720
At least they were smart enough to mark off a month,

684
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,760
saying where you can't go and kill each other.

685
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,440
We can't even take the Lord's birthday off to have a sandwich and say hello.

686
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,220
You know what I'm saying?

687
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,940
I know.

688
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,500
Scalp them any time, night or day, you know,

689
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,340
desecrate them bodies and so forth.

690
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,040
And what for?

691
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,900
I'm just so depressed about it, Chaz.

692
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,360
I don't know.

693
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,240
America seems like a rather, what should we say, a shallow country,

694
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,000
rather kind of semi-retarded nation sometimes.

695
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,660
Indeed.

696
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,820
I'm not much of an expert on foreign policy or even domestic affairs,

697
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,920
but gosh, first they're going to get rid of the president for having tested.

698
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,040
Seems incredibly silly.

699
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,680
These guys.

700
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,100
Shallow.

701
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,580
Shallow is a very good word.

702
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,180
I know.

703
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,060
It just seems like if you're far off Spain or Uruguay,

704
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,820
you'd be playing chess, you know,

705
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,740
and you'd be having a lot of these more intellectual espresso-like thoughts.

706
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,820
Good evening, princess.

707
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,440
Good evening.

708
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,780
And you wouldn't be thinking about ham and the bar.

709
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,640
Should we, you know, miscongregate the crescents and Drexel and so on and so forth?

710
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,560
No, let's go bomb up the Iranics.

711
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,200
And immediately you see in the guys in, what do they call them, in 1984?

712
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,080
The proles, which is like they'll start slobbering.

713
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,140
And jumping on there.

714
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,600
And then you see in the off in the corner, you see this like shady looking company man, you know,

715
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,540
and he like gets up and walks out.

716
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,100
He's people, some pixie on the back of their Afro-Cuban shoes.

717
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,400
And they all begin to sing that song.

718
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,880
Captain Chaz, Captain Chaz.

719
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,800
Good evening.

720
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,880
Navigator Stan.

721
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,940
Good evening, navigator.

722
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,180
I lost the map.

723
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,700
I lost the star chart.

724
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,220
No.

725
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,380
Dave, what's wrong?

726
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,160
I'll just grab on here to this old killer wheel right here.

727
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,260
We don't really need the maps anymore.

728
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,660
I don't think we really need.

729
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,420
That's not a killer wheel.

730
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,080
We don't need the map anymore.

731
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,800
That's right.

732
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,100
We're going to deep space, baby.

733
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,900
We don't need that thing.

734
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,200
The maps are no good to where we're going.

735
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,340
You mean we're going there?

736
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,100
The there.

737
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,540
We're three teams, man.

738
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Hither and thun.

739
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,840
This guy is like, should be, probably his own museum.

740
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,340
We're going there.

741
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,260
No, we're going th-th-th-there.

742
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,140
Are we taking th-th-that?

743
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,900
No, we're taking that.

744
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,320
Th-th-th-there.

745
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,480
We're taking...

746
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:02,940
Just...

747
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,880
We're all so sweet, baby.

748
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:20,860
We're going to bring the book to the storage

749
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,220
and add it to your collection.

750
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,660
I've got it.

751
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,400
BUY AND BRING.

752
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,400


753
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,400


754
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:40,100
2.2 million light years of flash beyond the mind

755
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:50,000
300 million solar masses that could humankind

756
00:40:53,080 --> 00:41:00,940
Nebulas of gas and powder apparent to our time

757
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,080
Andromeda, beauty in the sky

758
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,980
Andromeda, the ocean sky

759
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
Kas созд, we fly

760
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,360
Andromeda, the ocean sky

761
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,820
Ourcolema, Cherry, Persia

762
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:37,920
Andromeda

763
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,060
Andromedaour

764
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:45,440
We run

765
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,720
Andromedaour

766
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,040
At the edge of sight

767
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,700
One drop of water

768
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,500
Signals in the night

769
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,540
See Venus, Cassie, Ophelia

770
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,440
In their daughter's light

771
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,500
Monster Rome, see Theopia

772
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,480
Cosireus, Joppa, and the Queen

773
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,840
Shall its plight

774
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,600
Perseus, defeat the monster

775
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,740
And draw the dust alight

776
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
Audra, mother

777
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,460
Rise into the sky

778
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,960
Audra, mother

779
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,160
Light his promises

780
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,680
Audra, mother

781
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,620
Beauty in the night

782
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:32,600
Dear friends, that was by Arnold Mathis and Ken Klinger

783
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,160
In this case, from Arnold Mathis' CD, Deviations

784
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,700
It's nice to be getting stuff from Arnold Mathis again

785
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:51,660
At 1425 3rd Avenue, New York, New York 10028

786
00:43:52,580 --> 00:44:00,360
And, uh, for some reason I was prompted by that song to mention to y'all

787
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,860
A real good sci-fi novel I've been reading

788
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,600
With the simple title of Earth

789
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,840
By David Brin

790
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,260
B-R-I-N

791
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:16,080
Um, uh, he does what you would call hard sci-fi

792
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,180
And in this case, this book is, um, it's set about 50 years in the future

793
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:30,340
And it is actually David Brin's most optimistic view of how, uh, well, of all the terrible, uh,

794
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,560
problems that we'll be facing, our descendants

795
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,460
And us, if we're still alive

796
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:42,940
And, uh, but, but it also has just some amazing ideas about how to deal with some of those problems

797
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,960
And it's, uh, that's Earth by David Brin

798
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:55,580
Back in 19, in the 60s, John Bruner wrote a book called Stand on Zanzibar

799
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,440
And, and also a sequel to that called The Sheep Look Up

800
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,920
Uh, both of which, at the time, when I read them, uh, you know, as a young man

801
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,440
It was pretty chilling

802
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,860
You know, it was a, it was a portrait of, uh, the world in the 1990s

803
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,660
And it looked really grim

804
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,380
And the funny thing is, it's just like reading the headlines now

805
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:28,600
None of, there's hardly any difference between the way things turned out and Stand on Zanzibar by John Bruner

806
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:38,960
So, uh, in a way, I think we'll be lucky if, uh, things turn out the way they do in, uh, Earth by David Brin

807
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,660
Hey, Brin, hey, where'd that ESO stuff go?

808
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,920
David Brin, that sounds sort of like brain

809
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,040
Are we taking the, the, that?

810
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,340
No, the thither

811
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,280
The thither

812
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,620
We're taking that to the, the, the there

813
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,580
Thither and yon

814
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,440
Thither and zon

815
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,360
Make sure the elongation is perfect

816
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,400
Perfectly Christ-like

817
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,040
Talk right, Dave

818
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,360
Or else they're gonna throw you right out as soon as you get there

819
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,120
Now they're gonna look at them shoes and say, poo

820
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
What do you mean, weave like, y'all?

821
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,500
Poo

822
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,280
Yeah, they, they're gonna know what you've been walking in

823
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,500
I've been walking in the pews

824
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,740
You've been walking

825
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,880
The pews of the church

826
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,020
Up and down the pews, picking up the gumwads

827
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:22,140
Like, when I get to preaching, I get to preaching, I start walking across the tops of the pews

828
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,560
I carry that microphone in my hand, wearing my mirrored suit

829
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,580
And I start just striding across the tops of the pews

830
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:34,020
And sprinkling my holy water down upon the congregation

831
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,820
That's not holy water

832
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
That's not holy water

833
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:43,220
Well, we tell them that, and, you know, if you believe, anything is possible, as Jesus said

834
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:50,580
Yes, if you drink the unholy putrescences of Reverend Ivan Stang, you'll think it's holy water, and you will be healed

835
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,960
Yeah, but you know Christmas isn't about Reverend Stang

836
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,560
Don't we, we start to forget what Christmas is really all about

837
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,400
It's about Bob's birthday, isn't it?

838
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,240
It's about, it's about cruise missiles

839
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,560
Cruise missiles?

840
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,600
Panels of inquiry

841
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,620
Hey, are we taking her with us?

842
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,960
When we go to the, the, there?

843
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,280
The other end on

844
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,940
We're taking her with us, I suppose

845
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,240
Oh man

846
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,460
You know, think of

847
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,480
Two hundred cruise missiles they, they wasted on those humans

848
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,380
Two hundred cruise missiles and

849
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:29,940
Yeah

850
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,280
Miles and miles of

851
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,800
So think of the kill ratio, too

852
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,220
Amigos

853
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,500
You got twenty-five people you nailed, and you nailed them at a cost of two hundred missiles

854
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,560
That's ten, uh, that's fifteen missiles, almost twelve point five missiles per person

855
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,320
That we're throwing at our annual defense budget

856
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,780
Just so you can have another one of them big, slandery snack buffets that they have for C-SPAN

857
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,120
And all them people are permanently dead

858
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,400
You know

859
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,220
I mean, most of them are permanently dead

860
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,680
I know we hit some of them places in Chaldea and they, you know, the undead start coming up out of the center of the earth

861
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,220
But generally

862
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,660
You know, that's the part they don't show you on CNN

863
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,320
I know, that's, well, how would you show it if you were trying to blackmail an entire nation?

864
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,280
Well, it's the, you know, it's the birth season of our Lord Jesus Christ

865
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,240
And the rising of the dead from Chaldea, of the armies of the dead

866
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,800
But that is really bad

867
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,220
Because this is, you know, we're about to enter 1999, the year of the dead

868
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,680
Is it the necro year of the dead?

869
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,180
Well, supposedly when Jesus is born again

870
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,740
Well, the anti, you know, the beast, the beast Jesus

871
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,760
Not the one that works here at the Subgenius Foundation

872
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,240
Not the son of God

873
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:45,180
But the anti-Jesus that'll be born is going to bring in the armies of the living dead from the Middle East

874
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,600
That's biblical prophecy

875
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,160
This has all been foretold

876
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,900
Did Jesus go to Teotihuacan before or after he lived in Jerusalem?

877
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,800
Yeah, what about them parts of the Cyclopean thing because

878
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,180
The Cyclopean Apocrypha?

879
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,880
Yeah, they crucified him too

880
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,620
Yeah, they said it was over in America that Jesus came over here and he started slapping some people around and stuff

881
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,780
And they had to handcuff him

882
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,200
Jesus in the New World

883
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,280
Yeah, I know that they already knew the religion out of it

884
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,320
He took a ride with the Vikings

885
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:15,940
Huh?

886
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,040
Jesus, after he had faked his crucifixion

887
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,180
This is the original Jesus

888
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,560
The Jewish one

889
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,760
After he faked his death and crucifixion and went to France and had all those Merovingian babies

890
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,480
Then, this is the part that's little known

891
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,120
And he also went to India, of course, and studied under the holy men

892
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,040
He went to Tibet and learned from the Bob monks

893
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:46,800
And he voyaged at the end of his life to the New World with the Vikings

894
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,480
I thought he went with Saint Brendan and he didn't even know that the Lord was there

895
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,760
You know what I mean? He's kind of confused

896
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,540
Oh, well, he wasn't, you know, by the way

897
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,320
At that time, he was, you know, he wasn't doing that particular scam anymore

898
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,500
He was just kind of like riding around like them weird old

899
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,800
Well, he was the son of God, but he found out what they do to you

900
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,580
They do that even to the son of God?

901
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,860
Well, they used to, they don't do it now

902
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,820
Well, I've tried

903
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,580
They always made it sound like he was such a sap, though

904
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,420
I mean, if he was the son of God, wouldn't you try and get out of it right away?

905
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,700
I'd smote all them guys as hard as I could

906
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,160
I'd say, look, Roman soldiers, you want to see your underpants on fire in front of the Thessalonians?

907
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,520
Oh, if I was the son of God and those Roman soldiers came at me, I'd turn into Godzilla

908
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,420
I'd turn into a 500-foot tall monster, blow a radioactive fire at them

909
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,880
I'd summon UFOs to come and destroy all the jerks in the world

910
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:45,160
And, you know, Connie and her girls would come and service all the nice people

911
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,860
Well, that makes you wonder, don't it?

912
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,740
I mean, not too much

913
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,120
Well, if you were the son of God or if I was the son of God, that'd be great

914
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,140
But I'm afraid my connections aren't like that

915
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,120
We are all the sons and daughters of God

916
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:06,880
One line took to the trees, developing dexterity, stereo vision, larger brains, and a curiosity about their environment

917
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,620
Some became baboons

918
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,920
But that's not the line to us

919
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,780
Apes and humans have a recent common ancestor

920
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,240
Bone for bone, muscle for muscle, molecule for molecule

921
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,760
There are almost no important differences

922
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,060
Between apes and humans

923
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,820
Please tell them that I am God

924
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,180
Demons can smoke it or eat it

925
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,760
Mine?

926
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,460
Smoking demons?

927
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,560
Well, you've smoked a few in your life, haven't you?

928
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,760
Man, that's really, really hardcore

929
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,920
That's, you know, that's ridiculous

930
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,460
Angels are not, because they, you know, eat vegetables

931
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,720
And demons are bad because they eat angels

932
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,880
Hey, it's the natural way

933
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,320
It's like God allowed Satan to exist

934
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,520
It's Jesus' older brother

935
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,280
My mind is going

936
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,780
Slow down, you're moving too fast

937
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,840
You gotta make the morning distance

938
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,040
Kickin' around on the cobblestone

939
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,380
Look for fun and feelin' your way

940
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:21,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

941
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,700
出 chief

942
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,280
Turn right and you'll be Jakob

943
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,320
Cooler than your sister

944
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:39,420
Application

945
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,260
Hard to take out the confuse

946
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,040
The poor bros which you love

947
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,600
Actually, it was subgenius 1.01b.

948
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,100
It was a beta copy, test copy.

949
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,460
It was glitchy as hell, as sacred texts go.

950
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,720
And this was just, technically, it was just on typewriter paper.

951
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,560
What did subgeniuses do during that?

952
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,740
But, man, that thing would flicker.

953
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,340
It would lose.

954
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,240
From time to time, when you opened or closed it, it would lose.

955
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,900
You know, it'd have different sections missing.

956
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,980
They'd come and go.

957
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,220
Oh.

958
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,200
Well, that's the loose-lid.

959
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:22,820
Look at the formatting.

960
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,920
Sometimes the little handwritten lines that indicated where something was italic would be there,

961
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,520
and then other times they wouldn't.

962
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,420
Yeah, that's the loose-lid thing.

963
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,220
That's for fear of paranoia in case you don't get it all.

964
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,380
It's kind of committed to memory in the oral language.

965
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:42,220
Well, before the age of computer glitch, and this is in, like, the early 1980s,

966
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,640
this is before you put things on computer disks.

967
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,320
The same problems that you have on a corrupt disk,

968
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,800
we would have on pieces.

969
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,820
We'd have pieces of paper for the book of the subgenius manuscript.

970
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,180
One time, we thought we'd lost it all.

971
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,040
We thought that it had just, you know, it had gone completely blank.

972
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,540
But then we got new readers.

973
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,520
Killed the old Bobbies and got some new readers.

974
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,300
And they were able to read it and see it.

975
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,720
Well, that, you know, still doesn't tell us...

976
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,400
When they retied it.

977
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,640
...Bob's birthday or the season of adverts.

978
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:12,840
Yeah.

979
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,620
I'm still all confused.

980
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,080
You're talking about, you know, spy games and stuff.

981
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,580
Beware of Satan's claws.

982
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,260
Satan's claws.

983
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
I saw that.

984
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,900
Great band.

985
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,020
They wear Satan's claws.

986
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,540
You know, they got them hand-antographed 8x12s as promo headshots of Lucifer.

987
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,440
Ozzy.

988
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,060
Ozzy.

989
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,600
Would he still have it?

990
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,200
Like bristles?

991
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:33,520
Huh?

992
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,540
Yeah.

993
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,920
I'm sorry I agreed, but I know about Ozzy.

994
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,680
I heard about it.

995
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,940
It just seems so strange.

996
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,600
It's all so strange.

997
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,320
It's all so strange.

998
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,940
So very, very strange.

999
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,680
Yeah, it's pretty strange all right.

1000
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:49,960
Yeah, it's very, very strange.

1001
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:49,960


1002
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:49,960


1003
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:49,960


1004
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:49,960


1005
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:49,960


1006
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:49,960


1007
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,620
You know, did you guys all go to family feasts today and stuff like that?

1008
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,580
Well, it's kind of a different family for me.

1009
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,460
Yeah, I know.

1010
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,640
I heard that some of them aren't really what you'd call human, right?

1011
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,780
Well, actually, they're super and sub-human.

1012
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,820
No plain humans, no.

1013
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,620
But they were taking on some sort of comestible through some sort of orifice in their body

1014
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,120
today, right?

1015
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,440
Plenty and loads of, yes.

1016
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,940
High-quality comestibles.

1017
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1018
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1019
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1020
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1021
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1022
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1023
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1024
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1025
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1026
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1027
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1028
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1029
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1030
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1031
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1032
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1033
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:19,940


1034
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,080
Of an earthly origin or some alien smegma pie?

1035
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:31,500
Some that was alien smegma pie oriented and some that was more earthly.

1036
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,080
I've never heard that way.

1037
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:32,740
Oriental style?

1038
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,500
They do it in a walk or something like that?

1039
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:34,740
Yeah.

1040
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,040
Just toss it right up.

1041
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,520
Toss it right up.

1042
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,220
Oh, pretext.

1043
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,320
Well, you sounded funny when you said toss it right up.

1044
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,220
You sound like a Southern.

1045
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,540
But I better put in another type.

1046
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,940
It is just dumb stuff.

1047
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,060
Well, because that would...

1048
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:49,920
The shape of the...

1049
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,300
The show is beginning to lose viewers.

1050
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,900
Don't we all feel that way?

1051
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,300
That the show is losing viewers?

1052
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,820
And we're not talking about this one here, although it might be true.

1053
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,060
I'm talking about that Big Brother show we've been watching for so long.

1054
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,320
I'm sorry.

1055
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,100
I'm just watching.

1056
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:12,380
Well, and the Universal show, the show that is the great carpet of life.

1057
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,960
All of life is a show.

1058
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,800
And the Observer affects...

1059
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,900
Because the Heisenberg...

1060
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:24,280
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, if we don't have an audience, we ain't got much

1061
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:24,840
of a universe.

1062
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,040
And the observers have been losing interest.

1063
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,740
You know how we watch Beavis and Butthead and make fun of it?

1064
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,120
And they're just watching MTV videos and making fun of them?

1065
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,400
Somebody's looking at us looking at Beavis and Butthead.

1066
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,520
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,780
And doing Mystery Science Theater 3000 on us.

1068
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,860
Yeah, they told me they came in through the window, through the bathroom window, as they

1069
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,680
used to say one night from a silver spoon.

1070
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,880
They told me that they had knocked on the door.

1071
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:49,880


1072
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:49,880


1073
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,640
They told me that they had not only been watching, that they were stopped watching, and that

1074
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,140
they were taking what you call resumes again.

1075
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,240
And that everybody there was contractors.

1076
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,540
Well, Princess Wee was going to get a job originally, as queen of the UFOs.

1077
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,840
That was one of her potential jobs, was this whiter and watcher.

1078
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,340
Yeah, it was the head job for a while.

1079
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:14,820
She was going to be one of the observers of the universe that, you know, just as long

1080
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,380
as somebody was watching, then it existed.

1081
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,860
But if nobody was watching, then it didn't exist.

1082
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:19,860


1083
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,440
Then it, you know, technically it doesn't exist.

1084
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:26,120
It's just like that if a tree falls in the middle of a forest and nobody hears it, then

1085
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,880
it really falls.

1086
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:27,320
Yeah.

1087
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,680
Well, duh, it fell.

1088
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:38,580
How many rodents can shroder this cat, once it's got out of the box, and assuming all

1089
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:44,160
possibilities point to it being alive when it comes out of the box, how many rodents

1090
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,840
would it be able to kill in a solar year as long as it's alive?

1091
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:56,980
Well, the question is, how many of those rodents would be unobservable because they

1092
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,780
climbed behind furniture and died?

1093
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,360
Yeah.

1094
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:10,260
And how many of those rodents would be unobservable if the observer was in a vacuum and couldn't

1095
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:10,800
smell them?

1096
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:16,720
Well, see, that's the kind of question I think it's unfair for the Star Commission to ask.

1097
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,820
I don't think that anybody, any American would be able to ask that question.

1098
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:19,820


1099
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:19,820


1100
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,040
I think that every American citizen should have to answer those kind of questions.

1101
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,120
Even on the ACP?

1102
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,260
Yeah, but it was mostly a typo because they thought it was absurdist rather than observer.

1103
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,280
And that's why all the rest of the information, nobody could transcribe it or even figure

1104
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,280
out what you just said.

1105
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Did you say anything?

1106
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,040
Did I?

1107
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:43,720
Our ancestors walked upright, freeing their hands to poke and fix and experiment.

1108
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,320
We got smarter.

1109
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,180
We began to talk.

1110
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,800
And when we talked, we got smarter.

1111
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1112
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1113
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1114
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1115
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1116
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1117
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1118
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1119
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1120
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:54,900
We said, now it's time to write down the address of Church of the Subgenius, to write

1121
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,820
for that free information.

1122
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:02,500
If you've never done that, it's, you know, it's some free sheets of paper.

1123
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:09,940
Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, well, you could just send it direct to Bob,

1124
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:19,440
Bob Dobbs, at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1125
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,420
75214.

1126
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,720
That's 75214.

1127
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,140
Thank you.

1128
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:37,860
Oh, oh, oh, and Einstein Secret Orchestra, once again, who actually is, Chaz Smith edited

1129
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,560
what we've been listening to, friends.

1130
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,520
And he's a good editor.

1131
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,900
I did a little bit of more re-editing on it, but you've been listening to Lonesome Cowboy

1132
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,420
Dave and Chaz Smith on Netflix.

1133
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:55,220
And Einstein Secret Orchestra radio show out of WCSB in Cleveland, remixed and re-edited

1134
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,200
by Chaz and myself.

1135
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:04,400
Einstein Secret Orchestra is reachable at Post Office Box 81555.

1136
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:14,880
Cleveland, Ohio 44181.

1137
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,080
And the 220~!

1138
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,160
The

1139
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,160


1140
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,160


1141
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,800
The discovery of a mystery Buster tonight, will be available for English speakers.

1142
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,620
I show you AstNGl Kevinologist on switcheroo, a fan favorite.

1143
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,340
Knock the church off,ce relief.

1144
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,020
This is Chaz the Curse of Personal Sal прямо here.

1145
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,720
He's on his breakthrough news.

1146
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:39,720


1147
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:39,720


1148
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:39,720


1149
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,320
Solid chaudenchus with less homeless people.

1150
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,500
I promise you that it will be good.

1151
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,180
Just control your health!

1152
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:47,180


1153
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,400
grabbing Susuterie's phone rights.

1154
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,640
and couldn't smell it.

1155
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,760
Plunging through the membrane, we find ourselves inside the cell.

1156
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,100
Here, every structure has its function.

1157
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,460
Those dark green blobs are factories,

1158
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:11,200
where messenger molecules are busy building the enzymes which control the chemistry of the cell.

1159
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,280
The messengers were instructed and dispatched from within the nucleus,

1160
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,820
the heart and brain of the cell.

1161
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,160
All the instructions on how to get a cell to work.
