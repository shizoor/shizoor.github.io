1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm against the Turkish government.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,820
Despite pockets of ongoing fighting, the BBBBC reports.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,240
But victory has come at a terrible, humiliating defeat.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,640
The BBBBC.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,640
Meanwhile, local monitors say PR News is holding.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,480
The government has not suggested it will do so.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,160
Beijing says Bob is hindering firefighting efforts.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,540
Or, uh, to dump Bob as a retard.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,840
U.S. and German doctors say this is PR News.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
And PR News denied it.

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,540
I want to tell you about Paris.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,380
My heart has never finished.

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,240
There is an advantage of the Eiffel Tower.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,100
Or the Saint-Michel neighborhood.

15
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,520
I want to tell you about Paris.

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,940
I want to tell you about Paris.

17
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,500
I want to tell you about Paris.

18
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:27,480
I want to tell you about Paris.

19
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:57,500
I want to tell you about Paris.

20
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,240
I want to tell you about Paris.

21
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,520
I want to tell you about Paris.

22
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,320
I really like this song called Puppet Dance.

23
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,740
You'll think at the beginning that it's Fat Man D singing.

24
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,840
But that would be kind of ironic.

25
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,360
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

26
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,860
Come one, come all, right this way.

27
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,980
That's it.

28
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,440
Right here.

29
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,400
Right through here.

30
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,540
Ladies and gentlemen, everyone is welcome.

31
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,840
Well, hey there, little man.

32
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,040
Hey there, little girl.

33
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Come on.

34
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
Into the puppet theater.

35
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,960
Give it a Wall Street whirl.

36
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,280
There's a strange and twitchy dance.

37
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,540
It's going on right over there.

38
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,240
Well, ain't they ever so funny

39
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,400
with them strings tied up in their hair?

40
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,840
They're dancing, dancing, dancing a jig.

41
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,140
You can do the dance, too.

42
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,620
Just pay all of your money.

43
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,640
It's the very first rule.

44
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,300
As the puppeteers leer

45
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,180
and tug those pretty strings.

46
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,580
Hey, hey, my little man.

47
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,980
Everybody will dance and sing.

48
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,280
And hey there, my little lady.

49
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,680
Do the puppet dance.

50
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,020
It don't matter if it's a little shady.

51
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,900
You'll soon understand.

52
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,740
And hey there, sister lady.

53
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,160
Just step on the stage.

54
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,820
Don't you fret as they tie you down.

55
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:25,820


56
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,600
Just buy the strings.

57
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,740
It's the easiest thing.

58
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,300
We all just play along.

59
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,340
Mm-hmm.

60
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
Yes, just play along.

61
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
You play along, too, saxophone.

62
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,060
Yeah, you play along to the bottom,

63
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,060


64
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,620
and then to the farthest middle.

65
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:49,640
Or say god damn it,

66
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,640


67
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,680
Mm...

68
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,360
Or say god damn it, too, saxophone.

69
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,760
Yeah, you play along too, fiddler. That's right.

70
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,740
That's right.

71
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:43,660
Well, hey there, little man. Hey there, little girl. Come on and do the puppet dance. Give it a Wall Street whirl.

72
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:58,240
Oh, yes. All my friends. Ain't it shivery fun when we're dancing? Oh, we're dancing puppets.

73
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,280
Dancing under the gun.

74
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:12,920
Mm-hmm. That's it. That's right. Yes, just string along. String along.

75
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,420
Mm-hmm. Good. Good.

76
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,920
Oh, no, wait. Don't fight the strings now. Don't fight those puppet strings. Oh, that's better.

77
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:39,240
That's better. Just play along. Oh, we all just play along. Play along. We're happy to play along.

78
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

79
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

80
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

81
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

82
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

83
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

84
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

85
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,680
Johnson.

86
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,140
Johnson.

87
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:58,740


88
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:58,740


89
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:58,740


90
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:58,740


91
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:06,780
Shirley was the artiste behind that from a CD called Spaceship Landing in a Cemetery, Puppet Dance.

92
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,620
I lied a minute ago.

93
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,260
John was not actually at XD.

94
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,520
He was a guest at Starwood.

95
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,120
And later on, we're going to be telling you what all happened at XD and Starwood festivals.

96
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,200
It was exciting.

97
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:34,760
Exciting, including being handed CDs by folks that, well, in this case, I've played a whole lot of St. Andrew the Impaled,

98
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,580
recorded live at XD's over the last 10 or 15 years.

99
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,420
And he finally came out with an album and a band.

100
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,720
The band is called The Liberty Tubes.

101
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,440
They're from Pittsburgh.

102
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,180
And that's like the local name for the band.

103
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,020
It tunnels into town through the forbidding hills.

104
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:04,600
Anyway, longtime listeners will recognize these St. Andrew the Impaled tunes,

105
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,380
only they're completely different because it's studio stuff.

106
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,580
And it's a wonderful new thing.

107
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,060
I saw you look at me up and down.

108
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,420
Then I saw you looking all around.

109
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,940
That cool guy at the bar, yeah, his name is Jim.

110
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,560
But he's got good taste, so you ain't leaving with him.

111
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,080
You need a guy who's going to make you feel good.

112
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,460
Not dwell upon your faults like the other guys would.

113
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,160
Like your green teeth and your knobby ass knees.

114
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,640
What you really need is a fella like me.

115
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,300
Cause I got low standards.

116
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,020
I got low standards.

117
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,500
I got low standards.

118
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,940
So why don't you get with me?

119
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,700
Now you might think that I'm very refined.

120
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,320
But I'm just looking for a kind of good time.

121
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
So what if you're bald and missing an eye?

122
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,260
I could look past it.

123
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm that kind of guy.

124
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,860
I'll beg on work and you forgot your makeup kit.

125
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,280
Well, I'll just dim the lights a bit.

126
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,860
Wear diseases from your previous bows.

127
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
Don't bother me.

128
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,500
I got some of my own.

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,100
Cause I got low standards.

130
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
I got low standards.

131
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,180
I got low standards.

132
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
So why don't you get with me?

133
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,160
Yeah, that was good enough.

134
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,880
You got a list with every letter but N.

135
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,580
You say who and I say when.

136
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,180
You say most to you is one.

137
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,000
You're starting to sag.

138
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,680
I say grab that colostomy bag and get into my car.

139
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
It's a piece of crap.

140
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,500
Just toss a Burger King wrapper right in the back.

141
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,980
And we'll head off to your place or mine.

142
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,220
Or just putz a parking lot.

143
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
Shit, that'd be fine.

144
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,280
Cause I got low standards.

145
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,840
I got low standards.

146
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,340
I got low standards.

147
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,920
So why don't you get with me?

148
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,340
I got low standards.

149
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,900
I got low, low, low, low standards.

150
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,300
I got low standards.

151
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,900
I took it up to a poor choice of words.

152
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,200
When you say that the Holocaust never occurred.

153
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,800
You think stem cells are part of your phone.

154
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,220
And that bathing is for those too cheap for cologne.

155
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,720
Well, I got a can of spray here to cover the smell.

156
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,320
And earplugs cause your voice is grating as hell.

157
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,800
Besides, the things you say must be out of your mind.

158
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,340
You make the guests on Springer sound like fucking hot stocks.

159
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,160
You make the guests on Springer sound like fucking hot stocks.

160
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,760
You make the guests on Springer sound like fucking hot stocks.

161
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,060
But I know that I know.

162
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,620
Cause I got low standards.

163
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,320
Cause I got low standards.

164
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,540
I got low standards.

165
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:03,700
I got low standards.

166
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,140
So why don't you get with me?

167
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,540
What do you get with me?

168
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,760
They never really get used to it.

169
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,240
It makes sex really, really weird.

170
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,600
Oh, edit that out.

171
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,460
A lot of dead air in my lovemaking too.

172
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,700
A new victim.

173
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,540
The victim you haven't seen dead air in your lovemaking like you've seen in mine.

174
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,280
Led Zeppelin is just a band that was made up of the Beatles after they all put on disguises.

175
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,260
They got together and decided, what if we made our music worse?

176
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,620
I have to disagree with you.

177
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,600
Or at least more morose.

178
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,760
Of course you would, old man.

179
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,660
Old man.

180
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,440
Come up here to defend the Beatles.

181
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,560
That's all you did.

182
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,960
That's all you boomers can do.

183
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,200
When you think of the guidance and consideration that I have shown you over the last four days,

184
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,180
making sure you were safe,

185
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,120
that things didn't happen to you.

186
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,640
I go and flog myself in the woods every night,

187
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,680
not my log, out amongst the logs,

188
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,620
but I go out and I hurt myself in punishment for all the terrible things I did the prior night

189
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,620
and all the terrible things I plan on saying to you the next day.

190
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,340
But it's got to be done, Pease.

191
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,280
It's got to be done.

192
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:34,880
Why?

193
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,720
Because if he doesn't do it, no one else will.

194
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,500
Well, no, actually everybody else will too.

195
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,480
There's a line going around the building.

196
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,800
We've been doing a counter radio show.

197
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:45,880
What?

198
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,060
What?

199
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


200
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


201
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


202
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


203
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


204
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


205
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


206
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


207
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,160


208
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,460
An animation?

209
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,220
An anti-show, you might say.

210
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
An anti-show to expose what's taking place the next day.

211
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,940
We're out here broadcasting the real truth of the secret documents that we've recovered from Ivan Stang's house

212
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,460
when we stuck in there to find if he had any chips or liquor in his cabinet.

213
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,560
There was no liquor.

214
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,060
All of it.

215
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,740
Yeah, we didn't find any liquor.

216
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,220
We did find an extensive load of ranch beans.

217
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,100
Stang probably drank it all the first night he got here.

218
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,820
There was a lot of ranch beans and some empty cans.

219
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,020
A lot of wolf chili.

220
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,940
Wolf chili.

221
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,360
Official chili of the church.

222
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,720
Some weird sushi squid food or something.

223
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,460
Squishy spam.

224
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,120
Squib.

225
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,100
Treezo spam.

226
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,320
What's up with that?

227
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,640
You know, it's actually quite tasty.

228
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,300
It was, actually.

229
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,320
I will not disparage treezo spam.

230
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,280
But who looks at it and thinks it's tasty?

231
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,000
Treezo spam is a good friend of mine.

232
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,120
I will not sit on this radio show and have him disparaged like this.

233
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,500
Trees of spam.

234
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,900
Man, wouldn't that be...

235
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Trees of spam.

236
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,060
Trees of spam.

237
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,320
Where I live, the trees are made of spam.

238
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,160
And the grass is...

239
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,940
And you pluck a can right off the branch.

240
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,600
Right off the can.

241
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,980
And you just pop that open and...

242
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,560
I think the spam would be growing from the tree all natural, no can.

243
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,840
It would just be the spam ham hanging there.

244
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,540
No can?

245
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,260
No can.

246
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,580
Because when you picked it...

247
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,700
No, man, you're going to have an envelope for that pink meat.

248
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,300
No, when you pick it, then you put it in a can so you can ship it somewhere else.

249
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,560
But it's the fruit, you know.

250
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,780
So it's up there.

251
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,400
The greasy, slimy spam is hanging from the tree.

252
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,160
Listen to this idiot talk.

253
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
They send the subgeniuses out to pick the spam from the trees where it's not...

254
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,340
Trees, fruits, and...

255
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,300
They're canned and shipped to local grocery stores.

256
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,220
Look how little you know.

257
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,900
Wisconsin, yeah, I know.

258
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,340
Everyone knows this.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,920
Okay, peas.

260
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,560
Somebody manufactures it and somebody else sells it.

261
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,940
But no matter what, it's all...

262
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,220
Mob?

263
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,200
That's deep, man.

264
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,540
That's really...

265
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,460
That blew my mind as if X-Day had not blown my mind enough.

266
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
What was your...

267
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm mostly concerned with...

268
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,540
I'm going home from X-Day with four...

269
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,080
Four out of five tires on my brain.

270
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,620
Brain flat.

271
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,080
Yeah.

272
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,060
The fifth one's a lingering hallucination.

273
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,780
So just

274
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,640
I guess I'm going to miss that.

275
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,340
Go on back.

276
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,560
Go on back.

277
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,380
Go on back.

278
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,720
Go on back.

279
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,200
Go on back.

280
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,360
Go on back.

281
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,580
Go on back.

282
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,680
Go on back.

283
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:45,280
Go on back.

284
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,220
We'll be right back.

285
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,360
We'll be right back.

286
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,140
We'll be right back.

287
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,780
We'll be right back.

288
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,260
We'll be right back.

289
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,740
We'll be right back.

290
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,040
We'll be right back.

291
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,000
We'll be right back.

292
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:57,780
We'll be right back.

293
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
We'll be right back.

294
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,040
We'll be right back.

295
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,340
We'll be right back.

296
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,720
We'll be right back.

297
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,600
We'll be right back.

298
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,180
We'll be right back.

299
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,040
We'll be right back.

300
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,680
We'll be right back.

301
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,280
We'll be right back.

302
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,120
We'll be right back.

303
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,540
We'll be right back.

304
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,420
We'll be right back.

305
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,340
We'll be right back.

306
00:28:50,340 --> 00:29:00,940
We'll be right back.

307
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:09,280
time 24 drills now was there anything even close this year oh yeah there were all kinds of things

308
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:18,280
that were close uh president vermin supreme showed up and with a pony and a goat and the

309
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:25,780
and right at the beginning of my religious ceremony when my big spot at starwood at uh

310
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:32,320
prime time saturday afternoon i was starting my religious defival rant and that pony came up on

311
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:40,180
stage and took a great big old horse dump right there a pony dump it was only a little pony like

312
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:47,520
a shetland pony or something i think a shet land did you say i would say it was slightly yeah okay

313
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,140
it's going to land i think it would be different because that pony's poop smelled a lot worse than

314
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,760
any normal horse

315
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,420
poop i've ever smelled and believe me you're not supposed to feed pizza and stuff like that

316
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:08,460
right exactly normally horse and cow manure do not smell that bad when they're fresh but this pony i

317
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,660
don't know what they've been feeding it a bunch of propaganda from president vermin supreme no doubt

318
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:25,340
he turned out to be a real swell feller and uh he gave me a hand-painted tie that says vermin supreme

319
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,860
and he painted his name with elmer's glue and then dusted it with glitter yeah he had a whole bunch of

320
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:37,620
those and he gave me a free copy of his new book i pony and he uh he gave us lessons on how to use a

321
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:46,660
megaphone to uh defuse tensions at protests yes he did a workshop called megaphonics yeah he teaches

322
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:53,980
if you if he'd be a real good guy to have at your possibly violent protest to keep it from getting

323
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,060
violent because

324
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:03,960
he he interjects absurdity and a certain amount of uh understanding for both the sweaty irritated

325
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,700
cops who were getting kind of scared and the crazed scared sweaty demonstrators and so forth

326
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:19,200
jace was that chicago in 1968 or something you're talking about or well well uh i don't know he's

327
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,140
been everywhere he's done everything and he has lots of fun apparently now that sounds like a

328
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,760
cross between popeye and hannah byron i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know

329
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,140
the difference between robert there and um you know get him he does kind of look a little like

330
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:37,640
popeye with a beard but both eyes he's got the forearms and the uh shins like that bucket-like

331
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:45,640
thing uh now vermin supreme turned out to be being a real okay guy yeah he was he was a guest at

332
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,920
starwood oh we were had a lot of debauchery going on i heard that there was the places rife with

333
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,460
debauchery and and having adultery within adultery

334
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,620
and all kinds of weird stuff was going on.

335
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,640
Well, that's the way they advertise it,

336
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,140
but if that's happening, it's back in the woods

337
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,700
and they never invite me anymore.

338
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,940
Some of those children that lead the parade and stuff

339
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,840
have big creases in their foreheads.

340
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,080
They're scary looking, like right out of some Romero movie or something.

341
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,020
Yes, and they always do that parade during my rant.

342
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,540
You think you didn't know that,

343
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,200
but now you know that you did know that.

344
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,480
I do it all the time.

345
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,480
We had such spectacles at X Day as,

346
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,700
okay, envision this.

347
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,480
The Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

348
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,800
You know what that is, right?

349
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,100
A car shaped like a wiener.

350
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,180
Yes.

351
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,840
Well, this was a replica.

352
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,520
This wasn't the original Oscar Mayer Wienermobile,

353
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,240
but David Apocalypse with that

354
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,740
jumped through...

355
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,180
Three burning cars.

356
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,040
Three flaming cars.

357
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,560
He jumped those with the replica Wienermobile.

358
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,740
He was the Wienermobile.

359
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,240
Well, let's not do any spoilers here.

360
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,800
Okay, sorry.

361
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,160
In fact, he was in fact the wiener,

362
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,480
and he was in fact...

363
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,220
It's hard to really even describe.

364
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,400
Have you ever been so high

365
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,600
that you saw a giant talking hot dog?

366
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,740
Well, I've been so hard-working...

367
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,580
that I saw that very thing.

368
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,660
And it was real.

369
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,940
There's pictures to prove it.

370
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,560
They know when they're getting under your skin.

371
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,080
A giant talking...

372
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,100
They start asking questions about mustard and condiments

373
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,020
and stuff like that,

374
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,860
and it's kind of creepy.

375
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,360
Oh, kind of?

376
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,300
You have no idea.

377
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,420
It's the epitome of creepy.

378
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,780
Clowns.

379
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,020
Is there?

380
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,740
Dave, you know,

381
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,240
you know there's the one rule about clowns,

382
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,880
what you never ever do.

383
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
They all look like Trump,

384
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,740
and they get out of the car,

385
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,640
and they get back in the car,

386
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,480
and they look like Trump.

387
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,180
No.

388
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,100
Because everybody knows that Trump is a crazy clown car.

389
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,360
Oh, that's silly.

390
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,200
All clowns are...

391
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,000
He's very serious.

392
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,060
He really is.

393
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,180
Anyway,

394
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,280
the rule I was expecting you to know, Dave,

395
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,680
but apparently you don't know.

396
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,840
Don't ever...

397
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,520
No, what's a clown?

398
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,760
Don't ever give a clown drugs.

399
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,680
Okay?

400
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,820
Well, there were two clowns at X-Day,

401
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,260
and guess what happened?

402
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,360
Yep, you got it right.

403
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,900
Somebody gave him drugs.

404
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,380
Next thing you know,

405
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,920
there's flaming Wienermobiles

406
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,740
and talking hot dogs

407
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,700
and straight jacket escapes

408
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,020
and screwdrivers going all the way

409
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,560
into his freaking face.

410
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,320
Yep, that's what will happen, you know?

411
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,120
And entire shows starring no one

412
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,460
except the toolbox of death,

413
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,240
which is just a thing.

414
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,520
It's a toolbox full of tools of death.

415
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,400
And those things all happened to us.

416
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,480
It's true.

417
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,320
You died?

418
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
No, no, only...

419
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,900
Actually, nobody did die.

420
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,660
And, you know, obviously...

421
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,520
Somebody really died, and they didn't.

422
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,220
And you were going to make up their name

423
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,180
and make their family real anxious and ugly

424
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,920
and call you up on a telephone

425
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,800
and threaten the local Ku Klux Klan

426
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,820
to beat you up.

427
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,220
Or whatever they call them.

428
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,920
What do they call them?

429
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,600
The guys with the funny clothes?

430
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,120
Amish.

431
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,860
Yeah.

432
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,420
Amish.

433
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,260
Yeah.

434
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:46,660
Clowns?

435
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,620
You can pick on them a lot easier.

436
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,540
Yeah, they're clowns.

437
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,140
Yeah, and they're fascists, those clowns.

438
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,080
Confederate clowns.

439
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,260
Both of them start with a K, so...

440
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,920
That means nothing at all, really.

441
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,740
Kukuk's clown.

442
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:01,940
Beware.

443
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,020
Don't...

444
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,040
Don't let the sun set on you in this town

445
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,860
if you're not wearing whiteface.

446
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,980
That's not funny.

447
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,620
That is.

448
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,440
That's really sad.

449
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,960
Grease paint.

450
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,900
We're talking about grease paint.

451
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,760
It's clowns, okay?

452
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,640
They're fascists.

453
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,420
They're jerks.

454
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,120
If you give them drugs.

455
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
And that's what happened.

456
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,740
But it was made...

457
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:25,980
It was made up for...

458
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,580
You should have known better.

459
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,500
It was made up for by Reverend Angry Larry

460
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,540
playing drums and bass at the same time

461
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,220
so that the other musicians would have something

462
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,060
solid to work off of.

463
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,400
And the other...

464
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,080
How about a bass player or a drummer?

465
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,560
The only other musicians were

466
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,620
Princess Wee and Reverend Vanessa.

467
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,080
The beautiful Reverend Vanessa Oak.

468
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,700
And she's so smart.

469
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,360
Yes.

470
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,580
And...

471
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:55,740
And...

472
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:55,740


473
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,060
And she's so talented.

474
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,760
She is.

475
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,020
What is she doing in Church of the Subgenius?

476
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,680
I have to ask myself whenever I...

477
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,340
I'll ask, you know,

478
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,740
what's the reason for this?

479
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,420
You know, is some form of at-large absurdity

480
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,220
that becomes grander and grander by the moment?

481
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,940
What are we going to have to do to her to...

482
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,400
Bite down really hard on the leather straps

483
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,220
and just let them electroshock...

484
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,660
Electroshock...

485
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,200
While you're thinking of that Vanessa woman, you know?

486
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,280
You better not do anything to her.

487
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,040
No, no, no.

488
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,460
But the...

489
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,040
The only question is how...

490
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,660
How do...

491
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,620
It seems like she's a little too smart

492
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,980
to qualify for Church of the Subgenius.

493
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,060
Yeah, that's what you just said.

494
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,420
You said she was smart.

495
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,760
What can we do to...

496
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,400
What can we do to help her to qualify?

497
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,980
Well, if she could just listen to the recording of this,

498
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,000
she'd probably know well enough to stay away.

499
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,340
You know, that'll flatten four of your brain tires,

500
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,660
like Reverend Shogun was saying there.

501
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,160
That flat tire, that's a wonderful key

502
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,240
to perform in, by the way, a flat tire.

503
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,060
That's funny you should mention that,

504
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,440
because Princess, we and I,

505
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,300
making sure that our...

506
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,400
The I-van would be in good shape for this trip across Ohio

507
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,600
and then another one back to Texas, pulling a trailer.

508
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,340
We bought four new tires.

509
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,800
And within four days, one of them was flat.

510
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,160
I hate...

511
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,320
Well, we were on a campground, David.

512
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,680
It was fixed.

513
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,040
It was fixed.

514
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,140
It was fixed.

515
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,140


516
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,140


517
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,900
It was fixed by an admiral...

518
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,880
Well, I don't want to name names,

519
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,520
but it was a person who is transitioning

520
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,940
from male to female, as it were,

521
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,700
or something like that.

522
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
And yet...

523
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,200
John, if you're going to change tires,

524
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,880
you can't change genders, too,

525
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,760
at the same time as you're changing tires.

526
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,240
Well, this person...

527
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,560
Now that you mention it,

528
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,420
that's exactly what was happening.

529
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,200
Exactly.

530
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,200
Yeah, and I was thinking...

531
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,240
It gives new meaning to a flat tire, too,

532
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,080
because sometimes...

533
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,860
Sometimes things don't rise to the moment,

534
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,680
as they might say.

535
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,980
They just flatten out,

536
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,260
kind of dangle there by themselves.

537
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,660
Oh, no, you're talking about the naked baptism at X-Day,

538
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,580
what they call the sausage and flapjack fest.

539
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,380
Yeah, and Hemingway, too.

540
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,400
Yeah.

541
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,180
Well, remember, Reverend Angry Larry pointed that out.

542
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,220
This isn't really just a sausage fest.

543
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,780
It's also a flapjack fest.

544
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,560
The aging, you know, the graying...

545
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,440
You have to tell me that before, dear.

546
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,340
The graying of the nude subgeniuses.

547
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,280
We didn't use much of that on the video that's on YouTube.

548
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,220
Well, how bleak can you possibly be?

549
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,200
I don't understand what the hell you're talking about.

550
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,700
It sounds like somebody...

551
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
It sounds like some kind of faulty role.

552
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,920
Well, let me put it this way, Dave.

553
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,000
It's okay to feed the nude seniors at Wisteria.

554
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,720
It's okay to feed them.

555
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:53,860
I didn't mean to say that.

556
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,380
Yeah.

557
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,120
It's okay.

558
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,400
So, are you saying that many seniors line up,

559
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,300
dressed up like Canada geese or ducks,

560
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,820
and wait for a little small animal cracker to survive on for the next three weeks?

561
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,920
No, no.

562
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,340
They usually have...

563
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,840
They're well-fed, but they'll take more, you know, if you've got it.

564
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,920
They're tame.

565
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,400
You won't be wrecking their ability to survive in the wild

566
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,060
just by getting...

567
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,060


568
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,980
You're giving the nude seniors food.

569
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
But if you...

570
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,060
Then they'll hang around, so maybe you don't want to give them food.

571
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,200
Right.

572
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,460
And who would want a membership card either if they're, like, on the Internet?

573
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,500
They let you know.

574
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,740
They called you, or they emailed your house and said,

575
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,760
Congratulations, you're now a member of the Nude Seniors Club.

576
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,480
Ew!

577
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,460
That would be revolting.

578
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,400
Not to other seniors.

579
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,020
We get used to that kind of thing.

580
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,820
To many other seniors.

581
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,280
No.

582
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,340
Now, I'm not one who does that.

583
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,960
And actually, X-Day doesn't have a whole lot of that.

584
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,040
But Starwood sure does.

585
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,380
Old, bare-naked people that are old and bare-naked?

586
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:08,880
Yeah.

587
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,720
Yeah.

588
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,040
I love it when people get horribly offended by that.

589
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,080
It's like, how dare that old person walk around just showing everything?

590
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:24,500
Well, why don't you just leave, then?

591
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,680
If you've never seen anything.

592
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,480
What's that old lady said?

593
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,320
Well, if I see something I've never seen before, I'll just shoot it.

594
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
That should be your attitude, friend.

595
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,880
It's nothing you have never seen before.

596
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,500
Some of them will give you the baby bird special for only eight bucks.

597
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh, what is that?

598
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,440
Oh, if you have to ask, you already know.

599
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,300
Mm-hmm.

600
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,680
Uh-huh.

601
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,500
Yep.

602
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,040
You'll find out.

603
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,520
You guys make me think about that too much, and I don't like it.

604
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,720
Let's go on to the next subject.

605
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,320
The beer feast was lots of fun.

606
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:16,240
There was food also, and lots of weird beer with risque names like Big Red Cock beer and that kind of thing.

607
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,420
And Snarling Gray Squirrel.

608
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,220
Yeah, that's right.

609
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,600
Something like that.

610
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,940
How come beer makers always got to get so creative with them?

611
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,300
Yeah, I know.

612
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,720
I mean, I've seen some of the titles like Snapping Turtle with a college degree and stuff like that.

613
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,840
So somebody like me will buy them and keep the can on a shelf somewhere because it's funny.

614
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,860
I know, and that's even more ridiculous and sad.

615
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,200
IPAs.

616
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,720
Makes me want to go and cry.

617
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,180
I know.

618
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:53,940
There was a lot of wonderful artwork generated like there is at Every X Day because we bring...

619
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,980
Art supplies.

620
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:02,060
Yes, I always bring paper and lots of markers so that people can make drawings.

621
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,100
Yeah, colored markers.

622
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,720
And we have all those drawings and we have real artistes like Dr. Hal and...

623
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,260
And Apostasy Fnord.

624
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Yeah, Fnord.

625
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,440
And Catfeather when she's there.

626
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,160
She wasn't there.

627
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,180
And lots of others with lots of talent like Reverend Vanessa.

628
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,900
And then people like us.

629
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,420
Miss Oginist.

630
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,720
She's wonderful too.

631
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,660
Miss Oginist.

632
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,340
Do you know her?

633
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,320
I don't know Miss Oginist.

634
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,740
That was just something...

635
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,660
She's a little bit on the suicidal side.

636
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,600
I'm glad I don't know Miss Oginist.

637
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,980
Think how many punk singers have given themselves that night.

638
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,260
Three or four for sure.

639
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,420
Especially when they're riding the bus like in a large town like Los Angeles or New York City.

640
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,560
You get on the bus there and you start making up your own weird...

641
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,940
Your own lyrics that you want to...

642
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,560
To impress the bus driver.

643
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,900
Is that what you people are doing on the bus?

644
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,000
You people. You people.

645
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,680
What do you mean you people?

646
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,280
I thought you people were just schizophrenics that were just talking nonsense.

647
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,800
We people are just schizophrenics talking nonsense.

648
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,800
But we're also making a lot of plain and simple European sense, pal.

649
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,880
Well then go back where you came from, man.

650
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,100
I already did.

651
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,860
Go back to England.

652
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,880
Simple European.

653
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,040
Simple European.

654
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,320
Go back to England.

655
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,320


656
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,660
Go back to England.

657
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:27,960
Go back to England.

658
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,180
What's that supposed to be?

659
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,340
Go back to Italy.

660
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,920
Go back to Italy.

661
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,140
I have to go back to...

662
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,560
What would we do there?

663
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,400
We could like stomp in grapes and stuff like that and have with our big smelly feet and

664
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,320
argue about the size of the tomatoes as well.

665
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,400
I mean, come on, man.

666
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,040
America's where it's at.

667
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh yeah?

668
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,340
Oh yeah.

669
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,520
Yeah.

670
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,080
Which job would you rather have?

671
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,600
Well, I don't know what it is.

672
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,620
I'd rather be smacking the vegetables with my feet.

673
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,280
Yeah.

674
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,480
Right.

675
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,160
Yeah.

676
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,460
The old ways are the best.

677
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,820
Yep.

678
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,680
Especially for real old, old, old, old people.

679
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,160
Old souls.

680
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,480
Yeah, especially for old cigarettes too, man.

681
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,360
Have you ever done that?

682
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,320
No.

683
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,960
Not in a long time.

684
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,380
Don't try it.

685
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,640
Yeah, not in a long time.

686
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,620
Hey, we had a workshop in toilet paper launching.

687
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,400
Oh wow.

688
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,360
That sounds so enormously challenging.

689
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,600
Well, when you want to paper a house at Halloween, right?

690
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


691
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


692
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


693
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


694
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


695
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


696
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


697
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


698
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


699
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


700
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


701
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,600


702
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,440
Yeah.

703
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,880
You know, you could just, if you're the high school football star, you can probably throw

704
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,760
the toilet paper real well.

705
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:40,440
But if you're, say, a clown on drugs, you can actually use, what was David Apocalypse

706
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,280
launching that toilet paper with?

707
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,900
Was it like a leaf blower or a heater or something?

708
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,320
Yes.

709
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
I think it was like a hairdryer.

710
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,580
And then there was a roll of toilet paper that was mounted just a couple of feet away.

711
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,580


712
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,580


713
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,580


714
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,580


715
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,540
A couple of feet in front of it so that when you ran the hairdryer, it blew the paper

716
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,640
just perfectly up into the rafters of the building we were in.

717
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,380
Yeah, yeah.

718
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,180
Oh wow.

719
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,920
It made a beautiful arc.

720
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
It really did.

721
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:06,900
It was very impressive.

722
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,240
A lovely arc that looked really good on photographs.

723
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,220
And then, and it did, it went over the rafters and then hung there.

724
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,460
In fact, I had to tear that stuff down so I could, because it was blocking my camera.

725
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,320
I did too.

726
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,620
I was tearing it down too because it had all been so-

727
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,360
Oh, and then people-

728
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,680
And then the clowns, the clowns were like, oh, so you don't like our decorating style.

729
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,080
Yeah, especially in their own particular styles.

730
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,620
Yeah.

731
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,200
I was just thinking, you know, if you could Photoshop this, you could get a picture of

732
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:45,700
Trump's father in his Klan uniform, and then you could Photoshop his face, his son's face,

733
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,880
and the other one and say it doesn't fall far from the tree.

734
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,560
Dave, that's a 12-year-old's face.

735
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
I know.

736
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,220
I've been wanting to see it.

737
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,920
I'd like to see Trump and dad both stand there in their Klan uniforms beaming because, you

738
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,760
know, white people in New York were being persecuted by Catholics.

739
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,700
At least that's what Trump's father said to the New York Post or the New York Times or

740
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,200
I forget whoever.

741
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,520
I don't want to talk about it.

742
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,560
The thing.

743
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,200
Okay, I'm sorry.

744
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,900
The thing that-

745
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,260
I dare not think.

746
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,980
I don't want to even think about the thing.

747
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,940
I don't blame you.

748
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,700
So I'm sorry.

749
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,740
I didn't mean to get your roughage going because I know it's been a long time since you've

750
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,020
eaten dinner and are prepared, so to speak.

751
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:46,940
It's been a long time since I've had a bath, but because of the subgenius soap, soon I can

752
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,700
have one.

753
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,400
C'est bon.

754
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,620
That was one thing that turned up at the Bulldada auction.

755
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,380
We had a whole lot of Reverend Ferg's soap.

756
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,980
What's this company called?

757
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,840
Tri-

758
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:58,980
Triology.

759
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,360
Yeah, Triology Soaps.

760
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:10,800
Dave, did you know that you can get a wonderful scented soap in various different senses with

761
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:20,580
a Dobbs head inside, a silhouette Bob head of soap inside a translucent soap frame?

762
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,460
Yes, it's amazing.

763
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,040
Yeah, Triology Soaps.

764
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,880
They'll try anything.

765
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,520
Well, that sounds like, you know, like if you'd like to escape from this world into

766
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,540
another kind of semi-ridiculous world of your own making, you could go there with the little

767
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:39,540
soap preachers and have them riding Ferris wheels and making bubbles, go buying bubbles

768
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
and stuff like that.

769
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,280
That would be beautiful.

770
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,860
Ferris wheels?

771
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,260
That sounds like something out of Mary Poppins.

772
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,560
Mary Poppins.

773
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


774
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


775
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


776
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


777
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


778
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


779
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


780
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


781
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


782
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


783
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


784
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


785
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


786
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


787
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,560


788
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,880
Mary Poppins Returns, the new one.

789
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,380
Right.

790
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,160
They use the Dobbs head soap and all the kids frolic in the soap.

791
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,280
It's pretty special.

792
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,820
Yeah, the opiate version where they leave the kids in the hot car for three days.

793
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,220
So, anyway, Dave, we got so many recordings, so many shows at X Day, we're not going to

794
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,760
ever, we're not going to need you anymore.

795
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,500
We're going to have to put you out on the ice flow out to pasture.

796
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,720
No, not Dave on the ice flow.

797
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,000
No.

798
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,540
I'm not an Eskimo woman that you can't get.

799
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:20,540


800
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:20,540


801
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,540
I can just take you, say, well, you're stepping in.

802
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,560
It's not time yet.

803
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,160
Well, we didn't do it yet.

804
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:24,620
Yeah.

805
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,480
We didn't.

806
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,300
Okay, well, I'll let you know when you've done it.

807
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,560
I don't want to do it at all.

808
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Oh, well, here's something that I want to do that I have to, Dave, we're going to stop

809
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:45,840
talking a little bit early tonight, in fact, in about a minute and a half, because I have

810
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,060
this wonderful song that's real good for ending a show with.

811
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,540
Mm-hmm.

812
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
I mean, it's just perfect.

813
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,560
Well, good, then I can just sneak this little surprise thing in on you, Reverend Stang.

814
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:57,940
Oh, okay.

815
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:04,580
I have just found out that this special visitor that we have on the show tonight has a subgenius

816
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:04,900
name.

817
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,160
Oh, yeah, that's right.

818
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:14,720
This gentleman sitting here is my brother, my blood brother, and his name in subgenius

819
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,760
is Prince Dejel, king of all the UTIs.

820
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,280
That's my-

821
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:21,660
Not Cosm.

822
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,100
What does UTI stand for?

823
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,320
You got to figure that one out yourself.

824
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,760
You identified tickling-

825
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,240
I make them.

826
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,300
It's a music number.

827
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:34,880
Right.

828
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:40,100
I was kind of rude, and I didn't mention that we had an extra guest in the studio and our

829
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:46,500
house, but yeah, my brother-in-law is here, and he had a different subgenius name before,

830
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,100
I think.

831
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,820
It's always been Prince Dejel.

832
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,140
Oh, yeah?

833
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,740
I just added Prince Dejel.

834
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:49,740


835
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:49,740


836
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:49,740


837
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:49,940
I think that's the ending.

838
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,040
Oh, well, okay.

839
00:50:52,300 --> 00:51:01,840
Anyway, this song I'm going to play almost immediately is by John Shirley from his new

840
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,880
album, Spaceship Landing in a Cemetery.

841
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,800
And he explained to me, he pointed this particular song out.

842
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,400
It's the very last one on the CD.

843
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,680
It's called High.

844
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,140
And he says, it's not about a guy who gets high.

845
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,660
It's about a guy who is falling out of a plane.

846
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,500
He's in a plane, and he's getting ready to, maybe they're going to do skydiving or something,

847
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,280
but his friend who's flying screws up, and the door opens, and he gets sucked out.

848
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:41,360
And the song is this guy singing to you as he plummets earthwards.

849
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,420
Oh, goodness.

850
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:48,840
And it's about five and a half minutes long, and it ends a show.

851
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,800
That's the wonderful thing about this song.

852
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,940
It ends a show.

853
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,160
Okay, well, I'll be seeing you through the afternoon.

854
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:06,960
I'll send you the copy, or I can just fade you out, and you can keep listening to it.

855
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,760
Here, I'll just do that.

856
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,140
How could you fade Dave out?

857
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,440
I have to fade the music out.

858
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,440
Oh, by the way, friends, you're listening to Subgenius, Hour of Slack on...

859
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,640
No, he's gone.

860
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,320
Dave left.

861
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:19,720
Oh, my God.

862
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:19,720


863
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:19,860
He left.

864
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,560
He's gone.

865
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,580
He slammed the door.

866
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,920
He slammed...

867
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,720
Anyway, this is how it ends.

868
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,320
Hi.

869
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,220
Hi.

870
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:54,580
Hi.

871
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,160
Hi.

872
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,260
I'm high.

873
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,240
Flying through clouds.

874
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,860
They're streaming bye, bye, bye, bye

875
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,880
I'm not on drugs

876
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,800
I don't have to try

877
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,560
My attitude is an altitude

878
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,580
You see I'm falling

879
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,340
I'm falling from on high

880
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,380
Quite literally high

881
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,800
Way up in the sky

882
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,320
Up in the sky

883
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:37,100
And that's because I just fell out

884
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,540
Fell right out of an airplane

885
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,620
My friend Jake, he was really big

886
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,720
Such a flake, oh man

887
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,460
He opened the hatch, you see

888
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,780
Yeah, he opened the hatch, you see

889
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:55,780


890
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:55,780


891
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,860
We open the hatch

892
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,400
Plane gives a shake

893
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,520
Oh, thanks a lot, Jake

894
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,300
What a fight

895
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,700
I proceed to shoot

896
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,960
Right out the door

897
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,660
Now I'm falling through the clouds

898
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,840
And this won't be fun much more

899
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,280
And I'm thinking of a time

900
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,860
When I was with my sons in the car

901
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,200
We were all having a lot of fun

902
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,660
The four of us

903
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,860
Just out for a run

904
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,660
We were laughing together

905
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,360
There was no fear

906
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,460
And there was no

907
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,920
There was no

908
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,740
There was no tension at all

909
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,640
It was like we were in freedom

910
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:23,960
Before

911
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,100
There were no tears

912
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,400
I didn't, I didn't need to drink

913
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,880
Didn't need to get fried

914
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,020
But somehow

915
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,060
Just driving with them

916
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,960
Somehow I felt high

917
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,560
Just me and my kids driving by the lake

918
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,020
And it just felt like

919
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,140
Felt like it was a moment

920
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,680
That would never break

921
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,740
Felt like a moment

922
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,840
That would never break

923
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:20,620
That would never break

924
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,360
Thank you.

925
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,140
Bye.

926
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,680
Bye.

927
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,920
Bye.

928
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,680
Bye.

929
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,300
Bye.

930
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:25,660
Bye.

931
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,160
Bye.

932
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,640
Bye.

933
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,740
Bye.

934
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:24,000
Bye.

935
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,460
Bye.
