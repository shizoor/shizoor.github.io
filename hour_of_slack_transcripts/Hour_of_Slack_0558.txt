This is Joe Offric of the Order of Dionysus Abasios, and you're listening to the Hour
of Slack with Reverend Ivan Stagg.
I want you to suffer from up-against-the-underwear syndrome.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the upper pelvis to the
subgenius hour of slack.
Don't ever try to have a deep personal relationship with a subgenius.
They can't get it on without a pipe.
Don't listen to these guys.
They're really silly.
I personally...
You should always have relationships just with tape recorders.
Have you been in this elevator long, by the way?
I've been here about 20 minutes, and I thought I'd be where I wanted to be by now.
Well, Doug, well, I know just how you feel, pal.
It reminds me of the time in around 1938 when J.R. Bob Dobbs was despairing in his cups,
drunk as hell, at the Hop Frog Tavern in Wichita, California.
He was drinking a bottle of Cicada, honey.
He said to Philo, who witnessed this,
You can lead them to the promised land, but don't expect that to mean they're gonna keep
their promises to you.
Now, ten minutes later, while heading for the bathrooms to puke, Bob met his future
primary wife, Connie Dobbs, for the first time.
time. But again, the thing he's talking about here is not just society at large, but within the church.
These are sins within the church. Here in this seaport dive, women can be bought for what you
pay for a highball, but that doesn't stop men from fighting over them.
And this woman believes that seaweed rubbed into her skin will make her irresistible.
Ah yes, beauty. The magnet that draws the attention of the opposite sex. Desired by all people in all parts of the world.
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And all these women are making themselves more beautiful.
No matter how much it hurts, or how bloody the process. But peculiar ideas are not only women's.
This man is hunting the elixir of youth. Eating freshly killed raw turtle, he believes, is the
most important thing in the world. He believes that the most important thing in the world is to be able to live a life of beauty.

This man believes that a mouse will cure this poor woman's nervous disorder.
I fell into a burning ring of fire. I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire. But eventually you'll melt down. One day
you'll suddenly scream, why the f*** am I killing myself?
But enough of that depressing fare. Hello and welcome to Happyland. The people here in Happyland are very calm.
And the drugs are very effective. Announcements may be heard over our PA system. And as we walk toward Happyland's gates,
let us remind you, no pushing, no sharp objects, and no writing to your family at home. Thank you.
This is a crook.
And perverse nation, my friend.
The devil is in the supermarket. The devil is in the post office. The devil is in the movies and TV. The devil owns this world. It's his.
The world's crawling and the world's crawling. The ones that go in are lean and thin.
The ones that come out are bats and stouts. Your eyes fall in and your teeth fall out. Your brains come tumbling down your snout.
Be merry, my friends, be merry.
Merry Christmas to all and a happy, happy new year.
Oh, dear friends, I'll tell you. I think I'd be a serial killer without y'all to help me.

Oh, dear friends, I think I'd be a serial killer without y'all to help me.
I've heard a lot of trouble
Hello, the destruction near my house

It's a very哦

a wonderful year, friends.
The best one since I don't know when.
And life
was great
up until last weekend
when it turned into a living
nightmare.
And to save it, last Saturday
when I would have otherwise been doing a show,
I had to give up
the thing I loved the most
in all the world.
It's true.
I had to quit thinking about her.
Had to banish her
from my mind.
Had to pretend I didn't care at all
while I watched her let the
other guys use her.
And I needed her so bad.
I needed her so bad
that I had to hate her
in order to free myself
from her.
Because even though
she wasn't even thinking about it,
she was hurting me more and more
and more and I couldn't stop coming
back for more punishment.
It was an addiction.
I guess you could say an addiction.
And Bob Dole might not agree with me.
But I really think that's what it was.
And I ain't over her yet.
No, sir.
Not by a long shot.
Even now, I can see her
as if she were floating
in front of my face, just like smoke.
And I want to inhale her
so, so bad.
But I know I must
just say no.
And there are some things
that I guess that phrase does apply to.
I know it's something I have to do.
I know I'll be healthier for it in the long run
if the effort doesn't kill me.
But my friends, it just hurts
so bad!
Yes, friends, you guessed it.
Queen Tobacco
broke my heart.
Lady Tobaccy.
Sister Nicotine.
Miss Conspiracy herself.
Tore my poor heart in twain.
Just as she's done to so many
countless millions of other fools
before me.
Now, this ain't no New Year's resolution
I'm talking about, friends.
This was a soul-searing battle.
It has been for 25 years.
But this was D-Day.
I was again
faced with two
divergent paths, my friends.
Life or death.
And life without
her is gonna be hard.
Hard, hard, hard.
But life with her
will be shorter.
She's so sweet.
She is so fine.
She's the finest.
But sooner or later,
she sucks you dry.
The slack is gone
and a bunch of black gunk
and scar tissue has taken its place.
And, friends,
you feel
dumber than human.
But,
but,
last Saturday, my friend,
I decided since everything else in the world
was going totally to hell
and life was an endless struggle
and only the fittest and the meanest
survive,
hell, why not?
There's no time like the present.
Dump her before she finishes
dumping me.
Big time.
And one must
draw on one's own.
There's hidden reserves
of self-respect
and strength of character
and sheer, giant,
ego-driven,
gut-blowout,
subgenius will.
In fact, if I'm, hell,
if I'm gonna break one bad habit,
I might as well break them all.
Bring them on, man.
Where's a chair?
I'll smash it.
Sit down as a habit.
Where's a clock?
Oh, I already smashed all those last year
when this happened.
Where's the pathetic, blitherin' little human?
I'll be glad if I get her.
to gut it!
He's suffering a human
to live. Now that's a nasty habit,
ain't it? Where is the
conspiracy? Let me at him!
I mean, I'll tell you what, I'll just
say no! Damn it!
Now how many of you can make that
New Year's resolution and keep it,
huh? Just say no to the conspiracy.
I want to see you do it. Resolve
that you're going to break the conspiracy
habit this year.
Just try it.
And by gobs, friend, if you do try it,
if you do just try it,
well, maybe this time
you'll actually do it!
You've invested in things,
and when that eventual crisis hits,
you'll fold like jello
and won't be able to lead yourself
because you won't have any handle on the deeper meaning
of your life.
And that meaning only comes through
understanding, and unless you learn
to understand and see, you're doomed.
The rest of your life, pure
confusion, never knowing
what lays beyond doubt and fear.
Sure,
look to your friends, but they're no help.
They're as confused and directionless
as you are, and besides,
why should they want to help you?
Unless, of course,
there's something in it for them.
Sure, maybe some friend brings you the latest
packet
of self-help seminar
series from the latest...
the latest anointed expert
who knows you and your empty searching friends
will gobble up his 12-step formulas
for getting ripped off
and toss them away when you get tired
or bored.
But you're so filled with doubts
that you dive into the package anyway,
hoping you just might get a kernel or two
of useful information, which will calm
a few fears long enough to forget
what the experts said.
Then, bammo!
You're right back facing your day-to-day reactions
to the day-to-day, since you haven't
got the time, energy, or discipline
to really change your life.
Or do you, dear friends?
Or do you?
Personally, I think that you probably do.
You know, one can follow that line of thought
for a goodly while.
One can, as Mr. Thought Alchemy there
was talking about.
Sure, maybe you failed utterly the last
hundred tries.
Guess what?
I got 150 rejection slips
for the Book of the Subgenius.
Now, can you imagine that?
But I kept sending them out.
Now, maybe your every previous attempt
to follow your dream climaxed
with you dreaming about the day
that you'd start planning to pursue your dream.
Well, now maybe you ought to try
getting off of your butt
one more time.
Of course, there's something to be said
for just plain giving up,
as that great old subgenius,
uh, wino, said in the temple,
if I can't whoop it, I'll go down.
And that's exactly what I had to do, friends.
I had to quit.
But whatever it is, you have to,
you do have to do it.
Even if not doing something is what you have to do.
Slack is not the same as sloth and indolence.
Not necessarily, anyway.
I, personally, have always found that the most, you know,

slack comes from action.
When I am in the zone, the pure act of the action,
the pure do of the doing,
with total concentration,
flying with the equipment and the words effortlessly,
not even thinking, even when the phone is ringing
in the background, but just doing.
Those are my moments of true slack
when one is most alive.
Oh, but friends, you know, I was letting, you know,
That which I thought made me alive.
Kill me!
I was getting too uptight.
I was pushing too hard.
I was working too hard for slack.
Again.
Not gliding, but forcing.
And when you try to force it, slack hardens.
It becomes like a wall.
Like cornstarch in liquid suspension hardens like a rock if you hit it.
But it's like water if you caress it.
The most devilish trick, friends, is finding that delicate balance between too much and not enough.
Oh, by the way, did you know that we recently found the bottom half of that old memo from Bob?
You know, the top half said,
Too much is always better than not enough.
The bottom part says,
But it's almost as bad.
And friends, you gotta figure out the balance.
But you can't learn that unless you try and try again.
Screw up and screw up again.
Screw up, but admit that you did, and do it better the next time.
Easy for me to say since right now, but personally, I'm in the kind of mood where I'd rather be killing optimists.
In fact, I'm going through a nicotine fit like you wouldn't believe.
I haven't had to do an hour of slack without five packs of cigarettes going through my lungs during that hour.
In five or six years, at least.
And in fact, I would very much like to go out and kill, kill, kill.
To crush and destroy all in my path.
Hell, it's better than sitting here just dreaming about it.
I'll break every habit and every law, too.
I'll go through a 50th total lifestyle rebuild before I let the forces of entropy devour any more of myself.
I'll go through a 50th total lifestyle rebuild before I let the forces of entropy devour any more of myself.
That is my New Year's resolution, YES!
That is my Christmas present to myself.
I'm good enough.
I'm smart enough.
And gosh darn it, people like me.
I'm good enough.


Walking through the ghost bar,
Walking through the ghost bar,



Feeling really hopeless.
And wondering how I ever will see through this darkness.
And that drop of blood can be so beautiful.
And I sure was bleeding the drops by the bucket full.
I have a strength to endure.
And all the love that's pure.
I have a strength to endure.
I have a strength to endure.
Because, because, because,
I'm not afraid to tell her,
I'm not afraid to tell her,
Just how things work.
Just how things work.
I ride a hurricane through the fast lane,
I ride a hurricane through the fast lane,
Always looking over my shoulder.
She said there's something about you and,

Neonites always go hot.
Baby we can see this through,

Just give me all the strength you got.
I have the strength to endure.
I have the strength to endure.
And all the love that's so pure.
I have the strength to endure.
Because, because, because,
Be cool, be cool.
Because.
Because.
Because.
I have the strength to endure.
And all the love that's so pure.
I have this terrain to endure
Because, because
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work
Ride a hurricane through the past day
Always looking over my shoulder
She said there's something about you
And neon lights always glow hot
Baby, we can see this through
Just give me all the strength you've got
I have this terrain to endure
And all of us are so pure
I have this terrain to endure
Because, because
I have this terrain to endure
And all of us are so pure
I have this terrain to endure
Because, because
Yeah
Oh, I don't know what I'd do
Without the Ramones, too, sometimes

Yes, friends, that's Zug's riff from his CD Villagers.
I believe that Joe Newman may also be one of the musicians on that.
But so, so, dear friends, I have resolved to turn from the quick-fix comforts of my old mistress,
the demon weed from hell, cigarettes,
and devote myself solely to that true and faithful wife,
Frop.
Have a Frop Zippy Lops, friends.
No more.
Will the soul.
Eaters get my 20% interest?
No, sir.
And despite the sheer mind-obliterating, total relentless agony of giving up her,
I shall deal with it.
Because that's the only thing you can do, friends.
I'm no Superman.
In fact, I'll admit that I must sate my physical desires
with...
with a plastic lover.
My little fantastic...
plastic fantastic lover, I call it.
A little square patch slapped upon a hairless part of my skin daily.
21 milligrams of the master molecule.
Next month, 14 milligrams.
Then six.
And by then, you forget.
And no longer must you obey.
The master molecule.
Ha!
Until...
You're sure you got it licked.
Just when you know you got it licked and you quit worrying about it,
that's when the demons leap out of hiding and hit you with their big guns.
But this time, my friends, I know.
I know.
I actually know that I shall defeat them.
But I...
For anybody who thinks about doing this,
the patches are a big help.
They make a heck of a lot of difference.
Five bucks a patch.
Cheaper than what I was spending on merits, actually.
And funny how the insurance companies won't pay for them.
No, they won't pay for cancer prevention.
I just...
I just...
Makes you wonder who's really running things, you know?
Makes you wonder where...
The war on what?
We're having a war on what?
But I tell you, if they made a frot patch,
I'd replace my clothing with those.
I'd make a wet suit out of frot patches.
But seriously, folks, I had a mean, I mean a vicious cigarette habit.
Just like every teenager nowadays.
And just like every teenager, I started out thinking I'd...
I'd just smoke one now and then for the buzz.
Thought I was too smart to get hooked.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Friends, I'm sorry. What am I doing?
What am I doing?
I'm not that kind of a pretty person.
I'm not that kind of a preacher.
I ain't that kind of a preacher.
Um...
Yeah!
Huh!
I don't mean to preach at you, friends.
I'll tell you what I'd much rather do.
I'd much rather hit you upside the head with a stick.
That's what I'd like to be doing right now,
is hitting every one of you right across the face
with a great big stick with big red straps.
Oh, and speaking of sticks with dead guys nailed to them,
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Hanukkah,
Hail Satan, Praise Bob, Nam-Yo-Ho, Ren-Gek-Yo,
Moe, Larry Curly, and Him-sa!
Ah...
Ah, it feels a lot better.
It feels so much better to hate.
How can they deny us our hate, friends?
I just don't get it.
And you know, Christmas is...
Needless to say, as everybody points out,
the most depressing of holidays.
That special time when so many take time out
to find suicide in their hearts.
When the subgenius skulks through the malls,
hating and hating all the happy, chappy faces
and well-dressed people and piped-in,
ever-present Christmas carols
and the forced dinners with the family
who are mostly pinks or else crazy.
And...
And...
Well, the presents are cool.
And...
And then...
Everybody gets all drunk and weepy on New Year's and...
I know I'll be the weepiest bastard of them all this time, too.
I can already see it coming.
But let me tell you one thing, boys and girls.
Nobody hates Christmas as much as Jesus.
And, you know, I wanted to let Jesus speak for himself
on this show, this...
special New Year's Christmas hate-smoking show.
Um...
Because he had a lot to say, but...
But you know what?
He had to work.
He had to work for the conspiracy
because they don't pay Jesus enough
at the Subgenius Foundation.
He has to do these temp jobs
displaying Web TV
and the Subgenius website, actually,
in shopping malls.
Jesus!
And that was one thing that ticked him off.
He said, how come there's a million Santa Clauses
and there's only one of me?
Who's the important guy here?
And why...
And, you know, he has to...
Of course, Easter is a lot harder on him.
He really hates Easter.
But he was, uh...
He was saying, man, I've got to drive by these manger scenes
in these rich people's front yards
and in front of schools and stuff.
And it's so humiliating for my dad, you know,
to think about my dad.
Everybody thinks he never even made it with my mom or something,
which is ridiculous.
And, uh...
You know, it's like, oh, my God.
They never put the little brown piles all around the manger, you know.
And on top of that, I didn't get any presents.
There weren't any wise men.
There were some grays, apparently,
but that was later on.
Friends, like I say, unfortunately,
Jesus couldn't make it to talk to you about Christmas
because he, um, had to work.
Ain't it ironic, though,
that the only stations that would even play tapes
of the real Jesus Christ live nowadays talking
are subgenius stations that carry the hour of slack?
You have to wonder, what...
What is this world coming to?
I mean, poor Lord, you know.
I can see how he'd feel.
You know, there's all these guys dressed as Santa Claus
with little kids sitting on their laps.
Where's the guys dressed as Jesus with little kids?
Whatever, you know, sitting on his lap or praying.
Of course, that's the problem.
God, the newspapers around here.
We've got some ill-behaved preachers in Dallas
of non-subgenius denominations.
Every week, one of them molests a kid
or beats his wife or, um...
Oh, God, just sexual harassment cases.
Not to mention Robert Tilton.
All of them here in Dallas.
It's just one after another.
It makes...
It makes me ashamed of myself
because my behavior pales in comparison.
Sometimes I feel like I let y'all down, you know,
that I haven't been...
keeping up with the Swaggerts.
Haven't been keeping up with the Barry Baileys,
the Bob Tiltons.
But we'll make up for it, friends.
I guarantee you.
We're gonna make up for it.
We got plenty of time left.
I bought myself a few extra tickets.
I'm gonna make up for years by...
by breaking this evil habit.
I know I have.
I haven't done a damn lick of work all week.
But, man, I've got some stuff.
Wait until you see.
Anyway, let's prepare to go to side two of show.
This seems like an awfully long show
for one side.
I...
Like it's...
Anyway.
Time stretches out, you see,
when you're waiting.
For something you know must never come.
The end.
Wow, isn't it amazing
how the music will help you out like that?
That's Nina Rota music
from Federico Fellini's great film,
Eight and a Half,
my favorite movie of all time, I think.
And, uh...
You don't know what the heck I'm talking about.
And frankly, I just don't care.
I don't care, I don't care.
Because I'm a crazy man.
I'm crazy.
I can't...
I've got a Nick Derm patch on.
And I can't even drink coffee
because it makes me want to smoke too much.
But I'll tell you what it...
All of this makes me want to do.
It makes me want to rat my fool head off
so loud that it destroys everything within sight.
Just...
I'll rat this microphone if that's what it takes.
I'll take my cue from the great church of new faith.
Please, Bob!
Please, Bob!
Kill Bob!
Maybe we should go to...
Back to tapes.
Christmas tapes.
Happy Christmas tapes for side two.
I don't know.
Maybe we should look at Book of the Subgenius
and see what's predicted for 1999.
Maybe we should do both.
Maybe I'll just go on and on and on like this
in this strange limbo.
This purgatory
where Joe Camel
humpeth not
and nay,
not even the Marlboro Man
hacks and coughs his
hour upon the stage.
It is a fropped stick
smoked by an idiot
full of...
bugs and resin
signifying...
MONKEY!
Tree walking brain socket.
Doctors.
Huff.
Huff.
Huff.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No, it won't be Christmas tapes
because I pulled out my old faithful copy
of Book of the Subgenius,
my old tattered, leather-covered,
blood-smeared, semen-encrusted preacher's copy here.
And, uh, and I looked at the...
predictions in this holy book.
I looked at Dateline for Dominance.
I looked at 1996.
And I looked at what's coming up for 1997.
And I thought,
my God, you know,
it's been a long time since I looked at these.
I thought I'd memorized it all.
But I'd forgotten and all of this stuff happened.
1996.
Now, remember,
this book was published in 1983.
Bob spoke of things that would come.
And they did.
1996.
Greenhouse effect reversed by Bob Science.
You notice any greenhouse effect going on?
There is some greenhouse effect.
But believe me,
this would be Waterworld
if Bob Science had not intervened.
And did we even ask for credit?
Nuff said.
By the way,
it...
Hey, what happened to my messengers of deception?
Anyway, friends,
you...
Anybody who can disprove anything that I'm about to say,
have at it.
Also in 1996,
this was predicted.
Bob unmasks anti-Bob
as perpetrator of the Ice Age
and exposes the bowels of the conspiracy.
Whoa.
I'd say the conspiracy...
We're swimming in the conspiracy's bowels, friends.
I guess in a way that was already exposed.
But look what happened in the presidential election.
A perfectly good crippled war hero
couldn't even get elected by our people in this country.
She couldn't even think about ethics.
All they could think about was the economy.
World War V.
Between Bob Crusaders and minions of the anti-Bob.
Okay.
It happened.
Hey, I was there.
I don't know about you.
It was a hell of a bomb.

It was a battle.
The newspapers didn't write about it
because it was between the Bob Crusaders
and the minions of the anti-Bob.
The other anti-Bob.
They ain't gonna talk.
See, it's a controlled media.
Bob wins this war,
and he did, obviously,
or we wouldn't be here,
but only after traces of the elixir trademark
is released into the atmosphere,
causing the dream plagues.
And I think you all can agree with me
on the point that the dream plagues
have indeed shown themselves.
All of this, it says,
takes place in the first three months of the year.
Rest of the year finds world at peace
for the first time,
and that's certainly been true.
There have been a few commercial wars,
but Bob wasn't talking about it.
Commercial wars hadn't even been invented in 1983.
Well, they'd been invented.
They were being planned,
but they hadn't really been sponsored.
Longevity drugs and drugs.
Gravity drugs released,
but in short supply.
Well, obviously, it was in short supply.
Another prediction came true.
Couldn't even buy them.
Didn't hear about them.
Considerable rioting,
especially by elderly persons.
Well, they're the easiest ones to shut up quick now,
aren't they?
1996.
Church reveals secrets of fornicationalism.
Trademark.
Code retrieval from cosmic archives.
Other excess derived theories.
Now, hey,
if you don't have a computer
and can't check out the website,
don't complain to me,
but it's all there in black and gray.
Printed on hand-picked electrons
and little special mutated pixels,
gene-spliced pixels that we create ourselves.
Bob now trying to prepare world for visit from Planet X.
Well, we certainly did that all 1996.
Now completely subdued,
sub...
No, actually, hmm.
Now completely subgenioid
are more than half of the world's nations.
Populations are still primarily pink or normal,
but almost all leaders take orders from the church.
Well, now...
We might have been wrong on that one,
but we don't know.
We don't know who the leaders are really taking orders from.
It may be Bob.
Things are senseless enough that that could easily be.
The chaos in the world,
the chaos in today's newspapers,
could easily be the very spore of Bob Dobbs,
the footprints,
the so-called cotter pins, so to speak.
1996, immortality drugs developed,
bootlegged, yet more rioting.
Okay, that'll happen.
Average lifespan now considered to be 150
if death by cataclysm is not counted.
Well, two moot points.
Of course, those didn't make the news.
Ghosts are recognized as citizens and given voting rights.
That did happen in Burma.
Overpopulation becomes so bad
that most people give up fighting it.
Score another one for Bob.
There is another baby boom,
partly inspired by subgenius fertility rights.
Bob continues assuring world, quote,
not to worry.
And seventh...
Hey.
Hey.
Like I say,
I don't know what radio stations you've been listening to,
and 7,000 Americans in 1996
will defect to Malaysia,
the new church headquarters,
and that is indeed what happened,
although the church headquarters does remain in Dallas.
We have a new building there.
Bob perhaps may have been seeing the Temple of...
And what do we have coming up for 1997, dear friends?
Now, this is from the word of Bob.
This is from page 121
of Book of the Subgenius.
Simon & Schuster edition.
1997.
Nuclear chain reaction across the face of Europe.
Oh, that ought to be fun.
Ghosts identified as the culprits,
then revealed by Dobbs to be Nazi hell creatures
masquerading as dead people
in order to subvert subgenius
and speed up arrival of the New Age world order,
which is, of course, enslavement of the humans
by the demon.
The heroes, the supersonic Nazi hell creatures
from beneath the hollow Earth.
Oh, go ahead and laugh.
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Funny, funny.
Wait until March 30th,
morning edition of the paper shows up,
and suddenly that movie Mars Attacks
won't be so funny either.
World, space, hollow Earth, war one.
That's like World War I,
but it also involves space and the hollow Earth
for the first time.
New York City nuked.
Sorry, you WFMU.
New listeners, you'll have to tune in somewhere else.
Sea monster Leviathan attacks coastal cities.
The Elder Gods are summoned.
I'm surprised it hadn't been done yet.
Scouring of planet.
Humanity brought together by common foes, so to speak,
defeats invaders using newly released secrets
of time control, time addiction.
Living clones of Elvis, Hitler, Jimi Hendrix,
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
lead mankind to finally,
and Martin Luther King Jr.,
finally lead mankind to crush forever
the threat from the hollow Earth.
Unfortunately, details were unclear to Bob on this one.
Humans worldwide will be inoculated
against future accidents with the elixir.
Of course, man, you're gonna love those inoculations.
They never wear off.
Bob will go in, next year, friends,
Bob will go on television for the first time in 40 years
and make a speech,
which will move billions to tears.
Bob and the Church of the Subgenius Hierarchy
will be installed as lords
over the entire governmentless Earth.
You know, maybe y'all better be nice to me for a change.
And, uh, oh, and the last thing,
late in 1997,
cheap, brittle fiber-cutting,
composition broomsticks will be introduced.
Friends, you can invest in those broomsticks now.
We're going to manufacture those broomsticks,
because we know, because of the word of Bob,
what the next fad's gonna be.
How long can they shock their parents
by cutting slits down their privates
and hanging padlocks from them?
Uh-uh.
The broomstick up the...
the end...
shall be the new coolness.
Anyway, friends, we here at the Church of the Subgenius,
you know, having gone over that...
that prediction,
that true prediction of the way things will be,
we here at the Church Headquarters in Dallas
wish you, sincerely,
a very happy new year,
because it's the last one you're gonna have.
1998 won't last a whole year.
When you get that 1998 calendar,
you might as well do just what Dr. Legume did,
just tear it in half,
tear the whole back end off,
starting at July 6th, 1998,
because my friend, my sister,
there ain't gonna be a July 6th, 1998.
Ahimsa.
No, that ain't what I mean.
What I mean to say is,
AHIMSA!
You are fans,
far and near.
We're so glad you can all be here.
And when life gets oh, oh so hard,
you make it all worthwhile.
Screaming, shouting, whims, ranting,
and a wild hit, bang, and smile.
This is dedicated to
our fans across the world.
You're the best, most loyalists,
and that's for sure.
When life gets oh, so frustrating,
you make it all worthwhile.
Gonna have some fun tonight,
ain't it great to be alive?
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
You've got the feelings about this year.
All is very well, CJ is here.
Magic cheer spells for hope.
Let's get into gear.
It's the year that most are gonna be here.
Real funky, by yourself, the feeling.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
It's gonna be, and you're the only ones who understand.
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
You're the only ones who understand
Who understand
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
And so with great joy in my heart
I press the button that will light up
this beautiful symbol of brotherhood and love
And just as his finger touches the button
Bob?
With Astroscope
Here's something my wife could use in the house
An interocitor incorporating an electron sorter
Hey, I need one of those
Since we got all the hot, hot, hot mixing equipment
We've been having a lot of fun
Haven't we, Dr. Dogs and Maddox?
Haven't we?
Like a little kid at Christmas
And finally November
And the glow of the sun
Just don't go away
As sure as there's an X in Christmas
It's already almost Christmas
If you look around today's stores
Bye, bye, bye
Let's just call off
And rename the whole season
Advert
Advert
Advert
Advert
Advert
Advert

Advert, of course
Advertize
It's an advertising mechanism
As sure as there's an X in Christmas, folks
Welcome to Consumer Society
Chipmunks roasting
Personally, myself, I'm hoping it's gonna be a big disco kind of Christmas this year
I want it to be a Kung Fu Christmas
Could either of you describe a disco Christmas?
Well, that's when they play lots of music like this in the background
Wow
And everybody dances to Jesus
Wow
You know, the Church of the Subgenius
In cooperation with the papacy
Is actually going to be releasing a chocolate Jesus confection
That's right
For Easter
So you heard it here first
Silver wrapped for your protection
I mean, none of this pagan fertility rabbits and eggs thing
You know, none of that
We're gonna get back to basics
Chocolate Jesus is one of the ways we're gonna get back to basics


And ways to get back to children
Chocolate Jesus on cross by yours and the hell
Yeah
Marshmallow and peanut
Yeah, don't eat the head
The bleeding head
Extensively promoted by J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Pope
Both friends of KHSU and Arcata
There's a spot for you in the sofa room
Do you think we could lobby for a papal visit?
Papal? Like Papal Magdalene?
No, like do you think we could have the Pope come to Arcata?
And bless the Church of the Subgenius?
No, he might come to Arcata and we could bless him
Well, we have the Church of the Subgenius
Shroud of San Francisco?
We subsist entirely on faith
We don't need proof
Proof is
Faith is our proof
Absolutely, absolutely
Just like any
If I'm this faithful
Respecting modern religion
Yeah, if I'm this faithful
You better look damn well, believe it
Absolutely
The James Bond of world religions
We and other non-pinks like us
Will be saved by salvation alone
By pure faith in J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Pope
When that day comes
And that day
Yes, and the only religion that lets you talk over any radio for Bob
That's right, you can talk over any radio for Bob
Do it now
And we also allow you to see another dimension on your television
Which some religions will not allow you to do
This is true, we will also advocate free sexuality, free speech
Um, do you think J.R. Bob Dobbs would advocate pro-choice?
Pro-choice? Um
Continuously pro-choice
I mean, perhaps he'd choose
There's no doubt about pro-choice
Oh, to whom are we speaking?
I think he'd choose Vanilla Springer
I think he'd choose
Remy Lack
Remy Lack
Grendel?
Good stuff
Grendel, put your hand on the show
Touch the show
I'm touching it
Touch yourself
Ooh, I feel it, it's sacrament
And so the law was passed making every day of the year Christmas
And there were great changes throughout the land
But did it make boys and girls happy?
One year later, and the children have had Christmas every day for a year
Once again, it's December 24th
And the same two little boys are trying to make Christmas a reality
And they've got a diploma

Hello, Norman
Hello, Joey
What've ya got there?
A sled
How many sleds you got?
364
Me, too
How many footballs you got?
364
How many roller skates you got?
Seven hundred twenty-eight
Hey, here comes Santa Claus again
Merry Christmas
Well, hello, children.
Merry Christmas.
What's so funny?
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking.
Calling Santa Claus.
Come in, please.
Calling Santa Claus.
Come in, please.
Oh, Santa Claus.
Come in, wherever you are.
Funny, huh?
Well, you're all scurrying around finding the ornaments and the lights.
I'm going to make some popcorn.
Then I take out our special extra-long Yule log.
That's the biggest log we've ever had, Dad.
Yeah.
I want it by the window.
We had it there last year.
I want it in the middle of the room.
Mm, it surely smells good.
I think we should put it by the window again so the people outside can see it.
Mom always settles all of the arguments.
Christmas means many things to many people.
To some, Christmas means glittering lights, gaily-wrapped gifts.
That's right, sounds of laughter and good cheer.
To the folks at Preparation H.
And to the Roto-Rooter Man, it means Bob at Post Office Box.
Hey, I'm going to give that Post Office Box again.
You might as well get the pencil and write it down this time,
and then I won't have to do this next time.
We really want to force-feed the free information down your face, dear friends.
And after that, you will take that whole log happily.
Just write for free information from Bob at P.O. Box 140306.
That's Box 140306.
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.
And now, this.
