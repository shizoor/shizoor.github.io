But let's leave things
Of this world behind
And walk now down the path of Bob
For this brief minute of slack
From the church of the
South
of genius.
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart.
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs.
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations where mommy and daddy get up in the morning and
go to work and they kiss the kids goodbye.
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye, kind of a simultaneous
goodbye and hello.
Then they get home about seven o'clock, ticked off to use the polite term after a long drive
back out to the suburbs.
They get home, they kiss their kids hello and good night and they go to bed.
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family is because the kids see a little
tittering, stupid, sexy gags on television or because of the new permissiveness where
men are allowed to do things with other men.
That's a bunch of holy hooey, I say, my friend.
I say, oh, why not legalize pornography and ban work?
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.
Most of these kids these days grow up.
They don't have parents.
They got some kind of robot scarecrows.
No, friend, let there be slack.
This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
You'll soon detect, friends, that this episode, number 1850, is a rerun of coincidentally
number 850 from 2002, a time when I was still ambitious.
I was desperate and robust enough to go gallivanting all over the country constantly like a crazed
cowboy preacher, doing live shows in bars and occasionally theaters.
That time is past, but that's okay because you can still learn how to spell the name
of Bob.

Yes, friends, that was a total remix of B.O.B.,
the song by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band
that everyone always thought was Devo.
And for not bad reason, as you'll soon see
as we progress into this great spaz music month
on Hour of Slack.
Yes, this and the next couple of shows
will be mostly music, friends,
almost like real radio shows.
But wait until you hear what has been crammed
full length into the church of the subgenius.
Indeed, friends, all the cramming made this
particular show late.
And I don't apologize.
During the last few weeks, we,
that is, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank,
have spouted and spewed our way through
the subgenius revival in Indianapolis
and then the week-long 5X Day Drill
and then the week-long pagan hippie event Starwood
and then the wedding at Ground Zero
in New York City of the sex executioner from Noir
and his lovely bride, Andrea.
And then, then, friends, the devotional
or Devo convention in Cleveland last Saturday
and last Sunday, another defival,
by some accounts the greatest yet,
in Akron, Ohio, crucible of mutation.
And at each of these subgenius events,
about a dozen people each handed me CDs
to play on this show.
And I downloaded some of my old,
old-timey music favorites from Blobster.
All manner of songs and songs, friends,
that I couldn't afford when they were LPs,
but now I can in their illegal MP3 bootleg form.
And so, tonight and coming up,
we have new and old from Occupant.
Little Theodore, the Great Groovy Neptune,
Johnny Cash, Mark Mothersbaugh, Captain Beefheart,
Onan's Floatan Band, Sister Melodious Chops,
Elvin.
And I'm your host, Chris Costello.
The original cast of Guys and Dolls
and this great new band that played at the Akron defival
heard in the background called the Amino Acids.
And perhaps most startling and X-rated of all, friends,
a new album, actually a two-disc set from Reagan's Polyp.
Yes, Reagan's Polyp's new album or set, Love Overdrive.
It's kind of a best of.
And before I play this Reagan's Polyp song,
I should mention that this is a real album available on Amazon.com
with slick packaging, including liner notes by none other than me
and the famous folk singer, Bob Dylan.
Very strange, friends, but so is Reagan's Polyp.
This song is called Develop Revolutionary Consciousness.

They call you Lady Luck
Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have
a very unladylike way
of running out
You're on a date
with me
The pickings have been lush
And yet
before this evening is over
you might give me the brush
You might forget
your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I
can do is to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me
A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair
It isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
So let's keep the party polite

All the guys you've been with

A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me
When I've spent my life on this road
So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fella you came in with

At the Moor Down, noon in downtown, bodies with no feet
At the Moor Down, down in Youngstown, bodies got the blues
At the Moor Down, noon in downtown, bodies with no shoes
A napkin head wound in a fifty-five dodge, didn't mean to do it
But a sidewalk run in the loom, they summoned in the one, he had to lose it
At the Moor Down, down in Kentown, got the Acubeat
At the Moor Down, the Robotech sound, got to move your feet
It's a retro sound, you can spread around, the way the Spark Boys used to do it
Yeah, it's time to use it
Sure, after all the fall, an acupunct's here to prove it

And now an old favorite of mine
By Elvis Costello
Whose bass player was into Bob
Mother, father, I'm here in the zoo
I can't come home, cause I've grown up too soon
I got my sentence, I got my command
They said they'd make me major if I met off any man
I could be a carpenter, carpenter, but it's mere
I'm a general manager, I'm a large establishment
They pass them the fives on the back and put some to the ride
But I never thought they'd put me in the good squad
They come to look you over and they're giving you the eye
Good squad
The white suits are called out to play, you better say goodbye
Some grew up just like the dads and some grew up too far
Some go drinking with the lads, some don't grow up at all
You must find the proper place for everything you see
But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me
I could join a chain of males or be the best of the league
But looking far I like your girl to put me in the peak
They pass them the fives on the back and put some to the ride
But I never thought they'd put me in the good squad
They come to look you over and they're giving you the eye
Good squad
The white suits are called out to play, you better say goodbye
I was gonna say goodbye
Goodbye
theseak
But I remember millones
Good to see you
humanities
queer
spiritual
I never thought they'd put me in the good squad.
They're going to take it over and they're giving you the eye.
Good squad.
No answer to come out to play.
You better say goodbye.
You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless.
You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Time religion, don't give me no affliction.
That old time religion, it's good enough for me.
Ah, it's good enough for you.
Well, come out to show them.
Come out to show them.
Come out to show them.
Come out to show them.
Come out to show them.
Come out.
Come out to show them.
Come out to show them.
Give me that old time religion.
Give me that old time religion.
Give me that old time religion.
It's good enough for me.
Without your new affliction, don't need your new restriction.
Give me that old time religion.
It's good enough for me.
Moonlight on the mind
Nobody wants to play with me
Just because I'm never happy
All the other kids are going up and down slides
While I sit here and philosophize
I've got a world of my own
I see things as they are
Nobody can tell me what to do
Not even you
Nobody wants to play with me
Just because I am not friendly
All the other kids are playing funny games
While I sit by myself and examine my brain
I've got a world of my own
I see things that you don't
Nobody can tell me
What to do
What is good
Though you wish you could
Nobody wants to play with me
Just because I am not sexy
All the other kids are fooling around
While I'm several miles above the ground
I've got a world of my own
I see what is not there
Nobody can tell me how to feel
And all that's real
Nobody wants to play with me
Just because I have no family
All the other kids have wives and jobs
While I live in a house of my own
I play in the garden and think and stop
I've got a world of my own
I see sadness and dirt
Nobody can tell me what is right
Try to fight
Nobody wants to play with me
Just because I am not sexy






Just because I am not sexy
Just because I am old and ornery
All the other kids have grandchildren
They chatter and they squabble
But I ignore them
I've got a world of my own
I see all that I am
Nobody can tell me why I live
You have nothing to give me
This world is specialize on me

You can hear more of them at theaminoacids.com.
That's www.theaminoacids.com.
And now, friends, a song with...
For some reason, deep personal meaning to me.
I'm not sure why.
The King, Elvis.
Oh, I used to be disgusted
And now I try to be amused
But since the wizard got roughed
I'm not sure why

You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes
But when they told me about the side of the parking
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes
Oh, I was watching while you're dancing away
I look at Rex, you're in the echo and sway
How come everybody wants to be your friend?
You know that it still hurts me just to say it
Oh, I know that she's disgusted
Oh, why's that?
Cause she's feeling so abused
Oh, that's too bad
She gets tired of the lust
Oh, I'm so sad
But it's so hard to refuse
Can you say that I'm too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?
Oh, I said I'm so happy
I can't believe it's over now

I'm gonna die
She said, drop dead then left with another guy
That's what you get if you go chasing out the vengeance
Ever since you got me punctured
This has been my sentence
Oh, I used to be disgusted
When I tried to be amused
Since the wings had gotten rusted
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes
But when they told me about the side of the parking
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older
The angels wanna wear my red shoes
Oh
I won't get any older
The angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes
The angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes
The angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes
The angels wanna wear my red shoes
Red shoes


Red shoes



The Angels wanna wear my red shoes
I'm walking in a wonder wonderland
Asked for some water, all I got was sand
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull
Laying down tracks on the road to hell
I'm walking in a wonder wonderland
Asked for some water, all I got was sand
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull
Laying down tracks on the road to hell
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull
I wanna take you to my heaven's road
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old
I wanna fuck my head and death on the road
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old

I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old

The mathematics of the equation just don't add up
It's a paradoxical situation
And while my c*** is in elation
My soul is in...

My soul is in... purgatory
And praying to the demon god at Radio Shack
To give me peace and make the neighbor's dog
Stop telling me to murder the innocents
In the cracks of the sidewalks in New York City

The online world makes me want to care.
And I will go with the lights unfurled to meet my Charlie there.
Well, some will wear their sexy things and turn the lights down low.
Some will grab a brew or two and drink them as they go.
But me, I'm nothing.
I'm the kind of girl to go for a boulder party.
But you won't, or if you will, I'm going online for Charlie.
I'm going online for Charlie.
Well, some will fly to Cameroon.
See you later, Frauen.
And if I'm old, you may not hear
when I'm coming online for you.
He sends me streams of thrilling thought
He opens up my gate
He touches me where he should not
And I can hardly wait
Some like hair that strains apart
Others the beat of a party
You ready now?
But I don't care, just let me start
