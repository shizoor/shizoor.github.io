Does your mother know you're listening to the subgenius hour of slack with a somewhat
sticky rubber diamond stank?
She's listening with you?
That's illegal in 24 states, you know.
I'll bet you let your dog watch you undress for a bit, too.
I mean, praise Bob!
I'll bet you let your dog watch you undress for a bit, too.
In beautiful Sweden.
I was arrested and held as an accessory.
You'll read about it in the probation report.
But, Connie, why didn't you get in touch with me?
Well, I was so terribly ashamed, I didn't want anyone to know.
Take your hands off me!
You can't treat me the way you used to!
I can, eh?
We'll see about that!
You ever been arrested before?
Go on, squawk.
Tell them all about yourself so everybody will know the jam you're in.
Oh, you're not as tough as you think you are.
You're both pretty young to be in a racket like this.
You say you talked about some trouble you girls had.
I can't tell you that.
You mean...
You mean you're afraid to tell me for fear it might uncover other criminal activities you girls were engaged in?
Everybody's talking about Monica, the story of a bad girl.
Labeled by Time Magazine, Sex on the Rocks.
If you're one of those people who giggles like a schoolgirl when anyone uses the word titillate,
you're a prime candidate.
You're a prime candidate to be a registered listener devoted to...
The Subgenius Hour of Squawk.
With the prurient river diving stank, Dr. Johnson bets his covenant trademark that it'll do you a world of good.

There's only a little bit of time left before the end times begin.
What does that mean?
They're pounding their airborne badges into the air.
Into their flesh.
Oh yes, we have our jobs, butt wings, ceremony.
That was nothing because they were placing that on their breasts and pounding it in.
Oh boy.
Yeah, you know, whatever.
The actual badge is on our foreheads, my friends.
Some people do it on the end of their nose.
And I've even heard of a perverse sect in San Francisco that, well, I'll just say that piercing takes on a new name.

And the listeners remain fixed here.

We're going to be going outside of the sphere.
The sphere of humanity is...
I've never really cared for it.
You know, I never really gave a crap.
I was always told I was different, weird,
in some vague, unnameable way.
I wasn't, you know,
I didn't have a cleft palate or anything.
But I just knew I was different.
And when I finally found the actual mother church,
I knew that I was home.
Praise Connie!
Oh, praise Connie is right.
You will now realize that Connie is the one living true black master.
Friends, you see,
and I've been jealous of them.
Piss on each other's turf all they want.
But the whole time Connie's menstrual blood washes away the filth.
It washes away the unclean.
The way it is unclean.
Praise Connie!
Praise Connie!
You are out of control.
Don't worry, Ivan.
The bleeding, spurting side effects are part of the treatment.
I can't play.
My mouth won't do it.
It's just that everybody's milk.
You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack.
Too late to stop now.
You might as well go all the way.
Love is love.
If you listen.
You see, we're dealing in opposites here.
Everything's in reverse, you might say.
He's off.
Here I go.
L traveller, what are you trying to do?
Nothing, I got mess you here.

Welcome to the Internet, folks.
Yesterday I couldn't spell Internet.
Today I'm right smack dab in the middle of it.
I am not a geek.
I am a nerd.
I know you are, but what am I?
Nerd.
Woo!
I'm a nerd.
I know you are, but what am I?
Nerd.

This here is the Colquitt.
Welcome to the Internet, folks.
Yes, I'm a nerd.

Yes, I'm a nerd.

Oh
and quiet and get up just one sight and try it.
...tiny as little collar in bed, hard to stay awake.
And we understand.
We are all babies inside.
And can you sign my enamel?
You'll just have to squeeze it in with a micron.
And that baby's bombosity is washed off the aircraft carrier
with a high-pressure hose in my movie.
Oh, no, I know this part all too well from military school.
You didn't have one of those things?
You live with those things.
These things, you...
You learn to poop those things so you can find them immediately.
You literally swallow these things at lunch and breakfast
just in case you get straight in on a desert island
and you want to have a supply of these things.
And the smell of Brasso, that's the only other thing.
Well, he's got the last one I have.
You swallow these things and you wolf them down with Brasso.
Actually, you know, I grew up with those things,
and so I thought they were really cool
because I realized the whole world...
That was like pre-Gaffer's Tape fastener.
That was the one thing that held the whole world together.
But once Gaffer's Tape was instructed,
in about 1941...
These are the little clips, my friend.
Yes, we're...
How old are you?
Let's view those.
We are eons old.
We are not free to say that on the radio,
but suffice to say you cannot add enough zeros
on the end of the number in order to make sense of it.
You're getting nothing for nothing,
so you tell us how old you are,
then we tell you how old we are.
Wait, are you talking Earth years?
I think she is.
I think she's limited to that thinking, yeah.
I'm not at the realm of you people.
The realm of people?
What kind of derogatory remark is that?
I'm saying I'm not good enough.
I'm just me.
Well, you know, that's probably not for me.
You don't even need to be.
I'm saying I'm just here.
Well, you know, this is the me generation.
So you're right in time.
That must mean you're rather young to be part of the me generation.
I know what you're talking about.
I'm just a kid.
Well, at least that makes one of us.
Hey, look, the car's starting.
Everybody's driving away because that guy wants to meet us at the front door.
There's just some things that we can't really do.
There's a crowd at the door there.
There is?
There are about a thousand people out there.
I think you're carrying...
I think it's signs.
They all want to get...
Stay high.
The signs are facing the street, but I think they say something with down with,
and then I can't make out the last word.
Down with syndrome.
Oh.
He's pressing his nose up against the glass.
Oh, yes.
They're from over there at 10th Avenue.
I forgot.
He's pressing it up against the glass.
I can see it.
That's still one of my favorite moments when you and I are in the elevator with all of the callers.
This is what it's like to be a subjugist walking the streets.
It was so hard not to laugh.
You know what I'd like to know?
Yes, we had that moment.
What normals are to subjugists.
What the hell is that talking about?
You're just babbling.
We're talking about real life.
That really happened.
Yes, we are babbling, but the wise amongst you will be able to discern.
You wouldn't think so if you had been a more constant listener.
You would understand.
I've been listening to this show for four years.
Four years.
I'm in the basement.
Imagine that.
Four years.
Well, of course you're in the basement.
That's where we keep all our listeners.
Now, listen.
I'd like to know...
Yeah.
Yeah.
If I come down to the station...
Okay, we're punching in the record.
Will you come down?
Will you come outside?
No, no, I didn't mean...
Literally, this is info world now.
Will you come outside and meet me?
No, why should we do that?
What is this, some kind of playground thing?
I don't understand.
Come outside.
Are you challenging us to come outside and meet you in the street or something?
No, I just...
I'm a big fan of the show.
Well, I know the show.
Well, I'll tell you.
You can listen to it better from the comfort of your home than you can out in the windy, rainy street.
I don't think you want to come down here.
You're much safer in the house than you're at now.
Okay, newest caller.
What do you think we should do?
I'll be a wonderful...
Did you ever see Salem's Lot?
We are outside your window right now, scratching at the sale.
3D stereogram book.
Oh, all right.
And there's only 26 cents left, folks.
Call it right now.
Who is that guy?
If you have to wait, you know, just bear with us.
We're taking Visa MasterCard.
It's not a problem.
Oh, another pledge break.
Oh, okay.
Oops, I'm sorry.
That's why we have to gather money for...
What station are we on?
Oh, I forget.
Now, remember, we cannot take your Visa Card out of the air, nor your expiration date.
But we can take it over a phone line.
We're sort of young in our hearts, so whatever.
We can bring you the kind of programming that you, the listener, demand.
So, demand, listener.
It's your phone.
Free to demand on this show.
It's like what demand wanted.
Do you believe in those 3D stereogram books?
Yes, we do.
The kind men like.
They're a hoax.
It's a hoax conspiracy put out by the major eyeglass manufacturers.
No, you just can't read them, son.
I don't think so.
If you stare really hard at the 3D books, you'll see the truth.
Just as we, if we look at the science fiction movies, see the truth.
So, it messes up your eyes to force you to buy corrective lenses.
Well, that's true, too.
But that's, you know, that's the same as if you do this too much.
If you want to use your eyes...
If you do what we're doing right now too much, you get hairy hands.
They're all again.
They're suitable for framing.
Yeah.
That's what the cops say to me every time they pull me over.
Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise that church of the subgenius is.
I listen every week to gather evidence and ammunition for the citizens for normalcy.
Let me tell you, we're not going to get those subgeniuses.
We're going to get them right in the gonads.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.
I mean, I don't use words like...
I don't use words like that.
This tape, all about Satanism, drugs, and rock and roll, is proof positive that this so-called church is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket.
All those demented be-ow's-a-bob-kissing-hop-heads make me want to toss my Nestle's dollhouse cookies with their talk of buckets of pills from that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Boy, they're so high on drugs that they can't even keep any continuity in their tapes.
Too many children listen to these tapes and subscribe to the insane doctrines of the subgenius foundation.
They're led down a deceptive road to what these weirdos call slack, like that heathenist idea of nirvana.
I say that slack should be taken up like the excess yarn in my knitting and pulled until it sees the light of a normal day like the rest of us do.
So what should any decent-minded American do when faced with one of these zombies for Bob?
Well, first off, give them a bath in Pine Sol.
They usually stink to high heaven.
Then ship them off to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer.
Well, they'll get bombarded with enough People magazines, arid extra-dry deodorant, and Regis Philbin fan club material, so they won't be able to think anymore the way it should be.
Then they'll feed them real dogma about the glories of the home shopping club, Wingo, Zingo, and the evils.
The Mandingo.
We cannot stand by while our standards and principles are made light of by these possessed fools.
Normals of the world unite.
Oh, dear friends, and quit calling in with those contest answers.
We got all three winners. I can't believe it.
Dave Bales, hey, guy. Great.
Douglas Hooper and, yeah, Reverend Brian.
And that was the Citizens for Normalcy tape you just heard. Thank you.
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocratons, these pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens?
These normals who have made normality the norm?
Pinks. Pinks are but living stereotypes, insensate meat puppets, and mere food tubes who lack and fear the spark of originality that ignites everything.
Yes.
Every person bears some good and there's some bad.
And it's a choice.
You choose whether you want to love or hate that person.
And for myself, I just choose to hate most of them.
We want Uranus and we want him now.
We want Saturn and we want him now.
We want Mercury.
And we want it now.
We want the sun and we want it now.
25 hour day for couples and we want it now!
We will enslave the sun.
The sun will be ours.
We will give you for life.
The earth will give a life to you.
For we shall own the sun.
We shall own the sun.
We shall own the sun.


We want Saturn and we want it now.
We will enslave the sun.
We want Saturn and we want it now.
Gas giants.
We want Mars and we want it now.
We are the asteroids.
We want Venus and we want it now.
We want the sun and we want it now.
Hydrogen reactions.
We want the sun.
Get your hydrogen atoms here.
10 billion year old carbon.
Thanks Bob.
It's made of the old ashes from stars that a long ago went dead.
If everything was fine, everything comes apart one way or another, Bob said.
You better be glad of that.
You should take the old words and smoke it.
Remember what happens when the ashes rise.
Like a mighty phoenix.
Friends, join the church.
Build yourself a noose.
Build your own spaceship.
Build your own spaceship.
Stick it in your pipe.
Smoke it.
Blast off.
What's the matter?
Are you scared?
Are you afraid of college?
Come find out.
Go on down there.
We want the universe and we want it now.
We want the universe as we want it now.
We want the cosmos and we want it now.
We want the cosmos and we want it now.
What is the law?
The subgenius must have slack.
That is the law.
We are not men.
We are evil.
Earth, we must get off.
Wow.
So what are the two possible interpretations?
I mean, just to share with our listeners.
Well, in the most obvious one, we're talking about Earth and saying we must remove our
selves from Earth.
We must get off of the Earth's surface and migrate as much as we can and as soon as we
can.
Even if we must build our own ships, preferably the Xs will come.
The other way that the bumper sticker can be meant is all of Earth, listen to me.
We must get off, man.
It cannot be done as the Xs will lead us.
Anyway, that's the way I think it's called.



Well, just now, we celebrate the complete forgiveness of our country, come him and

They again come and say something like, they say something but nothing.
So it's Ihr reinforcements.

Claw the bark of trees that is the law.
Drink from the street that is the law.
Four legs and run run free four legs and run legs and run legs and run.

The seven seals shall be broken and the first seven seals shall juggle the great circus of beach ball and park and play.
Have a nice park day.
And there shall be plagues, plagues upon the children.
And they've got some pretty damn cool plagues.
You're going to get off on some of the plagues they've got. You'll make the good plagues.
Some of the other plagues, it's a bummer man.
And the great blind press of Jehovah shall squeeze out the stupidity and the dumbassery from the innocent and the guilty alike.
And the great can opener from Al Jazeera.
And the great champion of the game.
