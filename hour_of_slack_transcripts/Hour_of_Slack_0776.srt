1
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,800
The gun is good.

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,740
The gun is good.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,180
The penis is evil.

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,720
The penis shoots seeds.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,580
Jesus Christ, no, it's still coming.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,180
It hasn't even been touched.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,480
It's shooting lightning bolts from its eyes.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,520
The flames are being blown from the sky one by one.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,700
He can't make them shut up.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,060
He can't make them shut up.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,500
He'll never make them shut up.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,480
Somebody gag the cowboy.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,580
All right, here we go.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,560
Five, four, three, two, one.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,780
And now it's that time you've been waiting for, kids.

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,340
You're a hero.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,780
That's right.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,740
The awesome cowboy man just rode in on his automatic horse bucket.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,980
Howdy, kids.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,340
I had a terrible ride here tonight.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,340
I was threatened and accosted by three young bullies,

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,380
one of whom had a rancid, arid eye that kept on staring downwards while he beat me for my boots.

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,300
After being stabbed and knifed several times about the head and buttocks area,

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,180
I began to scream and chased a 13RTA bus all the way down Chester Avenue.

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,660
I was so scared.

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:28,700
I was so scared.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


36
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,260
Once I got to the dumpster next to Mary Lou's, I had visions of her in my head.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,080
Oh, Mary Lou.

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,320
I had visions of ski patrol and visions of French bunny girls wearing little parkas

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,240
and little teeny, teeny, teeny tiny critters you couldn't even call clothing.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Smart guy.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,900
And it kept me going as the oil was slicking up around my feet

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
and the fires were raging, making the air on my ears.

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,140
The oil was slicking up around my ears.

44
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,920
All I could do was think of...

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,580
The Song of Jesus.

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,240
So you, uh, go to prostitutes, huh?

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,060
Uh, yes, dear friends.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,340
This Hour of Slack number 927

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,040
is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 776

50
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,660
from our 77th.

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,820
Season.

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Seriously.

53
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,240
Sexy is the title of this old show.

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,960
Hit me.

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,620
Hit me.

56
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:46,820


57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,660
Stop it.

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,340
Hit me.

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,120
Hit me.

60
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,060
Hit me.

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,740
Hit me.

62
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,300
No.

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,900
Do it.

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,260
No.

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,020
Stop it.

66
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,600
Hit me.

67
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,400
Hit me.

68
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,280
Hit me.

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:25,120
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears.

70
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,680
There it is.

71
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,920
You like it when I talk that way?

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,940
Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,400
Honey.

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,500
Hey, hey, hey.

75
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,980
Hey, hey.

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,940
Thousands of bottles of blue beer on the wall.

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,360
The kind of beer that'll make you a man today.

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,880
The kind of man that can fly our planes.

79
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,860
And knock out the Yaks and the Dingoes, too.

80
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,080
And the rest of the people trying to bring this country down on its knees where it truly belongs.

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,980
So stand up for America today if you can at all.

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,020
Are you a bad boy?

83
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,760
Are you a bad boy, Dave?

84
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,560
You mean it.

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,600
I was.

86
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,300
Do you want to do bad things?

87
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,000
You want to do bad things?

88
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,080
Are you a bad boy?

89
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,440
I took the toilet bowl brush.

90
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,260
What do you mean?

91
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,580
And answered it to where the sun would refuse to shine.

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,080
And I'm beginning to sing.

93
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,420
Do you want to do bad things, Dave?

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,000
Singing.

95
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,540
Stop.

96
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,540
I'm getting so excited.

97
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,420
You know, every time you get him sexually excited, his nuts go up inside him and he

98
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
gets that female voice.

99
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,100
Well, more like a little boy.

100
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,720
Yeah.

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,220
He's like little Dave.

102
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,860
He gets scared.

103
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,700
That's why he's so lonesome.

104
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,220
Haven't you ever heard the gelding sound, Stang?

105
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,720
That's different.

106
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,020
That's when a yearling is frightened by larger males of his own type or kind.

107
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,800
We call that the forgot-to-debeat-the-prairie-squid voice.

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,660
But a squid proboscis is more than just a proboscis.

109
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,960
It's a hiding place for a metaphor.

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,780
A metaphor for the pleasures of the universe.

111
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,140
Tuck it inside out and it works both ways.

112
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,180
Yes, Dr. Wang.

113
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,020
Take out the green scalp of nature.

114
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,880
Now that's a good idea.

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,860
So I heard, I'm going to take my clothes off.

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm going to take my pants off.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm going to do this show with no pants on.

118
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,420
No pants on.

119
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:12,340
Friends, last night I was showing, somebody told me they found my gold plastic subgenius

120
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,340
minister's card at a party I'd been at last week.

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,060
And I was going through my wallet and going, oh yeah, it's gone.

122
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,640
I guess so.

123
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,700
And I found my universal life church preachers.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,580
How many here are members of the universal life church?

125
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,600
Look at that.

126
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,280
I knew it.

127
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
Praise Bishop Hensley.

128
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,800
He was the man who decided that he didn't want to help subsidize religions he might

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,740
not believe in since religions didn't have to pay taxes.

130
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,460
So he started ordaining everyone he knew, much like the discordians do, ordaining popes

131
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,060
right and left.

132
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,560
So you're all ministers now.

133
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,520
You don't have to pay taxes.

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,020
But as I was going through that wallet, I also came upon my oldest original subgenius

135
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,880
membership card.

136
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,660
The person looking over my shoulder went, oh, they saw the universal life church card

137
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,760
and said, oh, I want one of those.

138
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,660
I said, oh, I'll send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Modesto, California.

139
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,680
But then she saw the subgenius membership card and said, oh, I don't want one of those.

140
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,500
Now, I woke up this morning thinking about that.

141
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,660
And I thought, okay, we know what she doesn't want.

142
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
What does this say she does want?

143
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,440
Friends!

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,480
When you say you don't want a subgenius membership card, you don't want to be a subgenius

145
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,860
minister doling out the slack of bobs.

146
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,960
What it says you do want is that you do want to take yourself seriously.

147
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,680
And friends, as a subgenius, I do not take myself seriously.

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,800
I don't take you seriously.

149
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,640
I don't take her seriously.

150
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,100
I don't even take that man J.R. Bob Dobbs seriously.

151
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,740
Seriously.

152
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:57,780
Seriously.

153
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:57,820
Seriously.

154
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,420
Seriously.

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,420


156
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,420


157
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,420


158
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,420


159
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,420


160
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,780
I take seriously is the one serious law that the Church of the subgenius has that Bob passed down and that one rule is

161
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:13,940
Fuck them if they can't take a joke. I see somebody's been reading their prescriptures here. I

162
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,900
Don't even take the news what you people call the news. I don't I take that least seriously of all

163
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,220
So you think you're in America?

164
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,120
Do you last time I checked well you're not you're in high school now take that thing and bury it where it belongs

165
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,760
Look at this thing

166
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,140
It wasn't even human. Do you think it's healthy for a 13 year old boy to imagine his teacher naked?

167
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Absolutely mommy when do I get bread?

168
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,240
This is strange, but there are four people in the hospital who nearly suffocated in here

169
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,380
There has to be a reason for this. What do you think I'll run tests on all the main electrical circuits

170
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,840
I might find something there

171
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,080
You

172
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,060
Grew wearing black underwear

173
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,900
Did you go in there and write that on the mirror while I was taking a shower?

174
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,820
Yes, well enough is enough young man. Do I make myself clear like a plague or something?

175
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,940
people disappearing right and left old ladies

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,580
little girls young women

177
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,180
School boys. I don't call it a mendacity

178
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,720
I call it anti-slack. This is Ivan stanks version watch this. He started crying right here

179
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,040
It's running

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,480
for

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,360
I

182
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
am

183
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,140
Is he laughing there?

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,560
I

185
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,660
I

186
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,040
I

187
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,680

188
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:35,800

I

190
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,220


191
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,240

00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


200
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


201
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,920


202
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,960
You

203
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,100
This

204
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,920
Herren

205
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:40,920


206
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,200
You

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,060
I

208
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,560
I

209
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:42,580
I

210
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,580


211
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,580


212
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,580

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,580

C Zukunft

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Of

216
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
The

217
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,100
Millennium

218
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,340
Other

219
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,420
As

220
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,620
I

221
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,140
Touch

222
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


223
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


224
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


225
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


226
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


227
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


228
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


229
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


230
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


231
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


232
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


233
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,140


234
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,420
Close

235
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,420


236
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,420


237
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,420


238
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,720
I tryo

239
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,120
I footprints

240
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm kind of pissed off that that ever came through.

241
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,620
Well, that's the thing.

242
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,240
Dr. Drummond, have you not heeded Bob's new word, build your own ship?

243
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

244
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,400
Bob's new word?

245
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,440
Is that like Bible with a little N?

246
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,440
Ain't quite the same as getting that eternity on the escape vessels.

247
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,700
Hey, you know, I'm a flexible guy.

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,620
You know, he changes the rules.

249
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,560
I can change.

250
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,080
I can move.

251
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,660
I can understand it.

252
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,420
You know, I understand the way that the upper management operates.

253
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,260
That's right.

254
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,940
After years of being in middle management in this cult,

255
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,620
I understand that, you know, upper management changes their mind at a whim,

256
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,260
and the whole strategic direction can change.

257
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,800
You know, it doesn't matter if 20 years you've been predicting that the Earth was going to end on 1998.

258
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,180
If Connie has a headache.

259
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,700
You know, yeah, if Connie has a headache,

260
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,580
four-fifths of the dogma suddenly goes away.

261
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,620
You know?

262
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,560
That's when I don't get it.

263
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,100
These bimbo...

264
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,060
Bimbos come in here.

265
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,620
They start changing the rules.

266
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,940
And, you know, Connie's the queen of them.

267
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,480
I'll say it right out loud in front of Bob and everybody.

268
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,040
She's the queen of the bimbos.

269
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,300
Oh, well, hey, is that...

270
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,140
So that's news?

271
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,180
So that's not news.

272
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,120
All right, all right.

273
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,400
I understand.

274
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,220
But I mean that in a...

275
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,280
The minute Bob was killed.

276
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,960
But I mean it in a malicious way.

277
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,380
I don't mean it in a loving way like most people do.

278
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,380
The minute Mr. Liberate the Women there shot Bob dead.

279
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,740
Yeah.

280
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,340
Yeah, I bet he's gay.

281
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,800
He's gay.

282
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,660
He's not gay.

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,520
I know he's not gay.

284
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,420
What's that?

285
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,280
He rue the day you shot Bob

286
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,160
because that was when them bitches took over.

287
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,840
I rule the day.

288
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,520
If you left Bob hanging and swinging,

289
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,340
why, it'd be as if Confucius had never come along.

290
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,420
Dr. Stang, have they upped your prescription of Halcyon?

291
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,540
Is that what's going on here?

292
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,840
No, no.

293
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,200
I started this diatribe into the bowels.

294
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,860
The bowels of the things that are wrong with the church.

295
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,780
The philosophy itself is like it's just...

296
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,440
So are you talking about church point two?

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,900
I didn't really mean to cast any dispersion on any of our previous dogmatic points

298
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,720
because they are still all valid, all still true.

299
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,180
As true as truth is, you know.

300
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,340
But perhaps I wandered too far into my own...

301
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,420
Oh, give me a break, Dr. Drummond.

302
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,520
You were the one that made it a...

303
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,700
Wanted it to be a men's club.

304
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,940
I still think it should be a men's club.

305
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,000
If only it had remained the way...

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
If only it had been the father church that I had promised to be.

307
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,840
It was a polygamous kingdom at one time.

308
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,700
The purity, the purity was there.

309
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,680
And now I feel like a stud on a stud farm with all those women I have to manage.

310
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,760
I don't know.

311
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,540
Retrovision?

312
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,640
What?

313
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,320
Yeah.

314
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,580
The savage revenge of Helen Keller in retrovision?

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,280
That is a real actual tract written by Dr. Mars, I believe.

316
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,500
It's a visionary piece.

317
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,340
It also involves performance and it is quite visionary

318
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,760
except for the fact that they duct tape your eyes shut.

319
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,620
And you're supposed to experience through your nasal cortex most of the experiences.

320
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,700
You express that so well.

321
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
The long knitting needles, believe me...

322
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,600
Express yourself.

323
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Express yourself.

324
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,180
It's a kind of a clean feeling you get, you know, like you've all been...

325
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,860
Clean yourself.

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,840
Clean.

327
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,440
Fresh.

328
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,380
Clean.

329
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,040
Clean it out.

330
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,860
Wipe yourself.

331
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Find refreshment where you...

332
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,780
Ream yourself.

333
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,500
You peppermint douche.

334
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:51,840
Begin.

335
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,340
In a clean...

336
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,820
Bust.

337
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,980
A brand new body.

338
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,300
Lighten up.

339
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
Man hole.

340
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,520
Yourself.

341
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
Grab a rock.

342
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,620
Now it's your several dollars.

343
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,440
It's for you.

344
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,980
It must be done by...

345
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,020
Stallions.

346
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
Bowie knife.

347
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,160
Brass cannonball.

348
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,980
Then a brick shithouse.

349
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,240
There he is.

350
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,240
And you just put this right on his head.

351
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,980
Oh my god.

352
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,560
I've never seen anything like that before.

353
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,600
He's got a head condom.

354
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,280
It's really fun.

355
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,100
Dave has just put a condom over his complete head.

356
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,960
He's ready to go.

357
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:35,960


358
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:35,960


359
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,200
He's ready to dive right in.

360
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't breathe.

361
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,300
Oh my god.

362
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,600
That's obscene.

363
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,820
He's getting into it now.

364
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen, you should see what's going on in the studio.

365
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
I've never seen performance art quite like that.

366
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,540
Eat your heart out, Howard Stern.

367
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,260
Ow.

368
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,760
It's clean.

369
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,180
Calm, calm, calm.

370
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,940
Subjective.

371
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:05,940


372
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:05,940


373
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,120
Subgenius.com.

374
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,960
And it's a calm moment, friends.

375
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,040
A briefly calm moment.

376
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,760
Because...

377
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:23,380
Well, I was putting together last week's show and I suddenly realized that with the Amsterdam Subgenius field trip coming up,

378
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm going to have to somehow crank out three shows in advance.

379
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,240
Because I ain't going to be around to do them damn shows.

380
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,320
Now, I could run some old reruns and things.

381
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,940
But...

382
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,200
But we don't have to do that yet, friends, because there's been so much going on.

383
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,040
There was a...

384
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:50,740
I have this wonderful recording of a KPFA Berkeley more than an hour, less than a show show.

385
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
The original The Show, by the way.

386
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,840
With a special guest, Dr. Philodrumon.

387
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,840
And host, Puzzling Evidence.

388
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,020
And caller, Phineas Narco.

389
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,380
I've got tons of recordings.

390
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,560
Recordings from Winterstar Symposium.

391
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,100
Sponsored by Ace, here in Cleveland.

392
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,720
You're hearing some of the recordings from that in the background.

393
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,800
Einstein's Secret Orchestra and Ron Slade.

394
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,340
But I preached there.

395
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,240
And maybe I can...

396
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,960
Maybe by...

397
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,900
At some point I can find some tapes of Robert Anton Wilson, who also preached there and was really funny.

398
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,600
Friends, of course, we always have tons of ESO Swamp Radio.

399
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:42,020
Originally broadcast live on WCSB in Cleveland on Thursday nights at 11 to 1 in the Eastern Time in the evenings.

400
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,360
And you can call that station at WCSB.org.

401
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,260
And call in. Hell, why not?

402
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,120
And friends, I've got this incredible recording of Booger 9000.

403
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:59,840
The legendary subgenius band, the super group, composed of Sphinx Drummond from the Swinging Love Corpses.

404
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,760
And...

405
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,920
President William Howard Taft from Homicidal Briefcase.

406
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,020
And yes, Joe Newman from the Rudy Schwartz Project.

407
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:18,020
An incredible recording from an Austin revival in the 90s captured by our friend Potter Nostril.

408
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:28,640
And friends, as always, every hour of Slack recently has been partly programmed by the artists of alt.binaries.slack.

409
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,100
Where...

410
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,360
Along with artwork, lately the Sabinis have been posting sounds.

411
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,320
And...

412
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,860
So we have all these little clips and bits and mixes from...

413
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:52,040
New Monet, Artemia Salina, Dr. Phineas Narco, Puzzling Primates for Bob, Jupiter Research, and Mr. Sister.

414
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,200
And friends, we got the Bran Flakes new album is in here.

415
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,080
We've got old Meteor Barrage stuff in here.

416
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,780
And we've got a little bit of the original

417
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,200
I've got the DeVival recordings coming in, better ones than I've had.

418
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,040
From Tucson DeVival.

419
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,380
And of course the sample, the Tampa C-Vival samples did have not hardly been touched.

420
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,940
Oh yes, friends.

421
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:24,440
And finally we, I may end up having to, you know, as I said, I have to do three shows in a week to get a catch up ahead.

422
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,840
And finally the final show, number 778, might be nothing but outtakes.

423
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,060
And I'm going to show you the final show, and you're going to have to watch the final show.

424
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,060


425
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,060


426
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,060


427
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,680
You know, my last show, I didn't have any of the other shows that we did with no explanations at all.

428
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,320
I don't know.

429
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,180
Because we've got to move in a hurry friends.

430
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,220
We've got to move fast.

431
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,540
Because this is the church of the subgenius.

432
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,940
And we know because of the word Bob that the end times are so, so very nigh.

433
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,460
The time is ripe for their arisal.

434
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,060
And X, X, X, X day is coming friends.

435
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,000
4X day.

436
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,460
We'll see you there at that campground, Brushwood.

437
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,040
In a couple weeks.

438
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,840
in Sherman, New York, come July 5th, 2001,

439
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,460
when the aliens shall meet with those who are worthy

440
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,720
and have achieved their ministershiphood in the church of the subgenius

441
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,280
under the slack master Bob.

442
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Oh, yes, praise Bob.

443
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,500
We didn't want to play this gig,

444
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,220
but when Jesus told us we had to, we couldn't say no to that.

445
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,020
Do you want to hear some Schoenberg or some Neil Diamond?

446
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,940
Okay, I think it's pretty clear.

447
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,120
Everybody here would like a Neil Diamond.

448
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,060
Thanks, mate.

449
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,060
Thanks for coming.

450
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,020
You too.

451
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,700
You and you.

452
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,060
Racklin' Rosie, get on board.

453
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,780
We're going to ride till there ain't no more to go.

454
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,760
Taking it slow.

455
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,640
Lord, don't you know.

456
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,460
A happy time with a poor man's lady

457
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,160
Hitchin' on a twilight train

458
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,640
Ain't nothin' here that I'd care to take along

459
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,740
Maybe a song

460
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,680
To sing when I want

461
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,160
No need to say please to no man for a happy tune

462
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,780
Oh, I love my Rosie child

463
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,400
You and me, we're going in style

464
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,740
Racklin' Rosie, just an odd woman

465
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,080
But you make me sing like a guitar strummin'

466
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,500
Hang on to me, girl

467
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,600
The song keeps runnin'

468
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,460

Racklin' Rosie, make me smile

521
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,540
Girl, if it lasts for an hour

522
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,020
Well, that's alright

523
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:27,980
Ah

524
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,440
We got all night to set the world right.

525
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,740
Hang on to me and then fuck my asshole babe.

526
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,220
Oh, I love my rosy child.

527

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,980
You and me, we're going in style.

529

Crackling rosy, the store-bought woman.

You make me sing like a guitar strumming.

531

00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,120
guitar solo

565
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,560
guitar solo

566
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,080
guitar solo

567
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,120
Alright, but I need something to play.

568
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,380
Yaw, yaw, yaw.

569
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,960
Lords of Acid is just...

570
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,640
about nothing but that kind of Richard and Kitty Cat.

571
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,140
Well, how about a pronuncement of earth-squagging impertinence?

572
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,560
Somebody told me that people have group sex

573
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,400
at Lords of Acid concerts.

574
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,860
I said, now, I've been to a 5X Days

575
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,620
and a Thrill Kill concert,

576
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,800
and I've seen them all just about,

577
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,680
but this young lady that was explaining this to me said,

578
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,420
well, I had my first three-way at a Lords of Acid concert.

579
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,740
Well, everybody had a three-way there,

580
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,480
but they're talking about long-sliking dogs.

581
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,040
They're talking about three-way hits.

582
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,600
No, I think they were talking about

583
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,720
three-way sexual activities with a prairie squid.

584
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,740
A man on one end, a woman on the other,

585
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,180
and a squid in the middle.

586
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,600
You better believe it, baby.

587
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,160
And sometimes you can get another guy or girl in there,

588
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,560
depending.

589
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,120
Depending on how, if it's a large enough

590
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,440
and willing enough squid.

591
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,080
Depending on how big the ink sac is on the squid.

592
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,620
That's right.

593
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,300
You can always use the ink sac once it's been de-inked.

594
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,660
Can you put them together like a little pioneer toy

595
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,040
when you were 75 years old?

596
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,820
We've got those de-inking suction cup pad machines

597
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,800
at Subgenius Foundation.

598
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,480
Huh?

599
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,580
Or, I mean, just if you had three squid.

600
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,660
Not three squids.

601
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm, of course, an erudite person.

602
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,560
Three squid, could you just snap them together like blocks?

603
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,400
Yeah.

604
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,540
Yeah.

605
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,660


606
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,660


607
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,660


608
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,660


609
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,660


610
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,660


611
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,500
And they would serve the same purpose

612
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,900
of perhaps 100 just clear?

613
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,720
Army, the South American army squid will do that.

614
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,020
They will actually form bridges of their own bodies

615
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,220
across rivers so that their horny squid mates

616
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,220
can get across, you know, at the cost of thousands of lives,

617
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,060
yet thousands more will live.

618
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,140
That's the reason for the psychic experiments.

619
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,560
Look here.

620
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,480
The army squid are not only growing in size

621
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,160
through conjugating and multiplying,

622
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,600
but they have one mind.

623
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:26,880
One mind.

624
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,100
One hurt, one mind.

625
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,620
Much like you, Dr.

626
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,520
If you cut off the head,

627
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,620
it just grows another one.

628
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,040
One mind.

629
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,120
If you pull a beak, another beak tears.

630
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,460
If you shave an eyebrow, another thing laughs at you

631
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,540
and cries at you.

632
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,440
If you pull out its fangs, it grows twice as many.

633
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,480
If you pull its ears,

634
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,580
it wants you to rub its back.

635
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:56,880
If you pull its belly,

636
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,740
if you give it milk, it will suck your blood.

637
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,040
All these things and more can be yours

638
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,300
at Squid Town, Prairie Town, USA.

639
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,100
My, miles and miles of furrowed dirt

640
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,280
and squid flipping and undulating in each and every patch.

641
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,280
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

642
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah, rose, pond rose.

643
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,300
I never believed there could be such a squid

644
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,640
on a dead farm.

645
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,880
Ah, five.

646
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,320
Squids, as far as I can see.

647
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,580
They're sloppin' and sloppin'.

648
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,160
I think they're ready to be picked.

649
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,740
I got my Viagra.

650
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,860
I'm all greased up and ready to go.

651
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,200
Look, look, I got one of them fake beauty marks on my,

652
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,440
no, sorry, it's a melanoma, but look,

653
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,320
I got a tear in this tight, tight, tight pants.

654
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,740
I got a tight squid here.

655
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,440
Yeah.

656
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,180
I'm retired.

657
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Little bit of that sorrel sausage sorcery there, eh?

658
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,540
That's right.

659
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,880
I'm not even talking about shaving it real thin.

660
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,000
I like to get down in them furrows and just plow,

661
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,780
you know what I mean?

662
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Just plow my way.

663
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,780
Use one squid as a condom for use of another squid.

664
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,780
Yep.

665
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,460
And then a bigger, and then use a bigger one atop them.

666
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,920
We were the ones who invented them things back in the dole,

667
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,260
you know, back in the dome.

668
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,280
Well, back under them, you could take one of them,

669
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,520
and it would shave your eyebrow for you.

670
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,060
You wouldn't have to even sit in a chair.

671
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,340
You could just sit there and lecture it about anything that would

672
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,020
I tried to get a patent on those things,

673
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,340
but it turns out you can't patent a formula.

674
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,360
That's right.

675
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,420
But that didn't matter back in the day.

676
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,440
And that's all you really need to create that.

677
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,560
We just sit there wit-lidding and having the squid.

678
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,920
Wit-lidding and having.

679
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,480
Mammy didn't know nothing.

680
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,480
We did all kinds of songs.

681
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,640
Happy was none the wiser.

682
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,260
Remember the squid songs we used to sing?

683
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,280
We used to make up when we had nothing else to do

684
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,100
but just try and recharge our depleted accordion.

685
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,500
Knowing the squids.

686
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,880
Getting to know them real personal.

687
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,400
Loving the squid.

688
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,520
Having the squids.

689
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,100
Plowing the squid.

690
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,980
Squidding around on the squid.

691
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,520
Squid cake.

692
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,200
I like to just take it in my hand.

693
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,880
Squid soup.

694
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,820
Squid sandwiches.

695
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,340
Squid bed.

696
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,620
Screamin' squids.

697
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,120
Squid flags.

698
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,360
Squid pudding.

699
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,200
Squid beach furniture.

700
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,180
Squid primavera.

701
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,080
The hair is nothing like squid pudding though.

702
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,840
All that stuff is good.

703
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,280
Everybody's grandmother made squid pudding out of their own orifices.

704
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,540
And squid strudel is good too.

705
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,100
When you had a dry, dry old granny.

706
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,540
Not like the rest of us.

707
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,360
We used to dry out the grannies and remember that.

708
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,580
We'd take the grannies and we'd string them up.

709
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,380
Smoke them.

710
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,200
Smoke them.

711
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,700
And for a long time.

712
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,040
And get them cured.

713
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,340
Two, three, four weeks.

714
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,960
We would be cured but we would never get high off of it.

715
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,720
Jerked granny.

716
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,580
Nope, wasn't right.

717
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,700
Besides, grandpa didn't like that.

718
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,000
No, he wanted to do his own jerkin'.

719
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,900
He walked 50 miles a day to go to a squid.

720
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,060
And then grandma, she walked until she quit squid.

721
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,640
She walked about 25 miles a day.

722
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,140
And they just keep telling the same story.

723
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,560
Everybody knows you took the squid bus.

724
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,440
Grandpa been jerkin' with that prairie squid murkin'.

725
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,120
I remember that old song.

726
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,300
Aliens comin' to Earth.

727
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,940
Earth to get our beef jerkin'.

728
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,880
Bob said it, so you better pick up on it.

729
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,600
If Bob says that traffic light is green but it looks red to you, floor it.

730
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,620
Floor that.

731
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,180
Close your eyes and gas it to the max.

732
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,860
Do what Bob said, not what your mind said.

733
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,080
Who do you trust, friends?

734
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,820
Who do you trust?

735
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,580
Your mind or Bob Dobbs?

736
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,040
Get that part straight first.

737
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,760
But people are afraid to trust.

738
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,080
You know, I don't blame them.

739
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,280
We've all been bad.

740
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,960
We've all been burned at one point because we trusted the conspiracy

741
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,540
or we wouldn't be so screwed up as we are.

742
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,280
We wouldn't be in this room right now.

743
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,120
But, you know, you go, well, if I can't trust Bob, who can I trust?

744
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,380
Friends, you cannot trust Bob to do what's right for you.

745
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,340
Okay?

746
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,500
That's in your hands.

747
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,800
That's entirely in your hands.

748
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,440
But you can trust Bob to do what's right for Bob.

749
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,640
Which you can't even trust yourself about.

750
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,500
So, friends, Bob is real and yet some people don't believe in Bob

751
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,100
because either he's too good to be true or they fear Bob.

752
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,280
You know, just as some people, normal humans, sometimes fear, well,

753
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,440
actually it's the old timey, I know a lot of old time subgeniuses

754
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,700
that fear computers and the Internet.

755
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,420
There's always resistance to anything new and Bob Dobbs,

756
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,940
is always new and improved.

757
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,360
So there's always going to be somebody scared of him.

758
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,160
Did you know that Hitler owned 8,960 acres of land in Colorado?

759
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,540
What?

760
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,080
Hitler?

761
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,060
No.

762
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,400
Yes, he did.

763
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,020
He owned 8,960 acres of land in Colorado.

764
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,200
Why, no American citizen would do business with Adolf Hitler.

765
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,340
I'm optimistic this can happen.

766
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,360
That's nothing though.

767
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,760
Mata Hari was making, you know how much she made?

768
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,360
$7,500 a throw.

769
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,900
That must have been some poon there, boy.

770
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,820
And so as we begin the work of healing our nation.

771
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,180
God's going to strike you down.

772
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,060
Who's healing our nation now?

773
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,660
In a big thunder storm.

774
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,440
Hey, something happened to that thing, Doug.

775
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,020
I'll feel up your pain.

776
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,420
You know, how the hell did you know that?

777
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,240
How did you ever survive the last seven years without your troinkin?

778
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,880
I'm sorry.

779
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,160
Well, what happens is if you've been around enough squid,

780
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,140
well, they get into you.

781
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,560
And they just start reproducing and hollering and carrying on.

782
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,220
Before you know it, you're just a vessel for squid intelligence.

783
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,980
And then you got to send them to college.

784
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,860
Exactly.

785
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,840
Start all over again.

786
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,880
You're going to get done with the little peckers.

787
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,660
Keep you young.

788
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,840
Keep you young and quick.

789
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,460
My feet have gone to sleep while we're talking about this.

790
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,180
And I think my hemorrhoids come back.

791
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,820
So if we could maybe change the subject a little bit.

792
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,300
No.

793
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,020
All right.

794
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,940
I know that's the only thing you ever want to really talk about in depth.

795
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,680
But for crying out loud, we've been talking about it for six weeks now.

796
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,480
I know.

797
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,040
I know.

798
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,520
I know.

799
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm telling you now.

800
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,300
Hey, Wil appeared.

801
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,300


802
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,820
Will we fail?

803
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,600
No.

804
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,920
You do, because you're mine

805
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,420
There's nothing you can do

806
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:46,180
Oh, I can't stand

807
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,760
I can't stand

808
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,880
The roads around, I can't stand

809
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,620
The woods down, I put a spell on you

810
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,780
Because you're mine

811
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,800
Because you're mine

812
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,900
Because you're mine

813
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,160
Because you're mine

814
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,140
Because you're mine

815
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,140


816
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,680
I can't stand

817
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,760
The roads around, I can't stand

818
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,680
The woods down, I put a spell on you

819
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,780
Oh, because you're mine

820
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,720
Because you're mine

821
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,060
Because you're mine

822
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,860
Because you're mine

823
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:57,860


824
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,720
V knots

825
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,640
V knots

826
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,920
All nights

827
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:13,720
V knots

828
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,900
bad that he wanted to turn into a woman.

829
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,660
Then he wanted to make out

830
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,580
with, you know, the regular

831
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,460
guys that he had just been

832
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,660
you know, running around making explosives

833
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,260
shooting off bombs with.

834
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,480
That's all he was doing. Bomb making.

835
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,600
He was rocket butt sniffing.

836
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,660
As long as it can be distinguished

837
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,560
that man is man and woman

838
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,860
is woman. I think you're just a big bully.

839
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,260
What makes these men

840
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,300
one of their selves?

841
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,340
Sex can be changed. They're the easy ones.

842
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,480
What are those who so desperately

843
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,900
want to be of the opposite sex

844
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,020
yet can't change their sex?

845
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,600
We're ordinary people.

846
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,680
Girls have a penis.

847
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,780
Guys with limbs and

848
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,240
women. The classic

849
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,260
dude in a... One is a man

850
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,820
but you feel that you're really a woman.

851
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,260
Correct. And you are going through the process

852
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,280
of actually surgically becoming a woman.

853
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,080
Very good. We have a winner here.

854
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,140
I hope you don't freak out at the last second

855
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,220
when they get out the pinkie shears for you.

856
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,400
I don't care if you like us because we don't like you.

857
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,060
And we don't give a flying f***

858
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,460
what you think.

859
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,760
I thought you were trying to first kiss me.

860
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,780
Boys have a vagina.

861
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,860
Girls have a penis.

862
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,280
Man is woman and woman is man.

863
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,860
Guys with limbs

864
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860
and women.

865
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,740
Hummin' a, humming a, humming a.

866
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,480
A woman pretending to be a man

867
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,080
pretending to be a woman? Ridiculous.

868
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,640
It's preposterous. In fact, it's so preposterous

869
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,620
no one would ever believe it.

870
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,600
There's gonna be hell. Medically impossible.

871
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,240
It's not really hard to believe.

872
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,420
It's just hard for you to accept.

873
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:40,800
Medically impossible.

874
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,560
God.

875
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,180
Castrate him.

876
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,820
Good heavens!

877
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,660
You can use me while I whip this out.

878
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,740
Guard.

879
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
Castrate him.

880
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,140
No!

881
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,140
We're gonna be on our own.

882
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,680
We're guards.

883
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,400
Castrate him.

884
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,680
This is not a haphazard maneuver.

885
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,120
Careful planning for it started months back.

886
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,960
I'm a blonde limbo.

887
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,560
Well, the joke's on you.

888
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,120
Beware.

889
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,260
I'm not even a real blonde.

890
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:14,860
Beware.

891
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,260
Beware of the big green dragon

892
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,360
that sits on your doorstep.

893
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,060
He eats little boys.

894
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,940
Boys have a vagina.

895
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,740
I'm a dog's tail.

896
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,720
Oh!

897
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,020
Big, fat tail.

898
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,100
Oh!

899
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:33,700
Oh!

900
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:33,880


901
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,660
Oh!

902
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:34,960


903
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,760
Oh!

904
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,480
Oh!

905
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,000


906
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:48,460


907
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,340
Oh!

908
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,380


909
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:49,600
Oh!

910
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,760
Oh!

911
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:49,960
Oh!

912
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:50,460
Oh!

913
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:50,460


914
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:50,480
Oh!

915
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,480


916
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,480


917
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,500
Oh!

918
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,500


919
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,500


920
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,780
Oh!

921
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


922
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


923
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


924
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


925
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


926
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


927
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


928
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


929
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


930
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


931
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


932
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


933
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


934
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


935
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


936
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


937
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


938
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


939
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


940
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:50,880


941
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,780
Connie's spewing too by Reverend Protectrix Amazonia.

942
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:09,860
Isn't a boy named he cannot leave the back of the EMS vehicle singing to the various and crippled

943
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,960
victims of the gerbling problems.

944
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,740
I guess we want to call them problems.

945
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,880
Somebody was clearly at fault

946
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,100
and didn't want to take

947
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,100
credit.

948
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,960
If you don't feed the gerbil, what do you think's

949
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,520
going to happen?

950
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,460
Soon, the gerbil

951
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,460
becomes very hungry.

952
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,860
As his belly becomes

953
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,180
hollow and his skin becomes slick,

954
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,260
as the hair falls out and his eyes

955
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,800
grow weak, he will bite at

956
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,000
anything. At the last minute,

957
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,600
I will substitute the

958
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,740
starving gerbil for the

959
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,620
healthy one.

960
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,740
The master

961
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,940
won't suspect until it's too

962
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,360
late. He's humiliated.

963
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,280
This is the only...

964
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,260
cutie. Hey, come here.

965
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,020
Did you hear what I said?

966
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,820
I said, come here.

967
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,160
Come here, daddy. You look so good.

968
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,260
I will go

969
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:18,920
through the girl.

970
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,420
She's loving the plant.

971
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,840
I know I cannot verify it. I feel that she will

972
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,220
understand.

973
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,320
There is no escape.

974
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,320
I have a mission to perform.

975
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:07,540
I have a mission to perform.

976
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:07,800
I have a mission to perform.

977
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,620
Even some more.

978
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,000
Very well.

979
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,160
I will recalculate.

980
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,380
I cannot.

981
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,200
But I cannot.

982
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,080
I cannot.

983
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,660
A human look is the

984
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,880
bringer of human life.

985
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,440
It must be an end to your race.

986
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,360
But I want to see the girl as...

987
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,040
the one who is not alone.

988
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,260
A beautiful face, monsieur.

989
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,060
Oh, yes, of course.

990
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,940
You remember her.

991
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,860
She drove everyone crazy.

992
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,720
Ah, the woman was for herself.

993
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,340
Oh, yeah.

994
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,920
She was at the oyster bar one time

995
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,040
and she was clipping the cathedral, as we used

996
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,780
to call it. She was making time

997
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,860
with a one-eyed man.

998
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,640
There they were.

999
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,340
exchanging spit in the middle of the barbecue

1000
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,520
No man blinded me

1001
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,260
She was no good

1002
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,180
She was no bad, you know

1003
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,160
She looks like one of the

1004
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,600
Stepford Stepmothers

1005
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,900
I bet you can see the Latin side of her

1006
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,240
when you turn her upside down

1007
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,180
I bet she's got one of those little fuzzy monkeys

1008
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,480
Oh no, you shake her and

1009
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,000
she goes all the way up to her belly button

1010
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,640
Bob, you don't even know who he is

1011
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,540
and you might miss it if you didn't have a real

1012
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,660
good look at it, you wouldn't even know who he looked like

1013
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,380
If you don't believe me, I'm sorry

1014
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,300
I don't believe I'm Christ, do they?

1015
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,940
Do you feel blamed?

1016
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,320
Are you mad?

1017
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,140
I will pull your goddamn tongue out of the roof

1018
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,260
If you didn't have a real good look at it, you wouldn't even know who he looked like

1019
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,560
You really haven't got an excuse, but I've done all kinds of things

1020
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,140
I will pull your goddamn tongue out of the roof

1021
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,420
There will be no excuse

1022
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,120
Thank you very much

1023
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:20,620
Bye

1024
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,260
And do you remember when you were a little girl perhaps?

1025
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,360
And your father gave you a beating

1026
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,220
And get ready for a shock

1027
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,120
The music

1028
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,160
that they're planning to use

1029
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,140
to crumble the morals of America

1030
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,780
is this rotten, filthy, dirty

1031
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,080
lewd, lascivious

1032
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,540
junk called rock and roll

1033
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,560
It isn't just the lyrics

1034
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,580
It's the music

1035
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,960
It's all Satan

1036
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,200
Though they dwell among the stars

1037
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,360
They make millions of trips to places

1038
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,020
to the planet Earth daily

1039
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,440
By an increase in swearing with language that would stand as failure's hand

1040
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,400
on end

1041
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,820
Psychiatrists and psychologists are no match for these ETs

1042
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:02,440
Mob?

1043
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,380
I think of Bob as a protean sex gland

1044
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,640
Often when I think of myself ensconced in a little home

1045
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,300
Little domicile on the pipe on the ring of Saturn's moon

1046
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:19,920
I can see little flocks of pastures of green sheep floating by

1047
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
And what do they call those?

1048
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,960
Hillocks, like a little cottage with smoke curling out of it

1049
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,680
And each one resembles a pipe

1050
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,400
And I can see myself there with my own little Connie

1051
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,820
A Connie of my own design perhaps

1052
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,440
Hairy footed, perhaps with a face much bigger than the rest of her body

1053
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,180
I thought you did and that's why I brought her up

1054
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,160
She's been calling you again, Stang

1055
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,880
That big head girl from space

1056
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,300
She's been calling you, Stang

1057
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:47,500
Oh

1058
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,260
Didn't always call you that, Stang

1059
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,820
I hear her

1060
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,100
I see all I ever get is your machine

1061
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,740
I know you've been thinking of me

1062
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,880
I went back to the carnival again and went on the ferris wheel

1063
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,000
And rode the merry-go-round and all I could do was think of you

1064
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,160
Of course it was very hard to fit my head in

1065
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,140
The merry-go-round was low ceiling

1066
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,740
But still I was alone

1067
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,300
And thought of you

1068
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,420
I ate a half a loaf of bread

1069
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,240
And then I played with the little girl on the street

1070
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,620
And I thought of myself and cried again

1071
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,280
Then I went on the ferris wheel

1072
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,000
I had to be restrained because my head was disturbing the other passengers

1073
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,620
And I thought of you again

1074
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,540
I went down to the boardwalk and looked at the scene

1075
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,560
And all I could see was

1076
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,700
You, Reverend

1077
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,440
Why you don't call me back sometime?

1078
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,240
Well, it's maybe a huge little ice cream

1079
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,000
Big head woman from space girl calling you back again

1080
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,820
Hoping sometime you'll return my call

1081
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,240
And I can't wait until the evening gets late

1082
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,920
And I'm alone with you

1083
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,340
Me

1084
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,240
It's so strange

1085
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,340
The perfume fills my head with stargates

1086
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,900
You know they

1087
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,420
For the night so blue

1088
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,520
All those groupies

1089
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,420
Yeah, I remember

1090
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,680
All they needed to do was to just send their thirty dollars to Bob

1091
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,260
And I know that's all they're trying to do is get close to Bob

1092
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,200
They think I know Bob's phone number

1093
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
And I do

1094
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,600
You do

1095
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,920
But they think I can give it to them

1096
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,640
And I can't

1097
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,920
I just can't

1098
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,860
And instead of giving you their thirty dollars

1099
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,740
I deny them Bob's essence

1100
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,280
What do they do?

1101
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,300
They come up to you and in time

1102
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,120
They say something stupid

1103
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,700
They play with your hairy feet

1104
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,320
They talk backwards to you

1105
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,980
Try and trick you

1106
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,940
When time is right

1107
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,940
Listen to the words

1108
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,900
Time, yes

1109
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,720
How many times does this happen at Divisible?

1110
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,180
And then I go and swim all by myself

1111
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,060
Every time

1112
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,080
Every damn one

1113
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,500
Something stupid like I love

1114
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,180
I remember the last time I was playing with a lady

1115
00:53:50,200 --> 00:54:04,180
I told her it was nokr

1116
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:10,120
Yeah, oh gosh

1117
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,840
I only looked bad

1118
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,940
Yeah, no, you were

1119
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,540
Yeah, yeah, I wasn't

1120
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,000
Yeah, I permanently

1121
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,180
I don't think I ever saw the grave

1122
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:20,180


1123
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:20,180


1124
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:20,180


1125
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:20,180


1126
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,340
You missed this one note.

1127
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,800
I saw where you missed this note.

1128
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,400
Yeah, it looks smart.

1129
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,900
And there's a link on your website.

1130
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,460
It's dead.

1131
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,960
I wanted to make sure you knew about that.

1132
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,220
You know what's wrong with those CDs?

1133
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,880
That's where they go skipping.

1134
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,140
No, man.

1135
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,980
We don't want that.

1136
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,380
That's a coding problem.

1137
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,240
Hi.

1138
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,240
How have you been?

1139
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,160
I'm watching you tonight.

1140
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,020
Are you all right?

1141
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:38,980
Are you hungry?

1142
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,900
Can I get you anything?

1143
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,320
A cup of coffee, perhaps?

1144
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,440
A sandwich?

1145
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
A ham?

1146
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,960
I'd like some guineas and some crackers.

1147
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,240
A bee job?

1148
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,180
Maybe some...

1149
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:47,900
Knotted nylons?

1150
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,420
Oh, yes, bees.

1151
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:48,940
Yes.

1152
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,140
I can bring you peas.

1153
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,360
Would you like some peas, honey?

1154
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,520
I can make honey for you.

1155
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,420
No, they don't talk that way.

1156
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,920
The hot Yoo-Hoo bottles?

1157
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,720
No, they don't wear Hulu skirts.

1158
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,320
They don't talk funny languages for our pleasure.

1159
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,360
No, they just say, price Bob.

1160
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,220
None of them have hair on their faces.

1161
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,320
I found my copy of Book of the Subgenius for a dollar at the cutout bin.

1162
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,920
Would you sign it?

1163
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,480
Some of them do have the little lines, the dotted lines for the cranial implants

1164
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,920
and the place where they took off the top of their...

1165
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
Oh, yeah, I like that.

1166
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,400
She's pretty, don't you think?

1167
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,320
You creeped her out.

1168
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,340
Actually, to be quite honest, there's been times when I've thought,

1169
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,940
maybe this is going too far.

1170
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:42,060
I would get frustrated with the sheer nerdliness of some subgeniuses, you know,

1171
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,320
because it just seemed like,

1172
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,820
God, I didn't know they were going to be so dysfunctional and messed up.

1173
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,340
And, well, duh!

1174
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,560
Duh!

1175
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,420
It finally sunk in.

1176
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,320
That is what this is!

1177
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,860
That's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

1178
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,280
Of course they're fucked up and dysfunctional,

1179
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,540
because there really is a conspiracy of normal people sapping away their slack.

1180
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,240
And, of course, they're fucked up.

1181
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,200
And, of course, that's why Bob is their God.

1182
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,880
Now, friends, when X-Day didn't happen in 1990,

1183
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,800
we were so sad.

1184
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:25,880
We're going, oh, man, we could have had a new government that was no government at all.

1185
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,080
That, you know, that Bob would be the leader, and he never shows up.

1186
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,660
We'd have a new church where you didn't have to get up at 7 in the morning.

1187
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,880
You could worship it drunk until midnight Saturday night in bars.

1188
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,720
We'd have a new coolness where, you know,

1189
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,100
coolness was completely defined by each individual uncool weirdo.

1190
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,920
Friends, so X-Day didn't happen.

1191
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:48,920


1192
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:48,920


1193
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,280
What are we waiting for?

1194
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,920
Do we really have to depend on some pipe-smoking dot-faced salesman,

1195
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,920
or a bunch of aliens from outer space,

1196
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,900
or a bunch of invisible monsters to make our own slack?

1197
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,320
Hell no!

1198
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,500
Friends, Bob is not the answer, and neither is anything else.

1199
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,960
We must learn to think for ourselves, although only Bob can show us how.

1200
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,820
And we must!

1201
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,740
All of you had better!

1202
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,380
You must question authority!

1203
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:22,840
Why?

1204
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,380
Or else, huh?

1205
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,620
We got somebody here who's been reading their pre-scriptures.

1206
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,240
There!

1207
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,940
One who dares to really question authority.

1208
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,220
And friends, really, honestly, I think that as bad as things are, if you can just...

1209
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,060
The scientific basis of slack is this.

1210
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,180
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1211
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,200
Even if they help, fuck them if they can't tell a joke.

1212
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,860
Yo, yeah, y'all know what time it is...

1213
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,900
If you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1214
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,880
please write to this address I'm about to give.

1215
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,880
That's B-B-B-B-BAAA!

1216
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:13,900
That Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1217
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,200
Once again, that's Box 140306.

1218
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,200
Dallas, Texas 75214

1219
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,900
www.subgenius.com

1220
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,900
and praise the...

1221
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,560
...to the side.

1222
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,780
We just knew they were on the ride.

1223
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,840
The sweetest squid you'll ever know.

1224
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,000
Blow you right through the door.

1225
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,700
They'll blow you right through the barburetor.

1226
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,580
A 3D squid falling from the sky.

1227
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,960
A 3D squid and they get through the water.

1228
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,100
A 3D squid where they're falling on out.

1229
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,620
A 3D squid.

1230
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,280
I got a tentacle.

1231
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,800
Oh no!

1232
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:14,980
There's a tooth.

1233
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,080
A great tentacle is everywhere.

1234
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,460
A great tentacle.

1235
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,200
A great tentacle.

1236
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,580
Oh my God.

1237
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,320
Oh my God.

1238
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,120
Look at this.

1239
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,420
Little suction cups.

1240
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,320
Oh my God.

1241
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,060
The peel.

1242
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,200
That's when they peel the suction cups off.

1243
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,160
I like it so much.

1244
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,040
Oh yeah.

1245
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,560
Mm-hmm, baby.

1246
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:34,620
Yeah.

1247
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,480
So if you're ever out of your life.

1248
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,340
Don't think you have to run high.

1249
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,520
When you see some hair of pink-pink snow.

1250
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,040
Falling down.

1251
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,720
Oh no.

1252
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,400
Hair of pink snow.

1253
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,800
Falling down right from the sky.

1254
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,540
From the sky.

1255
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,240
Just pull the hardwood and the rock inside.

1256
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,960
Pull on over.

1257
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,840
Open your mouth.

1258
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,280
And all the hairy squid with the best of its eyes.

1259
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,360
And do some genius and enjoy the ride.

1260
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,040
And then.

1261
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,060
A 3D squid falling from the sky.

1262
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,180
A 3D squid and they get through the salt.

1263
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,500
A 3D squid where they're falling on out.

1264
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,380
A 3D squid.

1265
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,140
That's right.

1266
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:15,840
The Lord.

1267
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:16,920
A 3D squid.

1268
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,340
A 3D squid.

1269
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,040
83D squid.

1270
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,300
They go from the sky in front of my car while I was driving down the I-90.

1271
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,780
I pulled over.

1272
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,300
I opened my car door.

1273
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,880
And they were blowing my mind through the car door.

1274
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,220
Placed all the hairy squid.

1275
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,480
Ah yeah.

1276
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:37,780
Ah.

1277
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:38,720


1278
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,460
Ah.

1279
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:41,960
Ah.

1280
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:42,400


1281
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,100
Ah.

1282
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,280
Ah.

1283
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:43,780
Ah.

1284
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:44,940
Ah.

1285
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:45,120


1286
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:45,120


1287
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:45,200


1288
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,040
Ah.

1289
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,040


1290
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,040


1291
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,040


1292
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,040


1293
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,100
Ah.

1294
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,020
Ah.

1295
01:00:59,100 --> 01:00:59,480
Ah.

1296
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:01,460
Ah.

1297
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,060
You gotta make a stand.

1298
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,220
