Wowie Bob!
Oh!
I don't think that's...
Hey, Pastor! Bob's here! I'm gonna call your father!
You're the drummer! Get the kids! You're gonna get the house!
What the fuck am I gonna do with this?
Bob!
Now this... Bob...
can't really exist.
Bob-bob!
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth in the last few weeks?
No, not yet.
There are repeated references to Bob.
He was a threatening presence in our life
by early adolescence.
There are intimations of abuse and molestation on a regular basis.
That's Bob.
It's all a lie.
What?
It's not what you think.
This isn't rape.
It's research.
But I will not be researched!
Alright, let's go.
Thank you for the education.
Gentlemen, we've just received a Ph.D.
in stupidity.
Doctor, shall we?
It's not criminal
to try and understand female emotions.
Anyway, friends, this...
I must say, this was
indeed the best X-Day
ever. So far.
So far.
I suppose there's still room for one
slight possible
screw up. You can always screw the pooch
at the last moment.
The worst that could happen is we'd have to do it all over
again, and it has been...
The bands have been fantastic.
We've
managed to
ban everyone
who wasn't a good band.
And so
altogether, I think
Dobbs will be pleased.
Connie, I know, is pleased.
I heard her moans and groans echoing
through the woods last night.
By the way,
although there were some
excellent bands down on the main
stage, I don't know how many
of you caught what was going on in here
last night. There was really
quite an amazing
setup with the Ministry of Slack
combined with the Evolution Control
Committee, and all the
music and pictures that they've
stolen over the years, all crammed together
into one great big mashup.
I actually put
my camera down long enough to dance
for half a second.
Yes, Joy was unconfined.

And, friends,
that was an excerpt from the
aforementioned jam
between Trademark G of the Evolution
Control Committee and Ministry
of Slack. Mainly
Reverend Exister
and Reverend Slander Bob.
Before that, and more later,
some live hour of Slack with
Dr. Howell
from the Wisterian Cafe
stage. Not all
of this episode is from 14X
Day, just most of it.
DJ Reverend
Slackmaster Sarcastro
did the intro, for instance.
But now back to X Day
Drill with the band from which
this background music also
comes, Boron
Nuzzle, on the main stage
with a rant by Reverend
Sid Redlin, a rant
of much gravity.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Boron Nuzzle Foundation
sponsored
by the
Cortester Manifold Emporium
Scientific
Endowment Division.
Through intensive research in the movements
of mollusks within
fourth-dimensional matrices has made a
startling and potentially
lethal discovery.
Gravity is in
our minds!
Yes,
as stunning and arbitrary as this may
seem,
universal gravitation
is defined by Newton as a useful
conceptual delusion
collectively brought into existence through the projected
will of our entire planet's population
to further our own physical
evolution and scientific development as a species.
The philosophical and historical implications are, of course, staggering.
At what point was gravity agreed upon?
Is it a function of intelligence?
Was gravity retroactively applied to past events to make a cohesive fossil and geological
record that would help sustain this collective self-deception for our own benefit?
Yet there is more!
A schism amongst the masses!

The pertinent research agencies has arisen!
The Society for the Preservation of Gravity
fears gravity may be finite!
This group of learned entities seeks to encourage the use of levitation by the populace as a
means to extend the lifetime of our gravitational supply until we discover another gravitational
source or until such time as gravitation is no longer needed.
In marked contrast to this organization, the
gravitational integrity foundation seeks to maintain the illusion of gravity in the minds of the people at all costs!
They fear that if some persons engage in hovering activities, the disillusionment which will occur in the minds of non-hovering entities
will result in a gravitational breakdown throughout the system at large, resulting in gravitational disintegration before we as a scientific community and as a species.
are prepared to deal with the consequences.
Both parties cannot be correct!
Boron Nuzzle is a democratic and enlightened collective
and encourage you to make your own decisions!
You may choose to levitate
or you may reject this notion
as intrinsically dangerous
to the good of humans the world over.
But you must decide!
And the time to decide is now!
Attention! Attention!
Subgeniuses!
The music for tonight is about to commence
and
and
and

,
and
to introduce our first musician
who has come a long, long way.
He's come such a long way
that I personally do not feel qualified
on any level to verbally masturbate him enough.
However, our beloved Priestess Pisces
is of just the right gender
and general nastiness to be able to do so correctly.
So, we've got this guy who's got this rig
that's a conglomeration of circuit fuckery
and masterful sub-engineering
who has come all the way from that other coast
so far away in the land of trees and lots of rain.
From Portland, Oregon, please give it up
for Dr. Zeronius and the Cult of Zere!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.






, hello.
It is rare that so many subgenius doctors
of such extensive pedigree are seen in one place
causing a sort of chain reaction of a quorum.
At least, I think we feel the radiation, the contamination.
I'm going to bring him out in just a moment.
But first, our next cult is the original cult
co-author of the book of Zere, personal friend of Zere,
creator of Zere.
I am speaking of none other than Cult of Zere.
So please be ready to limber and loosen up for
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Cult of Zere.
Oh!
You'll be way happy.
Cult of Zere.



Oh!
Oh!
Anyway, that's the rosy future
But now we are still enmeshed in the toils of this planet
And the last convulsive struggles of X-Day
And convulsive they may well be
It's going to be a struggle for me to make it
We have two bands tonight
Two completely different bands
Cult of Zere
Which I played just a little bit of
Just before as we were setting up
It's weird experimental music
It had your voice mixed in with it
It did
Yes, Cult of Zere will be playing tonight
Followed by, to tap everything off
The Duke of Uke
The Duke of Uke, ladies and gentlemen
Hail Caesar
You will truly be
The, uh, well, Cult of Zere has just delivered
Great, I've got my own copy now
Excellent
Everything is going according to plan
Yes, Slag
What a quaint concept
Nice packaging
And it's dedicated to J.R. Bob Dobbs
Well, isn't that the best?
There's a lot of albums dedicated to J.R. Bob Dobbs
Usually by up-and-coming rock stars
Who OD'd on heroin
Just before they got rich and famous
Like Slugger
Sublime
That nice young man who created Sublime
He had to go and die of a heroin overdose
Just before he made us famous
That's too bad
Probably for the best
Heroin was his hero
Well, let's see
What do we have on the docket
In our remaining moments
Of the last hour of Slag
I've lost the docket, Dr. Hal
Oh dear, that's too bad
Although I guess there are still
We'll have to fly this thing by the seat of the pants
Coming in on a wing in a minute there, Slugger
Prayer
Though there's one motor gone
Still we must carry on
Or you could just free associate
Come up with a fountain
From your creative spring
Easy for you to say
You've got one
Yeah, but you've been doing this all these years
Yes, indeed
It's as easy as falling off a bicycle
You'll never forget
I can always just suddenly go
He's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen
It's easy
Actually, it's not easy to speak in tongues
I really did practice for
On and off
Not daily, not all day, every day
But I did practice
Okay, well, let's do some sharing then
You know, the other day this film crew that was here
Was asking me about
Not only about my influences and church influences
But your influences
And one thing I threw in
I don't know whether you have done this
But I thought it fair to mention
Was that if you grew
Grew up in Texas
Or in the American South at all
At night on the radio
You would hear a torrent of these honkers and shouters
These preachers
Coming up
Pulling it out
And broadcasting to the faithful
And this is surely a great central influence
On everything the Church of the Subgenius has ever done
Sure, that's how we learned
My personal favorite was
The great Reverend Jimmy Swagger
Swagger
I believe that Swagger was a sincere preacher
That's what I liked about him
He has been compared to Mick Jagger
The Mick Jagger of preachers
Well, it rhymes with Swagger
His offstage backroom habits
Apparently were kind of similar too
But he was
Unlike Jim Baker
Who was just a faker
Trying to make money
Rhymes with Baker
Unlike so many of
Or
He was a sincere preacher
He was the real thing
Like Dr. Gene Scott
Now, he was
There was another great preacher
The late, great Dr. Gene Scott
Not as much of an influence
Because we were already kind of like him
But his
Bulldaughter
His facial similarity to an aging Kerwin Matthews
Was always off-putting
So, friends, yes, it's true
We have a lot to thank the conspiracy for
Such as insane money-grubbing
Preachers
Where would the church of the subgenius be
Without insane money-grubbing preachers?
And just think
I've heard people say
Well, they ought to outlaw that sort of thing
My grandmother gave
$10,000 to that radio preacher
That I should have inherited
Friends, the day that they make it illegal
To spend your money on something stupid
We're out of business
So, praise our wonderful country of America
And every other country
Where you're free
To spend your money on anything you want
No matter how dumb it may appear
Damn straight
They call it discretionary spending, don't they?
Well, that's your discretion
Whether or not you want to do it at all
I never heard such a tissue of malarkey
People want to fix everything up
They go off half-cocked
And they make it worse than it ever was before
Good afternoon, Bob
Welcome to Bob
I'll be here talking about
Christian, satanic, neo-Nazi occultism
What's on your mind?
Hi, Bob
Seated across from me
Live in the studio today is Bob
Bob is a satanist
He is a self-described occult fascist
Correct?
Absolutely
A whole lot of other things
You're an occult fascist?
Yes
You are a satanic neo-Nazi?
Yes
No, no, no
Yes, not precisely
We don't use fascist in the terms of it being fascist
Just more to represent
It being fascist
Judeo-Christian satanists
We see democracy as being
Basically the twin of
Judeo-Christian fascist
Satan
It's a
It's a
Beastial
Yes
Animal
Like the true part of man
Man is absolutely an animal
That's a good analogy, Bob
You listen to me
You know where I'm coming from
What do you feel like walking in here and sitting
I think one of the reasons I enjoy
These people who are weak and confused
Bob said there's a sucker born every minute
You're dressed in black
You Mr. Satanist
You're making good time of it
And confused people
Weak and confused fascist Christian Satanists
Yes, yes
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yes
Head to foot
Yes
Like they're savagery, they're independence
What do you mean secret underwear?
I don't know, I just maybe got
Did you wear some sort of secret underwear that you weren't telling your followers about?
Tell, tell
See, this is outrageous
You gutless wimping faggot
You're not even a fascist social darned as Christians
I have to take a break
Bob will be right back
65, 50, 98, 98
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob
Bob did not edit that
Cult of Zere did

Because, ladies and gentlemen,
this is called
Stairway to Britney.
And, ladies and gentlemen,
if I may introduce here,
live, on stage, here,
at X Day,
Miss B-B-B-B-Britney Spears.
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
Oh, baby, baby

Thank you.
Woo!
That's, uh, that's, uh, that's the sound that refreshes, actually.
Yeah, it actually kind of did, actually.
I really actually spent.
We also have, uh, what else tonight?
Yeah, that's about it.
After the baptism, I figure it's gonna take,
we're not gonna have any more Bulldada auction.
We already made our $250.
You'll be left to your own devices.
Uh, we, yeah, until, there'll be some great bands down there.
Uh, did I mention Duke of Uke?
Yes, you did.
If you don't know the concept behind Duke of Uke,
uh, bring some toilet paper with you,
because you may soil your pants in surprise.
The first time I heard the Duke on stage,
I, no one had explained what he did.
And it was at a subgenius revival,
and this guy comes out with this little ukulele
and starts, like Tiny Tim, plinking along,
and I thought, oh my God,
not another one of those terrible,
heartland revivals.
But, then, I recognized what the song was
that he was playing on that little ukulele.
And that is the key to the greatness
that is the Duke of Uke.
You'll all find yourselves singing along,
if not pogoing, to that one instrument.
Uh, slam dancing and, and having a, uh, what, a mud pit,
what do the kids call it these days?
I think the term you're looking for is mosh pit.
Mosh pit, yeah, right.
Hey na na, hey na na, hey na na, hey na na.
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low,
lean back on my radio,
some gad was playing down some rock and roll
out of Soli's set.
Then the loud sound, it seemed, of fate
came back like a slow voice on a wave of fate.
There was no DJ, there was AZ Cosmic Drive.
There's a star man waiting in the sky,
he'd like to come and meet us,
but he thinks he'd blow our minds.
There's a star man waiting in the sky,
he told us not to blow it,
cause he'd know this all was wild.
He told me he'd let the children use it,
let your children lose it,
let all the children boogie.
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah.
At the phone someone's quite picked on you,
he asked for out so you heard him too.
Turn on your TV, you can pick him up on channel two.
Look out your window, you can see his light,
if we can sparkle he may land tonight.
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up and fried.

Thank you for choosing Subgenius.
There's some conspicuous absences this year.
I'm not about to talk what you think I'm talking about.
Our friend, Admiral Tits, couldn't be with us here today.
Praise Tits!
Praise Tits, indeed.
But she had sent me a thing the other day requesting that I play this,
so I hope this gets to her somehow.
The sun on the meadow is summery warm
The barren of forest runs free
But gather together to greet this dawn

awaits unseen
Tomorrow belongs

I tried to take all the Nazi out of it.

a very involved new preacher,

St. Elliot at Wisteria in Southern Ohio
at the 14X Day Drill.
But now the opposite.
The great St. Andrew the Impaled
telling of the after effects
of too much false slack.
The Hangover Song by Andrew.
With Senator Speck from the Amino Acids on Drums
making it up as he goes along.
But I guess,
we all do that non-stop, don't we?
Yeah, this is that song,
this is that song about,
about when you wake up
Sunday morning
and you don't know where you are.
Shinin', it's blindin', it's ridin'
My eyes out late again
with my crazy asshole friends
and I can't even pretend it'd be okay
for me to spend more time
time
Hey, anybody here got the time?
My head is floating like a boulder
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders
I just love when my day starts like this
Useless and clueless
I do this each time
Just when you think it might start to sink
And it's gone in a blink
And I'm back to the brink again
Hey, anybody here see my friends?
My head is floating like a boulder
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders
I just love when my day starts like this
I just love when my day starts like this
Here it is!
Don't know where I'm going
Don't know how I got here
I just love when my day starts like this

Don't even know where I am
Seriously
Seriously
Can somebody tell me how to get back to 15?
I don't recall too much of last night
Left my car on the east side
How I got here with some guy
Really all I know
Something about Albrecht
Albrecht!
Albrecht!
Albrecht!
Wasted
Yeah, face it
I spaced it
It's fine
What do I do now?
I'll somehow get downtown
Bring out everyone around
Cause I gotta feed the clown inside
Inside
Hey, anybody here give me a ride?
My head is floating like a boulder
Feel like it's coming off my shoulder
Feel like it's coming off my shoulder
I wonder just how long I'm gonna stay here?
I wonder just how many disasters
Between now and the sweet hereafter
My head is floating like a boulder
I just love when my
Here it is!
Yeah!
I think the term you're looking for is mosh pit?
Mosh pit, yeah, right.
I've watched those from afar.
I've watched those from afar.
I've documented them.
Well, I was on tour with GWAR, you know, the metal band GWAR for five days.
I voluntarily left the tour after that because
How did you avoid heat prostration?
I didn't. That was why I quit.
It gets hot in those concerts.
But I did have a good time filming the band and watching the kids injure each other.
But the most important thing to me was the very first time I saw that band GWAR,
this question entered my head that I had to have answered.
How do their costumes smell when they take them off?
Fairly right.
Do they wash them?
And I learned the answer.
No, they do not wash them and they smell like the most diseased mildew you could ever imagine.
I think that adds to the totality of the experience.
In fact, at X Day Drill 97, I believe, the sex executioner from GWAR,
came to X Day for his vacation.
The one day of the year that he didn't have to get splattered with fake blood.
Unfortunately, that happened to be the day that Legume had a big globe of the earth filled with fake blood,
which he smashed with a baseball bat,
splattering poor Chuck Varga, the sex executioner, with fake blood, even on his vacation.
Another interesting irony about X Day.
The...
One of the only times anyone has been injured here,
it was the medical doctor who happened to be here, Dr. Tillis.
Physician, heal thyself.
He was standing a little bit too close to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer
when we launched it for the last time a bit prematurely using actual dynamite.
And the doctor himself actually got a chunk of the head embedded in his chest.
A badge of honor, Ivan.
Indeed.
In fact, he is...
He is a...
He is a rich and successful rancher now.
Praise Dr. Tillis.
So, if you get hurt here, later on you'll get rich.
The End
Who shall defile the temples of the ancient gods?
A cruel and violent death shall be his fate,
and never shall his soul find rest.
And to eternity, such is the curse of Bob, our King of all Bubbies.

Mighty call the sheriff and said, come quickly.
Somebody broke in the freezer and stole all the steaks.
The dog was still hot, the sheriff said, man.
Sounds to me like the Lakeview Man
The Lakeview Man is a wild man
Lives in the woods outside of town
Howls at the moon, listen if you can
You might hear the Lakeview Man
Say he was a soldier who came home from war
All in one piece but with emotional scars
Beyond the story, argue about the date
Vietnam or the war between the states
And the Lakeview Man is a wild man
Lives in the woods outside of town
Lives in the woods outside of town
Howls at the moon, listen if you can
You might hear the Lakeview Man
I took a shortcut to the river last night
A beard and a blur in the long beam lights
You could see me in the dark night
Drank a few beers, dipped a few stones
And I drove a little faster on the way back home
A dog disappears, a cow is found dead
A chicken is missing, found missing its head
Shotgun gone, bread in the sand
Two times, two times, two times, two times
One more shot, oh ¿os��os?
semi-alerta
And the Lakeview Man Is me who lives in the woods outside of town
Sit down by my side and watch me
Hold my einlein
Dig my hole






Who lives theacking
is a wise may
howl
beeline
They set the lay again
You my
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
You might hear the Lakeview Man.
The Large did that whole last 10-minute collage
except for the song by the Rainmakers, Lakeview Man.
I'm a Lakeview Man myself.
I go to Lakeview Cemetery nearby to collect biological samples.
This has been Hour of Slack number 1327 from the Church of the Subgenius.
At subgenius.com, you can hear the completely X-rated and un-arable episode
number 1327.5XXX, all the stuff too hot for broadcast radio.
In fact, if you look hard enough, you can find just about anything at subgenius.com.
You might even find Bob.
Praise Bob.
