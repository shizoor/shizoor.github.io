1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,280
This is our world, listener. It's a world full of misery, filth, disease, war, suffering, corruption, hopelessness, and the self-genius power of SWAT.

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:27,060
How they hate us. 84% favor 69% by just 47% of 33%.

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,680
The thing about this is, as you notice, we keep changing people throughout, which doesn't mean that any person is completely there.

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,160
Nobody's permanent.

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,340
Well, no, I know.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,420
No one on this stage is permanent. There is nothing that says that we have to stay.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,780
If you can play or sing or whatever, step up.

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,260
Bob.

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,780
Bob.

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,880
Bob, Bob.

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,900
Bob, Bob, Bob.

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,280
Bob, Bob, Bob.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,580
Bob, Bob, Bob.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:09,860
Bob.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,680
Bob, Bob.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,040
Basically, today I learned how to rip-rip-rip-rip-rip-rip-rip.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,880
Last night, I hung out with my friend Bob.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,880
Basically, today I learned how to rip-rip-rip-rip-rip-rip.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,920
Last night, I hung out with my friend Bob.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,880
I hung out with my friend Bob.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,180
I hung out with my friend Bob.

22
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,840
I hung out with my friend Bob.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,000
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,060
Basically today I learned how to rip, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,880
Last night I hung up on a friend, Bob.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,260
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,700
as those which were first called flying saucers

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,020
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,300
who let their imaginations run away with their voracity.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,300
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,180
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,120
Some of them expanded the stories to alleged rides in the UFOs.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
Something, everything went black and I realized

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,160
that I'd been cut off and shut off for the most time.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,820
Nobody was listening to me.

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,440
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,180
not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights

38
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,840
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,060
and put into this studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,220
with lights and lights.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,800
And it was a small man with a swollen head

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,780
and hideously deformed eyes

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,160
sitting behind the console pushing the button

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,580
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,800
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,180
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
And they didn't say anything.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,500
They just kept flashing those lights at me

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,100
and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,460
And the man with the funny head, the leader,

51
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,100
the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

52
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,580
Well, I just want to know,

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,280
do you want to do it?

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,020
Do you want to be in the church?

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
At the church?

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,680
And where is there?

57
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,720
Yeah.

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,620
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,660
and it wasn't really a dream

60
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,320
until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,020
And suddenly it all came back to me.

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,980
I realized they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

63
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,140
when they put the...

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
Where is that noise coming from?

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
There's a nasty...

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,720
Hum.

67
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,840
Who's humming?

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,700
Which one of you people is giving me a hum job right this minute?

69
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,620
One of you is a 60 cycle signal.

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,700
Two months ago, the observatory issued a press statement

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,820
that the world was coming to an end.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,580
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,860
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

74
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,640
No, sir.

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:43,920
Oh.

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,720
The cult is full of superstition and mysticism.

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,220
You've got the people pretty angry.

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,800
It doesn't matter.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
You mean that all mankind will go violently insane?

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,820
What's behind that?

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,740
The self-genius.

82
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,600
Power of...

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,380
What?

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,760
It was very popular.

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,200
Well, it lasted.

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,980
Popular?

87
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

88
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,540
Bob, that's the high priest.

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I was talking to him yesterday.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,340
Well, we'd better get going.

91
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,540
Hallelujah.

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,240
Dr. Hal is here.

93
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,980
And he's tattooing some sort of a mystic alien lure

94
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,080
on Princess Wee's chest.

95
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,940
Wait a minute.

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,760
What did I...

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,060
Oh, okay.

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Well, the...

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,740
Actually, no, it's not that bad,

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,980
but the aliens have been rupturing us a little bit at a time.

101
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,000
That was one thing we figured out about X-Day.

102
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,300
Every year, every one of us is missing a few more parts.

103
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,460
In some cases, it's really obvious,

104
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,240
like hair, brain cells,

105
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,980
morals, memory.

106
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,480
And in my case, they took my...

107
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,220
They're taking my hearing little by little.

108
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,560
So if you see me doing that or looking confused, that's why.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,280
Okay.

110
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,200
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,060
What, what, what?

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,320
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

113
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,540
What?

114
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,820
Oh, right.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,700
I'm at the Slacker Mansion Studio in Cleveland Heights.

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,580
And it's hour of Slack number 1100.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,280
All right.

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,280


119
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,160
1100 and 14.

120
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,000
Friends, it's hard to keep track.

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,320
We've been on the road a lot.

122
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,200
The last event was the Total Devotional here in Cleveland,

123
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,180
where we annually worship our rival cult, Devo.

124
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,660
There will, therefore, be some weird Devo covers coming up in this and future shows.

125
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,100
But we're also still at 10X Day with Dr. Howell, as you just heard.

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Probably better than I could.

127
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,200
And there may...

128
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,540
There may even be some sermonizing from Starwood 27.

129
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,140
And we're catching up on the stockpiled collages by Fernanda Nende-Lee-Murr,

130
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,160
which opened the show and closed it.

131
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:10,940
And thanks to Reverend Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com for his collages,

132
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,000
such as when he hung out with Bob.

133
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,580
And as we're about to hear from WREK Atlanta,

134
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,660
Reverend Susie the Floozy's collage about humanity's attempt,

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,420
to kill Bob.

136
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,580
1-2-0!

137
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,080
1-2-0!

138
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,500
1-2-0!

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,800
1-2-0!

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:37,800


141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,880
Can't you drive it away?

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,300
If you have an idea how to do it, won't you tell us?

143
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,120
Gentlemen, we have tried every force known to us.

145
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,140
We can't kill him.

146
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,140
We have failed.

147
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,500
What are you going to do now?

148
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,660
Just wait.

149
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,240
Till he goes away.

150
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,060
This is a news bulletin from the WGBS radio newsroom.

151
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
A tape-recorded press release has just been delivered to this station,

152
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,700
as well as several others in the city,

153
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,020
from an unidentified group,

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
who claim to have kidnapped an experimental nuclear reactor.

155
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,740
Oh, yeah!

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,440
The terrorists claim it is hidden somewhere in the Wilton district,

157
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,400
and that the area should be evacuated immediately.

158
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,100
Here is part of the tape we received.

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,120
If $10 million in gold bullion is not delivered by jet

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,500
to a ship 200 miles due east of Washington,

161
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,520
we are going to overload the reactor

162
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,140
and flush fallout into the atmosphere

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,120
that won't disappear for years.

164
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,860
Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists.

165
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,340
And, um...

166
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,280
You're either with us or against us.

167
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,700
Um...

168
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,480
It means that we have to move quickly.

169
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,420
Move in a way that is, uh...

170
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,900
Uh...

171
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,480
Effective and sometimes lethal.

172
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,900
Right!

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,840
And...

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,820
Let's get cleaned up.

175
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,320
And...

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,340
Find a drink before the bar is closed.

177
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
We're on the hunt.

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,180
Dutch, don't talk about that stuff.

179
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,720
God, Dutch, how are you?

180
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,200
Nancy and I are hooked on heroin.

181
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,300
Well, thank you, Dutch.

182
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,700
It'll be too late by then, won't it, Reverend Staines?

183
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,960
If you want a picture of the future,

184
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever.

185
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,100
Godzilla!

186
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,480
At last!

187
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,360
Abort firings! Abort firings!

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,060
Interception will fragment bacilli-carrying missiles.

189
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,980
Repeat, abort firings!

190
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,120
Three billion human lives ended.

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,440
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day.

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,660
They lived only to face a new nightmare.

193
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,020
The war against the machines.

194
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,900
You'll use the fine art of threat with Bob.

195
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,540
You realize you've got to slow Bob down.

196
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,540
Do you know why?

197
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
To strike at Bob in some way.

198
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,960
What are you going to do?

199
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,620
Well, I suppose I should kick Bob.

200
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,380
I wouldn't if I were you.

201
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,120
All right, I'll do it.

202
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,920
But of course, only as a lesson to Bob.

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,440
Right.

204
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,420
No, you're not worried about Bob.

205
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,220
And living in Bob's home makes it all so easy.

206
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
And on the morning of the third day, as you're about to leave the house,

207
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,660
you run into Bob downstairs.

208
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,860
All right, Bob.

209
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,520
You asked for this.

210
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,620
I haven't asked for anything.

211
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,800
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

212
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,940
But how hard do you want me to kick Bob?

213
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,660
Quite.

214
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,120
Quite?

215
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,580
Oh, no.

216
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Oh, yes.

217
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,360
He might not like it if Bob...

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Oh, Bob wouldn't mind.

219
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,980
Yes, I know.

220
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,240
I've already done it.

221
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,820
Had fun?

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,320
Oh, yes.

223
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,040
Yes.

224
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,260
Yes.

225
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:07,980
What the tea?

226
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,200
It's on fire.

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,320
Would you tell me if my face was on fire,

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,460
Dr. Howe. I would tell you but on that great day when the sea shall give up her

229
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,800
dead and the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne then it is

230
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,420
said there shall be weeping and gnashing of mandibles and I'm afraid on that day

231
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,960
you might not even notice that your fire was on face.

232
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:24,200
But of course we are far from that now at our peaceful pleasant bucolic rural remove here at

233
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:32,960
the Brushwood campgrounds at X Day 10 where no one's face is on fire yet. But we will tell you

234
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,100
if your face is on fire because you're among friends. We're not the kind who are just going

235
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,940
to sit around and go kind of like that guy's face is on fire and he doesn't even know.

236
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm not going to tell him.

237
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,720
No we'll let you know and we'll even if we happen to notice that your pants are unzipped or something we'll let you know.

238
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm sorry to bother you.

239
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,600
They always do when I walk out on stage with my pants unzipped.

240
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,780
Did you know that your trousers are unsnapped? Kindly take care of that thing.

241
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,300
But on the other hand some subgeniuses keep it that way.

242
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,400
That's right.

243
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,020
As one of them said I like it that way. It saves time.

244
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,940
Yes like the old story about the old man.

245
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,020
Yes.

246
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:19,200
About the spoon and the piece of string. But we don't have time to tell every sad tale that comes our way.

247
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,940
There are some things to announce though.

248
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:30,480
If you all haven't taken a look at it there's a wonderful work of art curated by Susie the Floozy taking shape over there.

249
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,720
The giant subgenius X Day 10 comic strip.

250
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,380
And right over there now you can see Pantiera working on it.

251
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,900
Lots of hands have gone into its construction.

252
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,380
And there's still more work to do.

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,000
Although you shouldn't draw on people's extant artwork.

254
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,400
You should feel free to embellish.

255
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,480
Embellish even if it be in the margins.

256
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,820
To make it a rich document for all time.

257
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,340
To be enshrined in the hall of subgenius martyrs.

258
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,640
Yeah and we're going to need a really big scanner.

259
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,180
If anybody's got a scanner that's like 3 feet by 13 feet.

260
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,880
Or a non-scanner.

261
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:20,080
Or a not so dithery digital camera to click many snaps which can be combined through the miraculous agency of Photoshop.

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey this must be a clue Sarge said Nobby who'd returned to his default activity of mooching about and poking at things to see if they were valuable.

263
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,380
Look someone dumped a load of stinking old rubbish here.

264
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,260
He'd wandered across to a plinth which did indeed appear to be piled high with rags.

265
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Don't touch that please said Sir Reynolds rushing over.

266
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,380
That don't talk to me about Mondays.

267
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,640
It's Daniela Rina Powter's most controversial quark.

268
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,820
You didn't move anything did you he added nervously.

269
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,000
It's literally priceless and she's got a sharp tongue on her.

270
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,260
It's only a load of old rubbish Nobby protested backing away.

271
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,100
Art is greater than the sum of its mere mechanical components.

272
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,260
It's a bonus corporal said the curator.

273
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:22,120
Surely you would not say that Caravattia's three large pink women and one piece of gauze is just a lot of old pigment.

274
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,160
What about this one then said Nobby pointing to the adjacent plinth.

275
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,600
It's just a big stake with a nail in it.

276
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,900
Is this art too?

277
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:38,320
Freedom if it was ever on the market it would probably fetch $30,000.

278
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,380
Said Sir Reynolds.

279
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,960
For a bit of wood with a nail in it said Fred Colon.

280
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,760
Who did it?

281
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:56,520
After he viewed Don't Talk to Me About Mondays Lord Veterinary graciously had Miss Powter nailed to the stake by her ear said Stitch.

282
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,400
However she did manage to pull free during the afternoon.

283
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,180
I bet she was mad said Nobby.

284
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,560
Not after she won several awards for it.

285
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,300
I believe she's planning to nail her.

286
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,700
She's got herself to several other things.

287
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,200
It could be a very exciting exhibition.

288
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,500
Tell you what then sir said Nobby cheerfully.

289
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,160
Why don't you leave the old big frame where it is and give it a new name like Art Theft.

290
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,920
No said Sir Reynolds coldly.

291
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,360
That would be foolish.

292
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,940
The End

293
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,280
The End

294
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,760
The End

295
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,560
The End

296
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,400
The End

297
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,040
The End

298
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,280
The end

299
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:54,780
The End

300
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,120
The End

301
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:06,700
The End

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,120
The End

303
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,120


304
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,140
The End

305
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


306
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


307
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


308
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


309
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


310
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


311
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


312
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


313
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,140


314
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,160
The End

315
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,180
The End

316
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,220
The End

317
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,260
The End

318
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,300
The End

319
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,340
The End

320
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,380
The End

321
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,420
Has the same number of tails face up.

322
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes, it has.

323
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,920
Yeah.

324
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,780
And remember.

325
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,020
Suffer another night of torture.

326
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,940
This amazing invention has uncomfortable straps or headgear.

327
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,920
To learn more about the amazing, great, healthy head straps, go to ASS.com.

328
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,920
Dot com.

329
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,500
And after we do our little theological broadcast, hop, skip, and a jump here,

330
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,580
we're going to do, if I'm incorrect, please correct me, Reverend Stang,

331
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,360
the second half of the Bulldada auction.

332
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,500
That's right.

333
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,340
And there's some great materials here.

334
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,860
Yesterday.

335
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,440
Unbelievable stuff.

336
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,960
For $37 or something, one guy back there got not only everything you can get

337
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,660
from the Church.

338
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,620
The Church of the Subgenius in digital form.

339
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,660
I mean, it was like, it would cost you $5,000 to buy that much from the sales shack.

340
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,340
But he took our, when we said it was valuable, he believed us.

341
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,320
And he got the deal of the century.

342
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,700
Now, the second half of that deal is here.

343
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,900
Are you going to let him beat you out again, friend?

344
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,380
Incredible treasures are here.

345
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,620
Just because he's smarter than you?

346
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,460
Esoteric prizes.

347
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
What kind of a subgenius are you?

348
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,640
Are you going to let somebody prove their...

349
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:31,940
They're smarter?

350
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,880
Well, probably.

351
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,280
Because that's one definition of the term subgenius.

352
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,580
Greater than all the jeweled splendors of Far Cafe and the temples of Ind.

353
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:50,540
For example, we have Rocknar's mom's UFO occult kook book collection.

354
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,640
All the paperbacks which hysterically assure you of the imminence of the UFO invasion.

355
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,380
Yeah, these are the ones that we grew up with, too.

356
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,900
They're paperbacks, not hardcovers.

357
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,140
Yes, they're wonderful.

358
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,360
They have that look.

359
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,260
They just radiate occult kookdom.

360
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:18,540
And that entire collection is just one of the things which we will put up for sale here on this stage in just a while at the Bulldada auction.

361
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:26,500
As Nenslow put it, yes, I, too, remember that first walk down the occult aisle of the used bookstore.

362
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Ah, it does take one back to memories.

363
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,060
And there...

364
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,400
Mouldering on the shelf are Mary Baker Eddy's work on theosophy.

365
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,940
The secret science behind miracles by Max Freedom Long.

366
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
And its companion piece, Huna Magic.

367
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,020
And, of course, standing prominent among them all, the secret teachings of all ages.

368
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,180
Oh, that's available over there?

369
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,820
By Manly Palmer Hall.

370
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,300
No, it's not available.

371
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,700
I mean, that's what you used to see when you walked into an occult bookstore.

372
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,000
Now, just try to find any of that stuff.

373
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,260
Even the cheap reprint with the plastic fake leather cover that's not like the real...

374
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,380
That's the one I have.

375
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,960
Well, even that one is impossible to get these days.

376
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah, friends.

377
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,840
The secret teachings of all ages.

378
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,660
The secret teachings of all ages by Manly P. Hall.

379
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,120
Man, that book, that has everything in it.

380
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,680
You practically don't need the Church of the Subgenius when you have that.

381
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,340
Of course you do, to make everything refined and clear.

382
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,840
Well, yeah, the Church of the Subgenius is the secret teachings of all ages by Manly P. Hall.

383
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,900
Compressed in easy-to-read form and modernized so that it's pertinent to today's seeker.

384
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:47,900
It doesn't have the musty gloom of ancient semi-senile Rosicrucian mutterings and unopened Egyptian tombs.

385
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,440
That is, the book of the Subgenius doesn't.

386
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,520
But the secret teaching of all ages, I mean, it's got a little transparency.

387
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,160
And you can move Bacon's face over Shakespeare's and...

388
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,780
Look!

389
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,920
Bacon was Shakespeare.

390
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,160
It's got all these things in it.

391
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:12,060
But, as I was saying, the occult section of the bookstore, if there is even a bookstore,

392
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,080
if there is even an occult section, has self-help books by Donald Trump in it.

393
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:30,340
And it no longer has these wonderful curios that we gazed at in slack-jawed admiration as proto-subgenies.

394
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:30,900
Friends.

395
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,560
When you're a young subgenius, you'll believe everything you read.

396
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,960
And, boy, that's a great time in your life.

397
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,220
Your education expands.

398
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:47,060
You become full of falsehoods and bullshit to such an amazing point.

399
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:56,800
And then comes the long climb even higher where you, one by one, learn about the hoaxes.

400
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,500
You know...

401
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,460
The self-delusions.

402
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,740
The stang-eye-ever.

403
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,780
The suckers.

404
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,120
The fuckers.

405
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


406
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


407
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


408
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


409
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


410
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


411
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


412
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


413
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


414
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


415
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


416
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,740
Almost making you somewhat uncomfortable.

417
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,780
But, a number of years ago, I just dumped my whole occult library.

418
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,340
I just got...

419
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,360
I felt...

420
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,000
I didn't want it anymore.

421
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,320
I saved a few things, but, for the most part, out it all went.

422
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,300
Well, mine went into the basement where all the canisters of souls of the subgeniuses are.

423
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,460
So you can fish it out.

424
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,120
I still have mine.

425
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,040
I still have the book of Abramel and the Mage, the Malleus Maleficantius.

426
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,840
Karam, of course.

427
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,620
Some things like that.

428
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,660
But, you know, most of it I felt good riddance to bad rubbish.

429
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,660
Why do I need these occult scribblings when I am now in the church of the subgenius?

430
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,760
How many shitty rip-offs called the Necronomicon do you really have to have on your shelf?

431
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,900
Yes, really.

432
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,100
That occurs again and again.

433
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,160
Though I do have a copy of the Voynich manuscript, in fact, that I was unable to get.

434
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,780
I didn't want to get rid of it.

435
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,300
But, you know...

436
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,520
The one on human skin?

437
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,540
Nobody else would want such a thing, so I kept that.

438
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,080
But I got rid of most of it, I gotta tell you.

439
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:21,420
Because now that I'm in the church of the subgenius, we don't need these obtuse alchemical rants from pathetic ergot-influenced progenitors.

440
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,620
Right, we have our own.

441
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,940
And no doubt, although I hate to see it as a sort of a stick-in-the-mud luddite,

442
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,760
in the future we will drop even some...

443
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,440
Some of the solid ramifications of the church of the subgenius that you all own in the form of the subgenius book.

444
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,140
Future subgenius books may be injected, friends, subcutaneously.

445
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,800
Book pills are just around the corner.

446
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,040
You may be invaded by a train of juddering subgenius nanobots,

447
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,700
which will inculcate all the wisdom of Dobbs into your cerebral cortex

448
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,760
and take up a comfortable residence in the anterior frontal lobe.

449
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,580
I've always used the term sh median spectrum representization to stress the need to MeuP to

450
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,580


451
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,960
Decentral performances are just anything that we can caller into a different department.

452
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,840
I am positional.

453
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:29,840


454
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,300
Next is the actually sound.

455
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:30,760


456
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:30,760


457
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:30,760


458
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:30,760


459
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:38,360
collar he's not going very far differently saned persons has it occurred to you that with the

460
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,360
explosive growth of the church since the deal was originally made that perhaps we might not all fit

461
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,680
in the saucers has it occurred to you damn this place would be better this place would be fantastic

462
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:59,680
if it weren't for all these damn pinks is your idea of slack a scorched earth nuclear wasteland

463
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:07,120
well then then dig in with the wait wait come backists we might not get there to start with

464
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,920
but we'll get there in the end and I'll help you there

465
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:27,940
Reverend absinthe that explains his schism the white white come backists at X day with a leash

466
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,520
around his neck being held

467
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:37,840
by Pope s Pantiera who took him as a slave that romantic day at that festival at Brushwood before

468
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:47,940
that we heard some cut-ups by lemur and a cut from the audiobook of thud by Terry Pratchett

469
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:55,080
talking about art there as speaking of geeks the total devotional was a huge success at least for

470
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,500
us devotees and this year I was amazed and heartbroken by the fact that I was able to get

471
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:07,680
to see so many lovely girl geeks there there's hope for matings boys and more about that later

472
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:14,620
so don't give up hope yet we all suffer growing pains but which happens to be the name of this song

473
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,540
upcoming this devo ish song by occupant

474
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,700
you

475
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,640
so young

476
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,240
so strong

477
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,420
ignorance is bliss

478
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,820
fenced in

479
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,180
caught up again

480
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,460
in a place like this

481
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,500
dig in with the wait wait

482
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
people set a trap for you

483
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
usually you know what for wraiths

484
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,780
you're just another lab experiment

485
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,920
and your easy to replace

486
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,340
Too soon, too soon, centers overload.

487
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,940
Brought down, changed out of town, another dangerous road.

488
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,040
Should be a problem of biology, it's a choice you never made.

489
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,300
The seed is setting, you're subjected to a lethal dose of growing waste.

490
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,040
Take it through, laws were mostly made for fools.

491
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,880
Given I would be a husband who never was.

492
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,000
Does it chew up with veins that grow?

493
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,520
So young, so strong, ignorance is bliss.

494
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,820
Thin skin, caught up again, in a place like this.

495
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,680
People set a trap for you, using you, no waffle grains.

496
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,600
You're just another lab experiment, and you're easy to replace.

497
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,840
Should be a problem of biology, it's a choice you never made.

498
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,080
The seed is setting, you're subjected to a lethal dose of growing waste.

499
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,080
So young, too strong, ignorance is bliss.

500
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,000
Playin' withinnants, hard up on the

501
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,360
world the, the world the, world the, you gotta to play tough.

502
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:29,500
So young, too strong, ignorance is bliss.

503
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,260
That was Occupant,

504
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
who is reachable at myspace.com slash occupant.

505
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,580
And I got that from this year's annual collection of Devo covers,

506
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,540
which is a CD called Not Necessarily Beautiful,

507
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,440
But Mutated.

508
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,000
Thanks to Reverend Toth Wilder and DevoObsesso.com.

509
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,820
In fact, that music that I was just playing,

510
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,180
and will play again, in fact,

511
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:24,300
is a version of Girl You Want by Steve O. Lucian Dawn

512
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,340
from that self-same album.

513
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:35,360
And thanks also to Reverend Michael Pilmer.

514
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,060
And now, back to live hour of slack

515
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,620
at X Day with Dr. Howell

516
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,060
and home movies of your private life.

517
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,500
We are all set to project that.

518
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,640
And what the...

519
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,180
We have Lonesome Cowboy Dave calling in

520
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,720
right in the middle of our Bobcast.

521
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,700
And what's he allow?

522
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,560
Reverend Stang?

523
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,620
I'm trying to make him...

524
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,020
I'm trying...

525
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,760
Dave, I have you up against the microphone,

526
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,660
so yell.

527
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,180
He sounds like a buzzing insect.

528
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,620
I couldn't hear a solitary word.

529
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,680
No, it sounds...

530
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,540
I can hear him in the phone.

531
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,640
The mayfly.

532
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,680
Here today, gone tomorrow.

533
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,120
Evanescent, like snow upon the water.

534
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,800
Dave, you sound like a buzzing insect

535
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,680
when I put you up against the mic.

536
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,680
A poisonous, blood-sucking nightfly.

537
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,640
That's why we said you needed to be here.

538
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,580
Not a bee.

539
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,620
You can't just phone in.

540
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,980
This is a different kind of radio.

541
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,720
No, that one doesn't work.

542
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,820
That's not...

543
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,140
That's a wild mic that's a little too wild for us to use.

544
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,440
Right.

545
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,840
Well, we're on stage all the time, all day, every day.

546
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,340
So whenever you...

547
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,140
Right.

548
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,940
When you come out here, then we have shut things down,

549
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,700
but that's usually because it's real late at night.

550
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,840
So why don't you come out here,

551
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,400
and we won't shut it down, I promise.

552
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah, Dave!

553
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,820
Come on, man!

554
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,680
Dave's not here.

555
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,000
He's not here, man.

556
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,220
You hear him?

557
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,520
They've got torches, tar and feathers ready to go, Dave.

558
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,760
And curious 19th century agricultural implements

559
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,380
waving in the air, just waiting for you to get here.

560
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,360
Yeah, these are the fashionable kinds of tar and feathers, Dave.

561
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,240
So really, you should get your butt out here.

562
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,500
The festival is going on.

563
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,500
Yes.

564
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,000
The festival will fester without you.

565
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,700
Yeah.

566
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,840
Let me put you back with Princess Wee.

567
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,960
Well, folks, that was actually a call from Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

568
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,620
who can't be physically present at the moment,

569
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,960
but may be among us before long.

570
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,600
So what's on the agenda for this broadcast?

571
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,000
Well, we know that that wasn't an imposter,

572
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,960
because an imposter would have been on time.

573
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,580
This way we know it was really Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

574
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,300
and he's still lonesome right now.

575
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,460
But soon he'll be joining us.

576
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,460
Yeah, now...

577
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,420
I empathize.

578
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,480
Lonesome!

579
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,180
A fiery cloud of dust and a hearty lonesome!

580
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,060
The Lonesome!

581
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,380
With his Indian, that's what we think.

582
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,140
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find the Lonesome again!

583
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:17,940
Lonesome!

584
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,660
When Deputy Pete McCool captured Lonesome

585
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,620
and brought him to the jail in the Town of Unity,

586
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,320
he grabbed the deputy and started,

587
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,120
and he was back towards shore.

588
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,460
Ah, thanks, Indian.

589
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,720
It was an hour later when the Lonesome regained consciousness.

590
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,840
But at first he wasn't aware of that.

591
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,180
He blinked and muttered,

592
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,140
Um, this mask means I'm an outlaw.

593
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,020
Why?

594
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,800
I found your pocket.

595
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,460
Yeah.

596
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,300
You know, I...

597
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,740
Yeah.

598
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,120
Uh...

599
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm gonna be the gas station.

600
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says PR's bad.

601
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,240
It was bad.

602
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,440
And errors were made.

603
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,180
But a cover-up has been presented or put forward.

604
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,540
U.S. military officials say PR's bad when it explodes.

605
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,020
I know nothing.

606
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,160
On Wall Street 9212543.

607
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,860
The J. Paul Getty Museum and the Italian government will be killed.

608
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,480
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, killed.

609
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,600
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says this is subprime PR news.

610
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,180
X Day really is, aside from being a drill for the end of the world, it's the migration

611
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,760
of the subgeniuses to our breeding ground here in Brushwood.

612
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,700
And so wear your mating ritual outfits.

613
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,320
In some cases that might be nothing but your tattoos and your nose ring.

614
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,740
In other cases it might be your complete battle armor.

615
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,700
So, you know, it's up to you.

616
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,580
I'm going to wear my suit.

617
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,500
Just because that's the weirdest thing I could think of to wear.

618
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,460
Nobody here has ever seen me in a normal suit.

619
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,520
Where Dr. Howell is always in a nice suit.

620
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,600
So I don't know.

621
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,500
Anyway, that is happening tonight.

622
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,500
And there will be lots of dancing.

623
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,580
We've got to provide music.

624
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,680
You know, our DJ, DJ Shaver, is not here because he's getting married.

625
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:19,680


626
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,180
Friends, subgenius matings are happening all over the place.

627
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,200
That's right. Busting out all over.

628
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,580
There was a time.

629
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,120
Now we've been accused of being a sausage fest.

630
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,860
And I have to admit that looking at this crowd right now,

631
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,480
my sausage is not feeling especially festive.

632
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,220
Because it's mostly a bunch of guys.

633
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,460
But in the baptism it wasn't that way.

634
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,560
Oh, thanks for showing your tits, Reverend Brain Leak.

635
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,140
Well, now let's not be...

636
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,940
bitter.

637
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,500
The Bob-tism like any part of...

638
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,760
Well, the girls are all getting fixed.

639
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,100
They're all getting dressed up.

640
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,760
They're putting on their fancy dubs.

641
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,040
That's right.

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,080
Or taking them off.

643
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,860
However they wish to adorn themselves for this upcoming natal ceremony.

644
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,940
No, but it's true.

645
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,980
Back in the early days in Dallas,

646
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,520
it was a very small sausage fest.

647
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,480
But we lied.

648
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,120
And we acted like it was a sex contest.

649
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,340
And we were a cult.

650
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,160
And you know, if you tell a big enough lie,

651
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,660
people believe it.

652
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,560
And so it came true.

653
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,880
And that's...

654
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,460
You know, Magdalene and Jesus met out here.

655
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,920
Actually, Princess Wee and I met out here.

656
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
And we...

657
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,160
There's been many, many matings.

658
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,100
And little Yeti...

659
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,840
You'll see the little Yeti children scampering around.

660
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,900
Shambling under the trees.

661
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,400
Yeah, they shamble in a cute way.

662
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,100
And their little corkscrew tails are real cute.

663
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,360
The Volkerdings have one.

664
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,960
Dr. Drummond has, at the age of 89,

665
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,880
has become a dad again.

666
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,940
An extraordinary subgenius offspring.

667
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,620
Yes, he had to deal with childcare

668
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:07,280
and reinforcing a new containment vessel for the offspring.

669
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,960
But he might be back with Chaos McBobcat

670
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,000
and the young'un,

671
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,780
whose subgenius church epithet I know.

672
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,120
I cannot at the moment remember.

673
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,000
Maybe you know it, Stang.

674
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,000
Which? What's the baby's name?

675
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,880
What's the name of the phylo of the...

676
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,600
Yeah, the Uber baby.

677
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,920
The Uber baby?

678
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,140
The super-pooping, booby Uber baby.

679
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,600
That's what I get for asking.

680
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,940
Yes, friends.

681
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,360
There is a new efflorescence,

682
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,760
a new crop of subgeniuses

683
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,780
popping up through the fertile soil.

684
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,540
Because the great wheel of time goes forward.

685
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,360
And the Church of the Subgenius is a juggernaut

686
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,520
that doesn't stand still,

687
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,040
but eternally rolls forward.

688
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,080
The Church is like the masked killer

689
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,820
waiting outside your parents' window

690
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,540
to kill them,

691
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,360
so that you can be free,

692
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,680
yes, free,

693
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,160
to spread the seed word of Bob.

694
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,840
Now, uh...

695
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,540
And I was one of the first subgenius dads, folks.

696
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,740
I had two kids that were raised in the Church.

697
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,140
So much so that when the book of the subgenius

698
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,180
was first published,

699
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,440
and we got the very first copy in my house,

700
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,880
I put it on our little low coffee table,

701
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,780
and I went out of the room for a minute,

702
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
left my two-year-old daughter in there with it.

703
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,560
When I came back,

704
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,680
the book was soaking wet on the cover.

705
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,800
And I...

706
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,700
She was standing there looking sheepish.

707
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,500
And I said...

708
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,200
I looked from the book to her and I said,

709
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,820
Sivit?

710
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,880
Did you climb up on that table,

711
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,020
squat over that book,

712
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,140
and pee on it?

713
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,120
She said,

714
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,060
It was a accident.

715
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,480
Real cutely.

716
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,620
She was born in the time of pee.

717
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,020
She was born...

718
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,940
She knew what to do automatically.

719
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,740
She never even had to be taught.

720
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,640
And to this day,

721
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,100
she's one of the few other people who can go

722
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:04,860
perfectly.

723
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,780
Very early in her life,

724
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,080
she learned to pee on the Church of the Subgenius.

725
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,100
Yes, and...

726
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,860
She has pro...

727
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,220
She just got married herself last week.

728
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,140
I didn't conduct that wedding.

729
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,600
A Catholic priest did.

730
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,800
And that means I'm gonna have tons of grandchildren, friends.

731
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,400
Little Yeti kids.

732
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,540
And I made sure that the guy she was marrying

733
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,620
was of the blood.

734
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,100
Of the cloth, yes.

735
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,620
He passed the baseball bat test,

736
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,240
which is what every subgenius father puts...

737
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,660
Daters,

738
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,200
those who would court his daughter.

739
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,520
You wait behind the door,

740
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,840
and when the young man walks in,

741
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,600
you hit him on the back of the head

742
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,140
with a baseball bat

743
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,840
as hard as you can.

744
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,700
And if he lives, he is worthy.

745
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,580
And to...

746
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,240
To breed little Yetis with your beloved child.

747
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,140
Is that the hardest you can hit, pops?

748
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,380
That's... So...

749
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,640
We...

750
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,560
So, friends, things are looking up.

751
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,940
Now all we have to do is

752
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,720
hope that the conspiracy doesn't come

753
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,160
and take them all away from us

754
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,420
on account of having a copy of both the subjects.

755
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:15,740
We have to find the real subgenius,

756
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,140
or a few JPEGs from subgenius.com.

757
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,240
You must remove all subgenius images from your home.

758
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,060
Go, go, go!

759
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,240
I saw my baby yesterday.

760
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,780
I saw my baby yesterday.

761
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,760
She spent her money on a car.

762
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,920
Spent her money on a brand new car.

763
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,840
It didn't get away far.

764
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,180
You know it didn't go that far.

765
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,700
And so my baby said to me...

766
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,620
You know my baby said to me...

767
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,880
You know my baby...

768
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,680
She said, stop me.

769
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,060
She said, stop me.

770
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,440
She said, stop me.

771
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,060
I think I'm in a hole-in-a,

772
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,060
hole-in-a,

773
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,700
hole-in-a...

774
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,700
...

775
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,480
She said, stop me.

776
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,900
She said, stop me.

777
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,220
She said, stop me.

778
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,060
I think I'm in a hole-in-a,

779
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
hole-in-a,

780
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,440
hole-in-a...

781
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,360
Go, go, go,

782
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,880
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

783
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,680
Go, go, go,

784
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,400
I saw my baby yesterday

785
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,040
I saw my baby yesterday

786
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,080
She spent her money on a car

787
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,340
Spent her money on a brand new car

788
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,320
It didn't get her very far

789
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,700
You know it didn't go very far

790
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,520
And so my baby said to me

791
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,900
You know my baby said to me

792
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,320
You know my baby

793
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,040
She said stop it

794
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,560
She said stop it

795
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,880
She said stop it

796
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,980
I think I'm in trouble

797
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,760
Oh la, oh la, oh la

798
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,640
She said stop it

799
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,260
She said stop it

800
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,560
She said stop it

801
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,660
I think I'm in trouble

802
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,820
Oh la, oh la, oh la

803
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,800
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

804
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,060
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

805
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,620
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

806
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,300
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

807
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,400
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

808
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,700
Diva, the all-girl Devo cover band did that.

809
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,860
They are at myspace.com

810
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,960
slash Devo

811
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,280
Devo Lurement

812
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,460
Mm, mm, mm

813
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,800
And before Devo and Dr. Hal

814
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,560
We heard PR News and The Longeur

815
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,140
From Lemur

816
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,900
But now, Nowrel Pref

817
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,960
Drinking and flying

818
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,440
Drink, drink, drink

819
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,700
Some ass drank heavily before their scheduled launches

820
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,140
And none of this can we say for certain

821
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,660
That they factually did or did not occur

822
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,960
Heavy drinking alcohol

823
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,680
Hard ass

824
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,300
Whack, whack

825
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,400
Higher, higher, higher, higher

826
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,160
A bizarre ass love triangle

827
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,720
I wanna make one other point

828
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,840
I wanna make one other point

829
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,580
Make one other point

830
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,060
One other point

831
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,140
Barbecue in the afternoon

832
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,320
Barbecue in the afternoon

833
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,400
Support this surge

834
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,300
Let's get behind

835
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,060
Let's get behind

836
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,200
Barbecue in the afternoon

837
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,480
It was very badly mismanaged for nearly the first four years

838
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,540
This is a historic

839
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,740
Barbecue in the afternoon

840
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,880
Give us some time

841
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,220
The reality is that, um, dum, dum, dum

842
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,940
The reality, reality, reality, reality

843
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,440
Marriage should be between a man and a man and a man and a man and a man

844
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,940
And increasing the number of abortions

845
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,720
Which is something

846
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,640
Which is something ultimately

847
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:07,960
Ultimately

848
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,320
Ultimately

849
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,540
And ultimately with barbecue in the afternoon

850
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,520
We picked up the phone and took the call

851
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,620
That long distance was just a dream

852
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,640
We picked up the phone and took the call

853
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,360
Which should be between at maybe 2 hours or before

854
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,580
Which should be between at maybe 2 hours midday

855
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,360
Which should be between at maybe 2 hours or before

856
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,320
This is a long-awaited thing

857
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,320


858
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,320


859
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,400
Zie from the

860
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,420
contract

861
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:00,880
You gotta

862
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,240
You gotta

863
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,920
But falling in love, ain't a better thing to do.

864
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,380
🎵

865
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,720
Bobby and Ken in that great big pot.

866
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,200
He forgot to make it home one night.

867
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:34,520
🎵

868
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,320
Know what you see.

🎵

870
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,800
Simply can't be right.

871
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,300
Looks like the pot is worse than it's bite.

872
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,780
Why can't you have your cake and eat it too?

873
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,340
Why believe in things that make it tough on you?

874
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,960
Why scream and cry when you know it's true?

875
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,380
Why fall in love, ain't a better thing to do.

876

00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,080


882
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,000
He's young and in love, though he just runs easy.

883
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,060
He asked her what was wrong and she shot back violently.

884
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,700
Are you kidding me?

885
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,840
You must be kidding me.

886
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,380

00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,060
You are him up to pieces in a fit of jealousy.

889
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,980
Why can't you have your cake and eat it too?

890
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,440
Why believe in things that make it tough on you?

891
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,940
Why scream and cry when you know it's true?

892
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,420
Why fall in love when there are better things to do?

893
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:19,480
That was Reverend Samantha, dear friends, who is actually a beautiful young woman.

894
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,900
And her band, the Mutant Mountain Boys, who are actually half-girls.

895
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:31,860
And findable at myspace.com slash devofan.

896
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,380
They're all at myspace.com.

897
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,580
So am I, but I hardly ever look at it because it's so slow.

898
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:47,140
Much faster, friends, is subgenius.com, which, if you go to the radio page of subgenius.com,

899
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:55,060
offers downloads and podcasts of this show and logs with links to more of our contributors.

900
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,580
Such as Norell Preff.

901
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,140
What's your beef?

902
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,720
String your son up on a ramp and put a shackle around his legs.

903
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:10,060
And hoist your son into the air and cut his throat and let his blood drop upon the floor.

904
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:18,920
String millions of people all over the world and cut their throats and let their blood fall on the ground.

905
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,080
Go, go.

906
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,280
If you look into the Old Testament of the Bible,

907
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,620
you'll find instructions from God to slaughter millions of people all over the world.

908
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,280
Ladies and gentlemen.

909
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,780
Ladies and gentlemen, there are some among us who need to leave and they didn't want to miss the auction.

910
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,080
And so we're going to do something very unusual now.

911
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,700
We're going to close down this broadcast and open up the auction.

912
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,280
And then after we...

913
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,980
After we auction a few things off, we'll return and conclude our Bobcast.

914
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:08,140
This is just so some of our friends who are in the grip of time will be able to cast their bids.

915
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,840
Did you say Bobcast?

916
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,580
Are we doing that?

917
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,440
I didn't know. I've never heard that term.

918
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,400
Oh, well, I use it all the time. I mean...

919
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,300
I heard you say podcast, you know, but the podcast is really after the fact.

920
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,600
It's a real radio broadcast.

921
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,260
Yes.

922
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,960
I do them. I do them on my show.

923
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,460
We have TV sets all over New York right now.

924
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:40,860
Well, we've also in SF broadcast illegal signals and illegal TV signals, broadcast my show illegally on TV.

925
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,920
Done all of that, but...

926
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,780
Oh, is that so?

927
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,320
Yep.

928
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,380
K-Rob hacks into the local TV stations.

929
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,220
It was actually Dr. Monkey of Pirate Cat Radio, but this is...

930
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,960
Oh, that's right. We wouldn't want to...

931
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,740
...to our audience.

932
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:04,320
You can't receive this signal out here anyway, but you can download the podcast. Download the podcast.

933
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,600
So, just as...

934
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,240
Bobcast. The Bob?

935
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,520
The Bobcast.

936
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,460
The Bobcast.

937
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:10,740
The Bobcast.

938
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,340
It's in England. It's the Bobcast.

939
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:12,980
The Bobcast.

940
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,220
Well, Aunt Bertha and the Children's Bible Hour, a rival religious group, did their Godcast.

941
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,380
I'm just saying a Bobcast, which seems appropriate.

942
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,900
Okay, it's just funny because we never...

943
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,360
I've never heard that term before.

944
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:32,020
But now you have, because the new always arrives mixed in with the old.

945
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,120
Okay, so what have we got to auction here?

946
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,640
All sorts of things, friends.

947
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,180
All sorts of wonderful things.

948
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,020
The treasures of time lie high.

949
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,680
It earns coins and monuments scarce below the roots of some vegetables,

950
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:54,420
but we shall uncover them soon in the deep discovery of the subterranean world.

951
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:00,060
Some of you may not be content to rake the bowels of Potosi or regions toward the center,

952
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:05,400
but nature hath furnished one part of the earth and man another.

953
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:12,920
And now, Reverend Stang is pulling from the coffers and treasure chests of the subs

954
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,000
the incredible items which we are going to offer.

955
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,760
My God, look at that one.

956
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,300
A rejected Cafe Press shirt.

957
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,920
The church is subgenius.

958
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,060
That's the ultimate question.

959
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,180
And now, come on, you guys.

960
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,620
Is this a joke or a religion?

961
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,280
Why not both?

962
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,260
It's the only one that admits it's full of crap.

963
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,740
That makes it kind of like the only one that's not full of crap.

964
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,600
Yeah, it's the paradoxes of Bob equal the paradoxes of life.

965
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,560
Good old Robert Anton Wilson understood that.

966
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,300
Since the last time I was here,

967
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,900
Pope Bob Wilson...

968
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,220
went over...

969
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,740
He boarded the escape vessels ahead of us.

970
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,560
He had a first-class ticket.

971
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,620
A few of you may not know that Robert Anton Wilson died.

972
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,760
He picked January 11th to do it on.

973
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,020
One, one, one.

974
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,200
The joker to the end.

975
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,960
And he went out knowing that he was loved

976
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,860
because towards the end he was hurting for money

977
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,740
and in no time at all,

978
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,780
the Wilson fans and the discordians and the subgenius,

979
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,000
and probably the Flying Spaghetti Monsterites,

980
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,480
raised thousands of bucks.

981
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,960
So he was probably able to afford a really good coffin at that point.

982
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,400
But friends, I have to say here,

983
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,500
without Pope Bob and also his pal,

984
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,640
the late, great Saint Robert Shea,

985
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,340
and their book, Illuminatus,

986
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,460
there'd still be a Bob

987
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,000
and there'd still be a Church of the Subgenius,

988
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,740
but we wouldn't...

989
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,180
We wouldn't get it.

990
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,200
You know, we wouldn't have heard of it.

991
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,160
Bob would just be still selling it to other rich conspiracy jerks.

992
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,860
But on the other hand,

993
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,000
it could be that we only think we get it anyway.

994
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,360
See, only Bob really knows.

995
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,600
Bob Wilson used to go around making everybody a pope

996
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,440
and as a good copycat,

997
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,360
I'm going to make every one of you all subgenius ministers

998
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,740
whether you want it or not.

999
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,800
You're all ordained.

1000
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,800
You're all ordained ministers now.

1001
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,040
And the Church of the Subgenius

1002
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,220
and the Universal Life Church.

1003
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,420
Bob wants you ordained just for being here.

1004
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,040
That's all he needed to know.

1005
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,740
Who calls me villain,

1006
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,680
breaks my pate across,

1007
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,620
plucks up my beard and blows it in my face,

1008
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,620
creaks me by the nose,

1009
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,640
gives me the lie,

1010
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,740
the throat is deepest to the lungs.

1011
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,540
Who does me this?

1012
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,980
Who calls me villain,

1013
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,940
breaks my pate across,

1014
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,820
plucks up my beard and blows it in my face,

1015
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,880
freaks me by the nose,

1016
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,900
gives me the lie,

1017
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,980
the throat is deepest to the lungs.

1018
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:57,700
Who does me this?

1019
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,180
Who calls me villain,

1020
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,060
breaks my pate across,

1021
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,980
plucks up my beard and blows it in my face,

1022
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,980
freaks me by the nose,

1023
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,000
gives me the lie,

1024
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,140
the throat is deepest to the lungs.

1025
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,960
Who does me this?

1026
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,140
He, he, he,

1027
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,180
He, he, he, he,

1028
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:23,360
he, he, he, he, he, he.

1029
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,640
And thanks to Norrell Preff for that one.

1030
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,240
This is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1031
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:43,500
And you can get more information about that from Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 or subgenius.com.

1032
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:55,080
And to close out, friends, I've got a truly unique version of Devo's anthem, Jaco Homo, by our friend Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm.

1033
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,920
And he sent me this tune with a letter that says this.

1034
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:06,640
There are no live performances here, he says, with the exception of my vocals and accordion playing.

1035
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:13,460
All the other tracks were built from inserting literally hundreds of tiny samples.

1036
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,020
That I adjusted for pitch and timing, including percussion, all done on a single PC.

1037
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,800
As an experiment, I used Devo's original track as a template and guide.

1038
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,400
And gradually built up my own instrument tracks to the point where the original track was dropped out and removed.

1039
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:38,160
Leaving only my craftsmanship and reconstruction behind to produce the music you now hear.

1040
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,760
It was dark silver.

1041
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:06,000
So Bob, if you don't mind, could you paste the picture of the whole song in your自己?

1042
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,000


1043
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,000

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,000
