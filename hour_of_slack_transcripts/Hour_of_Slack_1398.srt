1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Well, right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,000
But I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,600
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,160
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try...

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,240
The Sogenius Power of Swag.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,020
Praise Bob!

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,200
What the hell do I think you're doing?

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,940
Did you know Bob is coming?

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,200
Pop is coming!

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,280
Praise him!

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,340
The end is nigh.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,440
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay!

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,260
To life is...

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,160
1998.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,400
Praise Bob!

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,020
Bob is coming!

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,160
X-Day is coming!

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,100
For day five dollars.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,900
Your wit would not threaten us.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,420
Shrew's brain for occupation.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,000
The Sogenius Power of Swag.

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,140
Oh, sleek and bastard, you make me writhe.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
Fear is the root of all courage and profit.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
Come on, Shane.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,520
Don't tell me you believe all this.

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,740
I traffic in the inexplicable.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,460
Take off that white hat.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,280
Boy, he's a skunk!

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,520
Go take it off.

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,280
Ever since I was a young boy,

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,240
Lulu has been back in service

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,240


33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,240


34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,080
He brings you even more trouble.

35
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,360
Bob!

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,640
And he's trapped.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,580
You've broken we time'srados!

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,980
Do me this favor,

39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


44
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


45
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,300
Because the rules are the only thing we got.

46
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,640
Promise to the rules.

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,860
None of you ever give the slightest consideration to a word I say!

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,660
That's because you're very boring!

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,840
Some kind of an avant-garde hoax has been perpetrated.

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm not going to listen to it.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,040
Let's go to the beach.

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,460
It's night and it's raining.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
I see you're determined to start an argument.

54
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,940
Go to bed, please.

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,920
Hug?

56
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,200
There's nothing less attractive than a psychiatrist

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,120
who pouts.

58
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,820
Cut short.

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,080
What do I have to do just to get in a word with you?

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,240
Offer sacrifice?

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,040
Then here.

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,540
I brought you a mud pie.

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Now can I talk to you?

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,020
Will you talk about the moon?

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Listen, everyone knows the moon is Roquefort.

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,380
I've come here to talk about Colonel Fell.

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
What about him?

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,860
Major Nanick approached him this morning.

69
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,760
Complaining of a strange and wondrous illness.

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,700
And do you know what that heartless butcher prescribed?

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,140
He said, here, take this.

72
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,880
It's a suicide pill with a mild laxative side effect.

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,480
What kind of bedside manner is that?

74
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,040
I frigged the arrow of peace.

75
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,440
Why'd you wear that arm there?

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,900
I was in the morning.

77
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,220
For God.

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
If God exists then he's a thinker.

79
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,100
More likely a foot.

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,260
A giant, all-knowing, all-powerful foot.

81
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,940
I don't belong to the goddess alive and hiding in Argentina.

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,780
But I believe in the devil all right.

83
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,220
You know why?

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,700
Because the prick keeps doing commercials.

85
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,380
The best value involved that keeps getting better.

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,500
And what is it that the youth of today wants, Alan?

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,920
Oh, well, you know, it's that this gore type of blood and bullets and, you know, death and being crushed.

88
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,240
And your brain's coming out the ear and that skull with that dagger through and that, you know, that.

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
You know what I'm saying.

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,460
I mean, it's that death, gore, dismemberment, whole type of go for it type of thing.

91
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:33,720
What's up?

92
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:42,100
There's a bunch of assholes fucking around in the harbor area, attracting the cops' attention to my investments and screwing up all of my business.

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,520
I am the Big Mac.

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,020
I am the Big Cheese.

95
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,560
You might say that I am the Big Mac with cheese.

96
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,200
Now, this record that I'm speaking to you on now, I made myself.

97
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,060
It's absolutely true.

98
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,720
I did.

99
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,780
I made it myself.

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,940
Nights and nights of hard, diligent work.

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,500
I got the machine from a supermarket in Quique.

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,640
It formally cost me 39 and sixpence.

103
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:37,700
And apart from one or two small faults, which the average person wouldn't really notice, it really is an excellent machine.

104
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,540
Frequency response is mild.

105
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,940
And anything you record on it, it comes out absolutely lifelike.

106
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,320
So why pay out in 20 guineas for a machine that you can get for 36 pence?

107
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,860
Why, indeed.

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Anyway, I'm not going to keep this great secret to myself.

109
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,800
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to tell you what you need to make this marvelous recorder.

110
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,480
And tell you all about it.

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,960
You need 200 screws, a whacking great few miscellaneous wheels, and a couple of reels.

112
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,860
A furlong of wire, a bit of old tire, 400 volts, and 240 volts.

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,440
Consisters, condensers, transformers, and knobs.

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,080
A smooth-running motor, centrifugal rotor, capstan, and roller.

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
A bracket to mount a revolutionary counter.

116
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,360
And just for a jade, you'll need some good tape.

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,740
Right. Now you've got all the bits, all the pieces, everything you need.

118
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,400
All you've got to do now is put it together.

119
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,420
You screw down the motor and gurgle the rod to combine the condensers with vertical sensors.

120
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,260
Transistors are gutted and bolted and nutted, all covered in wire and bits of old tire.

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,140
A couple of wheels, transformers, and reels, and amps are best parted to bring out the flutter.

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,960
Soldering blobs that smack on the knobs, compulate base on the lateral face.

123
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,960
Frugalate wire on the fast-arbor biocid playback response to pedicle sconce.

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,800
Add sugar to taste and a bit of fish paste, a few drops of oil, and bink to the boil.

125
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,720
Put in the fuse.

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,040
And turn on the juice.

127
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,380
And you're ready to go.

128
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,300
Uh, chat, uh, uh, chat, chat.

129
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,480
Hello, faithful listeners.

130
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,980
This is the Colonel, the overseer of the slaves known as Four Letter Words, also known as a manager.

131
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:48,940
This album is laden with subliminal messages, here to teach you about the subgenius, the cult of the subgenius, and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

132
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,820
And, by the way, can I get a house?

133
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,240
Jalapena.

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,560
Jalapena.

135
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,420
Jalapena.

136
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:03,660
I also want to tell you, by the way, this is protected by the B, the O, and the B with the D pinkies.

137
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,380
He's the master of slack.

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,180
Bob Dobbs.

139
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,560
He's the man to stab you in the back.

140
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,220
Bob Dobbs.

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,180
He's got a soup pipe.

142
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,120
Bob Dobbs.

143
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,100
Never listen to the hype.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,040
Bob Dobbs.

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,940
And stand on his way.

146
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,000
Bob Dobbs.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,880
His pride's gonna sting.

148
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,840
Bob Dobbs.

149
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,620
He can tell anything.

150
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,740
Bob Dobbs.

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Family knows no chain octopus.

152
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,720
Bob Dobbs.

153
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,400
All the chicks dig.

154
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,600
Bob Dobbs.

155
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,620
He can even fuck a pig.

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,580
Bob Dobbs.

157
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
He's got briefcase.

158
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,500
Bob Dobbs.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,560
He can divide our stage.

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
And stand on his way, all you pigs stay away.

161
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,300
And stand on his way, all you pigs stay away.

162
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,400
And stand on his way, all you pigs stay away.

163
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,980
And stand on his way, all you pigs stay away.

164
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,380
And stand on his way, all you pigs stay away.

165
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,300
And stand on his way, all you pigs stay away.

166
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,460
Oh my Bob?

167
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,560
No ?

168
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,560


169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,380
No.

170
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,260
My Christina won the vino.

171
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,660
He's a master of slack

172
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,360
Bop-Dop

173
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,620
He can stab you in the back

174
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,320
Bop-Dop

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,280
He's got a zoom pipe

176
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Bop-Dop

177
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
He has a license to the hack

178
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,180
Bop-Dop

179
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,960
He can sail anything

180
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,100
Bop-Dop

181
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,120
He can jump into some onion rings

182
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,060
Bop-Dop

183
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,080
He can stand on his way

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,000
Bop-Dop

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,960
He's power's gonna stay

186
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,900
Bop-Dop

187
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,720
All the chicks dig

188
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,860
Bop-Dop

189
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,900
He ain't even fucked a pig

190
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,840
Bop-Dop

191
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,880
He's got a briefcase

192
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,780
Bop-Dop

193
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,160
He's kickin' the değer spree

194
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,080
20

195
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Ex-ale-de

196
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,300
He's a master of slack

197
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,380
Pigs will stab you in the back

198
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,000
He's got a suit pipe

199
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,040
Never listens to the hype

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,260
Pops stands on his way

201
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,840
His time's gonna stay

202
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,620
He can tell anything

203
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,780
Puppet is an underage

204
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,540
All the chicks dig

205
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,660
He ain't even fucking big

206
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,660
He's got a briefcase

207
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,340
He can't be better than

208
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,440
X-Men, Tom's way

209
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,300
All you pigs stay away

210
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,440
X-Men, Tom's way

211
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,340
All you pigs stay away

212
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,460
X-Men, Tom's way

213
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,360
All you pigs stay away

214
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
X-Men, Tom's way

215
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,420
All you pigs stay away

216
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,920
But let's leave things of this world behind

217
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,480
and walk now down the path of Bob

218
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,460
for this brief minute of slack

219
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,080
from the church of the subgenius.

220
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,320
And so once again we find this deep-rooted contradiction

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,900
within the word of God

222
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,660
who he himself has said

223
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
I am everything but yet

224
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,140
everything

225
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,420
I am everything but yet

226
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,160
everything is me

227
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,780
and by this very self-same contradiction

228
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,260
we know that we do have some measure

229
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,900
of free will

230
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,680
yes, free choice

231
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,640
and it's up to us

232
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,620
to decide whether we're gonna sin

233
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,920
in the ways that God wants us to

234
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,380
or if we're gonna sin against God

235
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,520
but yet since he is everything

236
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,480
and everything is him

237
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
or her or it or everything

238
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,780
one could say well

239
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,860
everything is everything

240
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,660
so a sin might as well be a good deed

241
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,820
helping a little old lady across the street

242
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,420
might be a sin if everything is everything

243
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,360
now this is an acid head sort of motive

244
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,840
to think in

245
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,760
and I don't think anybody wants to go along

246
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
with such a vague

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,720
and to say the least fluid philosophy

248
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,300
because we have to have some sort of standard reference

249
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,080
for goodness or evilness.

250
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,840
We gotta zero our meter on something.

251
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,000
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?

252
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,940
Let there be slack.

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:03,800
Oh god how do I fall?

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:03,820
I'm so fucking noticed

266
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,800
I was like here's the Eminem thing

267
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,440
Wow

268
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Yeah.

269
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,380
I'm like, oh my god.

270
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,440
I fucking heard that chorus before, and I know it, and here it is, and I'm rocking out to it.

271
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,920
You know, I know a couple words.

272
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,440
And then they fucking come in with the real chorus, all right?

273
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,620
Like, they've been fucking with you.

274
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,580
Like, the thing they played earlier, oh, that was just like a little teaser to the chorus, all right?

275
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,840
And they didn't even play the chorus, all right?

276
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,620
You didn't realize this shit, because they went back in the verse, and they go back, and they play the teaser,

277
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,060
and then they play the super chorus, all right?

278
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,740
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

279
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,760
There's the chorus, and then there's the super chorus.

280
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,200
And I thought, fuck it, man, I can go super uber chorus.

281
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,260
This song is called Madness Is.

282
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,680
See if you can spot the super uber chorus.

283
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,860
Have you heard it?

284
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,420
Have you heard it?

285
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,720
Have you heard it?

286
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,080
Have you heard it?

287
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,060
I did it.

288
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,220
I went and gone quite crazy.

289
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,340
You'd be absurd.

290
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,540
Admit it.

291
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,840
For you to try to save me.

292
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,160
This is me.

293
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,800
Take it or leave it.

294
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,660
What else can I do?

295
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,020
Can you see?

296
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
Can't you believe it?

297
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,260
My way might work for you, too.

298
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,720
A conscious choice to quit the search for meaning.

299
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,020
A tiny voice inside your head is screaming.

300
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,420
This is me.

301
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,000
Take it or leave it.

302
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,780
What else can I do?

303
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,660
Can't you see? Can't you believe it?

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,160
My way might work for you too

305
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,100
So just let go, lose it

306
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,860
Give into insanity, there's hell refusing

307
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,740
No one else can set you free

308
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,100
Come on, choose it

309
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,720
Madness is as madness does

310
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,000
Let go, lose it

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,540
Lose it just because

312
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,960
So fire, shrink

313
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,540
Dump your medication

314
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,780
Down the sink

315
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,760
I mean it

316
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,800
Prepare for true elation

317
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
This is it

318
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Take a seat, can't you believe it?

319
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,380
My way might work for you too

320
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,200
So just let go, lose it

321
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,780
Give into insanity, there's hell refusing

322
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,640
No one else can set you free

323
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,000
Come on, choose it

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
Madness is as madness does

325
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,920
Let go, lose it

326
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,500
Lose it just because

327
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,520
They wanna control you

328
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,180
Put a chip in your mind

329
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
Don't tell nobody I told you

330
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,700
If you do, you'll know that I wrapped out mine

331
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,600
They wanna control you

332
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,120
Put a chip in your mind

333
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Don't tell nobody I told you

334
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,240
If you do, you'll know that I wrapped out mine

335
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,680
They wanna control you

336
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,240
Put a chip in your mind

337
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't tell nobody I told you

338
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,840
If you do, you'll know that I wrapped out mine

339
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,320
Wrapped it right out

340
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Wrapped it right out my head

341
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
Out of the head, indeed, of Reverend Andrew the Impaled

342
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,900
live at X-Day 2012.

343
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,300
Before that, a minute of slack from 1985.

344
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,960
Before that,

345
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,260
the Bob Dobbs punk song was by

346
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,860
The Four Letter Words

347
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,420
on the Bob Songs 5 album.

348
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,860
The long media barrage with British cuts

349
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,500
was from slackmaster Sarcastro.

350
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,760
And the child voice was Young Jack,

351
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,780
thanks to Dr. Legume

352
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,640
and more so to Reverend Pockets,

353
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440
who did the hard part.

354
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,980
Before that, title by Lemur.

355
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,420
This episode of Hour of Slack

356
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,120
was assembled on the road.

357
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,020
In fact, I'm recording this

358
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,520
at my dad's house

359
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,240
in San Diego,

360
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,260
Stanksville, Texas.

361
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,380
And he's asleep,

362
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,240
which is why I'm whispering

363
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,060
and there's no band behind me.

364
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,940
But now, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

365
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,120
The problem with electronic media is,

366
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,540
particularly television and others,

367
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,900
that everything is turned into entertainment.

368
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,380
And the entertainment is

369
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,140
not to educate you in an entertaining way

370
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,800
or to inform you in an educated way.

371
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,600
But rather to disturb you,

372
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,420
to titillate you,

373
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,060
to anger you,

374
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,080
to worry you,

375
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,560
you the viewer,

376
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,180
the consumer,

377
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
the user,

378
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,520
that they think of as

379
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,740
someone who is comfortable in their environment,

380
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
don't require a lot,

381
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,960
or somewhat passive,

382
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,660
and they're looking in for a little entertainment.

383
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,460
And all of these emotions,

384
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,560
that they are designed to bring out in you,

385
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,740
are not emotions that we have a lot of control over.

386
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,380
They're tugging down in the lower level of your brain,

387
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,420
so to speak,

388
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
getting into those instinctive areas.

389
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,040
Sex, fear, procreation, you know, food.

390
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh yeah, a lot of food ads on TV, isn't there?

391
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, think about it.

392
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,180
Folks, everything they're doing to entertain you

393
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,940
is trying to sell you a bomb, a cure.

394
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,720
A grail.

395
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,880
Yes sir.

396
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,180
Eat this, you'll feel better.

397
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Oh yeah.

398
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,180
Take this, your tummy won't hurt.

399
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,820
Take this and you won't have green demons

400
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,240
from the energy dimensions running through your bedroom at night.

401
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
Oh yeah, they got the bomb for you.

402
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,180
And in this country, the bomb is bi.

403
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,080
That's right, you're upset, you're confused,

404
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
you're a little eh, edgy,

405
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,560
because, you know, all you do is watch television.

406
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,720
And you have this feeling of unease.

407
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,480
And then something pops up there and you go,

408
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,300
man, I have got to have that 1472

409
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,040
Hyde-related double-drive disc clutch, baby.

410
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm going down putting on my credit card right now.

411
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,620
And you do.

412
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,900
You get that sum gun.

413
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,380
And it's yours.

414
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,760
But, you know, it doesn't make the unease go away

415
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,860
for more than just about the time

416
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,480
you start watching television again.

417
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,360
Yep, the biggest evil on the face of this planet

418
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,440
is commercial television.

419
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,620

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,640
Criminals.

567
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,620
Murdering a man.

568
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,460
Tough.

569
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,360
Diplomatic.

570
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,180
Hell on earth.

571
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,560
The American people.

572
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,520
Magnetic radiation.

573
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,940
Fraudulent assassin.

574
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,340
Mysterious murderer.

575
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,760
Chemical terrorism.

576
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,780
Military targets.

577
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,000
Photo crisis.

578
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,440
Danger.

579
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,640
A freak accident.

580
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,760
No known survivors.

581
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,760
Wild and woolly semi-automatic truck bomb.

582
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,460
Emergency anti-vacuum shooting rampage.

583
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,520
Notorious negative police brutality.

584
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,700
Fear.

585
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
The hidden Nazis next door.

586
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,680
Marxist rebels.

587
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,080
Serious murderer.

588
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,160
Accidents.

589
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,800
Problems.

590
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,700
Punitive damages.

591
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,240
Like that negative, heart-wrenching controversy.

592
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,480
Time for us.

593
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,540
To be continued.

594
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


595
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


596
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


597
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


598
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


599
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


600
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


601
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


602
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:02,880
Stuck.

603
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,080


604
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,100
Struggles.

605
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,160
Drug out.

606
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,380
Rock.

607
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,700
Rock.

608
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,560
Rock by rape.

609
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,020
Rock.

610
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,340
Rock.

611
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,860
Rock by rape.

612
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,000
Rock.

613
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,240
Rock.

614
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,100
Rock by rape.

615
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,600
Sex.

616
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,340
Drugs.

617
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,100
And rock.

618
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,100
By rape.

619
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,940
Drug out.

620
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,440
Drug out.

621
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:24,900
Drug out.

622
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,640
And that's part of our world tonight.

623
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,180
For the CBS TV News, Dan Rappaport reporting.

624
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,920
Good night.

625
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,160
And have a great weekend.

626
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,540
Thank you.

627
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,540


628
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,540


629
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,540


630
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,540


631
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,540


632
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,800
Give it up for Evolution Control Committee!

633
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,720
Now I lay me down to sling you

634
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,380
I pray, I pray

635
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,820
MNO acid ancestors

636
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,180
Now I die

637
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,400
Before I wake in silent void

638
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,620
Galactic space

639
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,520
Shimmering

640
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,320
Molecular designs

641
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,520
Are you trying to bum out the people that are tripping or something, Chaz?

642
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,680
Hey man, you trying to put a dodecahedron in the back of their

643
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,520
Trying to get them too serious?

644
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,220
Sexual shadow space now?

645
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,420
Hey man, life is a joke, it's a lie!

646
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,760
You-you-and friends

647
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,180
Someday you're gonna shut up like hell

648
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,740
So you better make, you better shout and make a lot of noise

649
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,360
Because someday your vocal cords are going to be frozen

650
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,580
Just like that is snow right to the left of your

651
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,180
They're on demand at all

652
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:57,460
So I'd like to give thanks to the universe for every single extra second that I get to live

653
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,920
Praise Bob and Hail Connie

654
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,180
Thank you, Spectrum

655
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,800
Thank you, Spectrum

656
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:01,800


657
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:01,800


658
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:01,800


659
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,500
God, there's at least seven minutes left of this life

660
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,480
This little life

661
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,260
Captured forever on the spinning disks and reels

662
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,920
So much more permanent than you or I

663
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,600
We are but mayflies

664
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,820
Bugs

665
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:26,160
Perhaps just as we examine and pity and laugh at the little mayfly in its brief span

666
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,620
Perhaps some larger creature

667
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,600
Like the man

668
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,980
Is gazing upon us

669
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,780
Perhaps all of us

670
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:31,780


671
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:31,780


672
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,760
Our little world is but an aquarium

673
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,220
And you are nailed to the door of perception

674
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
Endlessly watching it swing open and shut

675
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,980
Jesus came knocking

676
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,960
But no one answered

677
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,640
It's more like Prometheus on the dock

678
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,840
Waiting for the persecutor to let him be

679
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,380
Buddha came knocking

680
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,900
And they hit him on the head with a stick

681
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,300
Bob came a-knockin'

682
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,620
But you didn't have your thirty dollars

683
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,980
And he was too filthy

684
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,540
And so Bob was wroth and wrath in his anger

685
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,180
And he yanked upon the rug and spread the banana peels

686
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,780
And so many fell and the bigger they fell

687
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,300
The harder Bob came

688
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,240
And his laugh rang out

689
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,860
For political corruptigation

690
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,160
From holiday to holiday

691
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,580
And a very, very drastic disease in the body politic

692
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,940
We thank our Lord Jesus

693
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,100
The fight-meister Lord

694
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,820
And his big shiny fangs

695
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,820
For God has made us in his own image

696
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,880
And he's tired of looking in the mirror

697
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,040
Bob, make up your mind for the American people, why don't you?

698
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,120
And just step in and take over, won't you Bob?

699
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,740
Hey!

700
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:57,900
Hey!

701
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,240
I want some cheesy poops, mother-

702
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,260
Not that Bob!

703
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,900
Not Bob...

704
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,160
...Grodds

705
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,940
Bob Dobbs!

706
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs!

707
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,560
The living avatar of Slack!

708
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,080
He'll groom we thanks

709
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,420
For our frop

710
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,620
Our...

711
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
Frankness

712
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,720
Our frang

713
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,660
And our pang-eye

714
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,100
And other things

715
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,980
That the listener does not know

716
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,860
It is time

717
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,720
For all of you to know that Bob is a fang-eye!

718
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,200
And to decrease

719
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,240
Let go

720
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,180
The many, many foods you have ingested today

721
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,380
Float downstream, dude

722
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,480
Black is the color and none is the number

723
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,620
Turn off your mind, relax

724
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,460
Void, void, void

725
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,360
Anything that makes it harder to pee

726
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,580
Is anti-Slack

727
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,340
J.R. Bob Dobbs, 1959

728
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,380
I believe that prunes are God's answer to man's every dilemma

729
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,580
Anything that makes it harder to learn

730
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,680
Is also anti-Slack

731
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,020
Reverend Ivan Stang, 2000

732
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,640
We can only offer our Sinjurish thanks for that

733
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,920
So turn off that TV!

734
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,780
And turn up your radio!

735
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,360
And read a book every now and then!

736
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,880
FOO!

737
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,800
We had two bags of grass

738
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
75 pellets of mescaline

739
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,820
9 sheets of high-powered water acid

740
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,860
A salt-free lipoid cocaine

741
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,860
And a whole galaxy of black and blue

742
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,340
So after this order of rum

743
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,620
Take the buzz-bottom and light them all you fang

744
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,700
And put them to sleep

745
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,020
So watch your rock to the serious drug collection

746
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,640
And let's see if the pressure is right again

747
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:08,720
On us, roying forungs

748
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
Walter Bond

749
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:09,840


750
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:09,840


751
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:09,840


752
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:09,840


753
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:09,840


754
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,900
adding shit to a 집

755
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,780
We need dice

756
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:26,200
And 내려wn'

757
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,560
We darned

758
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:36,560
little bit fuzzy. I can see the air moving.

759
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,120
You can see the light vibrating.

760
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,380
I am so high.

Hey Larry, look at the sounds, they're dancing with those pigeons.

776
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,000
And Suds has turned into a bear.

777
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,800
When did Scotty grow a tail?

778
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,460
And who put Satan in front of the computer?

779
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,560
Gotta tell you Larry, I'm really high.

But I am so high.

786
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,260
And look guys, there's a mermaid.

787
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,240
A beautiful mermaid coming.

788
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,680
Oh my goodness.

789
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,300

Actually, I'm not.

Alright, now we're going to stop here.

822
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm going to slow things down a little bit.

823
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,300
Okay, that was fun.

824
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,560
Now back to the music.

825
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,700
I can't get high enough

826
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,060

827
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,280

828
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,680

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,500
Whoa, I've got something inside

834
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,800
Get up, brush my teeth and hair

835
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,680
I'll get out, I'll end up anywhere I've found

836
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,240
A place that opens up at ten

837
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,000
I'll sit through the afternoon

838
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,640
And drink and drink

839
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,240
And pretty soon I'll think

840
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,940
Everyone is my good friend

841
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,780
But I know

842
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,180

857
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,280
something to blow apart my mind

858
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,740
distractions

859
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,620

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:36,980

why Johnny can't smoke pot

925
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
why Johnny Cash smokes pot

926
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,040
I knew Johnny Cash

927
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,660

00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,680
and make sure that we're on the same page

934
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,180
I wouldn't want to be at cross purposes

935
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,240
you haven't heard of that

936
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,500

946
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,340
sailing away on the briefest of fogs

947
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,380
I'm not going to do that

948
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,040

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,480
way

955
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,020
yeah

956
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,120
head

957
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,740
bread

958
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,280
Their minds dead, sent them to bed.

959
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,780
Wouldn't it be nice if we had ten and barbie crutches

960
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,460
so no one ever had to take a shit or tangle.

961
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,600
Grandma, bless what I kind of puffed up on the screen.

962
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,560
Desecrating family sanctity.

963
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,140
Never dip your pool, can't you just say no?

964
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,180
Condoms are satanic, Jimmy Swagger told me so.

965
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,620
Ah, swing it on out there for me.

966
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:54,020
Ah, I think you've stepped in something.

967
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,960
Hello, condom.

968
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,860
Hiya, fellas.

969
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,860
Condoms breathe their shit, covered with slime.

970
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,640
Wrapped in sanitary sleeves.

971
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,260
Help breathe in age when you get laid.

972
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,460
Roll it on and shake your butt.

973
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,780
Breathe it in, soon you'll feel it up.

974
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,420
Never leave a wet one on your neighbor's doorknob.

975
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,460
Grandma, bless what I kind of puffed up on the screen.

976
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,460
Desecrating family sanctity.

977
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,100
Never dip your pool, can't you just say no?

978
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,380
Condoms are satanic.

979
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,880
Ah, ah, ah.

980
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,180
Leave it.

981
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,420
I'll bet you don't explode your...

982
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,940
Condoms are satanic, Jimmy Swagger told me.

983
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,120
Don't come in, Jimmy.

984
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,420
Don't come in, Jimmy.

985
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,180
Don't come in, Jimmy.

986
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,460
The Rudy Schwartz Project did that.

987
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,200
Condoms.

988
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,220
From Don't Get Charred, Get Puffy, the re-release.

989
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,420
We heard some very old 1980s puzzling evidence from KPFA.

990
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,620
The song, I Can't Get High Enough, was by Reverend Andrew the Impaled,

991
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,720
from 15XX.

992
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,560
16XX will be July 1st through 7th, 2013.

993
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,000
On January 30th, there's a devival in Detroit at Smalls.

994
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,200
January 30th is 13013.

995
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,660
Just saying.

996
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,460
Act accordingly on that date.

997
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:56,280
The blues jam, I'm So High, was several-fisted Tales of Connie,

998
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,500
the X-Day Jam Band, with Priestess Pisces making up the lyrics,

999
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,780
Fat Man D, also warbling, and music by Reverend Angry Larry,

1000
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,260
Reverend Suds Bashaw, Bishop Stick, Senator Speck,

1001
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,860
and Trademark Gunderson of Evolution Control Committee,

1002
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,200
who also did Rock by Rape, also live at X-Day.

1003
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,760
The radio ranting about life and death was with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1004
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,900
and Professor Chaz Smith from ESO Radio, WCSB Cleveland, around 2000,

1005
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,740
where we also discussed how Texans do things.

1006
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,040
It's like a monkey humping a football.

1007
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,000
When they have an inbreeding too much.

1008
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,280
It's like a monkey humping a football.

1009
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,720
A Texan likes to just crawl on top of something and wreck it for everybody else

1010
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,160
and cost everybody a whole lot of money and just be loud, loud, loud.

1011
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,760
The basis of the church of the subgenius,

1012
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,240
the product of a perverted or a few perverted Texans' minds.

1013
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,040
Read, if you will, this exciting chapter from Humping the Football.

1014
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,980
Bob actually is not a Texan.

1015
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,200
Well, I'm not supposed to be that specific,

1016
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,760
as to what he is or isn't.

1017
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,480
But he is a Midwesterner.

1018
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,360
He would, to a Yankee, I suppose, somebody might mistake Bob for a Texan.

1019
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,120
Well, what about perhaps a Skanky or a Nor'easter

1020
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,280
or one of those other platelets that you find?

1021
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,120
Oh, they probably think he's a Russian communist.

1022
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,220
Well, he is, isn't he, in some strange way we've yet to discern.

1023
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,120
Bob only believes that everyone should be equally rich, not equally poor.

1024
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,640
But without working, there lies the rub,

1025
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,480
and he'd like to rub your lips.

1026
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,080
You're a little round belly.

1027
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,380
He can rub the Buddha's belly any time he wants,

1028
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,240
but he better stay away from my front.

1029
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,060
Rubbed by Bob.

1030
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,780
You've been screwed by George and ticked off by Tipper.

1031
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,520
Ain't it about time to just bend over and pull out that wallet for J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1032
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,220
the one true savior, messiah, and holy man.

1033
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,500
You know, when the pinks interview me on TV about Bob,

1034
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,640
I always say, oh, no, he's not the messiah.

1035
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,340
Oh, he's not that well-known.

1036
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,280
You know, I joke about it.

1037
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,040
But the truth is, J.R. Bob Dobbs, a living man whose business is in Texas,

1038
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,240
is the God walking on earth now.

1039
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,660
He is not just the son of God.

1040
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,020
He is God.

1041
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,020
Bob Dobbs.

1042
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,620
Not some silly Internet character named Bob,

1043
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,500
but J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, that man Bob,

1044
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,320
whose first certificate I've seen,

1045
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,920
who I saw shot and killed.

1046
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:30,860
He's at stage.

1047
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,400
He is God.

1048
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:38,460
And this Christmas, we celebrate the birth of his business manager, Jesus.

1049
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Praise Jesus.

1050
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,420
Jesus is almost as great as Bob, friends.

1051
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,900
Jesus Christ.

1052
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,380
In my religion, that's the way we believe he is a prophet and the son of God.

1053
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,780
I remember the first time that I danced with Bob.

1054
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,780
But Bob himself changed God's diapers.

1055
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,700
Voice andQC

1056
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,080
Bed or something?

1057
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:21,880


1058
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:21,880


1059
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,420
Yeah, you lived in the very beginning

1060
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,420


1061
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,420


1062
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,420


1063
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,540
It's sadness,

1064
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:23,680
loneliness.

1065
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,180
Better to get bone causal thinking than j常

1066
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,340
Let God kill you.

1067
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,420
For God's sake.

1068
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


1069
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,420


1070
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,640
フ shrimp, quake.

1071
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,520
Are you ever compelled to say it?

1072
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,220
What?

1073
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,140
See, that's what I mean.

1074
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:53,680
What?

1075
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,340
It?

1076
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,020
What?

1077
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,920
See, that's what I mean.

1078
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,540
What?

1079
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:57,900
It?

1080
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,880
What?

1081
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,760
See, that's what I mean.

1082
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,380
What?

1083
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:01,960
It?

1084
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:11,460
Barbecue, average, entropy, reversion.

1085
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:20,700
All your life your priorities and your forgeries get no sympathy.

1086
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,860
Hey, I just pet you, cause you're so cuddly.

1087
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:55,960
Your name is Bowser's, my fuzzy buddy, and all the other cats try to be cute.

1088
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,520
I like to feed you, and you're so cute.

1089
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,480
You're crunchy cat food.

1090
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,080
Unable.

1091
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,480
Threatening.

1092
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,280
Objective.

1093
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,440
Mutated.

1094
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:17,540
Praise Bob, that was the Psychoskeletons, found as such on SoundClick.com.

1095
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,380
From Lemur, it's PR News.

1096
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,280
And next up, Jonathan Coulton from his new album Artificial Heart.

1097
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm a folk hero for trying to thwart PR News on Monday.

1098
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,800
A federal appeals court claiming responsibility for an attack that left two U.S. Marines not

1099
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,280
harmed.

1100
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,500
As Daniel Carson reports, economists say there's PR News.

1101
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,200
Economists say there's been another so-called PR News from Washington.

1102
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,260
They gave me a test to make me the best that I could be.

1103
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,840
They knew all along that there was something wrong with me.

1104
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,220
We picked out a spot and made a hole.

1105
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,560
Wire and glass and stainless steel.

1106
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,260
Now I can imagine how I feel.

1107
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,420
I got a new heart.

1108
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,700
I got a new heart.

1109
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,080
I got a new heart.

1110
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,240
I got a new heart.

1111
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,440
Artificial heart.

1112
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,260
It's not a real heart.

1113
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,540
It's not a real heart.

1114
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,720
It's not a real heart.

1115
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,080
It is a real artificial heart.

1116
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,520
There's blood on the bed, but here in my head I'm feeling fine.

1117
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,640
It's easy to sleep when I'm not buzzing all the time.

1118
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,820
So funny the way I was before.

1119
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,160
Once I was blind, but now I see.

1120
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,020
Once I was him, but now he's me.

1121
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,100
Got a new heart.

1122
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,360
I got a new heart.

1123
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,640
I got a new heart.

1124
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,000
I got a new artificial heart.

1125
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,840
It's not a real heart.

1126
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,180
It's not a real heart.

1127
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,360
It's not a real heart.

1128
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,760
It is a real artificial heart

1129
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,880
You're at me again, I nod and pretend to think it through

1130
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,940
I don't need to think at all if I don't care for you

1131
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,700
It's not an emergency for me

1132
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,220
I look at the walls and they go clear

1133
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,700
Cover my eyes and disappear

1134
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,220
I got a new heart, I got a new heart

1135
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,740
I got a new heart, I got a new artificial heart

1136
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,680
It's not a real heart, it's not a real heart

1137
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,100
It's not a real heart, it is a real artificial heart

1138
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,820
Don't pour your love out on me, baby

1139
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,060
If you do, then I think that maybe

1140
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,460
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years

1141
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,820
Don't pour your love out on me, honey

1142
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,120
Take my heart, my soul, my money

1143
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,540
But don't leave me here drowning in my tears

1144
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,240
You say you're gonna leave

1145
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,580
Gonna take that big wide turn

1146
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,820
Gonna fly right out of here

1147
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,120
Without a single word

1148
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,440
But you know you'll break my heart

1149
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,180
When I watch you close that door

1150
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,220
Cause I know I won't see you anymore

1151
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,080
Don't pour your love out on me, baby

1152
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,320
If you do, then I think that maybe

1153
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,660
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years

1154
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,060
Don't pour your love out on me, honey

1155
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,340
Take my heart, my soul, my money

1156
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,860
But don't leave me here drowning in my tears

1157
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,600
Haven't I been good to you?

1158
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,880
What about that brand new ring?

1159
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,100
Doesn't that mean love to you?

1160
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,020
Doesn't that mean anything?

1161
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,600
If I threw away my pride

1162
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,480
And I got down on my knees

1163
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,880
Would you make me beg you worthy please?

1164
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,160
You're my only one

1165
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,420
If you know you need me

1166
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,500
You're my only one

1167
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,860
So tell me, just tell me

1168
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:56,860


1169
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:56,980
You're my only one

1170
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:56,980


1171
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,740
There's so much I wanna do

1172
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,060
I've got love enough for two

1173
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,860
But I'll never choose a girl if I don't have you

1174
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,300
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry

1175
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,320
at the subgenius.org channel.

1176
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,320


1177
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,320


1178
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:31,000
hour of slack. For free information, write to P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1179
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,320
or see www.subgenius.com. Praise Bob!

1180
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,500
Thank you, Reverend Baby Bear. Don't Pull Your Love was, of course, by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1181
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:53,500
Before that, Jonathan Colton. We personally gave Jonathan Colton a subgenius ministership

1182
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,960
after his concert in North Carolina recently, and he was very polite about it.

1183
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,600
Now, we'll let the show run over its edges with some amazing guitar work embedded in a live

1184
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,300
performance at Last X Day Festival by the great weirdo singer Tommy Amita.

1185
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,380
And the band, Amiba Knievel. Praise Bob!

1186
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,120
This is called Cowboy Ed and His Caterpillar.

1187
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,280
Cowboy Ed and his caterpillar

1188
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,860
Riding out across the plains

1189
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,280
Watching from the westward

1190
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,100
Grounding up all the aphids

1191
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,360
Cowboy Ed can't complain

1192
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,020
It's all in a day's work

1193
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,940
Cowboy Ed is glad to be of service

1194
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,740
Don't squish him, it only makes him nervous

1195
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,920
Once upon a time in the west

1196
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,340
Ed was a normal-sized boy

1197
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,660
Who wanted to be a cowboy

1198
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,880
Something happened to shrink him

1199
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,300
To this size and size again

1200
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:09,300


1201
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:09,300


1202
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:09,300


1203
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:09,300


1204
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:09,300


1205
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,780
He didn't let that stop him

1206
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,800
Cowboy Ed is glad to be of service

1207
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,380
Don't squish him, it only makes him nervous

1208
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:32,640
Of course, four and seven years ago

1209
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,120
Our fathers brought forth on this

1210
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,960
Common animation

1211
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,300
The first ever song to be sung by a cowboy

1212
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,300


1213
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,300


1214
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,300


1215
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,140
Conceived in liberty and data

1216
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,760
Cated to the proposition

1217
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,060
All men are created equal

1218
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,460
Those old words and honest they once said

1219
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,560
Still ring true even for cowboy Ed

1220
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,540
Cowboy Ed

1221
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,220
Cowboy Ed

1222
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,200
lime

1223
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,200


1224
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,360
New Zelotnik

1225
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,360


1226
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,040
Mais le prix

1227
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,540
guitar solo

1228
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,600
guitar solo

1229
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,180
guitar solo

1230
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,020
guitar solo

1231
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,020
guitar solo

1232
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,800
guitar solo

1233
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,720
guitar solo

1234
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,440
Tune in next week, Cowboy Ed will fly

1235
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,340
When his steed becomes a butterfly

1236
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,000
Ha!

1237
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,120
Ha!

1238
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,020
Ha!

1239
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:03,300
Ha!

1240
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,420


1241
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:03,580
Ha!

1242
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:03,860
Ha!

1243
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,020
Ha!

1244
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:04,320
Ha!

1245
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:04,420
Ha!

1246
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:04,600
Ha!

1247
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:04,980
Ha!

1248
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:05,360
Ha!

1249
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:05,720
Ha!

1250
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:05,800
Ha!

1251
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,040
Ha!

1252
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,040


1253
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,040


1254
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:06,840
Ha!
