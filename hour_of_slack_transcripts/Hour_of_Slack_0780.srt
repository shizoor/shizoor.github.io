Please connect your brain connector in with your network system modulator program.

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:28,780
Get ready to have the center cortex, the bottom lobe of your cranial system, connected with

3
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,640
our system.

4
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,420
Your cyber biological interface shall be connected.

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,520
Connected within three seconds.

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,060
Two, one.

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:19,740


39
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,660
That was the sound of your connection interface.

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,460
You are now in the cybernetic system.

41
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,380
Everything shall be okay at this point.

42
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:39,960
Please follow your cybernetic interface leader to the following cyber internet spaces and

43
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,920
perform your pre-giving duties.

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,980
these as needed.

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,440
Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say,

46
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,780
you have no chance to survive, make your time.

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:08,320
Ah, yes, dear friends, oh, it is good, good to be back, but I'm not back for long, friends,

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:19,480
because we're in the process of moving the church offices to another part of Cleveland.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,120
And two weeks ago, friends, we were just in Amsterdam, a hole in the head land.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
Yes, we went on a field trip to the Neanderthal lands, we subgeniuses did,

51
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,120
about 25 or so of us.

52
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,500
And friends, it was amazing, the Butch people are so great.

53
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,540
You know how the Hindus worship cows?

54
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, the Butch people of hole in head land worship subgeniuses,

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,600
and they have these subgenius preserves there in the Neanderthal lands called coffee houses,

56
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,340
where you can fight technobortem, and it's great.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,300
I mean, it's like they just make...

58
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,040
It's as if...

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,760
It's like subgenius heaven, my friends, in the Neanderthal lands.

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,920
And you can even look at the beautiful Neanderthal men and women for sale on display

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,300
in these lovely red lit windows.

62
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,800
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,060
But, but anyway, we have some tapes.

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,300
We don't have, we don't have tapes yet of the devivalism.

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,640
In Amsterdam.

66
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,640
But we do have Radio Patapo.

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,800
Radio Patapo, the Dutch subgenius show, or Dutch-German, actually,

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,180
with Reverend Jitze, or Lord Yeti,

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,620
and the great Pope Black, Pope David Lee Black,

70
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,440
Pope of all Europe, who helped us get to...

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,280
And actually has just done a successful tour of Germany.

72
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,620
He did Hamburg, Berlin, and I believe Kiel,

73
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,300
with the Dutch subgeniuses.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,160
And Duke of Uke, Little Theodore, and Vagina Jones, dear friends.

75
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,960
I wish I could have gone on that, but I did go to...

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,300
Anyway, it's busy, busy, busy, busy around here.

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,400
We've got a devival coming up in Cleveland at the Euclid Tavern again,

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,320
Saturday, May 12th, with Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,500
winners of the Free Times Press Best Instrumental Electronic Group.

80
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,680
And on May 27th, friends, I'm getting married.

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,260
That's right, I'm getting married.

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,180
Sorry, girls, you can redeem those tickets at the post office,

83
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,520
and I'll give you the post office box.

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,560
So anyway, next week I'm probably going to be even more married,

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,520
and I'll do another Suzy the Floozy show replay,

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,760
which will be real fun.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,960
But in the meantime, I did want to get some of this Amsterdamian damn stuff out,

88
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,000
and some of the CDs, new CDs,

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,000
by the subgeniuses who performed at the Amsterdam Devival,

90
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,100
Little Theodore, Duke of Uke, Vagina Jones,

91
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,160
also known as King Lear,

92
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,900
and Fat Harry White.

93
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,500
And Fat Harry White was not actually at the Devival,

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,840
but you'll see what I mean.

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,840
He's incredible.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,160
And friends, what's also incredible is that in this hour of slack,

97
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,960
we will be exposed finally to some really brand new voices

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,440
because of the Euro subs.

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
From England, Reverend Mickey Finn and Pope Phil Monty,

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,500
and I think there was a Reverend Priest there also from England,

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,680
Dr. Notov from Denmark,

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,180
Reverend Jitza and several other folks whose names I can't pronounce,

103
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,600
from Holland Headland.

104
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,440
And, oh man, it's such an inspiring thing

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,600
to see the church of the subgenius spread its tentacles out across the world.

106
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,360
Of course, there is at least one subgenius in every country.

107
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,320
Well, in some cases, there's one in every continent.

108
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,300
But they...

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,160
And those are the bravest, the most advanced, yet devolved,

110
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,640
of all the creatures of that land in which they find themselves,

111
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
the Pope, the only Pope.

112
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,680
And, but yet, but now it is spreading.

113
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,880
Actually, we've always had lots of members in Northern Europe in general,

114
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,820
but it ain't the same, friends,

115
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,140
unless you actually go there and meet them and know them

116
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,900
and come to share.

117
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,800
And that's the butch word for slack.

118
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,920
And so let us go on into that self-same slack.

119
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,180
Yes.

120
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,660
We love Bob.

121
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,140
Bob.

122
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,260
Bob.

123
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,960
Bob.

124
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,380
Bob.

125
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,880
Bob is here.

126
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,180
Bob is good.

127
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,500
We love.

128
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,560
We just...

129
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,280
We love Bob.

130
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:18,760
We love Bob.

131
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,660
Whatever you people are on, I don't want any of it.

132
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
It hurt me.

133
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,500
Mr. Bond, you have already ingested a fatal quantity.

134
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,200
These young people are on a new drug called Bob.

135
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,300
Bob!

136
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,040
Bob!

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,820
Bob!

138
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Bob!

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,100
Bob!

140
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


141
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


142
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


143
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


144
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


145
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


146
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


147
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


148
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


149
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


150
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


151
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


152
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


153
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


154
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


155
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


156
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


157
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,100


158
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,360
Just give me some Bob, man.

159
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,460
Bob.

160
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,180
Bob.

161
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,460
It's really great.

162
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,060
Pass the Bob around, man.

163
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,240
Here you go, man.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,780
Oh, it's old God.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,580
Oh, wait.

166
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,460
Bob, it really opens up my heart chakra,

167
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,300
and it just, it just really helps me connect.

168
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,800
It makes her want to do it with anybody, man.

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
I don't need anything.

170
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,280
I want Bob now.

171
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,260
I need it now.

172
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,540
Otherwise, I'm going to fall over.

173
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,320
Hey, I want...

174
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,960
I just...

175
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,540
I don't want Bob.

176
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,560
I just want the Bob sticker on the top of the Nutella, man.

177
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,500
I want the collector's item Bob.

178
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,480
Give me Bob now!

179
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,060
Yeah, I want Bob!

180
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,600
Bob!

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,900
They think they want more Bob, but they'll never get enough.

182
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,280
They can never be satisfied once they've had that first taste of slack.

183
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,720
Kids, do what your parents say.

184
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,420
Don't ever send money to Bob.

185
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:37,300
It's a dangerous cult where people have insane, weird sex along the...

186
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,380
Here's my $30!

187
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,620
Whatever fantasy they ever desired for only $30.

188
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,880
Forever.

189
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,100
Do you want that, kids?

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,060
Well, then send $30 to the Stamp Out Bob movement.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,380
Youth Against Bob.

192
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,220
Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

193
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,020
Kill that freak.

194
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,100
Nip it in the bud.

195
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,940
Kill it before it divides.

196
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,200
Annie Christie.

197
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,100
Yeah, kill Bob!

198
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah!

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't even remember what I played.

200
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,600
This is Brain Box.

201
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,100
And miscellaneous.

202
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,800
This person was kind of miscellaneous.

203
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,720
Space and sex.

204
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,480
That's all I heard.

205
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,900
You gotta burn me some of your rants.

206
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,740
You gotta burn me some of them.

207
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,800
You should have heard the conversation five minutes ago.

208
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,020
Oh, man.

209
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,260
All that Amsterdam.

210
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,060
No, it wasn't like that.

211
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,400
It was...

212
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,000
It was more like...

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,420
Oh, we were down there at the Bush Doctor by Muntplein.

214
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,840
Near Rembrandt's plane.

215
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,800
And they're testing the combination of the blueberry...

216
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,060
With the blueberry water hash, you see.

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,660
And with a little dusting of keef upon it.

218
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,400
Of course, it's illegal to do that kind of thing in this country.

219
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,600
And even in Holland, we discovered, much to our chagrin this time,

220
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,300
that it's not actually legal to smoke this cannabis stuff.

221
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,240
Anywhere except in those licensed coffee shops.

222
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,420
In other words, if your hotel isn't, quote, cool, unquote,

223
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,740
they will heartily discourage you from sampling these latest...

224
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,640
Marvelous examples of the advances in Dutch botanical science,

225
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,380
I think is what I was going to say.

226
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,220
That was just some glitch in the tape.

227
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,920
Sorry, friends.

228
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,040
The Dutch and those who have traveled,

229
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,320
to Holland, to experiment with crossbreeding

230
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
these marvelous species of plants.

231
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,080
And they have such colorful names,

232
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,980
like White Widow, which has now been crossed with Afghan,

233
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,600
so it's Afghan White Widow.

234
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,920
And Bubble Gum, so named because it...

235
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,680
Well, last year it did taste like Bubble Gum,

236
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,360
but this year it tasted and smelled more like skunk puke.

237
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,380
And yet, the general...

238
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
What was it?

239
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,240
The other one, there was one called Orange Skunk

240
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,160
that smelled and tasted just like Bubble Gum.

241
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,480
You know what I discovered is that if you smoke those things,

242
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,100
you'll get this kind of funny, light-headed feeling.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,500
And then after a while, you'll get this kind of brightened sensibility.

244
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Sort of, you know, everything looks a little brighter,

245
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,380
and you're thinking...

246
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,020
Thoughts seem a little more lively,

247
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,340
and your imagination gets jacked up.

248
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
Your mind is more lucid.

249
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,420
Yeah, and then you take all your clothes off and get arrested,

250
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,900
and then you wake up in a...

251
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,620
Oh, no, no, that's when you drank.

252
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,200
I forgot.

253
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,080
And then your vegetables...

254
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,880
I get confused, you know, because usually the two...

255
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,600
Sometimes the two go together, and then your...

256
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,100
Vegetables and lucidity go together.

257
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,240
As Bob said, too much is always better than not enough,

258
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
but it's almost...

259
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,660
Too much is twice as bad.

260
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,860
I think it's twice as worst.

261
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,800
You didn't know about that last part, did you?

262
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,120
About the twice as worst part?

263
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,640
What? Too much is twice as bad as not enough?

264
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,780
It should be devil is enough.

265
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,140
It's be deviled enough.

266
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,600
It's...

267
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,700
Yeah, I'm sorry.

268
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,160
There is...

269
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,120
Well, there is an enough, I suppose, for something.

270
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Enough Dave.

271
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,900
Enough Dave?

272
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
In the days.

273
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah.

274
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,020
There's not enough Dave in my day.

275
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,400
There's not enough Dave in my day.

276
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,580
There's not enough Dave in my day.

277
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,160
There's not enough Dave in my day.

278
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,300
There's not enough Dave in my day.

279
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,980
Enough Dave in my day.

280
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,640
Enough Dave in my day.

281
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,800
Enough Dave in my day.

282
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,200
Enough Dave in my day.

283
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,040
Enough Dave in my day.

284
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,040


285
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,040


286
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,040


287
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,040


288
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,040


289
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,040


290
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,520
So...

291
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,680
Phil.

292
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,420
Phil.

293
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,180
Philip Delman just left our boat.

294
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,000
He's going to sail over off to Amsterdam now.

295
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,800
Yeah, well, apparently the infamous Paul Black

296
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,180
has also contributed to making this show

297
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,540
in the form of a song he apparently found

298
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,280
somewhere in the second-hand record store in 19...

299
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,480
This is Pitfield Monkey, actually.

300
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,280
Pitfield, please come over here and explore.

301
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,220
Explain Fat Harry White to the ladies and gentlemen of Amsterdam.

302
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,620
Fat Harry White is a psychs guard of the stature of Barry White from America.

303
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,760
And he's from the northwest of England.

304
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,220
Can you play the Fat Harry White?

305
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,100
Fat Harry White.

306
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,820
Can you light this?

307
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,340
Fat Harry White is going to tell us about Bob.

308
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,080
Here we go.

309
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,840
Hey baby, you be Eve and I'll be your Adam.

310
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,060
Together we'll taste the forbidden fruits of love in the Garden of Eden.

311
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,280
Yeah.

312
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,980
Hey, I've been talking about Garden of Eden and all that, right?

313
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,500
I was talking to my old mate Bob the Gardener the other day.

314
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,940
Now Bob tends to work mainly on the sloping hills of the York Cestus,

315
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,280
the Shining Hills.

316
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,000
And he's probably the most talked about uphill gardener in the area.

317
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,820
Anyway, we were talking about smoking, actually.

318
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,400
Now Bob's a heavy smoker, but I've not smoked a fag for years.

319
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm not kidding.

320
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Last time I had a puff was about ten years ago.

321
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,420
I'll never forget it.

322
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,540
It was in my bedroom on New Year's Eve.

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,040
I remember deciding to give him up and thinking,

324
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,400
hey, I wonder if I'll ever taste one again.

325
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,320
Tell you what, not touched one since.

326
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,860
Now Bob mainly smokes roll-ups with the cheapest tobacco he can buy.

327
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,280
Yeah.

328
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,340
But on special occasions, he always treats himself to a good rough shag.

329
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,840
Then, you know, sometimes he'll have the occasional 20 Super Kings.

330
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,900
He said he sometimes has a sneaky one in the bath when his wife Anne is in bed.

331
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,540
He just lies back in the bubbles, gets his king size out and pulls on it slowly.

332
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,620
Mm-mm, better.

333
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,560
Not that his wife would mind, because she's a heavy smoker too.

334
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,900
She smokes up to 60 cigarettes a day.

335
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,040
She told me about a time once, about three years ago,

336
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,760
when Bob tried to give her one on the back of his moped.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,280
Just as he was about to put it between the lips,

338
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,720
he came off by the Pelican Crossing, you know.

339
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,720
Anyway, I mean, smoke is bad for you.

340
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,720
I advise you not to do it, you know.

341
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,460
But I mean, I like talking to Bob because I'm interested in gardening, you know.

342
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,540
In fact, I was in the back garden with Fat Aria, you know, the bread knife, the other night.

343
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,080
And she suggested we build an ornamental pond in our garden.

344
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,480
Well, I told her, it's a great idea.

345
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,380
It's a great idea.

346
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,320
It's a great, mmm, it's a great idea.

347
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,140
I mean, not only would it become the main feature of our garden,

348
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,240
but I thought it'd be handy to stick some fish in there, which we could eat.

349
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,600
You know, like a couple of dozen trout, maybe the odd school of salmon.

350
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,740
Frogs, even.

351
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,320
You know, they're a nice delicacy, aren't they?

352
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,440
Hot straight onto the barbecue.

353
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,380
Anyway, right.

354
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,380
Me old mate, Fat Larry, gave me the idea.

355
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
He keeps trout in his pond.

356
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,820
I'll never forget the last time I was in his garden.

357
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,020
I was stood by the water's edge when I asked him if he'd give me one.

358
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,680
Ooh, talk about fresh.

359
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,180
No sooner had I asked him when he thrust this,

360
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,260
nine-inch slippery specimen into me hand.

361
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,680
Tell you what, I hadn't expected him to whip it out there and then.

362
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm worried it would leave a slimy mess on me car coat.

363
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,560
I immediately tossed it off.

364
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,420
Anyway, when it came to our pond, I had a big question for Harriet.

365
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,040
I walked round the garden with her and asked her where, you know,

366
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,480
she wanted me to stick it.

367
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,300
She said she fancied having it in the middle of the lawn

368
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,680
so all the neighbours could see.

369
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,600
Now, truth be known, I thought they might think we were showing off.

370
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,780
So I suggested we have a little one

371
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,540
in the greenhouse.

372
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,680
Well, after a little bit of persuasion, she agreed to it.

373
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,200
She said she didn't mind it being little as long as it was good and deep, you know.

374
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,300
Well, I grabbed hold of my trusty spade and said,

375
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,700
No problemo!

376
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,000
And promptly set about getting on the job with my old tool clutched firmly in both hands.

377
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,860
It's not a new model, but though I say so myself, it's still got a sturdy shaft and

378
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,400
the head, whilst undeniably battered, eh, still gets the job done.

379
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,980
Anyway, the pond was a great success.

380
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,300
The final touch was a great success.

381
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,180
The final touch was the three-foot ornamental bird that stuck in the middle.

382
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm not kidding.

383
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,480
Everyone who calls always comments when they see the huge stalk I have on display.

384
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,060
Oh, yeah!

385
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,580
Come on, down to the Garden of Eden, God's own garden of love.

386
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,620
I am your apostle of Amore.

387
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,280
Will you be my friend?

388
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,480
Actually, there will be two of the greatest examples of spazz music.

389
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,280
Uh, spazz music.

390
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,720
Spazz rock.

391
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,280
I agree.

392
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,280


393
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,280


394
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,280


395
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,920
It's the best rock that you can ever hope to see.

396
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,300
Oh, all right!

397
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,500
Now, you're right!

398
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:02,500


399
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,180
In the tradition that started Devo, for instance, and many of you are familiar with that great

400
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:17,320
old-time quartet Devo, the Devos, we used to call them, well, they devolved and devolved,

401
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,500
and some bands became even more devolved than Devo, and that is where little Theodore

402
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,460
fits into the chain of evolution.

403
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,220
For he is even more devosed.

404
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,280
Oh, yeah!

405
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,280


406
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,280


407
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,060
and devote. Friends, you can come see

408
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,320
Little Theodore. Have you ever imagined

409
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
a

410
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,620
raucous punk

411
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,380
hits like Anarchy

412
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,300
in the UK performed on a

413
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,800
pleasant ukulele?

414
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,440
Imagine Tiny Tim

415
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
doing God

416
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,500
Save the Queen. Well, friends, the Duke

417
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,640
of Uke,

418
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,280
the Duke of all ukuleles

419
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,240
himself will be at the

420
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,660
Bud Cup

421
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,960
this Friday

422
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,860
night for your

423
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,500
edification and enjoyment.

424
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,240
You can have your fortune told.

425
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,500
Diverse psychics

426
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,760
will read your

427
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,180
past and future life

428
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,880
history and tell you

429
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,560
who and what you really are.

430
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,060
We will heal you. We will sicken you.

431
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,920
We will marry you and we will

432
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,260
divorce you. We will bury you.

433
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,140
Friends, and we will bring

434
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,160
you slack in the name

435
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,840
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

436
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,640
We will disgust you and

437
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,700
tire you out and drive you home early.

438
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,820
And that's why it's called

439
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,720
a devival. It's really quite sad

440
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,680
and pitiful. But friends,

441
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,700
and yet, isn't it more like real

442
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,760
life that way? You go

443
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,900
home and there's no one to sleep with

444
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,840
but Bob. But you know, you can be

445
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,860
alone with Bob. He's not like most

446
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,020
personal saviors.

447
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,800
He climbs into bed with you, gives you

448
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,520
a little reach around.

449
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,940
While he takes his way with you, friends.

450
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,840
Bob can be your

451
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,440
special secret imaginary.

452
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,600
buddy. Just like in

453
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,360
childhood, you had that little invisible

454
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,400
friend. That's Bob. Nowadays.

455
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,500
Now that you're a grown up.

456
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,440
Bob loves

457
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,560
you. But, well, actually

458
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,740
friends, God.

459
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,580
God loves you. There is a God and he

460
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,660
loves you. But Bob wants you.

461
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,480
And there's a big difference there.

462
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,640
A real big difference. You think about

463
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,120
that, friends, when you sleep tonight.

464
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,440
Bob wants you.

465
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,380
God loves you. But Bob

466
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,200
wants you, friends.

467
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,600
Let there be slack.

468
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,800
Praise that man,

469
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
Bobby. Praise old Bobby.

470
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,200
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

471
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,500
Praise him, Bob.

472
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,460
Have you got a little

473
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,380
Theodore hit?

474
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,500
He has a great

475
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,520
song that will stick in your head forever

476
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,600
about how much he hates songs that

477
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,320
stick in your head forever.

478
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,620
Happy people.

479
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
So close to death, so slick.

480
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,880
Happy people.

481
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,780
You make me stomp and kick.

482
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,500
Happy people.

483
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,120
What gives you the right?

484
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,920
Happy people. They laugh instead

485
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,160
of fight. Happy people.

486
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,880
You've taken the system's bait.

487
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,560
Happy people.

488
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,420
They think it's a great straight.

489
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,920
Happy people. You're part of

490
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,840
Reagan's plan. Happy

491
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,040
people. No matter what you think of his clan.

492
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
Happy people.

493
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,120
You're all but introduced.

494
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,140
Happy people.

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,100
These are our golden noose.

496
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,260
Happy people. Should we put back in your place?

497
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,980
Happy people.

498
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,660
We're the rest of our miserable race.

499
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,340
Happy people.

500
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,940
It's you I most attest.

501
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
Happy people.

502
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,380
Make me wanna be a pest.

503
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,100
Happy people.

504
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,900
You stray from the right course.

505
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,500
Happy people.

506
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,200
You justify the use of force.

507
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,880
Happy people.

508
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,540
You ought to be ashamed.

509
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,360
Happy people.

510
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,340
At least they give us some of the blame.

511
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,460
Can you work and get over it?

512
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,000
But there's no point in joking.

513
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,640
You just need to make us cry like dogs.

514
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,620
Those are the define children.

515
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:14,660
Like Franck

516
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:14,780
And cells are bad for you?

517
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:14,840
Oh, come on

518
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:14,880
No that easier

519
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:25,940
Oh my god..

520
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,360
guitar solo

521
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,980
guitar solo

522
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,860

538
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,980
afternoon

539
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,560
night.

540
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:05,560
Over and over, drop all my dead soldiers, these are moments that I want to keep.

541
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,300
Now you're screaming and shouting and taking down the power within my eyes.

542
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm too drunk to weep, too drunk to weep, too drunk to weep.

543
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,020
My eyes are too drunk to weep.

544
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,800
It is heaven when I'm jealous of you.

545
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,120
Jealous for you.

546
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,160
Jealous of you.

547
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,840
It is heaven when I'm jealous for you.

548
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,860
It is heaven when you're jealous too.

549
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,240
You're jealous too.

550
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,200
You're jealous too.

551
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,780
It is heaven when you're jealous too.

552
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:55,360
Over and over, drop all my dead soldiers, these are moments that I want to keep.

553
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,460
Now you're screaming.

554
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,680
And shouting and taking down the power within my eyes.

555
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,400
I'm too drunk to weep, too drunk to weep, too drunk to weep.

556
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,940
My eyes are too drunk to weep.

557
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,400
Ah, yes, dear friends.

558
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,980
King Leia with her song, It Is Heaven, from her new CD.

559
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,860
King Leia is also known as...

560
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,920
Reverend Vagina Jones.

561
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,460
Praise Vagina.

562
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,740
Kiss the nose.

563
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,380
Light up that pipe.

564
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,380
Suck that slack right in.

565
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,440
And then six hours later, it's going to get out sooner or later.

566
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,420
No matter how long you hold your breath.

567
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,940
No matter how tight your pants are.

568
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,220
No matter how tight you put that rubber band on.

569
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,220
The slack's going to get out.

570
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,140
In some form or another.

571
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,560
It may be jizz.

572
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,720
It may be gas.

573
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,100
It may be work.

574
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,160
It may be just pure spew.

575
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,580
It may be invisible.

576
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,540
The best part is the invisible part.

577
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,820
The iodine.

578
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,380
A one-three-one.

579
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,340
Has got my thyroid.

580
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,600
On the run.

581
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
In the crew time.

582
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,600
A eight-five.

583
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,440
He's making it hard.

584
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,480
Just to see it.

585
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,440
With the iodine.

586
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,080
A one-three-one.

587
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,540
The iodine.

588
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,380
A one-three-one.

589
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,960
Now we all run into the hell.

590
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,620
And I dance.

591
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,240
There's another thing that just popped into my mind.

592
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,940
When we're talking about UFOs.

593
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,360
Is that the moon itself is actually a mothership space station.

594
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,260
For all these alien races.

595
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,380
It's actually a commuting station between a couple of intergalactic highways.

596
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,080
Which are going through and forth the universe.

597
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,500
And they put a little gas station right next to the earth.

598
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,760
Which is now the moon of course.

599
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,960
On the back side you can fly in with your little spaceship.

600
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,560
So the earth is more or less a shopping mall for them.

601
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,780
Where they can go down and get some groceries.

602
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,560
And scare a couple of people.

603
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,080
Or take them up and bisect them.

604
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,800
And stuff like that.

605
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,320
So that's the moon for you.

606
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,180
Earth is a shopping mall.

607
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,720
And Bob is the salesman in the shopping mall.

608
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,120
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

609
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,760
What's about that staying?

610
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,900
Well the earth is not so much a shopping mall.

611
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,220
But more like one of those roadside gas stations.

612
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,080
Petrol stations with cheap knock off crap.

613
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,540
Well the souls of humankind are that cheap knock off crap.

614
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,960
Not so much the aliens but the aliens children.

615
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,800
Or whining.

616
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,300
Oh I want some more of those human.

617
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,380
I want another 10 billion human souls.

618
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,820
Oh alright get him.

619
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,980
Go slaughter.

620
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,320
Go cause another 40 wars down there on earth.

621
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,000
So the kid can have another billion human souls in anguish.

622
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,000
There is a war in heaven friends.

623
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,820
And we are but the spoils in that war.

624
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,720
We are the booty.

625
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,280
Earth is a farm.

626
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,700
And we are the spuds.

627
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,480
Nay.

628
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,260
We are the parasites on the spuds.

629
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,140
Of that farm.

630
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,020
And that's what they want.

631
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,340


632
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,600
And Bob friends.

633
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,080
Bob's that farmer.

634
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,860
He's gonna harvest us up.

635
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,500
And set.

636
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,220
Wait a minute.

637
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,060
Hey.

638
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
Maybe Bob's not such a good deal after all.

639
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,460
Maybe we're just suckers.

640
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,120
Slaves for some pipes.

641
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,700
Nah.

642
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,860
Well how does it relate between actually normal and pink souls and subgenius souls.

643
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,080
Is there a.

644
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,900
Because if an alien actually eats a subgenius soul.

645
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,940
There's something else with it I guess.

646
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,740
Like a creature or.

647
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,480
Well they get a little higher off of a subgenius soul.

648
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,480
Or one who has sent their $30 to Bob.

649
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,360
At which there is a distinction.

650
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,660
Sending one's $30 to Bob does save one.

651
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,820
But does not necessarily mean that one has the true subgenius soul.

652
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,020
It's close enough to fool an elder god in the bargaining session.

653
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,020
Well I may have said too much already.

654
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,740
But the true subgenius.

655
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,380
Which is everyone who would be listening to me now of course.

656
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,400
Would be the one saved.

657
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:38,000
And the souls bargained off to some titanic unseen forces underground.

658
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,460
Would be negligible.

659
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,720
The people you don't like.

660
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,640
You know those Bobbies.

661
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,320
You know how I mean.

662
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Wouldn't be you.

663
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,900
Be the next guy.

664
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,600
I'm not Bob.

665
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,420
Yeah.

666
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,020
Yeah.

667
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,520
Those half assed people.

668
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,400
Not you.

669
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,440
No.

670
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,000
Your $30 would be very well spent.

671
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,260
Take that in

672
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:14,760
Thank you.

673
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,700
Take this.

674
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,660
So everything I do is right, I believe in God!

675
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,260
No need to even pray, I write, sometimes I talk to God.

676
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,260
He never needs to answer me, that's precisely how I know.

677
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,380
I'm just the way he wants me to be, I believe in God!

678
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,600
So everything I do is right, I believe in God!

679
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,800
So everything I say is right, I believe in God!

680
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,860
So everything I think is right, I believe in God!

681
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,040
No need to even pray, I write, I know that there are those

682
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,180
Who are not quite sure what to do, but there's a shining path

683
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,420
Inside every one of you, when I encountered God

684
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,440
He filled my heart and soul with song, I've sung it ever since

685
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,680
And now I cannot do no wrong, I believe in God!

686
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,580
So everything I do is right, I believe in God!

687
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,800
So everything I say is right, I believe in God!

688
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,960
So everything I say is right, I believe in God!

689
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,040
So everything I think is right, I believe in God!

690
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,480
No need to even pray, I write, I believe in God!

691
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,060
So everything I do is right!

692
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,940
I believe in God.

693
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,160
Little Theodore.

694
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:57,100
Little Theodore, friends, the amazing Little Theodore.

695
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,320
And that's from a CD re-release of his 1990 final LP,

696
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,860
Idiots Are Closer to God.

697
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,100
And friends, you can contact Little Theodore at, one word,

698
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,680
littletheodore at yahoo.com.

699
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:24,940
Theodore, by the way, Little Theodore is spelled F-Y-O-D-O-R.

700
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,380
Theodore.

701
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,920
Theodore.

702
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:37,280
Little Theodore at yahoo.com or 3277 Raleigh Street, Denver, Colorado, 80212.

703
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:46,660
That's 3277 Raleigh Street, Denver, Colorado, 80212.

704
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,680
Every time.

705
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:46,640
That's 3277 Raleigh Street, Denver, Colorado, 80212.

706
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,400
We have one Dutch man in this room right now.

707
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,860
And we want an explanation for these toilets that you have here in Holland.

708
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,740
The steps I can understand.

709
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,840
The steps I can understand.

710
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,280
But the toilets.

711
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,160
And even those little walls that serve food.

712
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,520
You put your little two guilders, two and a half guilders in

713
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,820
and pull food out of this brick wall.

714
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,780
That I can understand.

715
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,540
But come on, man.

716
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,440
The toilet.

717
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,880
Well, actually, there's a very logical explanation for the toilet.

718
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,520
Well, not only that.

719
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,800
Actually, our houses are very small because we don't have a lot of space.

720
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,500
So the only logical place to put a toilet because at a certain point they had to move,

721
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,160
be moved out of the kitchen into someplace else.

722
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,560
And the only thing they had left was a broom cupboard.

723
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,080
So just they stuck it in the broom cupboard,

724
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,660
which basically means everybody is still shitting in a broom cupboard.

725
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,480
And actually they maintained that size officially also in stuff they make now, new buildings.

726
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,480
Like all the toilets are still really small instead of the broom cupboard.

727
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,140
Well, they're a bit bigger now than the broom cupboard size they used to have.

728
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,880
But now it makes sense.

729
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,720
Yeah, it makes sense.

730
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,200
Now that you've told us, I understand.

731
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,080
Okay, now I have another question.

732
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,360
Why in all of the doorways is there a thing to trip you?

733
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,480
Like everyone to be tripping?

734
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,860
They saw you coming.

735
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,620
Well, that's actually the tripping which happens to you.

736
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,360
It's actually not necessarily caused by the things which they have lying in the door,

737
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,180
which makes you trip.

738
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,400
But actually the little creatures will live under it.

739
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,940
A little like gnome-like creatures.

740
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,500
And we still have a lot of them here in Holland,

741
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,960
only most people don't see them.

742
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,500
And they think it's either mice or they just like trip.

743
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,780
And the little very small guys with like small beards and little red hats.

744
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,760
Yeah.

745
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,300
What?

746
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,020
In Dutch we call them kabouters.

747
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,160
Kabouters?

748
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,700
Kabouters.

749
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,900
What does that mean?

750
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,120
Well, the Irish have the leprechauns.

751
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,600
You know, and...

752
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,840
What is the biggest word?

753
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,000
The word for that, Stang?

754
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,180
Don't say it.

755
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,740
I'm afraid to say it because then they will come.

756
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,000
I will not summon them.

757
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,440
You won't trick me that easily.

758
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,520
He is wise.

759
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,600
He is wise.

760
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,680
He does not move your simple foolish ways.

761
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,480
I don't be silly.

762
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,260
Of course I don't.

763
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,640
But that's because you're smart.

764
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,280
I mean, you spent all that excess money that you make on trips to Amsterdam and stuff like that, don't you?

765
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,200
Yeah.

766
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,720
That's what the rest of us do.

767
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,220
You know, you have a write-off.

768
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,600
Intelligence, yeah.

769
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,140
Mind.

770
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,200
That's got a lot to do with it, Stang.

771
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,500
That's what...

772
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,640
No, that...

773
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,860
Bob never said that.

774
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,320
Nah, Bob never said that.

775
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:26,680
That ain't doctrinal.

776
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,020
He never told me anything.

777
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,500
Bob never said you had to have a brain.

778
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,400
In fact, he said just the opposite.

779
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,460
He said to just float with it, man.

780
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,440
Just feel your way along.

781
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,040
Don't be linear.

782
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,720
Have a holographic view.

783
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,940
If you feel the weight holding you down, you don't want to be linear.

784
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,100
It's like you're being locked in a box, man.

785
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,960
Just like the way you go.

786
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,560
Yeah, man.

787
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,420
It's not a road or a grid.

788
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,580
It's more like a cloud.

789
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,900
Yeah, it's like an aeroil or a canyon.

790
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,140
No, it's like a beaver's tooth.

791
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,160
No, it's like a hamstrung muscle.

792
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,160
The neurons don't really do that much.

793
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:10,260
The things they don't even know about go off the neurons.

794
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,840
They do all the real stuff.

795
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,080
They're so lonely and they're so stupid.

796
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,680
They're sitting right next to all the other neurons.

797
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,100
Dave, get your hands off that neuron.

798
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,540
Quit playing with your neurons.

799
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,720
Look at that.

800
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,580
Look at him.

801
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,320
He's just like a chimpanzee today.

802
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Just beating his neurons again.

803
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,560
Ripping his neurons.

804
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,880
Ew, it's gross.

805
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,120
W-w-w-w-w-wisk.

806
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,920
W-w-w-w-w-w-wisk, I got it.

807
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,460
The Scandinavian plate has it.

808
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
The grosser serotonin all over everything.

809
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,380
The body means spring testing and other morning afternoons.

810
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:53,480
Will you plug your ears and quit leaking out your damn neuronic chemical brain cell pus?

811
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,020
It's neuronic pus, man.

812
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,180
Ah, neuronic pus.

813
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,520
Somebody called this show a bunch of neuronic pus and I think they meant moronic pus.

814
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,340
I don't think they meant it.

815
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,040
I would agree.

816
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,540
I would tend to agree with that characterization.

817
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:14,060
Well, quite frankly, everybody who is listening at the moment, I'm talking not to a broad audience.

818
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,080
It's true.

819
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,680
It's a broad audience of one.

820
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,240
Basically, there's only really one person who we're broadcasting to tonight who I'm talking to.

821
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:20,980
That's far.

822
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,260
No, it's the one person out there who gets it.

823
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:29,020
It's the one person out there who sees this as more than something stupid they listen to on the radio.

824
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,340
There's somebody out there right now who is sitting there thinking to themselves,

825
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,600
actually, that makes a lot of sense.

826
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:42,000
Why shouldn't there be any high-epops called Bob?

827
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,960
That makes about as much sense as anything.

828
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Ever since I've been watching films, I've seen somebody with a pipe in their mouth walking around and adding to scenes,

829
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:56,280
scenes that wouldn't have ended unless that man with the pipe was there in the background giving some side information like,

830
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,340
the aliens are over there!

831
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,740
Or something along those lines.

832
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,840
Basically, there is always a man in the background with a pipe.

833
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,580
And as soon as you've actually come to realize that there's always a man in the background with a pipe,

834
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,580
perhaps you'll start listening to the man.

835
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,200
And you'll start to see that man in the background with the pipe.

836
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,360
You know, we haven't got along.

837
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:26,760
We've got probably, I mean, let's face it, we've all listened to the scientific reports that say we've probably got another 200, 300 million years.

838
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,320
They're all saying numbers that are too big for us to imagine.

839
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,240
If the asteroid doesn't get you.

840
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,520
If the asteroid doesn't get you.

841
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,480
The chances are, let's face it, tops, we're all looking at about another eight months tops.

842
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,880
I don't think we're going to make it to 2002.

843
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,680
I think that's a pipe dream.

844
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,200
I think the fact that we made it to 2001 is a bit of a result, quite frankly.

845
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,400
It's not going to happen, really.

846
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,520
I don't care how much jizz you've got.

847
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,320
I don't care how much slack you've got.

848
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,720
I don't care how much general piety you have.

849
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,040
I think the fact is that we're on the way out.

850
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,960
We've reached the end.

851
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,560
But quite frankly, you can choose your side.

852
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,880
This is just a damn thing to keep the Germans from getting the 2006 cup.

853
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,260
That's exactly what this is.

854
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,280
This is a diversion.

855
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,980
This is all a diversion.

856
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,320
And deep down in your heart, you know that everything you've ever witnessed is a diversion.

857
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,820
None of it makes any sense because none of it is for anything that's going to profit you.

858
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,240
Except for one thing.

859
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,800
And that one thing is if you send $30 to the Church of the Subgenius.

860
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,420
And what you'll gain from that is not just a slight smile.

861
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,480
You won't be able to raise your eyelids in company and think, I'm cooler than you.

862
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
You're going to know that you're cooler than me.

863
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,360
You're going to know that you're cooler than them.

864
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,540
You've actually paid money to be cooler than they are.

865
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:56,060
And quite frankly, you've done nothing in your life that won't be absorbed in the cauldron of coolness that will come from you spending $30.

866
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,040
$30.

867
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,240
I mean, in English, that's about half a sixpence.

868
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,980
It's not anything that's going to cost you.

869
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,560
Send it along to the crazy Americans.

870
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,520
They don't care.

871
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,920
Just pile that along to them.

872
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,800
Just more money to them.

873
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,260
You will get a card.

874
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,480
It's like a receipt.

875
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,920
You know, you're not sending your money off and just getting thanks.

876
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,540
You're getting a card.

877
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,960
You're getting a card that says, I, Reverend, state your name.

878
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,680
Whatever your name may be.

879
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,920
We'll be boarding the saucers.

880
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
Whenever that should happen.

881
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,320
Although it seemed to be a couple of years ago.

882
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,360
Hasn't happened yet.

883
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,820
But I have faith.

884
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,600
It's going to happen at some point.

885
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,320
Very soon it will happen.

886
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,220
And those of you who held on through 1998.

887
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,760
Anything can happen in the next half hour.

888
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,280
1999.

889
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,560
2000.

890
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,220
2001.

891
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,140
And probably 2002.

892
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,780
And still no rupture.

893
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,580
But you'll know that you are part of a church who has got the last laugh.

894
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,680
And we have.

895
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,380
That's the last laugh.

896
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,160
Ladies and gentlemen, did you think you were going to hear the last laugh tonight?

897
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,440
If you ever wondered what the last laugh sounded like.

898
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,000
This is the last laugh.

899
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,360
Oh.

900
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,940
My God.

901
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,140
Do you want that?

902
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,280
Do you want that to be your last memory of life on earth?

903
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,140
Do you want that to be the only sound you can hear?

904
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,140


905
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,680
Do you want that to be the only sound you can carry through heaven, Hades and purgatory?

906
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,000
Or would you rather.

907
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,700
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

908
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,940
Would you rather.

909
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,680
Would you rather.

910
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,500
Be listening to the music of people you love.

911
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,540
Artists you admire.

912
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,820
Folk that you think they know where they're coming from.

913
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,920
If you are that way.

914
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,640
You can write a cheque for $30.

915
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,980
You can spare 30 pounds.

916
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,680
Think about it.

917
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
What were you going to buy tomorrow?

918
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,880
Tomorrow's Monday.

919
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,220
You're probably going to be at work.

920
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,560
So you're going to go there.

921
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,620
You're going to buy lunch.

922
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,200
Lunch is going to involve a sandwich perhaps.

923
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,500
After that maybe you'll rent a video for the evening.

924
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,560
There's not much on telly tonight.

925
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,240
You'll go home.

926
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:24,780
You'll watch that.

927
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,480
That'll be great.

928
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,600
Everything's groovy.

929
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:33,300
Or you could send all the money you would have spent tomorrow to the church of the subgenius.

930
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:40,380
And what you get from that would probably be just a little more than watching a video tonight.

931
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,160
You might find yourself with a gateway to infinite slack.

932
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,740
Your soul will suddenly become immortal.

933
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,960
Soon you will find the ability to talk at random in public places.

934
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,820
You're wrong.

935
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,720
You're wrong.

936
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,440
Don't you look at my eyes.

937
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,080
I'm talking to you.

938
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,240
Haber, frapper, doppler, blitz.

939
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,700
Soon all cars will be made this way.

940
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,760
Well Guido's here in the house.

941
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,160
Moronic.

942
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,800
But he seems like he's in a garage or something.

943
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,200
He's built his own Amsterdam.

944
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,420
I get that's the look I got.

945
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,100
It's like one eye pointed sky when one to the ground.

946
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,580
We must build our own ships.

947
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,620
But in the meantime, since those ships are so dangerous, complicated and expensive, you

948
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,380
can build your own Amsterdam.

949
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,580
Of course, if they catch you doing it, they'll throw you in prison for 99 years.

950
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,100
Yeah, they don't like that very much.

951
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,860
But people are doing it all the time.

952
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,340
Yeah, man.

953
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,340
Everybody's building like their own private Amsterdam.

954
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,240
See, you know, that's what the mind is for.

955
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,180
You control your mind.

956
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,640
You control your own private Amsterdam.

957
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,920
Well, actually, I was more like thinking about your backyard or your garage.

958
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,180
Oh, you control your back muscles and your lumbago.

959
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,420
You can also control your cesspool and everything back there too, you know.

960
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:19,500
If a yogi can control his lumbago, then make it into a whole separate, almost like another mind.

961
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:28,960
A yogi can control his lumbago and give himself instant healing, but he can't eat a lousy piece of fried chicken or some spaghetti with meat sauce.

962
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,080
You know what I'm saying?

963
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:38,320
The guy can probably make himself fly, but he can't find a pair of shoes that actually fit his big, flabby old yogi feet, you know?

964
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,780
Well, that's the thing about being a holy man.

965
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:47,560
You have to be not of this world, which usually means you don't have a job and you have to depend on handouts.

966
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,220
That's what I do.

967
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,140
Yes, but you are so unholy.

968
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,480
Well, I'm a holy man of unholiness, you know.

969
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,640
I mean, there's a tradition of that.

970
00:45:59,140 --> 00:45:59,900
It's legitimate.

971
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,680
Not the fact that you're...

972
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:01,940
There's conventions.

973
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,920
I mean, you know, I go to conventions with other holy men of unholiness, unfortunately.

974
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,620
Like Anton LaVey or somebody?

975
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,220
Well, unfortunately, some of the best ones are dead.

976
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,460
Anton LaVey is dead, isn't he?

977
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,300
Anton's dead.

978
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,620
Koresh is dead.

979
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:21,420
Now, do you think he went to hell or purgatory or heaven or lumbago or any of those places?

980
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,320
Disney Land.

981
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,080
Disney Land.

982
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,440
How Guido said it best.

983
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,380
He went to Disney Land.

984
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,040
Oh.

985
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,520
Can't you see the Church of the Satanist guy in one of those weird teacup rides, you know,

986
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,380
like the Mad Hatter teacup ride or going maybe through Pirates of the Caribbean?

987
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,540
Actually, I'm sure there was a time when Anton LaVey went through Disney Land.

988
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,380
Yeah.

989
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,880
I've been to Disney Land.

990
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,260
That's before.

991
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,840
I mean, lots of people go to Disney Land sooner or later.

992
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,000
Well, Chad...

993
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,740
I thought it was really kind of boring and pink.

994
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,760
Well, you've got to go...

995
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,020
That hot center was cool.

996
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,020
What you've got to do is take the Mystic Tour like that.

997
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,020


998
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,700
I mean, you've got to go down there to like, you know, if you want to be a real Satanist

999
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,060
or a craft worshiper.

1000
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,260
Yeah, you don't go to Amsterdam.

1001
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,480
Chaz went to the Crossroads.

1002
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,480


1003
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,340
Chaz went to the Crossroads.

1004
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,220
You don't go to Europe.

1005
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,200
You've got to go down in the Mississippi Delta.

1006
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,980
Well, I want to try to...

1007
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,840
And dig your fingers in that mud and suck the brain right out of that mud bug.

1008
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,380
Well, that's fine, but I just wanted to get high.

1009
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,000
Well, we've got a true incident that he found right behind us.

1010
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,000


1011
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,000


1012
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,000


1013
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,160
We have Dr. Philo Drummond, the overman, who originally is from Tibet.

1014
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,080
Princess We Are Doe, who is from outer space.

1015
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,240
The queen of all the UFOs.

1016
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,320
Pope Black, who is originally from America, and I'm from Texas, which is different from America.

1017
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:53,880
We've got Father Pope Phil Monty, representing Northern England.

1018
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,880
But not the South!

1019
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,540
That's true. Remember Vicki Finn, your face is the London front.

1020
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stan, why is he here? Can you tell us that, please?

1021
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,900
Well, you know, friends, you're either on the saucers or you're off the saucers.

1022
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,220
And he spent his $30 to Bob Dobbs. He's on the saucers.

1023
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:12,820
Yeah!

1024
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:23,860
You could be a complete loser. Ugly, stupid, mean, disgusting, heretic.

1025
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:23,860


1026
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,200
You could be a little bit of a nigger-lip.

1027
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,680
And with strange sexual perversions.

1028
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,680
Bob was still running for only $30.

1029
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:41,400
And yet, Mother Teresa, for all the good she did in the world, she never spent $30.

1030
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,280
She's burning in the deepest pit of hell. The devils are poking Mother Teresa.

1031
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,360
And Princess Di. Was Princess Di so genius?

1032
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,240
No! No!

1033
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,480
No! When she suddenly was lifted up.

1034
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,960
Oh, she was taken away. Oh, she was thinking about Mom? No, sir.

1035
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,540
No.

1036
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,220
She was thinking about her.

1037
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,100
She was thinking about that bodyguard.

1038
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,460
She was thinking about that bodyguard.

1039
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,040
And look what happened to her. Now, is she in 1777? No.

1040
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,820
She's being tormented and tortured by devils that got blown up by land mines.

1041
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,100
Universal sick.

1042
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:21,100
And what about Anton LaVey? Is Anton LaVey? Is he still alive?

1043
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,460
I don't know.

1044
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,060
I don't know if Anton LaVey ever was on our mailing list or not.

1045
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,020
He had his own cult.

1046
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah, he had his own. He's more like, I think that he and Dobbs used to hang out at the cult leader convention.

1047
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,020
Yeah, like David Courage.

1048
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,660
Do you think he's on the guest list?

1049
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,240
Jim Jones. Jim Jones.

1050
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,120
Yeah, the $30 guest list.

1051
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,880
Oh, you have to pay $30 to get it.

1052
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,620
The Book of Life, my friend. Your name is in the Book of Life.

1053
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,940
The Book of Life, yes.

1054
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,740
Five Rocks, Five Old Drummings, name is in the Book of Life.

1055
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,480
You bet.

1056
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,740
You did sing your 30s.

1057
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,320
I had my $30 cut off by Bob himself.

1058
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,280
Whoa.

1059
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,720
Well, friends, we're saved.

1060
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:12,000
And that's why you feel this joy and confidence just oozing and gushing out of us, running down our pants, legs.

1061
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,680
Oh, just look at that rug.

1062
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,840
But you too can have the same thing for only that tiny 70 guilders, friends,

1063
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,300
took that post office box in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1064
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,860
Where the cowboys live.

1065
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,640
Tumbleweeds, blow crosses.

1066
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,340
Dabbleheads.

1067
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,500
Wee-haw.

1068
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:29,900
Orsi.

1069
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,320
People are heeled.

1070
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,000
Electri-eyes.

1071
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,780
Electri-eyes.

1072
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,580
And then, you got the streetcar.

1073
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,980
And the race.

1074
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,800
And the race.

1075
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,340
We're anti-American.

1076
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,660
We're going to subvert the conspiracy of America from the inside.

1077
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,120
That's right.

1078
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:44,820
We don't have to do it.

1079
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,040
We speak their language.

1080
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,660
But to destroy the concept of money?

1081
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,520
Friend, you bring slack, it's going to take a hell of a lot of money.

1082
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,820
And a lot of your prayers.

1083
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,860
So, friends, I'm going to give that post office box to you to send all your murder and cash.

1084
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,820
Tell us where.

1085
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,340
Post office box.

1086
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:05,840
Tell us where.

1087
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:11,880
140306.

1088
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,480
In beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1089
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,100
With that zip code.

1090
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,440
75214.

1091
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,340
USA.

1092
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:23,980
Praise Bob.

1093
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,640
We're going to do it.

1094
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,300
We can't wait to get back to America and destroy all family values.

1095
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:36,660
Yeah.

1096
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,640
And you can actually read that on the website.

1097
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,060
They got a website called...

1098
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,160
Subgenius.com.

1099
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:42,360
Yeah.

1100
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,260
Subgenius.com.

1101
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,540
All you have to do is spell subgenius.com.

1102
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,340
You're a .com, right?

1103
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,260
Type in the word yes.

1104
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:46,520
Yes.

1105
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,000
We are in the book.

1106
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,080
Subgenius.com.

1107
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1108
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1109
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1110
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1111
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1112
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1113
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1114
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1115
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,080


1116
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,740
Yeah.

1117
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,540
Actually selling a word.

1118
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,560
Selling what you actually always thought would be a word.

1119
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,980
But we'll go over your act.

1120
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,760
It's what we preach because we're not the kind of people who are preaching to Bob.

1121
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,800
We don't understand it anyway.

1122
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,540
Chitza, Chitza, do you have any doctor music there?

1123
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,840
Well, I just, I'm just going to put in a song of the Duke of Ouk.

1124
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,940
The Duke.

1125
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,440
The Duke.

1126
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,200
The Duke.

1127
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,920
Clean up, vote, Ouk.

1128
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,480
Ouk.

1129
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,080
Duke of Ouk.

1130
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,540
Ouk.

1131
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,220
Keep him away from the peanuts.

1132
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,780
Clean up, vote, Duke of Ouk.

1133
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,500
O LIKE with Chuck Callie.

1134
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,000
Keep the guy away from the peanuts.

1135
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,480
Hey na na.

1136
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,500
Hey na na.

1137
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,700
Hey na na.

1138
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,420
Hey na na.

1139
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:34,420


1140
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,400
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low, ho-ho.

1141
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,240
I lean back on my radio, ho-ho.

1142
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,760
Some cat was laying on the walker.

1143
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:46,760


1144
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:46,760


1145
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:46,760


1146
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:46,760


1147
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,340
Down to rock and roll, out of soul, he said

1148
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,420
Then the loud sound, it seemed to fade

1149
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,300
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of faith

1150
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,780
There ain't no DJ, that was easy cosmic drive

1151
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:14,340
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1152
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,780
He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds

1153
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,780
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1154
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:29,900
He told us not to blow, cause he knows it's all worthwhile

1155
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:36,240
He told me, let the children use it, let the children lose it

1156
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,820
Let all the children boo-boo

1157
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,040
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1158
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,320
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1159
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,020

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,620
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1163
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,260
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1164
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,040
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1165
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,680
I had to phone someone so I picked on you

1166
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,820
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too

1167
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,880
Turn on your TV, we can pick him up on Channel 2

1168
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,320
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1169
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,980
Look out your window, you can see his light

1170
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,540
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight

1171
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,340
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright

1172
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,140
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1173
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,660
He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds

1174

He told me, let the children lose it

1178

Let the children use it

1179
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,840
Let all the children boo-boo

1180
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,120
Starman waiting in the sky

1181
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:12,320
He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds

1182
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,340
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1183
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,280

He told me, let the children use it

1186
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,660
Let the children use it

1187
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,280
Let all the children boo-boo

1188
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,360
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1189
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,380
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

1196
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,340
Bye-bye.

1197
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,200
...dot-com.

1198
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,400
Hey, praise Bob, and that's from the CD,

1199
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,420
The Duke of Uke,

1200
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,340
Ukulele Ladyland.

1201
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,980
I don't care what you do,

1202
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,780
as long as you're at the bad coit, the little butt plug,

1203
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,120
or wherever you want to be,

1204
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,980
providing that he's plugging a butt on Friday night.

1205
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,960
I'm going to own bad cells down to the bad coit.

1206
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,320
Bring yourself, bring money,

1207
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,460
but bring everything along

1208
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,360
at the butt...

1209
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,060
plug.

1210
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,960
We'll be bad if you're bad.

1211
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,000
This is a book cassette tape.

1212
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,680
It must be listened to on a stereo...

1213
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,760
You're going to be as bad as you want to be, baby!

1214
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,480
Oh, yeah!

1215
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,900
We'll be bad because of the bad coit, bro.

1216
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,860
You made me do that,

1217
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,780
didn't you?

1218
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,380
Oh, you're so bad.

1219
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,980
I didn't want to do that,

1220
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,680
but you made me do it.

1221
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,980
You're bad,

1222
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,380
you're a good person.

1223
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,140
You should come make it count for something.

1224
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,400
Come to the bad coit Friday night.

1225
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,180
We'll help you,

1226
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,480
and perhaps you can help us.

1227
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,600
Mmmmmm.

1228
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,220
Mmmmmm.

1229
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,440
Mmmmmm.

1230
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,920
It looks like there's about 37 of us,

1231
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,740
but there's only three of us,

1232
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,440
and we wear different costumes.

1233
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,240
See?

1234
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,240
If you can see the changes,

1235
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,420
come along.

1236
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:12,800
Friday night,

1237
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,080
we have...

1238
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,620
Wonder Man-est for you.

1239
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:16,860
Oooh.

1240
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,240
Come see Princess Wei and her PJs.

1241
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,700
Ahhh!

1242
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:22,460
Oooh!

1243
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,160
You're never gonna get this offer again.

1244
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,200
One time only!

1245
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,220
Never.

1246
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,640
Ahhh.

1247
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,800
See this, and die.

1248
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,420
Stumble.

1249
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,900
Stumble.

1250
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:39,520
Yeah.

1251
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,840
Oh, anyway, this is, uh,

1252
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,200
the end of, uh,

Het Programma

1254
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,220
on Radio Patapool,

1255
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,380
and we're gonna close off now,

1256
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,000
and go into Amsterdam,

1257
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,480
and get off this...

1258
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,760
Get off this damn boat,

1259
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,160
and...

1260
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,100
...tourist.com-er.

1261
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,560
Uh...

1262
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,860
Take the second window on the right.

1263
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,680
...right.

1264
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,420
Keep your hat on tight,

1265
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,980
your sack in the saddle,

1266
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,760
and your head to the wind,

1267
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,900
and I don't remember the rest,

1268
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,000
but... have fun.

1269
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,940
See you there.

1270
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,540
...for 20 years.

1271
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,680
The Judge Paul...
