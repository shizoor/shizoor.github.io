1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:08,380
You know what? It's not a radio show at all. It's a map! My God, it's a map!

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,780
And now, the Self Genius Hour of Swag.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,600
That's too bad, fella.

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,360
Self Genius Hour of Swag

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,360


6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,580
Like the fruit stand that turns into a filling station.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,020
But the footprints and signs from the past are everywhere.

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,220
They've been fighting over this land ever since the first Spanish missionary

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:58,280
showed the Indians the benefits of religion, horses, and a few years of forced labor.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,040
The Indians had it right all along.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,600
They respected ghosts.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,940
Memories are like that.

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,700
As unpredictable as nitro, and you never know what's going to set one off.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,100
Like the clues that keep you on the right track are never where you look for them.

15
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,000
They fall out of the pocket of somebody else's suit you pick up at the cleaners.

16
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,820
They're in the tune you can't stop humming that you never heard in your life.

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,500
They're at the other end of the wrong number you dial in the middle of the night.

18
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,080
The signs are in all those old familiar places.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,360
You only think about them.

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,800
You think you've never been before.

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,800
But you get used to seeing them out of the corner of your eye.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,100
And you end up tripping over the ones that are right in front of you.

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,680
And some days, I just feel like I've been bombarded by bozons.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,640
.

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,720
.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:07,720


27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:07,720


28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:07,780
.

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,120
.

30
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,020
.

31
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,100
.

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,180
.

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,580
.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,000
.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,020
.

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,120
.

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,140
.

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,280
.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,140
What are you doing, Dad?

40
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm developing a compound that, when applied to the soles of shoes, keeps gum from sticking to them.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,180
What a wonderful gift to mankind.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,500
Con, what are you going to do today?

43
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,680
I'm very busy.

44
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,580
After I rake a perfect crosshatch pattern in the pea gravel in the driveway,

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm going to change the air in the spare tire of the station wagon.

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,600
I'd better make some sandwiches.

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,660
Yeah, I was going to tell you about the dark stuff.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,380
Maybe you've just been sitting there all this time, waiting, wishing, and hoping against all hope

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,220
that you would live long enough to experience, at least once more,

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,480
or maybe just once, that fabled event which truly is dark stuff.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,960
Ah, yes, just when you thought that the church had breathed its last gasp

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,500
and that Bob went down for the last time instead of whipping it,

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:33,120
you thought you might never get another chance to groove on down the backside of reality

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,160
while stoking it.

55
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,100
On your fine frockster, with your best beach-burning rolling blood.

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:50,600
The proceeding was judged politically incorrect and against Federal Bureau of Demonology.

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,760
Wow, these photo op things, they keep running down.

58
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,540
Why don't you put in another little phone card?

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,880
Ah, I think, well, that fixes it.

60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,260
So,

61
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,540
anyway, you and all the other subgenius megalomaniacs.

62
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,040
Ah, come on, Dr. Howell.

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,380
What about me and all them other subgenius megalomaniacs?

64
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,420
Ah, friends,

65
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,560
I've got some preaching to do tonight.

66
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,900
I've got a focused, a particularly focused message.

67
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,060
We're just going to stay on one subject tonight.

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,200
We're going to do it Dr. Gene Scott style, I think.

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,600
I don't, I don't want you to think that'd be about right.

70
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:36,880
Will?

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,360
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,260
Hey, Zandy?

73
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,380
Whatever.

74
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,880
We're just going to, I'm going to preach on,

75
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,240
because it's a spirit, it's spirit-filled men, you see.

76
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,420
And women, take the mind of your, now I'm preaching now.

77
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,480
Take, women, you take the mind of your man by the spirit.

78
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,460
See, if you can take him by, take the mind of your man by the spirit,

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
you can control him.

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
You can control his flesh.

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,400
Because what controls this being is the mind, and not the brain.

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,060
No, the brain doesn't know.

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,440
You decide.

84
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
It's in your will.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
Thy will be done.

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,780
Now, it's funny, see, old Will, Will of Dobbs over here is laughing.

87
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,960
But that's not the kind of will we're talking about.

88
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,780
Your will.

89
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,820
Let thy will be done.

90
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,740
Let the mind of Bob dwell in you, you see, sir, ma'am.

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,560
But Bob will not dwell in your filth.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,320
He will not dwell in your negative thoughts, your rebellion.

93
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,820
When you get the mind of Bob properly, by the Holy Spirit,

94
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,020
you'll see a change in everything, a change in your whole life.

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,420
You've got to develop your Bob mind.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,340
You've got to give your mind, you see, you see what I'm talking about now, don't you?

97
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,120
Well, now, now I'm not using background music here.

98
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,140
I don't need it.

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,980
I'm not wanting it, and I'm not needing it.

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,540
Because I've been in discernment.

101
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,900
You've heard Brother Gene, and now you're going to hear me.

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,660
But you've got to develop that Bob mind.

103
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,600
You've got to give your mind food from the word of Bob.

104
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,900
You can't hide away at home from the world and have the Bob mind.

105
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,940
It has to be developed.

106
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,280
You have to go out into the world.

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,740
You have to be ready to, well, do it to it before it's going to do it to you.

108
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,880
You know what I'm saying now.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
Because that's the first thing.

110
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,760
The first secret for getting the mind of Bob is, well, you know what it is, get slack.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,500
You don't, yeah, you don't come bed, now, I know you've been, some of you, you pray to Bob for slack.

112
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,740
But don't be coming up to Bob with a sad face.

113
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,100
Don't come to him with a sad face.

114
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,560
You rejoice.

115
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
You've got the mind of Bob.

116
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,000
You don't walk up to Bob and say, no, Bob, I'm rejected.

117
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,360
Nobody loves me.

118
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,900
Oh, I hate my job.

119
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,640
No siree.

120
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,600
No siree, ma'am.

121
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,600
You walk up to Bob with, with slack.

122
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,680
And say, Bob, now, despite all this, this stuff, all this mess, I'm still, I'm still slackful.

123
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,460
And see, when you got Bob's ear, because, because he's a God who loves to be worshipped.

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,560
Then you kind of slip in.

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,340
And Bob, while I'm talking to you, I got this little problem I'd like to tell you about.

126
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,360
That's how you do it.

127
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,220
Now, if you meditate on these things, the brain will get the idea.

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,260
That's what you're trying to do.

129
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,900
You're trying to trick the brain into getting the idea.

130
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,060
It's like unto the twelve temptations.

131
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,040
Now, the government files on this church.

132
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,820
I want you to know about the government.

133
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,420
Because the conspiracy has ignored us.

134
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,420
Sure, largely.

135
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,240
We think.

136
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,960
We think.

137
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,980
But it's not because we're so pathetic.

138
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,240
No, that's not.

139
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,380
It's because we're so frightening to them.

140
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,920
Unexplained.

141
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,520
They don't know.

142
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,520
They don't know.

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,060
They know that the formula for world overthrow is here.

144
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,880
But they don't know what it is.

145
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,180
They don't know why.

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,900
Or what.

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,980
Or the how of it.

148
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,780
It's just like the way they regard the UFO.

149
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,140
There's this whole secret, majestic twelve kind of group.

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
The Department of the National Security Agency.

151
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Does nothing but study the subgenius.

152
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,900
They may know, for all we know, they may know more about Bob than we do.

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,020
They might actually be a more, for all we know, they might be a more important tool in his plan than you.

154
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,860
The conspiracy agency that studies the subgenius might know more about it than you and me.

155
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:39,920
Because they've got, working with them, they've got the coprolitologists of Moab.

156
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Moab.

157
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,140
My friend, in the desert.

158
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,980
Yay, the desert of Lebanon.

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,160
It's simultaneously a place and a being and a state of mind.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,240
You see, this is how one can pass through the gates of opportunity.

161
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,300
Now friends, some things need to be said.

162
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:08,100
And you know on most college campuses now, there's spent condoms hanging from the fences and the trees.

163
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,960
And where it used to be just regular toilet paper or something like that.

164
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:23,660
But to fool the pink, to fool the pink, now you see, I'm not using the music.

165
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm just right here and they're not going to stop me.

166
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,140
Ehh, said G. Miguelomaniac.

167
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,280
Ehh, said G. Miguelomaniac.

168
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,380
Ehh, said G. Miguelomaniac.

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,440
Ehh, said G. Miguelomaniac.

170
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,860
May I? May I continue here?

171
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,400
You and all the other Sub G. M-e-g-l-o-r-o-d.

172
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,040
Now we can have a nice show.

Yeah, man, this is the nicest show we're ever going to have.

174
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,660
You know, millions of years ago, these funny looking big reptile type things roamed the earth.

175
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:06,740
many many many many years ago always crazy they had great big horns

176
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:18,200
the longer dog was 72 feet long its tiny brain was half the size of a woman

177
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,280
but it possessed a spinal enlargement which could do differential calculus and solve problems in advanced physics

178
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,660

217
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,660
Oh, you're listening to the Church of the New Faith.

220
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,840
But praise the Church of the New Faith.

221
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Fine preachers there, but they can't shut me up because to fool the pink, you see, to fool the pink.

222
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,000
Let's meditate upon this.

223
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
To fool the pink.

224
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:17,140
One must be able to adopt the disguise, a certain disguise, a variation, let's say, on the masks of insanity,

225
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,620
as read about in your pamphlet, number one, and book, number one.

226
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,740
Assume whatever guise is necessary.

227
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,040
To fool the pink who thinks that you're serving it.

228
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,800
Now, you know just what it takes.

229
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,160
You know what it's going to take to make them think that you're catering to their every whim.

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,740
It takes a keen perception to pinpoint just what that whim is.

231
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:50,440
And you just show just enough eccentricity that they think you're not hiding anything, see, or being a sycophant.

232
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,820
This is all part of the zen of corporalism.

233
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,480
It's not just being a culprit, but kissing.

234
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,120
To show just enough abnormality that they think you're being real upfront and honest with them.

235
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,100
That's the idea anyway.

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:13,200
Because if it's a rogue, unsaved subgenius you're dealing with, you're applying for a job with an unsaved subgenius,

237
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,280
they'll see right through it.

238
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,240
And that reminds me, I was driving by an old fill-in station the other day, and it made me think,

239
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,220
you know, the first mega fist temple lodge here in Dallas?

240
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,840
It shouldn't just be a little building like, you know, it is.

241
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:41,460
It should be more like a UFO shaped, you know, like those restaurants that you see in Los Angeles that are shaped like UFOs.

242
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:51,160
That's the kind of building that, but with that sort of combination Jetsons and Rosicrucian ornate designs upon it.

243
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,400
That's what I've always thought of.

244
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:00,220
the first mega fist temple lodge to be and where are your pledges where are your pledges i asked

245
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:07,060
your friends because you know without them without them pledges why this radio station can't keep

246
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:14,420
this ministry the word of bob as preached by your pastor reverend i've been staying that's me talking

247
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:21,580
and i'm asking you dear friends to get them pledges on in now i know you you felt in your

248
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,840
heart the faith the faith that you would pay the station later on but now you must do the acts

249
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:40,140
you see that the acts of actually writing that check because friends we only turn the cheek

250
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:48,840
one time uh in the when when they edited the bible they cut the part where jesus said

251
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,560
uh and then if he said

252
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:59,320
slaps you again said jesus then flay him alive in front of his wife and family they cut stuff like

253
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:06,060
that uh the the early christians did for reasons that have probably seem obvious to us now but

254
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:13,420
the truth is as it said in the gospel of john the other john that jesus has a child he was like the

255
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:21,500
kid in the twilight zone that could kill anybody by magic and uh in the book of john it said the

256
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:29,040
young it tells we've told the story on previous uh ministry uh state show broadcast here that uh

257
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,080
the young jesus was into killing his playmates and teachers he didn't know any better he was

258
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,820
just learning to be a messiah and it was the same was and he would fly he could fly jesus had powers

259
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,460
of flight he could fly around and cast spells like a sorcerer this is all in the nag hamadi text and

260
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,960
you can go you can buy it at the bookstore

261
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,340
the flying

262
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:59,840
jesus the super jesus dear friends but the early gospels of bob are surprisingly similar as we find

263
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:07,100
in the chapter under the bad magic of the young sorcerer bob of flying the site just like the

264
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:16,520
sorcerer jesus the child bob would fly and get into robbing banks dear friends uh his mother

265
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,300
said told the senate subcommittee when they

266
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,560
angered

267
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:28,560
him that wasn't her exact words but when people angered him she said they would suddenly drop dead

268
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:36,720
and die i quote from the commission report there a horrible grisly death friends that happened to

269
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:45,120
his teachers praise bob paper cut to death one was it's like when he'd pray when bob would pray

270
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,480
for his teacher or a boss to die well bob was just so lucky it would happen

271
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
that way

272
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,080
where did bob do that

273
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,080


274
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:05,060

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,560
Dear Lord, kill all who do not believe.

315
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,220
Kill wretched.

316
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,060
Kill crack users.

317
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,940
Kill long-haired, maggot-infested children

318
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,240

Satan, kill your children.

321
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,060
Lord, help us deal with the death

322
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,880
and the discrimination of the forces of evil.

323
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,960
I pray.

324
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,600
Die, all heathens, I pray.

325
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,780
Please, Lord, help us in our war against Satan.

326
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,060
Kill. Die.

327
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,360

Kill Satan.

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,120
Die for God.

330
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,720
Can't you see what's happening?

331
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,660
Conspiracy.

332
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,260
A secret battle, a war on God.

333
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,680
But no, a war on Satan.

334
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,520
They're killing Christians.

335
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,540
They're killing blacks.

336
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,780
God, they will kill whites.

337
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,560
They kill Jews.

338
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,400
They kill Muslims.

339
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,200
They kill Ori and Elves and Malawis.

340
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,520
They are the children who smoke crack

341
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,500
and then they go ahead and kill and rape in their gangs.

342
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,560
These little heathens.

343
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,840
Die.

344
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,720
Kill for Christ.

345
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,800
Guys, our general, the battle is our battle plan.

346
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,340
Should we be giving away our tactics to the enemy?

347
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:45,600
No.

348
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,060
Kill heathens.

349
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,160
If you are having fun, then you are sinning, you heathen.

350
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,140
Pleasure is the root of all evil.

351
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,620
Here, Satan's arson on his bed to capture your soul.

352
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,320
Do I ever swallow my gun and blow my head off

353
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
to get you heathens to listen?

354
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,120
The Lord God Almighty is great and should be feared.

355
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,480
Christ would do a double flip over his cross.

356
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,780
Lust for death.

357
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,660
Fear is wrath.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,640
Fear for love.

359
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,360
Fear pleasure.

360
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,320
Have you ever been so angry at someone

361
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,420
that you just wanted to,

362
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,140
or you didn't know what to do?

363
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,040
Provence, wet creed.

364
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,280
Reattach.

365
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,160
Freshly purchased.

366
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,620
Freshly sharpened, rather.

367
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,580
The money to purchase.

368
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,320
Sawtooth.

369
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,940
Boxing for Boeing 747.

370
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,860
Angular curled saw blade and

371
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,740
chug-a-lot down the middle of the crotch

372
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,520
to let them fall off.

373
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,960
If you're Japanese pick up Trumpet.

374
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,480
למש

375
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,460
God, you know what?

376
00:21:59,600 --> 00:21:59,980
You.

377
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,060
Don't stick your nose in here.

378
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,760
Yeah, go away.

379
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,840
The world monetary system will be completely revamped.

380
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
The way trading is done in the stock market will change.

381
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Cash will disappear.

382
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,340
We use plastic cards and the barter system for everything.

383
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,280
Unexpected people from nontraditional backgrounds will pop up as world leaders.

384
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,260
The world will be destabilized until 1995.

385
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,620
Which means more of everything from quakes to revolution.

386
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,340
Sir, Mr. Paucus, this is genetics.

387
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,200
You know, not all mutations are created equal.

388
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,020
Oh, new recruit?

389
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,680
Call any time.

390
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm ready for the quiz now.

391
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,860
What now?

392
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,680
You'll just have to wait in line with the other...

393
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,960
I have to wait another five minutes?

394
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,260
Don't bite your pencil.

395
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
Now just stand over there.

396
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,060
Keep your hands out of your pockets.

397
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,420
Just stand still and we'll get to you in just a minute.

398
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,860
But, but, but...

399
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:25,360
A severed thumb that turned up in the stomach of a lake trout has been traced to its owner, Mike Pachuca.

400
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,940
The Sweetwater County coroner said Thursday that he had confirmed that the thumb belonged to...

401
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,840
...a few-year-old Robert Dobbs, a policeman.

402
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,660
Psycho-lysmic trauma.

403
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,340
It was shot in February.

404
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,320
...shows similarities with the experiences of soldiers and others.

405
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,340
The Dobbs said he had lost his father next to the road near Boating.

406
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,720
The crowds look menacing.

407
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,640
A car backfired spring day.

408
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,580
There's a flaming asphalt tire fire south of Green River.

409
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
July 2nd.

410
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,420
Later from the alley.

411
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,940
July 26th.

412
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:09,720
The fingers, removed from the fish's belly, were found and reattached by dexterous surgeons on Dexagene.

413
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,960
Question number one.

414
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,860
You know, it's not...

415
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,380
Yeah, that's right, baby.

416
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,260
It's not a radio show.

417
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,420
It's a map.

418
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,480
But don't get it confused with the territory.

419
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,460
Don't get Bob confused with the dots.

420
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,040
Uh...

421
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:32,980
Bob...

422
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,360
Yeah, friends, it's okay, it's okay, though.

423
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,980
But because of the way I live, one of the dear listeners called in a little while ago and said,

424
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,940
Reverend Stang, could you give me the number of the Church of the New Faith again?

425
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,080
And, you know, I can't.

426
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,940
I can't because I don't have it on paper.

427
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,520
It was just on that one tape.

428
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,220
But...

429
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,880
You know, you can find out what anything is.

430
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,040
But...

431
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,580
And it's not just a tape.

432
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:02,640


433
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,680
You can find out what something is by writing to Bob.

434
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,420
We're going to give you a post office box number that you can write to that'll actually

435
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,440
put you in touch with J.R. Bob Dobbs.

436
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,560
You can ask him personally.

437
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,400
Well, maybe one of his secretaries might have to deal with it if he's too busy.

438
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,320
But we'll tell you those addresses, all kinds of things you might want to know.

439
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,740
Here comes that post office box number.

440
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,000
I bet you've got that pencil ready now.

441
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,500
That's...

442
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:45,160
Yeah, we'll just address that to Bob at post office box 140306.

443
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,260
Ah, yes.

444
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,800
In Dallas, Texas.

445
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,680
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

446
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,980
Zip code 75214.

447
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,820
Ah, yes, yes.

448
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,000
And something good.

449
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,240
Good, good, good will be coming your way.

450
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,880
Any...

451
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:16,000
Why, when we get to side two of this radio ministry broadcast, why, oh, it just tickles

452
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,020
my soul gland to think about it.

453
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,940
I'm going to express that gland.

454
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm going to try to do it right here on the air.

455
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,180
But stockpile those weapons, friends, like we were saying.

456
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,940
Uh...

457
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,000
We're going to try to bring you the specifics of the hardware.

458
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,360
And next week we'll have a special section on the subgenius women's weapons of choice.

459
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:47,760
Because you're going to need to know how to administer justice after X day in case you're

460
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,460
still stuck on this planet.

461
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,220
If the men from Planet X don't rupture you up.

462
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,760
Just in case you aren't one of the first ones up, I should say.

463
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,820
I mean, every...

464
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,480
You will.

465
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,440
I mean, if you, uh, you know, have your subgenius membership card.

466
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Certainly, I'm...

467
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,780
I can't see how the X's would mess anything up.

468
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,620
I mean, they're like unto gods and all.

469
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,600
But say there was a slight delay.

470
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,620
And you were left behind for a short time.

471
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,840
And you might not have to know how to apply justice in your clan or, or, or neighborhood.

472
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,380
Your little warlord community there after the end times have climaxed.

473
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,200
So we're going to...

474
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,160
Uh, be publishing in the stark fist of removal newsletter.

475
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,000
So, where the arsenals in our country are.

476
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,520
Real maps to the arsenals.

477
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,200
Shortest routes.

478
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,460
Evacuation modes.

479
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,900
And arsenal storming techniques.

480
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:50,460
So that the true subgenius warrior of the faith will know how to get that information,

481
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,500
shall we say.

482
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
And where to place those nuclear weapons.

483
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,380
Strategy A.

484
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,940
Strategy B.

485
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Strategy C.

486
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,620
Strategy D.

487
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,600
Strategy E.

488
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,140
Strategy E.

489
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,540
Strategy F.

490
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:02,700
Strategy E.

491
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:02,700


492
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,160
Strategy T.

493
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


494
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,820
Strategy F.

495
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:09,820


496
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,040
Strategy T.

497
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,040
Strategy F.

498
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,200
Strategy T.

499
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,200


500
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,400
Strategy式

501
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,900
Strategy X.

502
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:14,700
Strategy Y.

503
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,420
Strategyitudine.

504
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,700
Strategy PRX.

505
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,760
StECTA.

506
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,880
Federation, come and land.

507
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,220
They're donut-shaped, you know,

508
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,000
and they'll stack up on the Washington Monument,

509
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,640
the big one first and then the next biggest one and like that,

510
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,980
like one of those baby's toys,

511
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,980
only not exactly correctly,

512
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,500
and they'll form a shape that opens the gateway

513
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,300
for, shall it be the Exists

514
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,940
or the Yakatizma, the Wyists

515
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,160
or even the Zists.

516
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,980
Well, I'll tell you what I'm hoping for,

517
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,400
the pleasure goddesses, friends.

518
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,400
Of course, I know that you're with me on that too.

519
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,480
I feel like I'm with you today on this show,

520
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,740
tonight, I should say.

521
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,200
I feel like I'm perceiving the unsullied truth tonight

522
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,060
with no subjective bias.

523
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,740
At all.

524
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,120
Ah, yes.

525
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,320
And although the believers are calling in,

526
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,660
Will is counseling those young Bobbyettes.

527
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,540
And friends, we've reached the end of side one of our show.

528
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,640
Let's switch to some lovely, relaxing music here

529
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,960
while we prepare to go to side two

530
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,060
of your subgenius radio ministry,

531
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,320
Hour of Slack.

532
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,620
Ah, yes.

533
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,120
Here on lovely radio station

534
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,660
in beautiful...

535
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,300
Praise these wonderful partner stations.

536
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,680
By the way, the script of the live portion of this show

537
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,780
was carefully prepared into exacting specifications

538
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,220
by Dr. Philo Drummond,

539
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,140
over man, first degree, second authorized mega fist temple lodge,

540
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,160
St. Louis, Missouri,

541
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,160
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

542
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,440
the sacred scribe number 273, copyright 1992.

543
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,680
This is show number 333.

544
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,120
Praise Bob.

545
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,260
And에도 D contained the K lacks.

546
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,260


547
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,540
we're bad.

548
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,180
Can't erase who,

549
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:09,960
We

550
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,680
never know.

551
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,640
coming this summer.

552
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,060
The stupid to end all in stupid.

553
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,820
Dr. Brown.

554
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,480
When the Jocas after me.

555
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,660
I know,

556
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,260
No, put me in the time machine.

557
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,260
You'll never find me in the future.

558
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,660
Please put me in the time machine.

559
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,140
Hey, what are you doing here? This is my sequel.

560
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,280
What are you talking about? This is my sequel.

561
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,440
I'm afraid you're both wrong, gentlemen.

562
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,940
This is my sequel.

563
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,480
Who Framed Roger Robocop in the Future Part 3.

564
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,160
You know what they say about summer movies.

565
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,960
Summer movies, some aren't.

566
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,420
And now, another great John F. Kennedy moment in history.

567
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,260
The year is 1827.

568
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,480
The place, Berlin, Germany.

569
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,500
Composer Ludwig von Beethoven meets with his mistress in her boudoir.

570
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,080
My liebchen, aren't you going to take off your dress for Ludwig?

571
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,680
I can't.

572
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,320
Why not?

573
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
I too.

574
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,080
Wait a minute. There's somebody under your dress.

575
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,160
Come out of there, you schweinhund.

576
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,140
Ask not what your country can do for you.

577
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,120
Ask what you can do for your country.

578
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,200
Who are you?

579
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,100
Ich bin ein Berliner.

580
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,180
Baloney, you are no Berliner.

581
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,740
You're that sneaky John F. Kennedy.

582
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,800
Get out, you sex maniac.

583
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,440
No, I can explain.

584
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,320
Get out und stay out.

585
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,180
I can explain this.

586
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,860
This has been another John F. Kennedy great moment in history.

587
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,880
Willa Dobbs, if you haven't heard his story,

588
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,480
you haven't heard...

589
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,960
The whole story.

590
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,440
Ha, ha, ha.

591
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,680
That was...

592
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,020
Yeah.

593
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,100
And...

594
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,760
Well, of course, I guess I've been talking kind of roundabout.

595
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,160
But what we wanted to get...

596
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:18,420
Well, one of the subjects, the main focus of this particular branch of the subject we were on, dear friends,

597
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,080
is understanding the ancient...

598
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,220
heritage of the Yeti.

599
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,780
Of, uh...

600
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,960
Of Mutantus.

601
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,540
The Yetis of Mutantus.

602
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,340
Uh, well, now, wait a minute.

603
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm not gonna...

604
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,760
I just, I don't want to hear that same old background music again.

605
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,640
That's just...

606
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,020
I've heard that a million times.

607
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,780
I got preaching to do here.

608
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,000
I...

609
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,580
What's some...

610
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,720
I need to sharpen this up here.

611
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,500
If I turn up my own head...

612
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:52,640
If I turn up my own head...

613
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
You turn up your own headphones, don't you?

614
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,400
This is a preacher technique.

615
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,820
You turn up your own headphones, it makes you feel more powerful.

616
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,480
Which is all that really counts.

617
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,940
The, uh...

618
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,140
That the enthusiasm become delirious.

619
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,120
But as we were saying...

620
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,880
Now...

621
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,120
You've heard, of course, of...

622
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,460
Mu...

623
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,640
And Atlantis...

624
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,640
And Lemuria...

625
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,800
And these various, you know, new agey...

626
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,520
Things.

627
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,900
And there actually was a...

628
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,600
Uh...

629
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,560
Mu was the human name of, uh...

630
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,820
This continent.

631
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,840
Now, it's not exactly the same as Gondwana land.

632
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,000
Now, if you'll, uh...

633
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,020
If you've studied your history...

634
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:39,780
Uh...

635
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,760
Pre-creationist history...

636
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,660
Uh...

637
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,480
You would, uh...

638
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,040
Know that Gondwana land was the, uh...

639
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,640
The land before the continent separated, you see.

640
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,720
You would know about continental drift and all that.

641
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,100
Before the...

642
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,620
The...

643
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:52,620


644
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,960
There was North America and South America and Africa and Asia and...

645
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,780
It was all like one chunk.

646
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,700
Okay.

647
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,720
And here there were yetis.

648
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,140
There was all this land.

649
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,960
But then...

650
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,760
With the plate tectonics, things split up some.

651
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,320
Okay, so...

652
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,560
But they were connected.

653
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,800
Interconnected still.

654
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,200
But...

655
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,620
But...

656
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,280
Oceans where there ain't none.

657
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,900
There was all this land there which sunk.

658
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,860
And the present...

659
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,600
It was like a negative of the way the world looks now.

660
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,160
There was...

661
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,560
There was land where the ocean...

662
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,140
Ocean is now...

663
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,500
An ocean where the land is now.

664
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,980
And the present continents popped up into place.

665
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,560
And the old continent...

666
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,940
Sunk.

667
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,700
And this is sort of like the Earth's breathing.

668
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,500
It's like a continental seesaw that happens over millions of years.

669
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,020
And it will happen again...

670
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:39,900
Soon.

671
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,300
So there is...

672
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,980
On top...

673
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,760
Besides this, there is continental drift.

674
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,320
But that's more like the solar winds...

675
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,380
Kind of blowing the scum across the top of the pond.

676
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,040
If you know what I mean.

677
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,560
Where it shifts and breaks up.

678
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,680
It's...

679
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,040
It's at least as much a result of the solar wind.

680
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,000
According to subgenius...

681
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Forbidden sciences.

682
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,580
As it is due to the sub-tectonic magma currents.

683
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,900
Which, of course, they study in secular high schools and such like.

684
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,120
But I get behind myself, you might say, here.

685
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,860
The Yetis.

686
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,080
The original Yetis.

687
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,120
What...

688
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,180
The...

689
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,620
The last...

690
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,360
I guess you'd say the only full-blood Yetis now...

691
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,820
Would be the so-called Bigfoot or Sasquatch.

692
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,120
Known to the American wilderness.

693
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,160
The Yetis is their name, of course, in the Himalayas.

694
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,880
In Tibet.

695
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,200
Where Bob escaped to after that time in Burma.

696
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,880
That prisoner of war camp in Japan.

697
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,280
But...

698
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,860
Don't want to get ahead of myself too much on that one.

699
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,980
Now you know that story.

700
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,020
The Yetis lived upon that lost continent of ancient times...

701
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,820
In faraway days called Mutantis.

702
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
And there...

703
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,960
Of course, the Yetis were invented by the Exists, as you know.

704
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,780
But the Yetis, in turn, invented for themselves beasts of burden.

705
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,900
Which we know as humans.

706
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,780
The common human was invented 80 million years ago...

707
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,640
In a test tube by the Yetis of Mutantis.

708
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,040
Now, the original name of the humans...

709
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,080
It's an unusual...

710
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,560
It's a...

711
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,040
Weegor.

712
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Weegor.

713
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,020
U-I-G-H-U-R-S.

714
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,840
Okay?

715
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,260
Weegors.

716
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,480
Who escaped...

717
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,580
The...

718
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,740
From the Yetis.

719
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,540
And in fact, after the...

720
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,840
I hesitate to call it the fall of the Yetis.

721
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,840
But the accident, shall we say.

722
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,040
The Weegor Empire was the largest colonial empire...

723
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,900
Belonging to Mutantis.

724
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,120
The Empire of the Sun.

725
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,380
It stretched from the Pacific Ocean...

726
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,960
Where the Pacific Ocean is now...

727
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,920
To where Moscow is now.

728
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,960
And these Weegors...

729
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,580
Were the beginning of the true Aryan races.

730
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,620
The milk-white skin and the blue eyes.

731
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,360
And during the...

732
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,180
The Pleistocene...

733
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,100
After the Empire of the Yetis were destroyed...

734
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,020
These devolved creatures...

735
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,040
After the Yeti...

736
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,140
Creators...

737
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,000
Were destroyed in the Great Magnetic Cataclysm...

738
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,020
And the raising of the...

739
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,500
Of the mountains.

740
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,720
The survivors...

741
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,920
Those Weegors...

742
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,980
Formed settlements across Europe...

743
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,520
In tertiary times.

744
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,740
And the old friends...

745
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,100
Low 50 feet beneath...

746
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,440
The Gobi Desert...

747
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,000
Lay the ruins of...

748
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,080
Karakota.

749
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,260
Now Bob got all this from the Nakao records...

750
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,080
When he was in the hands of the Tibetan Llamas.

751
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,920
These sacred...

752
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,080
Sacred scrolls.

753
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,340
That tell of...

754
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,180
The...

755
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,720
Because...

756
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,040
Well let's look at our book of the subgenius...

757
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,720
Volume 2...

758
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,600
Here...

759
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,000
If you know...

760
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You ain't...

761
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,620
You ain't...

762
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,140
You ain't nodding on me are ya?

763
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,620
Now I can see a few heads starting to nod out there.

764
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,840
Hey I know your collection plate's gonna be coming around to wake you up.

765
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,100
Don't you be worried about that.

766
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,840
I'm not...

767
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,900
I ain't...

768
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,480
Demanding total attention.

769
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,440
I ain't getting it.

770
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,900
I ain't wanting it.

771
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,560
You're allowed to daydream and dream up your own...

772
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,700
I know you're gonna come up with some...

773
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,260
Some strange...

774
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,380
Strange interpretations for what I say.

775
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,440
People read the strangest things into the word of Bob.

776
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,100
They just...

777
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,760
The kookiest, nuttiest things.

778
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
You take a simple concept like the...

779
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,540
The um...

780
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,060
The...

781
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,120
These escapees from the exes...

782
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,300
The yeti test tube in Atlantis.

783
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,960
And they'll take something simple like that and just make this kooky, nutty...

784
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,640
You know that's...

785
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
But you know how religionists are friends.

786
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,220
You know how these fundamentalist nuts...

787
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,740
Subject...

788
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,340
Look, Bob preserves from subgenius...

789
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,900
Kooks.

790
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,520
But um...

791
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,780
Well...

792
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,820
Well...

793
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,040
Well, let's...

794
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,060
Let's go back...

795
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,240
In...

796
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,240
To these revivals of ancient date and see what the old covenant men had to say.

797
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,260
Let's make love under the stars.

798
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,800
And watch for UFOs.

799
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,300
If little baby Martians...

800
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,720
Come out of the UFOs...

801
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,600
And **** them...

802
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,500
Yeah...

803
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,600
Yeah...

804
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,400
The zebra spilled its plasticine on Venus...

805
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,280
And the gels and fingers whose electric harbors...

806
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,420
Ramona's ****...

807
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,000
Died in hell...

808
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,520
And the Nazis want to kill...

809
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,520
To kill everyone...

810
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,940
Oh, sweet...

811
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,540
Um...

812
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,660
Just let me know when it's...

813
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,060
Let me know...

814
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,760
Let me know when it's...

815
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,180
No, mean, just...

816
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,120
Your наших investment...

817
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,000
Let my help...

818
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:19,820
Show that Curiosity is very...

819
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,880
so

820
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:46,640
when the broke fan made the world the earth was the woman and the sky was the man and the sky man

821
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:59,920
man came down upon the earth woman and the world in the beginning was pure lake covered with bull

822
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:12,960
rushes and when gabrog fran had killed neither bob and formed man man from the dung and blood

823
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
he then made woman

824
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:26,160
and the earth woman out of rattlesnakes and tarantulas and they came together and made man

825
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:39,860
woman and man man and that is why there are four sexes today man man woman woman man woman and woman

826
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,100
man when there were villages

827
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,460
there was an ancient wicked and wicked saying god will bestow his kingdom as king

828
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:00,460


829
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:00,940
until mud came from aotic rocks and

830
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:00,940


831
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,100
survived its collapse the world the earth was a ravzięked forest it is not

832
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,280
anyone who did not fight for man only hope made the world Kim and Chimney did notном

833
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,320
cow il

834
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:26,800
monsters grew fast and became very strange. They hurt others. They upset huts. They befouled the

835
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,140
people's food. A wise man who could see things in his mind which had not yet happened said,

836
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:44,500
kill these strange bad things before they kill you. And so the people went and killed the bad

837
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:52,920
things. But that was never the end for the subgenius men came and killed man, man, and woman,

838
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,700
man, and man, woman, and woman, woman.

839
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:34,660
Such religious patterns. The Church of the Subgenius is an esoteric organization,

840
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:42,620
a secret lodge or cult whose members lurk just outside of the comfortable circle of the firelight.

841
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,240
Well, um, customer service. My birthday was wonderful. We had the performing elephants,

842
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,900
dancing girls, uh, Androcles and the lion, uh, just about everything that you can imagine. It

843
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:06,220
was all wrapped up into one bundle of scrumptious fun. Unfortunately, I was sick to my stomach and

844
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:13,540
missed it. Oh, that's right now ongoing. Yes. But, uh, um, well,

845
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm going on right on the show here.

846
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,200
Oh, no.

847
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,580
Oh, no.

848
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,240
Get out of here.

849
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,180
Come on, come on.

850
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,120
As a general rule, in evaluating your listening situation,

851
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,820
you should stand in front of the speaker an equal distance from each speaker.

852
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,600
Lord God is the greatest power, General of all.

853
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:52,040
He said, take the art of the covenant. Let the priest carry the horns of battle, delivering the march against Satan, Joshua 6.

854
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,980
Because the priest must take us into battle and make it holy.

855
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,260
The spiritual well-being of our nation is more important now than ever.

856
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,840
For the time is near when the sharring of flesh and the gnashing of teeth is coming.

857
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,100
No, but we have, uh, you know what I did find was a piece of footage with, uh,

858
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,840
Pee Wee Herman and President Kennedy in 1963.

859
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,240
Oh, that's why they're changing all the coins.

860
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:15,940
Yeah.

861
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,520
I don't think you understand this, young man.

862
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,840
Ann Bertha, who gave you the headphones?

863
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,340
You're not supposed to have any of this radio stuff at this hour.

864
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,620
If you put one nail in my hand, you'll have to nail the other.

865
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,420
The other what?

866
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,780
Oh, my.

867
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,520
Nasty young man.

868
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,760
But if he would have been an octopus, that would have been really terrible to nail him.

869
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,380
Well, it would have taken eight nails.

870
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,260
More arms than an octopus.

872
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,700
He was all over you.

873
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,820
We've been to that show.

874
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


875
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


876
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


877
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


878
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:42,820


879
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,080
We've been to that show before.

880
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,700
I don't understand you.

881
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,040
You're just a satanic evil.

882
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,280
My God, customer service is still hanging on.

883
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,400
No, satiric.

884
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,580
It's level.

885
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,880
I'm still hanging in there.

886
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,040
It's pretty sad.

887
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,780
Not satanic.

888
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,400
See, that's, it's an old mimeograph machine gets smudged.

889
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,840
It's not satanic and evil.

890
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,700
It's satirical and...

891
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,400
I would if I could, but...

892
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,740
I love Ann Bertha.

893
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,280
Jesus Christ.

894
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,320
Less than half an hour ago, I shot 50 cc's of Ann Bertha.

895
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,240
Nailed it.

896
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,140
Still back.

897
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,660
Done.

898
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,680
I don't understand.

899
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,540
Put her away.

900
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,360
I don't even know.

901
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,520
I'll put her behind you.

902
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:12,820
That's it.

903
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,100
That's it.

904
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,900
Professor Dyer.

905
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,140
And Martha, would you like to go home, dear?

906
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,240
Oh, Jesus doesn't like this show.

907
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,060
He was your fornicator and masturbator and...

908
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,800
Now, Ann Bertha, just take a stress pill and calm down.

909
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,100
I just need...

910
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,580
Think of beautiful thoughts, like me.

911
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,340
No, Jesus had the submarine earlier.

912
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,700
That was in the first 15 minutes of the show.

913
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,120
It's what they call the Jesus wheel.

914
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
It keeps the rover of the submarine from...

915
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,760
Is she still in her strengths, Ann Bertha?

916
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,200
It was just...

917
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:42,660
Okay, yeah.

918
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,840
She's in the rubber room now, being chastised by Sven and Newt, our overeager bodyguards.

919
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,300
I need a mouth or something.

920
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,040
I need...

921
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,420
I need a headache.

922
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,080
You and me too, sister.

923
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,380
I think Ann Bertha's...

924
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,280
I think something's happening down there.

925
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,220
Here come the cops.

926
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,440
I can't do it.

927
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,960
I just nailed it.

928
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,260
What's happening down there?

929
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:05,920
Look at the monitor.

930
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,500
Ann Bertha's swelling up.

931
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,480
I...

932
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,180
dreamed of getting in there.

933
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,260
My

934
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:41,740
I therefore praise these gentlemen who know and show both the how and when.

935
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,680
Oh, thank you so much, Captain.

936
00:48:48,720 --> 00:49:00,220
Ah, yeah, it feels so good, so good, good, good to be in the spirit again, you know,

937
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:06,500
because, oh, it's like, it's like love between those yetis.

938
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,680
You know, a couple of yetis getting together.

939
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,380
It wouldn't, back in them days, oh, they'd do things you can't even imagine.

940
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:22,580
But it was, because it wasn't just like chemistry between, like, a couple of yetis,

941
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,040
like it would be between, say, you and your beloved.

942
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,780
It would be more like electrochemistry

943
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,120
with a bunch of quantum,

944
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,500
quantum physics thrown in, because they, you know, when they get going,

945
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,020
they just pour back and forth, dear friends, kind of exploding together

946
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,600
in these echoing shiver rushes,

947
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:47,520
where one could literally feel just exactly what the other one felt

948
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,480
when they touched each other, sort of a sensory telepathy,

949
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:57,100
a supernaturally, a mutual anticipation, dear friends,

950
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,740
of each other's desire.

951
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,760
So passion choice from moment to moment,

952
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,760
and that's what religion is all about,

953
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,820
because religion evolved, as we see here,

954
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,340
in Prescripture 719, from magic,

955
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,920
simple, primordial magic, sympathetic,

956
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,540
you got your sympathetic magic,

957
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,540
you got your associative magic,

958
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,400
you know, basically, trying to influence one's environment,

959
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:28,220
you see, by hoping, in a formalized enough way,

960
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,060
that's all it is.

961
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,600
You know, that's all praying is.

962
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:36,880
You're trying to change the world around you just by hoping in a fancied-up way, if it's fancied up enough.

963
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,600
And see, back in the old days in the times of the pre-men,

964
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:50,880
say by chance one day the drought ended after the neighbor's kid died.

965
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:57,060
So you'd think, well, maybe the next drought might be stopped by killing the neighbor's next kid.

966
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,120
You know, they go, remember that time Jones got killed and it didn't flood?

967
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,280
Well, by gobs, we'll kill a Jones every year and it'll never flood.

968
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,060
We never liked that Jones clan anyway.

969
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,300
That's the way it works.

970
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,140
But then one is forced to question.

971
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,460
One is forced to ask.

972
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:26,660
Are, therefore, the teachings of Bob nothing but a misguided, overly complicated form of associative magic and wishful thinking?

973
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:26,920
Well.

974
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:35,920
My friends, it is, but it's a guided, not misguided, it's a guided overly complicated form of associative magic and wishful thinking.

975
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,180
So why would it be any different from the false religions, you would ask?

976
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,480
Because, my friends, it is based on true magic.

977
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,620
True magic.

978
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,480
True prophecy.

979
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:51,920
Not just stupid inferences like some of these other, you know, prophetic, so-called prophetic churches.

980
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,580
And what of proof?

981
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,640
See, we're wrapping it all up here.

982
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,040
We got it.

983
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,340
We got it all figured out.

984
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,040
You ask any subgenius, there be your proof.

985
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:10,160
It'll tell you a million examples what Bob has done, what Bob, my friends, has done, and it would, that were like magic.

986
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,360
Things that were like magic.

987
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,080
Like when the child Bob would pray for his enemies to die.

988
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,960
Ah, yes.

989
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:27,020
You know, the Druids found that if a woman went out into a field and plowed or even just pretended to plow,

990
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,980
that it would rain.

991
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,640
As if to say, see God, we're plowing.

992
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,380
We're out here plowing, God.

993
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,220
Hint, hint.

994
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,500
Get the picture, God.

995
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:35,720
See?

996
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,820
Then it would rain.

997
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,020
Now, by the same token today, when we go out and spend credit card money we don't have,

998
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,060
we're doing the same thing.

999
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,920
We're going, see God?

1000
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,120
See God?

1001
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,500
We're using the credit card.

1002
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,420
You can grant us prosperity now.

1003
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,380
We spent, we used the money.

1004
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,380
You can give us the real money now that we spent the credit card.

1005
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,220
But there's endless arguments, you know, about the faith.

1006
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,860
It's like a big stupid soap opera.

1007
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:12,680
But that makes me think of that time in the myth, the myth of the olden Bob,

1008
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:18,960
where it said when the Lord Bob, and this was the way they would do it in covenant days,

1009
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:26,040
when the Lord Bob entered his palaces, which were perfect to the fullest extent,

1010
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:35,800
his 1,000, 188,109 queens rejoiced within their minds to see their husband home.

1011
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:44,680
They leapt, leaped from the meditation seats, and as was socially customary,

1012
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,300
covered their faces shyly and looked about coyly.

1013
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm reading Masterson's text here.

1014
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,720
Their insuperable ecstasy was so strong.

1015
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,880
They first embraced the Lord Bob in their innermost recesses of their hearts.

1016
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,400
That was the first thing they did.

1017
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,640
Just embraced him with their hearts, their innermost hearts.

1018
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,180
Then they embraced him with their outermost hearts.

1019
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,260
Then they embraced him visually.

1020
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,800
See, up to that point, they didn't dare even look at him.

1021
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,680
They were so happy to see him home.

1022
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,760
They'd worked their way up through it.

1023
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,160
Then they'd send their sons to embrace him.

1024
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,020
But they still weren't embracing him, see?

1025
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,380
Of course, there's 188,000 of them.

1026
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,460
And finally, after the sons had all embraced Bob,

1027
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,720
then, though they tried to restrain their feelings,

1028
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,780
the brides of Bob would shed tears.

1029
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,400
That was their final stage, you see.

1030
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,600
Don't you see?

1031
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:51,980
Because this was just before the good signs of the Zodiac had evolved.

1032
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,840
After the first Bob was born.

1033
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,480
And the wise men informed him that his first son, Bob,

1034
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,880
they said, in Prescripture 1719, they said,

1035
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,920
the wise men said,

1036
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,560
surely he is an Epops descendant.

1037
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,040
The Brahmanas said,

1038
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:17,080
this spotless son is restored by the all-powerful and all-persuasive Lord Vishnu,

1039
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,300
the personality of the Godhead,

1040
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,800
in order to oblige you, oblige you, see.

1041
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,660
And then Bob's unconsciousness now lapses in his consciousness.

1042
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,660
That is, his consciousness, his consciousness, I'm saying,

1043
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:33,580
lapses into unconsciousness of the undifferentiated cosmic life

1044
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,780
and uncovers the true significance of this Bob,

1045
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,120
this Bob whose numbers reveal that he is a life

1046
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,180
not yet entered into the process of evolution.

1047
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,800
In other words, by this standard, he is a pink, a pink.

1048
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,820
He falls asleep with his genitals uncovered, to use the biblical term.

1049
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,020
He is uncovered within his tent, as they say.

1050
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,360
He is suffering the plight of Noah,

1051
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,600
who said to himself,

1052
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,400
Darn it, Noah said.

1053
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,520
He said, you know, we got all these stinking animals on board.

1054
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,240
We can't clean up after them.

1055
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,780
Everybody's dead except us and these animals.

1056
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,700
I'm going to get drunk.

1057
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,700
I'm going to break into them casks full of grog.

1058
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,400
And Noah did that.

1059
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,880
And that's when, you know, they,

1060
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,360
and that boy found him and,

1061
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:25,320
and they punished him for, for finding him.

1062
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,160
Sent him away into Canaan, you see.

1063
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,960
And that's where the naked women and the lustfulness man

1064
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,960
and the head and the people being fried alive

1065
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,180
and the angel that keep the guy from being tempted

1066
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,160
on that woodcut, that's where they all come from.

1067
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,380
It's the land of, of Canaan, dear friends.

1068
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,540
Because we love to preach the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs here on the radio.

1069
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,000
We know that people who've just tuned into this show for the first time

1070
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,680
are getting an earful.

1071
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:55,940
They're hearing,

1072
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,300
they're hearing this preaching and they're going,

1073
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,420
finally.

1074
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,600
They're saying, I thought I was alone in the world.

1075
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,080
I thought I was the only one who thought thoughts like this.

1076
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,960
I thought I was the only one who had a Bob man.

1077
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,580
Because that's what you have, you know.

1078
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,760
You have, it's your Bob man that listens to this show with you.

1079
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,240
You have your spirit man, as Brother Tilton has told you about.

1080
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,300
But that's drunk most of the time.

1081
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,400
It's a fundamentalist Christian.

1082
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,580
Did you know that everyone, as part of their nental life,

1083
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:25,920
their nental life,

1084
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,420
not mental life.

1085
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,780
I trust you've been reading your book.

1086
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,220
Your nental life, your psychic self,

1087
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,400
the things standing behind you that they can't see.

1088
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,720
And neither can you or me, thank God, because they're so ugly.

1089
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,560
Your nental life has three parts.

1090
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,740
It has your conspiracy man, your spirit man, and your Bob man.

1091
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,780
Your spirit man on everybody is a fundamentalist Baptist Christian.

1092
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,700
Even on a Palestinian or an Israeli or Jewish fellow,

1093
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,920
he has a spirit man.

1094
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:55,920


1095
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,980
He's a spirit man that's a Baptist fundamentalist, a nut, old, crazy.

1096
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,600
I mean, not just regular Baptist.

1097
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,960
I mean, a crazy fundamentalist.

1098
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,980
But you see, friends, people get the wrong idea about the church.

1099
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,040
They think that we're making fun of those old characters, you know,

1100
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,440
those old preachers in their wooden cabin,

1101
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,700
preaching to that little congregation out in the backwoods.

1102
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,660
And we're not.

1103
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,100
That's not what we're doing.

1104
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,280
We're not trying to make fun of that.

1105
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,160
That feller.

1106
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,880
What we're trying to do is recapture that, friends, and take it back.

1107
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,900
We want to take it back.

1108
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,760
And that's another thing we've been talking about.

1109
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,820
We want to take fascism back from the conspiracy.

1110
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,720
We want to give fascism back to the people.

1111
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,400
Take it back from the way the conspiracy demeaned it

1112
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:52,360
and demeaned that preaching and turned it into Bob Tilton, friends.

1113
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,880
We're into real traditional family values.

1114
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,300
You know, a head-launching done properly.

1115
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:01,440
It's just like an old-time barn-raising with a square dance at the end

1116
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,700
to break in the old church.

1117
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,460
Oh, yes.

1118
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,660
Well, it looks like it's about time for us to get off the air.

1119
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,740
And I'm going to give that post office box number again

1120
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:16,480
that you can write to for free information on J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1121
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,300
the guru and high-epop, the saint of sales,

1122
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,180
and the living avatar of slack.

1123
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:22,980
Oh, yes.

1124
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,180
And we've been...

1125
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm preaching his word.

1126
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,340
I'm your preacher, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1127
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,460
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1128
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,220
And you can write to Bob at

1129
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,300
Post Office Box

1130
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,140
1-4-0-3-0-6

1131
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,900
Dallas, Texas

1132
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,680
7-5-2-1-4

1133
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,540
That's right.

1134
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,720
That's Bob at Box 1-4-0-3-0-6

1135
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,520
Dallas, Texas

1136
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,160
7-5-2-1-4

1137
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,380
Ah, yes.

1138
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,200
Praise Bob.

1139
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,260
And let's...

1140
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,460
Let there be slack.

1141
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,280
Bob, hear our plea.

1142
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,720
We beseech thee.

1143
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,240
Help us be free from normalcy.

1144
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,620
We're dumb, devoted, and dumb.

1145
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,760
Talk back.

1146
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,220
Please give us an hour of slack.

1147
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs never fails.

1148
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,800
He's the living slack master of mystic sales.

1149
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,600
All you conspiracy doofs.

1150
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,820
Just you wait.

1151
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,340
Till July the 5th, 1998.

1152
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,780
Invaders will come from Planet X

1153
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,260
Bringing gifts of money, time control, and great sex

1154
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,840
A new age will dawn and we'll never look back

1155
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,340
We'll be busy enjoying our slack

1156
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,840
Everybody now.

1157
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,320
Bob, hear our plea.

1158
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,840
We beseech thee.

1159
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,320
Help us be free from normalcy.

1160
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,000
We're dumb, devoted, and dumb.

1161
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,940
Talk back.

1162
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,400
Please give us an hour of slack.

1163
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,820
He's the bridge between heaven and earth and hell.

1164
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,240
He's the Patriot Saint of sales.

1165
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,940
Yeah, he's doing well.

1166
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,680
Media cretins are normals and things beware.

1167
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,780
The Slaves of Hell.

1168
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,140
Every word of this slackmaster sells everywhere.

1169
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,200
Give thanks to Bob.

1170
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,540
Give thanks to Bob.

1171
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:29,680
Give thanks to Bob.

1172
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,900
Our eternal hope.

1173
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,460
Praise be to her when you journey to hell.
