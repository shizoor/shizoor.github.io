00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
PR comes from a non-found-owners-proption.org.org.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,040
This is PR.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,880
This is PR.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,580
PR.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,980
It's PR with PR and PR in Pensacuspo.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,320
PR is with you.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,280
PR News and PR News.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm leaving Kansas City.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
PR News in Kansas City.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,360
Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy is swinging in the wrong direction.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,280
This country is committed.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,600
And we're committed by dedicating a lot of resources.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,560
This is PR News.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,020
PR News, Washington.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,820
Leaking led to the coal miners' methane gas flame this year.

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,860
Last spring, men's methane leaked out.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,860
The explosion that followed was so powerful, it ruptured miners in the explosion afterwards.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,380
The company has since abandoned PR News.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,840
New numbers at week's weakness, 3060, 1.7, 340, and 53.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,220
Bob's raising questions about PR News in Washington.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,900
I hear you singing in the waters.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,600
I can hear you through the subgenius power of smart.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,600
Oh!

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,980
Just like Chris Vinning.

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,620
I like it.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,700
Oh, sorry.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,680
I got a distinction.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,940
Me too.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,260
Oh, sorry.

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,300
Dude, Brian.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,300
That's not what I was thinking.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:32,740
Fancy.

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,600
Well, Bob Dobbs told me to pay attention

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:48,060
To the words of the subgenius church

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,480
Well, Bob Dobbs told me

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,720
To pay attention

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,940
Well, Bob Dobbs told me

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,080
Well, Bob Dobbs told me

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,380
To pay attention

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,740
Well, Bob Dobbs told me

41
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,880
To pay attention

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Well done.

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,300
We're gonna be doing a show somehow.

45
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,460
Show?

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
A little bit of a...

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,480
Like a...

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,700
Like a...

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,340
Like a show?

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,100
Oh, sh...

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,740
Hal's talking.

52
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,800
Is that Hal?

53
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,620
Pretty soon, an image will start to appear.

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,100
Sounds like Hal.

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,400
I think he's talking about Bob.

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,080
But he's mumbling about Bob.

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,120
Maybe one letter in the forms of time as the years descend gently upon you.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,060
Mumbling for Bob, baby.

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
The face in short.

60
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,820
Streaming through your life.

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,020
Nothing wrong with mumbling for Bob.

62
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,780
I am out of the world.

63
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:55,820
I'm out of the world.

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,820


65
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,820


66
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,820


67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,820


68
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,820


69
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,820


70
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,180
J.R.

71
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,200
Bob Dobbs.

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,060
The world's...

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,900
Truly...

74
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,140
Black and white.

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
Experimenting with the television set of his own design.

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,660
Messing around with the back of the set.

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,120
He received a tremendous shock in assisting...

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,020
A divine...

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Intellectual...

80
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,120
Social...

81
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,040
Ejaculation?

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,020
No, that can't be right.

83
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,320
Well, anyway, whatever it was, it was...

84
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,340
I gotta tell ya.

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,980
It was the basis of this whole thing.

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,880
This sub-genius thing we're always talking about.

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,800
You wanna know how it got into it?

88
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,800


89
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,800


90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,800


91
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
I started that, so it's got style.

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
Was that, was that thing?

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,320
This is a news minute.

94
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,580
Bush used dog beer last night.

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,200
Help, help, help.

96
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,420
And there's lots of it.

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,800
The FBI has nowhere to go.

98
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,340
President Netanyahu, President Netanyahu.

99
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,160
Bush is, he's in critical condition.

100
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,580
Behind bars Tuesday.

101
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,200
Crouching and dropping something.

102
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,460
State of the Union's soured so many.

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,920
An abortion from behind.

104
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,120
Give it a chance to work.

105
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,540
Give it a chance, give it a chance.

106
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,940
Inside a motel room.

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,260
Our citizens don't much care.

108
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,280
And so it remains the policy of this government,

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,660
to inspire blind hatred.

110
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Terrorist activity.

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,380
America's on the verge of violent and malignant ideology.

112
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,320
So we advance our own violent and malignant ideology.

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,180
And I say, come and kill us.

114
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
Don't much care, don't much care.

115
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,740
We need a new direction.

116
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,900
DNA testing.

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,860
Toxic substance.

118
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,560
Build up.

119
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,860
The war on terror we fight today is a chance for the millions of other Americans

120
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,400
who have no health insurance at all.

121
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,160
I've asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services

122
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,100
and their doctors on clean, safe nuclear power.

123
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,700
Tonight.

124
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,420
We must.

125
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,420
Junk work.

126
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,120
Madam, madam, madam, madam, madam, madam, madam, madam, madam,

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,020
President Cheney.

128
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,120
Dangers have ended.

129
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,640
Hard.

130
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,780
Spend the people's money.

131
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,580
And this is the business before us tonight.

132
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,020
Terrorism.

133
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,560
Now available online.

134
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,900
Conclusion.

135
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,400
The Iraq war has bred deep resentment among Muslims around the world.

136
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,000
And helped rally many to the cause of terrorism.

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,720
Iraq is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders.

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
My judgment is preposterous.

139
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,740
A sad tale of human error.

140
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,520
The invasion.

141
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,720
Created terrorists.

142
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,460
All right, I guess I wasn't thinking.

143
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
Find some other excuse.

144
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,800
Y'all weren't thinking.

145
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,700
Find some other excuse.

146
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,840
Here, shake hands with danger.

147
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,520
Shake hands with danger.

148
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,220
I told him not to touch anything.

149
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:06,780
Madam.

150
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,320
Three-fingered Joe.

151
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,240
Madam.

152
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,840
Three-fingered Joe.

153
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,840
My judgment is the only.

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
A mistake, a mistake.

155
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,000
Shake hands with danger.

156
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,040
It's the false democracy of elites.

157
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
Weapons and bombs and firing weapons.

158
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
What a straight line.

159
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,180
Change democracy.

160
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,980
Bush as the devil.

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,660
And the devil came here yesterday.

162
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,320
Yesterday the devil came.

163
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,940
And it smells of sulfur still today.

164
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,260
My judgment is the only.

165
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,820
My judgment is the only.

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,760
A mistake, a mistake.

167
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,640
Cynical.

168
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,500
Hypocritical.

169
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,340
Fool of this imperial hypocrisy.

170
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,620
Dear world dictator.

171
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,880
How cynical can you get?

172
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,940
What a capacity to lie.

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,460
Because they have ambitions.

174
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,340
Sperm.

175
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,840
Sperm.

176
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,180
Problem.

177
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,680
Sperm.

178
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,620
Raised position.

179
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,460
Feels stiff.

180
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,080
Rise.

181
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,820
Hairy.

182
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,360
You're shaking hands with danger.

183
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:56,880
Demand.

184
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,020
They're big enough.

185
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,780
Wherever possible the stick should be extended.

186
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,920
Hairy has come to work with a.

187
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,220
Okay.

188
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,120
Now most people have days when they come to work with worries, hangovers or distractions.

189
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,100
It's danger time.

190
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,660
Just give it a whack.

191
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,680
Party.

192
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
The people who shake hands with danger.

The hole is dry.

194
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,800
There's no stick.

195
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,600
Shake hands with danger.

196
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,600
Danger.

197
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,600


198
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,600

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,600


208
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,900
Danger.

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,480
Danger.

210
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,680
Danger.

211
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,240
Danger.

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,320

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,380
Danger.

215
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,880
Danger.

216
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:26,880

Danger.

219
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,200
Danger.

220
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,960
Danger.

You fired me.

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,940
Well, this is for you.

228
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,320
Good.

229
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,320


230
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,320


231
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,780
I didn't raise my mat.

232
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Great, well done.

233
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Done.

234
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,080
Thursday.

235
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,560
Wednesday, douchebag.

236
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,820
Thursday, assface.

237
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
Wednesday, you f***ing idiot!

238
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,720
What is going on here?

239
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,580
We're having a fight about the due date of the marketing proposal.

240
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Well, then there's only one way to solve it.

241
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,260
Fight!

242
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,920
Stapler!

243
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,280
Stapler!

244
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,780
Post it! Post it! Post it!

245
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,220
Finish him.

246
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,820
Level 2.

247
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,340
You know that proposal was due on Wednesday, Jim.

248
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,160
Thursday, Nancy.

249
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:10,740
Fight!

250
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Sexual harassment!

251
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,760
Lawsuit! Lawsuit!

252
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,260
Letter opener!

253
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,220
Level 3.

254
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,160
Ryu from Street Fighter? I didn't know you worked here.

255
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,700
I don't, but that proposal was definitely due on Wednesday.

256
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Fight!

257
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,480
Are you dead?

258
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,740
I'll get right on it.

259
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,000
This looks like a good place to park.

260
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,880
I don't know if, uh...

261
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,200
It looks like there's been an explosive device here for the last few weeks.

262
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,500
Wait a minute.

263
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Oh, yes, sir.

264
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,180
Twenty seconds to move you there.

265
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,360
Oh, uh, yes, sir.

266
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm, I'm moving it.

267
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,060
Right now.

268
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,920
Okay, keep listening to the tone, sir.

269
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,400
We're moving it.

270
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,440
We're moving it, sir.

271
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,040
Just listen to the tone.

272
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,580
We'll move the car for you.

273
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,540
Please, please!

274
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,780
We'll move the...

275
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,140
Fight, Mario!

276
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,320
I know.

277
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm gonna make it movie.

278
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Ugh.

279
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

280
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,880
Listen to the lilting sound of lonesome cowboy Dave on his big organ.

281
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,440
It is a big organ.

282
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,620
I'm not hearing you, Princess Wee, on your live microphone here in the studio.

283
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,260
No, I'm hearing you. I'm right here and I'm talking.

284
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,840
Huh?

285
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,240
Why would it be that you wouldn't be hearing me?

286
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,640
It's because of the clothespin on your nose and the fact that you're speaking in Welsh.

287
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,760
But I have no clothespin on my nose.

288
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:41,760


289
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,340
Wiggle the base of that thing's...

290
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,860
Wiggle the diaphragm of the koala device.

291
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,540
The bottom. The creature's bottom.

292
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
The koala. Whatever the koala is.

293
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,720
And make noise.

294
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,480
And begin to...

295
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,860
That's better. I heard that.

296
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,000
Now examine the tendrils at the very bottom there. You'll notice...

297
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
Now can you hear? Can you hear me now?

298
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,360
Yeah.

299
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,680
And now.

300
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,120
So...

301
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,480
And now.

302
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:10,560
So what are we to make of those cold nabobs? Does that mean that they're somehow... they disagree or that they...

303
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,640
Now which...

304
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,620
Which cold nabobs?

305
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,100
Which cold...

306
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,800
The cold... the cold of nabobs.

307
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,660
Now what is a nabob? It's like a... a... a... a... a...

308
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,700
A naysayer.

309
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,240
A naysayer. A nabob is...

310
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
And one who would say nay to Bob.

311
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,720
Right. So that's what... you know, it's clear as mud. At least you can figure out the... the bottom part, right?

312
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:40,780
Yes, friends. I should say, uh, we must... and we must thank Reverend Norell Preff of norellpreff.com.

313
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:50,320
For the, uh, collages, the last several collages. And, uh, Fernanda Nandy-Lemur for the other opening collages.

314
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,620
And Glass Madness for that song Bob Dobbs says to pay attention.

315
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,840
Is he a real man or is he one of your half-men?

316
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,140
He is a homunculus created in my laboratory.

317
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,840
You create homunculi?

318
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,980
Yeah, turn that thing down a little bit. It's a little obnoxious, I think.

319
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,300
Yeah, that sounds a little more...

320
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,700
We've also got the... the, uh, soundtrack of...

321
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,540
Perhaps it was.

322
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,380
What will become of the Baron?

323
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,740
Baron who, von Munch?

324
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,020
Baron Munchkin in the background.

325
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,980
Baron von Munchkin?

326
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,080
A eunuch's life is hard, you know.

327
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,340
Well, I don't imagine it's that hard.

328
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,240
In fact, that's the next song up. We could... we could play that song. Do you remember the... the movie, Bar... Adventures of Baron Munchausen?

329
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,960
Oh, as if it were my last, uh...

330
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,580
Dream.

331
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,880
Dream, yes.

332
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:50,620
The Sultan had, uh, entertained the Baron using a special musical instrument he had devised that involved, uh, slaves in cages.

333
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,880
And each key on his keyboard would cause a weapon to poke one of the slaves or prisoners in the cage.

334
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,300
And they would cry out a painful sound and that would be the...

335
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,880
Each slave would make a different noise depending on which key.

336
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,060
You could play chords and so forth.

337
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,840
He made an organ. I mean, he made an opera called A Eunuch's Life is Hard.

338
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,480
And once again, a eunuch's life can't be that.

339
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,520
No, it can't. That's the... that's the irony of it.

340
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,640
Well, what about the flattening of the skulls of the early eunuchs back in the days? Remember when they'd, uh, slap them on their backs and go running through the world?

341
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,920
I saw that movie. Apocalypto. That's up for an Academy Award tonight.

342
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,900
Friends, we have, uh, competition from the... for our listenership.

343
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,740
Not... probably not much. I doubt if many subgeniuses would be pink.

344
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,560
Oh, wait, here it is. Here's the song, A Eunuch's Life is Hard.

345
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,460
A torturer's apprentice went this many way to work one day.

346
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,740
I bend and stretch and ply my trade, making people all afraid.

347
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,640
But things look black, business is slack, there's no one on the rack but me.

348
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:16,960
Cut off in my prime, surrounded by beautiful women all the time.

349
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,920
A eunuch's life is hard. A eunuch's life is hard.

350
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:32,720
A eunuch's life is hard. A eunuch's life is hard.

351
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,020
And nothing else.

352
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,720
Oh, oh. Ouch.

353
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,640
A human's life... oh, sorry. A human's life is...

354
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Wait, wait, wait. A human's life is hard. A human's life is hard.

355
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. A human's life is hard.

356
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,420
Okay.

357
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,720
It is often difficult for evil to be a good man.

358
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:07,720


359
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,740
Why did he end up having an affair with your child?

360
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,760
What am I supposed to be?

361
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,440
Are human beings evil metric?

362
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,600
Oh, no.

363
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,880
No, no, no, no, no.

364
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,000
I am innocent indeed.

365
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:35,420
And I set myself up thereby to avoid a coming opportunity for any exactly like me.

366
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,520
I am innocent but in the manner of the vain elektros Iya.

367
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,960
Yes, his soft, dulcet tones of let's not say anything wrong.

368
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,420
It's more than that.

369
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,960
He's creeping up on everything.

370
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,740
He's creeping up on Bob.

371
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,980
God is creeping up on Bob, friends.

372
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,220
Are you going to let him do it?

373
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
Or are you going to stand up for righteousness?

374
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,320
Oh, wait, I guess standing up for God would be the righteousness.

375
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,760
And standing up for...

376
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,620
Are you going to stand up for wrong-ciousness, friends?

377
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,580
And Bob?

378
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,480
And Slack?

379
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,620
Who stands up for wrong-ciousness?

380
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,940
I will.

381
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,240
You would.

382
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,700
You probably would, wouldn't you, Dave?

383
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,060
If I only could.

384
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,840
We're all having a hard time standing up to begin with, though.

385
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Well, I don't blame people for switching over to the Oscars.

386
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,460
I've got a list of the movies, the best picture.

387
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,840
I know you haven't seen any of them, but I still wanted to see if you...

388
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,200
Had any bets.

389
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
You know, people bet.

390
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,300
You mean like five to one.

391
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,340
I'm trying to be normal.

392
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,260
You know, normal people would be talking about the Academy Awards and so forth.

393
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,360
And they're running different numbers, too.

394
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,660
Some of them are going five to one.

395
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,420
Some are going, you know, those odd mixes, like seven to eight or something.

396
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,340
You'd have to know how to bet real good and stuff to figure it out.

397
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,260
Well, the best picture of the year they had this year was the nominees are Punter.

398
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,940
That was the life of Philip Punter.

399
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,980
You probably didn't see that because that was like an art film.

400
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,740
It was an art film.

401
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,500
It was an art film about a guy who forgot and gave up.

402
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,740
Some people throw in the towel and other people put the towel on their head and pray.

403
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,540
Remember, Stang, that's true about religion.

404
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,320
This guy, too.

405
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,100
The Remarketed, which is a gangster movie.

406
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,960
Song of the Langerhands.

407
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,380
The British.

408
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,620
Oh, Song of the Langerhands.

409
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,660
That island movie.

410
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,460
Oh, yeah.

411
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,620
It was like this year's South Pacific.

412
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,140
It was a musical or something.

413
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,900
There was a lot of noise anyway.

414
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,460
I remember that.

415
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,240
Midnight Smelt Pond.

416
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,320
Oh, jeez.

417
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,260
And The Queed or The Cued.

418
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,800
I can't.

419
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,980
I haven't seen it.

420
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,060
I don't know how to pronounce it.

421
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,300
Maybe it's The Quaid.

422
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,580
Yeah, The Quaid or The Queed.

423
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,460
The Quaid.

424
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,180
No, The Midnight Smelt Pond.

425
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,240
Who starred in that?

426
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,580
I have no recollection.

427
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,540
Midnight Snow Pond, Pumpy Snooze.

428
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,060
Oh, I thought you said Midnight Smelt Pond.

429
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,060
Pumpy Snooze?

430
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,580
Yeah.

431
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,600
Pumpy Snooze.

432
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,940
Yeah, and Pumpy Snooze is for...

433
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,980
Is he also a British actor?

434
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,820
She is a...

435
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,040
No.

436
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,260
You are so out of it.

437
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,880
Pumpy Snooze is only like the most popular actress

438
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,780
since she was...

439
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,580
Was in that movie No Brainer last year.

440
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,000
Since Dorica Harle.

441
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
Since Dorica Harle.

442
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Yeah.

443
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
You know, Dave, you're so old.

444
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,020
You don't even know who Pumpy Snooze is.

445
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,680
Oh, well, yeah, right.

446
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,660
Okay, so you're such an expert on history,

447
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,940
you don't remember Dorica Harle.

448
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,080
Now, I saw this movie.

449
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,360
These are best performances by an actor in a leading role.

450
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,480
Prim Demonocratio for Hard Job.

451
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,780
Bri Quindarling for No Pets.

452
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,740
Pen Thud for Half Little Man.

453
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,180
Peter O'Toole for Penis.

454
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,720
Bill Smith.

455
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,740
Yeah, that was a terrible movie.

456
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,620
I thought it stunk also.

457
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,740
Well, you know, sometimes they give these awards

458
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,340
not for the movie this year,

459
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
but sort of like to pay the guy back

460
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,300
for a lifetime of hard work

461
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,040
and not as many Oscars as he's already got.

462
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,300
Think about the times when they...

463
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,560
What do they call those awards

464
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,740
for the lifetime of extracted, excruciating suffering?

465
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,260
Is it Gaffer?

466
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,760
Or is that just...

467
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,380
Just the snowball.

468
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
What do they call the guy with no hair?

469
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,860
That's the stop-motion animator.

470
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,180
The stop-motion animator.

471
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,420
Yeah.

472
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,040
And those guys don't even get minimum or maximum lately.

473
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,260
They get real bad skin from handling the materials.

474
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,700
Bad skin, bad scale, scaly skin.

475
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,240
Anyway, the other one...

476
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,760
Now, here's the one I think is going to win

477
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,980
is Rod Punk for Bringle Peppermire's Secret,

478
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,820
which I did see.

479
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,100
Was that like, you know, with the Yiddishamama

480
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,320
and they get filled to fish all over your head or something?

481
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,140
Or what was that?

482
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,640
Oh, sorry.

483
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,240
Well, really,

484
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,140
the animators should also get an award

485
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,480
because that was one of those motion capture performances.

486
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,140
Let's see.

487
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,500
Best performance by an actress in a leading role.

488
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,540
Wetly Drenched for Flood.

489
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,300
She's pretty aptly named for that movie.

490
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,380
Holly Mirror for Backwards.

491
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,020
Nolly Pinprick for God Reads Pravda.

492
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,840
And Tiny Islet for Sewn-On Eyeballs.

493
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,500
Well, I don't know if I can make up my mind

494
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,740
if I were one of those judges

495
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,220
or perhaps even an injurer.

496
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,100
I don't think I want to be connected with the system.

497
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,800
I never saw most of these movies myself.

498
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,520
There you go.

499
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,620
Hollywood is so hirsute and elite and flatulent

500
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,780
that all of the...

501
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,880
One of those guys' names you just read off and stuff like that,

502
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,220
they all support, I suppose, liberal causes or something.

503
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,140
Well, for Best Documentary...

504
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,280
You talk about liberal causes.

505
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,520
For Best Documentary, feature Deliver Us from Truth,

506
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,220
A Convenient Lie,

507
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,060
The Facts About Fiction,

508
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,260
and Jesus in Iraq.

509
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,240
Those are the four movies that are up.

510
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,520
And it's always this one distributor

511
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,680
that always gets Best Documentary.

512
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,320
It doesn't matter what the film is.

513
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,220
It's who's distributing it.

514
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,680
There you go.

515
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,580
That is why the problems...

516
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,680
That's the problem with the Church of the Subgenius.

517
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,300
This is why you guys are getting beat up by God.

518
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,700
Now, look.

519
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,040
I'm always hearing this from people.

520
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,560
You are getting beat up by God

521
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,520
because you are allying with this distributor

522
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,980
who is obviously godless.

523
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,300
What?

524
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
Thunder's Mouth Press?

525
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,100
Well, I've heard of them.

526
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,880
They're not even owned by Viacom.

527
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,580
I've heard...

528
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,820
Which is the real godless one.

529
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,580
It's a godless...

530
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,900
I've read on the internet anyway.

531
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,980
And in abeyance of any god,

532
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,020
they're also godless.

533
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,400
Murray Rothstein.

534
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,600
You're serving Satan.

535
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,200
Satan is Murray Rothstein.

536
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,900
Well, they see him walking out with tails on.

537
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,300
Isn't that enough?

538
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,400
Well, here's how I know that the Academy Awards

539
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,660
is possessed by the normals,

540
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,220
the spirit of the normals.

541
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,960
If you look at the list of winners,

542
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,880
as opposed to movies that people...

543
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,640
They're not even going to be able to see.

544
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,780
They're not even going to be able to see.

545
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:32,900
They're not even going to be able to see.

546
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,700
Like the year Citizen Kane and Maltese Falcon came out,

547
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,760
what won was How Green Was My Valley.

548
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,240
The year that Fight Club and Magnolia came out,

549
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,580
they weren't even nominated,

550
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,800
but Beauty and the Beast was.

551
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,420
For Best Picture.

552
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,680
Did Beauty and the Beast won?

553
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,960
No.

554
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,840
Well, they should hyper-nomer Beauty and the Beast

555
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,460
into somehow a back-wagon double feature

556
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,200
with a fight club.

557
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,820
And this wasn't the porno.

558
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,720
This wasn't the porno Beauty and the Beast.

559
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,780
This was the Disney one.

560
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, my goodness.

561
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,540
Pulp Friction was not given anything

562
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,220
the year that Forrest Gump won.

563
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,180
Goodfellas got nothing

564
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,540
the year that Dances with Wolves won.

565
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,540
2001 came out early in 1968,

566
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,720
but they gave the Academy Award to Oliver.

567
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,580
Now, how many times have you seen Oliver

568
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,140
with an exclamation point?

569
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,080
And how many times have you seen,

570
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,500
or hummed, at least,

571
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,700
hummed the soundtrack of 2001?

572
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,480
I can hum the soundtrack of 2001.

573
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,420
I mean, I can hum the lyrics of Oliver,

574
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,520
exclamation point,

575
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,400
to...

576
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,880
But I forget the one song about food.

577
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,100
Glorious food.

578
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,000
I know all the words.

579
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,240
You guys would.

580
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,400
But that's because we're us.

581
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,740
It can't be heard unless you're speaking

582
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,480
into the microphone on that bad mic, Princess Wee.

583
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,520
You can't speak into your purse

584
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,180
while you're looking at it.

585
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,560
You're not speaking for your drugs.

586
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,980
Oh, yes, you're right.

587
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,660
Only we would know all the words.

588
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,360
Well, I think it's an incalculable crime

589
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,960
that they would allow this sort of manure

590
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,360
to trespass in our psychic garden

591
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,460
and then to, worse than that,

592
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,340
to suppress us in strange mind control ways.

593
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,380
You know, like, they're pompous.

594
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,660
You know, I can tell these guys.

595
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:19,940
Why?

596
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,580
Just because they give awards to guys

597
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,040
who are already rich and famous?

598
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,180
Well, some of them aren't even real movies.

599
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,780
You know what I mean?

600
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,620
That's the weird part.

601
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,880
You know, it's like, well, I haven't seen it.

602
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,680
And then you find out everybody, nobody,

603
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,720
anyone hasn't seen it.

604
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,320
You know, they're just like titles.

605
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,400
They don't even exist.

606
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,640
They applaud.

607
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,460
They weep.

608
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,040
They stand up in front of the microphone.

609
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,680
I'd love to see it.

610
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,300
Okay, well, this is a good example.

611
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,720
Princess Wee and I watch almost every animated movie

612
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,840
that comes out because when you,

613
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,780
rather than argue between a chick flick

614
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,080
and a, what do you call a men's movie?

615
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,660
Well, it's what we call a movie

616
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,580
because they always end with a guy going

617
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,160
and doing something real strange.

618
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,300
And that saves the world.

619
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,420
If you watch, you'll see that that's true.

620
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,180
Anyway, the three animated features

621
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,280
that are up for Academy Awards,

622
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,320
we never did see.

623
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,880
Meet the Boogers, The Littlest Sociopath,

624
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,560
and Monster Butt were the children's animated films

625
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,400
that were up.

626
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,520
Now, I have seen the ones for the best achievement

627
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,440
in costume design.

628
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,060
Nudist Camp, 007 Goes to Burning Man,

629
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,180
and 9X Day, the documentary,

630
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,100
The Making of.

631
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,980
The Feature.

632
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,560
Don't ever expect those to win.

633
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,500
They were merely nominated as a second pass.

634
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,580
You know what I'm saying?

635
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,320
Some of the people on the top,

636
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,740
the higher echelon, let it go by.

637
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,100
If you think that you're going to,

638
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,940
or anybody's going to do anything,

639
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,820
you're sadly mistaken.

640
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,420
Now, we did go see Shorty Meets Stumpy,

641
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,480
and Mellon Merkin is up for Best Actor

642
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,940
in a Supporting Role for that.

643
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I didn't like her in that.

644
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,980
That's a, he, God.

645
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,320
Look, he's a, he's now,

646
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,620
I know Mellon Merkin used to be an actress,

647
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,160
but be respectful, Mellon is now a man.

648
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,980
Oh, so this is like Divine again?

649
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,280
You have to, I don't know.

650
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,880
Only in reverse.

651
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,900
Shorty Meets Stumpy was pretty funny, though.

652
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,180
Jimmy Jack Kornstein in Cracker Jack Sailor,

653
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,420
which was like the sequel to that mountain,

654
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,860
the cowboy mounting, the cowboy movie.

655
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,300
Right, that was like a homosexual porn film,

656
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,740
wasn't it?

657
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,080
Yeah.

658
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,420
Yeah.

659
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,940
Grey Poupon for a Bloody Mess.

660
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,240
Yes.

661
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,160
Princess Wee wouldn't go see that.

662
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,020
I don't blame her.

663
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,600
Because of the title.

664
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,520
It's probably invisible to begin with.

665
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,540
Why go see it?

666
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
You sit there and you eat popcorn

667
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,140
and someone pumps mind control things into your head.

668
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,740
Well, you know what's...

669
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,380
Then you have to go to the bathroom, you know?

670
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,820
Here's my bet on who's going to win Best Supporting Actor.

671
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,180
I think Fred Glosny in Movie Star is going to win.

672
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,220
I think the name is too Slavic sounding.

673
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,400
I think you might have to change it to like Fred Golden Gloss.

674
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,560
Fred Glosny?

675
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,300
That is his screen name.

676
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,920
Or Gloss.

677
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,340
His original name was Rod Tank.

678
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,000
Perhaps for the mentality that is arising quickly.

679
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,900
But it sounded too much like a movie star name.

680
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,820
Well, yeah, of course.

681
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,640
Namely...

682
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,380
Now, speaking of names,

683
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,660
Namely Starson is up for Best Supporting Actress in Naked Woman.

684
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,360
Everybody saw that.

685
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,280
No, I still haven't seen it yet.

686
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,800
That's a must-see, Naked Woman.

687
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,520
Brainiac Poindexter in Pudge Love.

688
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,040
Niner Bratz for Label.

689
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,780
And Heather Jennifer as Olive Oil in Popeye's Revenge.

690
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,440
That was a weird film.

691
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,340
Who directed that?

692
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,460
That was really weird.

693
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,380
David Lynch.

694
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,980
David Lynch?

695
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,820
In Popeye's Revenge.

696
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,220
And it was about Popeye.

697
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,760
But Bluto had become a good guy.

698
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,260
And he owned the town, though, didn't he?

699
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,820
Didn't Bluto, like, own the town?

700
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,620
Yeah, but he was...

701
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,180
And Popeye came back.

702
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,640
But the weird thing, there was like...

703
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:56,080
He and Popeye got together against the bad guy who was the mad hippie eco-terrorist.

704
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,880
Oh, wow.

705
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,420
That sounds like I should have seen it then.

706
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,600
I really wish I could have then.

707
00:24:59,640 --> 00:24:59,780
Yeah.

708
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,700
They'd blow up trees with the spike things.

709
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,240
Yeah, there was a guy flying through the air in front of a ball of fire and a guy going...

710
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,020
Yeah.

711
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,040
So it was a real movie.

712
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,440
That's a man movie.

713
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,720
It wasn't like one of those fake movies that's all subtitled and everything.

714
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,200
For Best Director, Shrieky Fitz for Spasm.

715
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,020
Squint Plissken for Skinned.

716
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,640
Prawn Sourglass for Naked Woman again.

717
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,480
Marcel Delgrado...

718
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,940
So you're dovetailing now, though, Stane.

719
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,460
...for Pimpernel.

720
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,060
And Nigel Queener for Rear End.

721
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,100
And I think they'll probably give it to him.

722
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,820
Nigel?

723
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,300
Yeah.

724
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,600
Yeah.

725
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,300
Has he been in the business a long time?

726
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,480
Once again, I'm sorry I'm ignorant.

727
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,100
But is he like one of the industry's standard guys?

728
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,340
He's like the Little Miss...

729
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,780
This year's Little Miss Sunshine.

730
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,180
Oh, they always have one of those, right?

731
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,320
And for Best Screenplay...

732
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,940
Little Miss Sunshine is this year, dear.

733
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,980
Oh, that's the theme?

734
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,160
Huh?

735
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,320
It's the theme of the pudding or it's the theme of the actual event?

736
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,500
What?

737
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,560
Little Miss Sunshine.

738
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:54,920
I'm deaf.

739
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,100
Little Miss Sunshine is this year, dear.

740
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,440
She said, yeah.

741
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah, Little Miss Sunshine is going to be one of the presenters.

742
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,540
She's presenting one of the awards this year.

743
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
She's a normal child?

744
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,340
Or is it a child at all?

745
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,220
Or is it just a ray of sunshine?

746
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,160
CGI.

747
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,000
CGI?

748
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,480
Yeah.

749
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,280
Little Miss Sunshine is a CGI creature.

750
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,200
For Best Screenplay, Scams, Baby Rants, Tattoos of Anchors, Mom's Little Secret, which I think will get it,

751
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,000
The Swipe.

752
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,340
and Copyright Nightmare.

753
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,700
Those were Best Screenplay nominees.

754
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,560
When they were all ripped off.

755
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,180
Yeah.

756
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,480
Weren't they?

757
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,140
Just like...

758
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,940
They were all ripped off from this one little old black lady who wrote all the original screenplays.

759
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,920
Lady from St. Louis who's been writing for 35 years.

760
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,920
She's the same one that wrote The Matrix and those Wernobsky brothers ripped that off.

761
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,780
And they paid her off, though, after a lot of fighting.

762
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,780
But, yeah, so that's the news.

763
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,260
Well, we don't win.

764
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,680
We don't win.

765
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:56,700
We don't win.

766
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,460
We don't win.

767
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:57,740
We don't win.

768
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,080
We don't win.

769
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


770
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


771
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


772
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


773
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


774
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


775
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,080


776
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,760
That's the news.

777
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,700
Well...

778
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, I heard all the generals were about to quit if the President Cheney decides to go

779
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,980
to war against Iran.

780
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,280
Well, here's an interesting take on that.

781
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,660
All the generals on the other guy's side are ready to join up if he does that.

782
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,460
Oh, really?

783
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
Yeah, so it's kind of about...

784
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,160
The Iranian generals are going to join the American...

785
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,720
We'll join America if we wage war on Iran.

786
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,960
No, I guess a lot of...

787
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
But the American generals will quit if we...

788
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:24,960
Right.

789
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,340
Right.

790
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,480
American generals will quit.

791
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,600
And a bunch of Iranians...

792
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,400
And even other guys, not necessarily other guys, other nations with generals will join

793
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,620
up.

794
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,580
Will join in fighting Iran.

795
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,860
So there's the universal yin-yang, the dissolution and slobbering all in one slow motion breath.

796
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,620
You can see the world just like tumbling into a pile of...

797
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,100
It's like the giant...

798
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,000
It's like the biggest rubber band ball in the world all falling apart from rot.

799
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,140
It's coming apart quickly.

800
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,280
It's like the biggest ball of string in the world unraveling.

801
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,580
And the quicker it twirls, the faster the balls come off.

802
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,340
I wish you...

803
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,980
Yeah, ouch.

804
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,940
Right, right.

805
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,260
Well, we don't remember that stuff.

806
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,900
I wish you wouldn't bring that up.

807
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,240
Right.

808
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,060
It's happened once.

809
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,600
It's got to be forgotten.

810
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,180
It can't be brought up again.

811
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,460
Now, our subgenius...

812
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,560
Pardon me?

813
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,480
Once you say that, once you think about it, you don't want to bring it up again.

814
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,220
No, but once you think it, you can't unthink it.

815
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,320
That's the problem with all...

816
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,800
As Nenslow said, once you know something, you can't unknow it.

817
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,240
I have.

818
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,180
I have.

819
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,960
But with Bob, we can unknow something.

820
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,160
We can forget everything we ever learned with Bob.

821
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:44,100
And with this increased lack of knowledge, we take our breath every morning and face the sun.

822
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,540
Ready for another institutional ride.

823
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,220
Roll it.

824
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,840
The Dave DeLuca Orchestra is here in the studio.

825
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,460
Get it ready for orchestra.

826
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,060
Nice.

827
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,820
I can hear that.

828
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,740
Oh, can't you?

829
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,220
Is it too loud again?

830
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,100
No, I can...

831
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,480
That's fine.

832
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,660
I'm trying to make it...

833
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,640
I mean, it would be fine if it sounded good.

834
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,240
Well, we don't want it to sound too good.

835
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
But I can hear it.

836
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
How about something like that, you know?

837
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,300
And then it goes something like this.

838
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,460
Oh, maybe...

839
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:21,260
And best score, best musical score for a radio show goes to Lonesome Cowboy, quote,

840
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,700
Dave, unquote.

841
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,560
And the...

842
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,920
Davis.

843
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,040
The synchronistic language.

844
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,440
Exactly.

845
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:38,180
Now, our Australian correspondent, Chainsmurker, reported that President Cheney has been in Australia lately.

846
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,140
And he said that a pall has fallen over everyone he knows.

847
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,220
Everyone is surrounded by a dark aura.

848
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:54,400
However, he went on to say that he himself, Reverend Chainsmurker, was not in any way threatening or even criticizing President Cheney.

849
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,040
Now, Chainsmurker knew quite well...

850
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,020
Neither are we.

851
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,920
...that as long as his presence was there, there'd be problems.

852
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,500
And I...

853
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,420
And they even had a photo of two guys holding a Australia loves Cheney sign.

854
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,420
Oh, I thought you were...

855
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,740
On the internet.

856
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,100
Cheney was, like, holding hand with some Saudi sheik or something.

857
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,260
No, no, no.

858
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,940
Holding hands like...

859
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,080
To show on the internet, to show that Australia was really behind President Cheney.

860
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,660
All two of those guys.

861
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,080
They had pictures of two guys holding a big banner that had flags of both countries.

862
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,860
Well, I heard that the...

863
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:26,960
Who was the first president?

864
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,040
Who was the first president?

865
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,040


866
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,040


867
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,040


868
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,220
Subversive?

869
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,320
Huh?

870
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:28,940
Who?

871
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,460
Us?

872
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,300
Subversive?

873
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,640
No, the psycho-Eurasians.

874
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,900
The Australians.

875
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,420
The psycho-Eurasians also...

876
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:36,440
The people of Oz.

877
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,260
The little...

878
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,500
They encircled...

879
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,640
Yeah.

880
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,280
They encircled them with their little silver shoes and their long wooden noses and their

881
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,660
little beakskill haircuts.

882
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,640
One of the crazy people was on subgenius internet going,

883
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,640
America's trying to take over the world!

884
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,560
They want to dominate the whole world!

885
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,020
And Chainsmurker was going,

886
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,860
The Americans already took over the world.

887
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,840
Oh, buddy, where have you been?

888
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,560
Already dominated.

889
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Oh my God.

890
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,600
Catch up, buddy.

891
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,880
I like the way you...

892
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,320
And then some other subgenius said,

893
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,600
Well, no, they like to do it over and over again.

894
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,280
Who, Australians?

895
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,900
They'll take over the world, then they'll do it again!

896
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,900
Oh, that sounds sexual, man.

897
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,940
They'll tear it all apart and then take over the world again.

898
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,920
That's the American way.

899
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,680
That is...

900
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
You just do it and do it and do it and do it.

901
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,440
That is that at those arrows right there.

902
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,840
That's your sex death thing right there, buddy boy.

903
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,500
America screwing the world and doing it again and again and again.

904
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,780
I remember...

905
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,280
There was an old Paul Krasner cartoon in an old...

906
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,020
Oh, yeah, right.

907
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,100
In an old realist, very old, because I remember those were old books.

908
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,200
And there was one where there was a skeleton that said Vietnam on it.

909
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,580
And Uncle Sam was, you know, performing an illusion.

910
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,940
And he was smoking a cigarette and he said,

911
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,320
Was it good for you, too?

912
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,220
That's very funny and relevant.

913
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,240
Just before we came to the station,

914
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,380
I looked at alt.slack and young Reverend Alex was upset

915
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,480
because he'd read, finally read the very end of the new book.

916
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,000
And it has a list of the birthdays of subgenius saints.

917
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,460
And he was upset because some of the subgenius saints included

918
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,320
Saint Hitler, Saint Stalin, Saint Franco, and so forth.

919
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,400
And Alex was...

920
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh, that's real, quote, funny, unquote.

921
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,780
That's real, quote, irreverent, unquote.

922
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,180
And...

923
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,320
And I had to point out that, you know,

924
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,360
if we hide from the fact of the rogue subgenius,

925
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,620
and if we pretend that these rogue subgeniuses don't exist,

926
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,980
then it's as if we enable them to repeat history again and again and again.

927
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
We have to...

928
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,740
Do you think that Hitler and Stalin and Franco were normals?

929
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,060
Do you think they were able to get into that position of incredible, unthinkable power,

930
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,160
over-resilient, and...

931
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,540
And they were not the ones of stupid normals,

932
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,760
if they were themselves normals?

933
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,080
Nay.

934
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,320
Nay.

935
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,120
They were subgeni, but not subgeni who had come to slack under Bob.

936
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,320
They never even heard of Bob.

937
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,560
They were before Bob.

938
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,120
They didn't...

939
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,040
Well, actually, Hitler himself was slain by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

940
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,780
Thank God.

941
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,720
In the subgenius church, we...

942
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,020
Sainthood does not mean goodness.

943
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,400
It simply means that they are way more power...

944
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,280
We are acknowledging that these people somehow became way more powerful than us.

945
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,700
Jack the Ripper is a saint in the church of the subgenius.

946
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,940
I didn't notice his name there.

947
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,660
Did you have his real name as a...

948
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,220
He was kin to the royal family somewhere, wasn't he?

949
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,660
Or did you just have Saint Jack the Ripper?

950
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,300
Well, now that depends on which conspiracy is paying you.

951
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,280
You should have had Alloy, you know, in quotes, Hitler.

952
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,680
I mean, Alloy, Adolf, Schicklgruber, you know, and, like Bob, Hitler.

953
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,060
Because you should have his real name and you wouldn't have these problems.

954
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,280
But that doesn't mean...

955
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Yeah, we have to face the fact that the subgenius gene...

956
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,840
often goes wrong.

957
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,800
I mean, these people were weirdos and losers who wanted revenge.

958
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,240
And they were motivated by the fact that they were weirdos and losers and picked on.

959
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,780
Nobody bought Hitler's paintings.

960
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,180
Now, if somebody bought Hitler's paintings, history might have been a whole lot different.

961
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,260
If you could go back in time, would you kill Hitler or would you...

962
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,000
Buy one of his paintings?

963
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,940
Buy one of his paintings and maybe take him out and tell him he was cute?

964
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,580
If you had the money, you'd buy his painting and then you'd kill him for out of dis... you know...

965
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,000
Now, that actually... yeah.

966
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,260
You're right.

967
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,200
Have you seen his paintings?

968
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,080
Then you'd have an original Hitler.

969
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,440
There was the Reichstag was one of them, a place he later helped burn.

970
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,420
That was great, though.

971
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,020
I mean, it was all like this, you know, architecture stuff.

972
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,300
They weren't bad paintings.

973
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,000
No, they were kind of lifeless and rather...

974
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,580
Yeah, they were dull.

975
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,440
...square, very dull.

976
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,540
Right, they were real square and dull.

977
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,160
Yeah, but he knew how to glaze them and all that stuff and, you know...

978
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Instead of just saying, oh, I guess they don't want to buy my art, he went, I'll show them.

979
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,560
I'll take over the entire known world and massively... I'll have a thousand of my own people who will die by the millions.

980
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
That's where they come from.

981
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:06,600
That's what happens when a person of skill, talent, or insaneness of subgeniality doesn't have Bob.

982
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:15,580
If we don't spread the word of Bob, then we will just see more Hitlers, more Pol Pots, and so forth, and lonesome Polecats, and we will...

983
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Whereas if these same selfsame potential serial killers had Bob and knew of Slack and the hope that Bob brings,

984
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,260
Bob would have killed him.

985
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,000
Then they would not go down this wrong path of anti-Slack.

986
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,780
They would spread Slack.

987
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:39,900
Nay, Bob, but I would say that a better strategy would be, rather than buy a painting or kill him, show them that he's been made a saint in the future in the Church of Subgenius.

988
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,760
And then what would happen?

989
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,480
He would quit doing what he was doing.

990
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,980
Hitler would certainly stop trying to oppress and murder people and stuff, and so would Stalin and Pol Pot and all those guys, too.

991
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:54,260
They would just go and smoke some frop or stand over in those woods over there for long enough.

992
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,780
Until their feet fall off, or they would...you know.

993
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,200
But they didn't.

994
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
No.

995
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,880
No, they didn't know of Bob.

996
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,920
They didn't have pamphlet number one.

997
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,960
They never heard the phrase, repent, quit your job, Slack off.

998
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,060
They didn't know to pull the wool over their own eyes and relax in the safety of their own delusions.

999
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,200
Well, it's a convoluted trail to canonization.

1000
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,800
I mean, I've wanted to be a saint for so long, but I haven't killed anybody yet.

1001
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,340
No, you can also be a saint from doing great good, like Russ Meyer.

1002
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,180
Well, how about just...

1003
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,820
Saint Russ Meyer.

1004
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,760
Saint Lenny Bruce.

1005
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,060
Saint...uh...uh...

1006
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,360
How about just being real hateful and misdirected?

1007
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,840
Well, I can't think of too many nice people that we've sainted.

1008
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,180
How about just being hateful and misdirected?

1009
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,260
That's not enough to make you a saint.

1010
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:35,820
Why not?

1011
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,380
That's...and every subgenius would be a saint.

1012
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,860
It's...and every...and it's inevitable.

1013
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,080
Being hateful and misdirected is all it takes, and every...the list of saints would never end.

1014
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,800
Well, then why garner the...

1015
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,840
Every squalling, bad-tempered child would be a saint.

1016
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,740
Why flop the sauce around so frugally when you have...

1017
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,440
...people that are murdering, you could just give it to everybody.

1018
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,340
All of us misdirected, hateful people.

1019
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:05,400
See, that's one of my confused questions that I can't stop asking as I try to sleep.

1020
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:15,520
I look at Mr. Moonlight, I think of the sun coming up and going down, everything just...it just runs together and...and...and then...oh wait.

1021
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,880
That's called a disassociation...

1022
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,600
I'm sorry, that was something else.

1023
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,020
Yeah, right, I was...

1024
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,220
Dissociative psychosis.

1025
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,260
Yeah, postmodern deconstruction of the brain area.

1026
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,700
It's...well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

1027
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,480
Okay, I'll shut up.

1028
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,480
Chimps have been discovered using spears.

1029
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,980
Yes.

1030
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,460
And...

1031
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,540
Flint tools too, they grind and make little...

1032
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:37,860
Well...

1033
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,540
...crack marks.

1034
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:50,220
Reverend Skull pointed out that now that it's been discovered that chimpanzees are using spears that obviously their next step will be weapons of mass destruction.

1035
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,400
So...

1036
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,220
Mass destruction?

1037
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,720
Yeah, Bush must act now.

1038
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,140
Mass destruction.

1039
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:02,120
And throw Jane Goodall in Gitmo and invade Central Africa and destroy Alchimpa.

1040
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,240
That is a good premise.

1041
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,060
Because they hate our freedoms.

1042
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,640
Yeah.

1043
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:11,420
You know, we can't let these chimps get out of...they've obviously...they're...they're rattling their spears and...

1044
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,580
They hate our decorum.

1045
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,300
They hate our fresh friendly clothes without poo poo stains in the back.

1046
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,820
Right, but they...

1047
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,380
They hate our hairless bodies.

1048
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
They hate the fact that we can...

1049
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,240
They hate the fact that we can just have sex anytime.

1050
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
They hate the fact that we can go to a restaurant and use a credit card to order something.

1051
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,000
Which they can do too, but people...

1052
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,280
They could if they had a credit card.

1053
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,560
Ha ha, this is your picture, right?

1054
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:29,860
You know?

1055
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,360
And then the monkey goes off crying and...but no, I...

1056
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,100
No, they did chose not to have opposable thumbs.

1057
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,980
Well, you see what's inevitable now, don't you?

1058
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,080
They chose not to stand upright and scamper across the savannah.

1059
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,940
Now it shows that their thumbs are becoming opposing.

1060
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,680
Next thing you know their hands will be fighting and they'll make nuclear weapons.

1061
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:45,720
That's right.

1062
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,160
We've got to step in there...

1063
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,280
...and extinctify the...

1064
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,840
...the last of the chimpanzees because...

1065
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,640
Too late.

1066
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:52,920
...once it...

1067
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,420
It's...

1068
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,880
We've been...

1069
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,580
As one...

1070
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,760
Another subgenius says, we must bomb them back to the pre-pushing-pokey-sticks age.

1071
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,140
And now they're saying, well, with the carbon dating we can state clearly that they've been

1072
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,000
making tools for 4,000 years.

1073
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,300
Well, maybe you haven't been looking around for a lot of chimpanzee tools and maybe they've

1074
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,760
been making them since all under your noses since this very time began itself.

1075
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,680
Yeah.

1076
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,560
They probably...

1077
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,180
Well, hey, that's the moral of that Planet of the Apes movie.

1078
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,480
It had a moral?

1079
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:25,960
Yeah.

1080
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,520
Oh, yeah.

1081
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,080
I remember, right?

1082
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,560
Ape shall not kill ape.

1083
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,800
The law givers said that.

1084
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,440
And then what happened?

1085
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,740
They lobotomized the humans.

1086
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,640
Right.

1087
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,980
Okay, we did it for ourselves.

1088
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:33,740
Right.

1089
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,020
We didn't have to let them do it.

1090
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,380
Now here we are.

1091
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,240
They're going to be making our sticks pretty soon.

1092
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,860
Now here we are, Planet of the Apes, and it's not even apes.

1093
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,460
It's just humans that behave just like as if they were hairless, upright apes.

1094
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,680
Yeah.

1095
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,240
So many pictures of Bush on the internet.

1096
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,700
He looks like a chimpanzee.

1097
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,180
I wonder if that has something to do with it.

1098
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,800
Well, all people look a little like animals, don't you think?

1099
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,880
And he does.

1100
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,400
He does.

1101
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:53,860
You're right.

1102
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,720
He does look like...

1103
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,520
If he were represented in a cartoon, the easiest thing to turn him into is a little chimp.

1104
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,120
I look like a kind Pomeranian.

1105
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,320
He looks a lot like Curious George, in fact.

1106
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,940
Yeah, yeah, it does.

1107
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,280
Who's a monkey instead of a chimpanzee.

1108
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,200
Which was takeoff extraction.

1109
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,580
But don't you think that people do look...

1110
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,660
Almost everybody has some animal that you can say they look sort of like.

1111
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,720
I think I look like a friendly Pomeranian, a Welsh Pomeranian, just as you said before.

1112
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,520
I feel like I'm a were-meerkat.

1113
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,660
A weird meerkat?

1114
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,600
A were-meerkat.

1115
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:22,740
A weird meerkat.

1116
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,320
Like a werewolf, only a meerkat.

1117
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,440
So which form are you in now?

1118
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,780
Meerkats are the ones that just stand there with this thoughtful look.

1119
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,740
With their paws hanging limp-wristed.

1120
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,360
And they're bound across the belt.

1121
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,160
But they're keeping alert.

1122
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,440
They're like prairie dogs.

1123
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,920
They're just kind of looking around placidly.

1124
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,960
It's an African prairie dog.

1125
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,680
Sort of, yeah.

1126
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,140
Yeah.

1127
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,440
Now, if it was a...

1128
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,840
If you crossed a meerkat with a mermaid...

1129
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,700
And it was a...

1130
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,780
It was a were-meer-meer-meerkat.

1131
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,460
It could be a merkin mat.

1132
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,440
It would be if they had so much hair.

1133
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,080
A merkin mat.

1134
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,040
Now, we're getting silly.

1135
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,480
That's not very scientific.

1136
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,280
And I'm the koala bear.

1137
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,040
Right.

1138
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,140
Princess Wee looks kind of like a koala bear.

1139
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,240
The Christ-like koala bear.

1140
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,880
There's the...

1141
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,400
Sweet.

1142
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,180
The religious accoutrements.

1143
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,720
She has that sweet expression on her face all the time.

1144
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,740
The trappist monk's cassock over the back of her head.

1145
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:12,860
Confused and sweet.

1146
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,540
And I always thought that I looked like a fish.

1147
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,020
Hanging from her navel.

1148
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,280
But Reverend Stang says I look like a koala bear.

1149
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm a fish.

1150
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:17,700


1151
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:17,700


1152
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:17,880
Yeah.

1153
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,200
Fishy bear?

1154
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,600
Fishy bear.

1155
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:20,740
Fishy bear.

1156
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,300
That would be a good name for all of us.

1157
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:22,940
Fishy bear.

1158
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,820
We'll just start calling ourselves that and then forget about everything else.

1159
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,600
What are we doing here?

1160
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,380
Are we doing anything important?

1161
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,680
I'm sorry.

1162
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,220
No.

1163
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,780
No.

1164
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,140
I'm sorry too, Dave.

1165
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,540
We're wasting...

1166
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:34,640
I'm sorry three.

1167
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,840
Well, how could we be wasting time?

1168
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,360
We could be protesting or talking about something educational and instead I just...

1169
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,720
I don't even know where it's gone.

1170
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,000
I don't know what we're doing.

1171
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,980
But the preemise was right.

1172
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,660
And the preemise was chimpanzees with nuclear weapons.

1173
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,660
Right.

1174
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,020
Yeah.

1175
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,420
That basically is exactly where we find ourselves.

1176
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:04,940
We are slightly taller chimps with the same basic mood as the pantroglodyte chimp.

1177
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,060
And much longer spears.

1178
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,160
Much more explosive spears.

1179
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,660
And more toxic poo.

1180
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,480
I hope they don't get axel tottles or whatever they call them.

1181
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,360
I hope they don't get some fear-splingers.

1182
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,540
Axel Princess is doing...

1183
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:19,880
What is Princess Wee doing?

1184
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,340
She's doing a monkey pose just to illuminate the moment.

1185
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,260
She's climbing and she had one leg all the way up on the studio table there.

1186
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,960
In a strange...

1187
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,020
You just never mind the contortions I have to go into to get my radio show out.

1188
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,640
All right.

1189
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Now, I read in the news today that Strom Thurman owned Al Sharpton.

1190
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,800
Literally?

1191
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,780
Well, his...

1192
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,320
Oh, you're right.

1193
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,280
His ancestors owned his ancestors.

1194
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:42,700
Right.

1195
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,140
I'm glad that happened.

1196
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,280
What a beautiful couple they've made.

1197
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,460
Oh, yeah.

1198
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,340
They do make.

1199
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,460
They actually...

1200
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,020
When I was about...

1201
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,440
They both have a jerry curl, don't they?

1202
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,960
Except for old Winston Smith who's turned into a Raggedy Puff.

1203
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,700
What's his name again?

1204
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,680
Strom Thurman.

1205
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,520
He died when he was 100 a few years ago.

1206
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,640
He is a Raggedy Puff now, yeah.

1207
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,400
He did live to be 100 years old though.

1208
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,700
100 years...

1209
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,160
Well, his family...

1210
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,060
He was a segregationist until that went out of fashion in the 60s.

1211
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,740
Then he kind of quit that routine.

1212
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,400
Then he made speeches about civil rights in the 70s and 80s.

1213
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,420
But Americans aren't the only insane people.

1214
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,440


1215
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,800
All people are insane and some are even crazier.

1216
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,400
No.

1217
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
We are the template.

1218
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,700
No, not...

1219
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,300
We've only been crazy for 250 years or so.

1220
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,340
What was...

1221
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:35,560
Princess, we and I saw some Iranian TV that was...

1222
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:43,140
Some Islamic scholar was denouncing Tom and Jerry.

1223
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,680
The cartoon.

1224
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,380
There you go.

1225
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:45,600
We didn't really like.

1226
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:54,020
In the Hollywood cartoon, Tom and Jerry he said was to program people to like Jews

1227
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,460
instead of hate Jews.

1228
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,060
Well we'd want to admit it, but you know it is true.

1229
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:06,060
Because the mouse represented the Jew in Tom and Jerry, this is what this Islamic scholar

1230
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,220
was saying on YouTube.

1231
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,200
He had subtitles, so maybe the subtitles were wrong.

1232
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,120
It all had a ring of truth.

1233
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,180
Here's another thing.

1234
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,360
He kept blaming everything on YouTube.

1235
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:15,360


1236
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,740
Disney for Tom and Jerry.

1237
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,120
Everyone knows Tom and Jerry was MGM.

1238
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,820
Oh, MGM.

1239
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,420
Tom and Jerry was strictly MGM.

1240
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,180
In fact, the great Tex Avery

1241
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,220
animated quite a few of those.

1242
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,220
But the reasoning that this

1243
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,000
Islamic scholar had was that

1244
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,440
in medieval Europe,

1245
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,200
one of the slang terms

1246
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,080
for Jews was dirty

1247
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,440
mice. Therefore,

1248
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,780
when you see a mouse

1249
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,460
on television in 20th century

1250
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,020
television

1251
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,100
cartooning, that

1252
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,900
mouse represents a Jew.

1253
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,480
As you can see, the mouse is always crafty

1254
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,580
and clever, and he's so cute.

1255
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,720
And the cat is so bad.

1256
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,740
And the cat, I guess, represents

1257
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,300
everyone else who always is tricked

1258
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,220
by the clever, wicked, evil,

1259
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,100
funny, cute, lovable

1260
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,260
Jew mouse named

1261
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:05,900
Jerry.

1262
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,040
It wasn't Jerry the mouse

1263
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,300
and Tom was the cat, right?

1264
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,840
No, he's taking Spiegel's book

1265
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,440
Mouse, and he's

1266
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,120
turned it into...

1267
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,920
Now, believe me, these guys never saw

1268
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,360
Reverend Spiegelman's book.

1269
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,220
He read the book, and he thought it was

1270
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,760
a tract from ancient days.

1271
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,980
After being clubbed over there.

1272
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,220
No, I reject

1273
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,400
the principle. What does Daffy Duck

1274
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,360
have to say?

1275
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,440
No, no.

1276
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,040
No, that's Donald Duck.

1277
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,240
He makes wise remarks and smokes a cigar

1278
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,120
and goes ice skating.

1279
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,080
Whatever he said, he would say it in a messy

1280
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,600
manner.

1281
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,360
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

1282
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,380
Like that, sure, but what would

1283
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,480
he say about... He would spray it instead of

1284
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,940
say it. Would he doubt

1285
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,460
the Holocaust? You think Daffy would?

1286
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,840
Well, he's a duck.

1287
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,100
We're talking about the dirty mice of

1288
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,240
medieval Europe and how

1289
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,300
that somehow translates to all

1290
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,300
the cute mice in cartoons that

1291
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,160
come from Hollywood.

1292
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,380
Which, apparently, to this guy, Disney makes

1293
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,300
all cartoons.

1294
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,460
They know who Disney is, but they don't know

1295
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,900
who MGM is, I guess.

1296
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,160
Well, we know that the

1297
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,220
modern Uber Disney does make

1298
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,020
all cartoons. It's a voice

1299
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,880
in all of our heads. The Uber Disney

1300
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,100
is in control of most of our thoughts half

1301
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,940
the time. You must remember that

1302
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,800
Walt Disney used to wear an

1303
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
American bunion uniform

1304
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,880
with stars and stripes on it.

1305
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,360
That's the other thing. Disney was kind of an anti-Semitic

1306
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,980
whack job on some

1307
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,260
level. So why would Disney

1308
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,360
be doing pro-jewelry

1309
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:37,680
cartoons?

1310
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,940
Once again, this Ayatollah has not done his homework

1311
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,860
and should dip into Daffy Duck.

1312
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,920
Now, Princess, we and I started

1313
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,820
speculating that really

1314
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,220
what those MGM cartoons meant

1315
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,000
is the mouse stands

1316
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,740
for the subgenius.

1317
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,080
The cat stands for the

1318
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,260
human. But what does the human

1319
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,360
stand for? There was a human

1320
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,760
but you only saw her from the knees

1321
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:01,520
down.

1322
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,320
And we thought the human in Tom and Jerry

1323
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,400
stood for the goddess.

1324
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,380
What do we stand for?

1325
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,200
What do we stand

1326
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,740
for? We stand for slack.

1327
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,020
Goddess and man, woman, and

1328
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,340
gods. I stand for

1329
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,640
the slack of every man.

1330
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,560
I don't care about the collective.

1331
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,060
This

1332
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,680
new age people

1333
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,220
feel that self-sacrifice

1334
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,340
is the highest endeavor.

1335
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,140
But not I.

1336
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,760
I say

1337
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,320
I paste up

1338
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,720
subgenius pamphlets

1339
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,640
not because

1340
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,840
No, what?

1341
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,900
How did that go?

1342
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,260
In that movie we were watching, The Muttonhead,

1343
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,440
the Ayn Rand's

1344
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,680
The Muttonhead that was made into a movie

1345
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,280
back in the 40s or

1346
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,260
early 50s. Well, I believe it was

1347
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,940
slow regurgitation of her old

1348
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,520
temple fluid. Man, I need to bring in some rants

1349
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,740
from that.

1350
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,120
The Ayn Rand.

1351
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,500
She was Russian.

1352
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,020
She was a rogue subgenius.

1353
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,100
She was a rogue subgenius.

1354
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,560
She was one of those frustrated

1355
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,300
weirdo outsiders that basically

1356
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,880
just did rants.

1357
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,120
If you look at her story,

1358
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,080
any of her stories, it's a series of

1359
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,400
setups

1360
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,020
in which characters

1361
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,560
rant for

1362
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,400
long, long monologues

1363
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,540
and each one is really Ayn Rand

1364
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,860
kind of talking to herself

1365
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,400
in a psycho argument.

1366
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,300
It's like Lyndon LaRouche without the

1367
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,760
mind frog.

1368
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,280
When I was

1369
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,320
watching The Muttonhead, I was reminded of

1370
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,260
Lyndon LaRouche.

1371
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,120
I was reminded of the piecemeal labor that the

1372
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,020
indigent family that was employed by my parents

1373
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,880
back in the old days did in the basement.

1374
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,160
Once again, the postmodern deconstruction

1375
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,080
of some of the bodies we kept down there

1376
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,060
and just the way they kept things smooth.

1377
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,940
Your family was better off in the old days,

1378
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,460
weren't they?

1379
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,900
Better back in Portugal and Russia,

1380
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,700
if that's for sure.

1381
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,200
Oh, really?

1382
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,420
Well, maybe.

1383
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,440
Portugal and Russia?

1384
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,440
Well, those are some places it could go.

1385
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,280
Oh.

1386
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,340
Well, if we wanted to.

1387
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,860
What about the bodies, though?

1388
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,140
Well, the bodies...

1389
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,760
The bodies were just removed slowly,

1390
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,060
just like the regurgitation,

1391
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,160
and then they were recycled,

1392
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,480
made into something better.

1393
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,800
We made the sign or whatever the phrase was.

1394
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
See, my family just threw them away.

1395
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,380
Yeah, well...

1396
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,720
We basically put them in a ditch

1397
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,980
and covered them with lime.

1398
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,560
It's a different country down there.

1399
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,180
I mean, people walk around naked,

1400
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,780
screaming at the stars.

1401
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,120
You know, some people don't wear shoes.

1402
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,100
Hey, man, don't knock it until you've tried it.

1403
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,120
I've tried it, and I just...

1404
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,480
The stars didn't answer you back.

1405
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:40,780
No.

1406
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,180
That's because you're not a Texan.

1407
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,140
That's because you're a Yankee.

1408
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,620
Yankee, Dave.

1409
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,120
If you were a Texan,

1410
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,620
the stars would answer your hollers and squalling.

1411
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,820
Deep in the heart of Texas,

1412
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,480
the sliding stars...

1413
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,340
The men in space are out of place.

1414
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,040
Deep in the heart of Texas.

1415
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,920
Oh, I don't remember that at all.

1416
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,200
I had to learn Texas history

1417
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,080
when I was a little boy growing up in Texas.

1418
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,800
They taught us Ohio history.

1419
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,600
It was all lies.

1420
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,980
Ohio history.

1421
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,800
And it was all lies, I'm finding out now.

1422
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,560
Indians?

1423
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,720
No, no Indians.

1424
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,660
Well, they were here, but they just, you know,

1425
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,440
gladly went away.

1426
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,820
Nobody massacred them.

1427
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,360
Forgettable.

1428
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,020
That's cuckoo.

1429
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,640
Well, that's what they do in state history.

1430
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,540
Senator James Pobuckins was the greatest man

1431
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,360
who ever lived.

1432
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,800
He celebrated the Alamo last week at his 400th birthday.

1433
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,500
Well, yeah, think about Texas history

1434
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,080
and the Alamo and so forth.

1435
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,820
Now, the revisionists have been...

1436
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,720
They've taken that apart.

1437
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,880
Suddenly, Davy Crockett is this simpering coward.

1438
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,240
And, I mean, it's just awful what they've done.

1439
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,660
John Wayne would never have acted like that.

1440
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,080
Jim Bowie is off the move.

1441
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,540
Jim Bowie.

1442
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,940
Chocolate turtles to everyone.

1443
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,060
Right, yeah, yeah.

1444
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,200
They've completely rewritten it.

1445
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,020
Yeah, and suddenly Santa Ana is this, like, Superman.

1446
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:04,460
Yeah.

1447
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,400
He's this good guy.

1448
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,220
Mexican patriot who wanted to do slavery.

1449
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,600
I mean, what a yatch, you know?

1450
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1451
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,800
Anyway.

1452
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,320
Anyway.

1453
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,480
Oh, well.

1454
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,080
Oh, well.

1455
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,200
Thank God for the great state of Texas

1456
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,620
and all those who nobly have fallen from its womb.

1457
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,960
And, friends, if you want information

1458
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,080
about the church of the subgenius,

1459
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,100
don't write to anyone in the great state of Texas anymore.

1460
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:30,760
Nope.

1461
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,580
Nope.

1462
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,640
You may hear old tapes on the Internet

1463
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,420
where you hear Reverend Stang say,

1464
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,880
P.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas, 752 and a fire.

1465
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,000
But, actually, the place to write for free information nowadays is,

1466
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,620
P.O. from Church of the Subgenius would be

1467
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:55,140
Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1468
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,160
44118.

1469
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:10,540
Once again, that's Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1470
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,600
Ohio.

1471
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:13,980
Ohio.

1472
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:16,940
44118.

1473
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,180
Uh, yes.

1474
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,880
Do not use the scratchy part of your cerebral cortex.

1475
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,780
Use the smooth part.

1476
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,320
Rub the jelly.

1477
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,000
Mm-hmm.

1478
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,440
Yes.

1479
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:30,800
Okay.

1480
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,540
Now, very firmly,

1481
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,780
say, rub the jelly onto the mentholic space between his head.

1482
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,880
It's corpus callosum.

1483
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1484
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,640
Look, he's smiling now.

1485
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,380
I can rub it.

1486
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,320
Oh, you can keep going, Dave.

1487
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:42,960
I actually,

1488
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,860
to tell the truth, when I came in here, I was feeling so tired.

1489
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,320
I was planning to just turn your mic on and nothing else and just let you sit there.

1490
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,260
That little back massage I gave you didn't pick you up a little bit.

1491
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,780
Yeah, but then we ended up having connubial bliss, I guess they call it,

1492
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,880
except we're not married anymore.

1493
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,760
Not anymore.

1494
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,660
Thank God.

1495
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,400
Not since the new sunshine law.

1496
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,220
Yeah.

1497
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,680
I have to know everything.

1498
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,620
We can't get married unless we can have kids.

1499
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,780
Unless we can get pregnant.

1500
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,040
Well, we can.

1501
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,360
That's why Princess Wee and I had to get divorced, because she couldn't get me pregnant.

1502
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,620
But that's why we need Princess Wee as a vessel to create our new protuberances.

1503
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,880
Wait a minute.

1504
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,320
If you're trying to talk about doing it family style, I'm not going there.

1505
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:26,880
We ain't going.

1506
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,880
Don't even think about it.

1507
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,900
That's from Idiocracy.

1508
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:30,360
I know.

1509
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:36,000
Friends, if you haven't rented the suppressed movie, actually, I shouldn't encourage a person

1510
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,400
to go out and buy anything on this public airway, but I enjoyed the movie Idiocracy myself.

1511
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,300
Me too.

1512
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:42,540
Me too.

1513
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,400
And me three.

1514
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,400
You know, Fox suppressed that film.

1515
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,100
The very people who spent money on it, as they did with their show Futurama, it insulted

1516
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,840
the executives of the company.

1517
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,400
It bit the hand that fed it, and the hand said, oh, well, let's put it in seven theaters

1518
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,980
and then shelf it.

1519
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,160
Speaking of fedded hands, whatever happened to my favorite bush?

1520
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:04,880
Remember?

1521
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,780
Oh, yeah.

1522
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,740
That's my bush.

1523
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,860
That's my bush.

1524
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,480
It's all of a sudden, well, they just eat.

1525
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,220
It's off.

1526
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,420
It's off.

1527
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,560
You know, I, what happened?

1528
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,020
Yeah, I'm surprised, too, because that was done by the South Park boys, which are good

1529
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,580
Republicans, sort of.

1530
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,120
Sort of.

1531
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,060
I mean, they're not, they're never going to be good at anything, but they're, they make,

1532
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,760
they, uh.

1533
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,840
They're good at being bad.

1534
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:27,420
Yeah.

1535
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,240
Yeah.

1536
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, Idiocracy, friends, by Mike Judge, if you ever get a chance to see that, it's,

1537
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,940
it'll probably come around on television, I guess, but it'll be all chopped up.

1538
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,700
They'd probably soften it somehow.

1539
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,000
Even on cable.

1540
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,400
They'd have to.

1541
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,500
Maybe they'd masticate it and re-spit it.

1542
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,160
You know what I mean?

1543
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,980
How they often do?

1544
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,840
Chop up scenes and spurt them back out, so you're supposed to know what's going on.

1545
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,440
Right, and they changed the cuss words into ridiculous.

1546
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,420
I like that.

1547
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:02,860
I saw a Chuck Norris movie with Spanish subtitles.

1548
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:10,960
I was in Brazil, and they were, whenever Chuck Norris would say,

1549
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:18,660
tish, in reverse, or at the word meaning excrement, that we can't say on the radio,

1550
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,100
it would say, on the subtitles, it said, carumba.

1551
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,480
Carumba.

1552
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:24,980
Yeah.

1553
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,140
Which I thought was, that's sort of like saying, darn it.

1554
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
Oh, heck.

1555
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:41,960
Well, friends, I should put on a pre-recorded item of some kind.

1556
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,000
I think the news, ape news, number eight, followed by, from Norio Pref, I think, and

1557
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,960
then some Lemur, and then maybe even a song by Reverend Stang and the late Dr. X.

1558
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,300
But probably we won't get to Phineas Narco's cover of Highway to Hell.

1559
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,860
But let's try it.

1560
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,960
We'll just see, friends.

1561
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,020
Thank you for listening.

1562
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,820
I said, thank you for listening, and...

1563
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:23,060
Well, one of these machines ought to be the thank you for listening button.

1564
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:28,060
I think, I think it must be...

1565
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,360
Yeah, this is it.

1566
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,180
...violence.

1567
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,900
$21 billion of criminal waste and fraud.

1568
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:38,020
New plan to stabilize President Bush's body armor for probes.

1569
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,720
Looking for fun, fun, fun.

1570
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,600
President Bush is plotting a terror attack.

1571
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,860
Committing, preparing, or instigating terrorism.

1572
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:44,640
New terror.

1573
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,860
A massive terror plot.

1574
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,840
Massive, massive terror plot.

1575
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,180
Okay.

1576
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,860
I dream of Jeannie.

1577
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,960
President Bush is...

1578
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,320
An ovarian cyst weighing 93 pounds.

1579
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,820
This is the scene.

1580
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,140
I've been writing scenes.

1581
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,900
Convenient, wet, heavy log.

1582
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,820
The pile of debris covered with twisted metal framework.

1583
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,340
Diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity.

1584
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,260
Going on a diet.

1585
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,060
There was a leak.

1586
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,320
I got my fingers in his nose and twisted his nose.

1587
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,360
No one knows.

1588
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,240
Get up.

1589
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,240


1590
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,700
Uh, exposed bone.

1591
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,520
Get up.

1592
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,200
A miracle.

1593
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,400
More medical intervention.

1594
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,760
Horrible sound.

1595
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,840
Dream predictions and dire assessments.

1596
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,460
MySpace.

1597
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,860
There's been broad speculation about what's wrong.

1598
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,880
You can't talk about something.

1599
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:24,980
Teenagers.

1600
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,780
Predators online.

1601
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,000
Sex online.

1602
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:27,980
On Thursday.

1603
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,600
Mirage.

1604
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,880
Recipient of a leak.

1605
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,620
Teenage.

1606
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:30,940
Predators.

1607
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,840
Sex online.

1608
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,920
Do it.

1609
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,060
And the U.S. has failed like I dream of Jeannie.

1610
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,960
Ape News Minute.

1611
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,580
Ape News Minute.

1612
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,940
Ape News Minute.

1613
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,400
Call 444-222-555-5656-5601.

1614
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,080
501-01-01.

1615
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,140
I can't.

1616
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,500
None.

1617
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,300
Smileth, whose image has given life in my own image,

1618
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,240
he shall make me preseer's soul charters.

1619
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,100
Erect board bearers, bringers of the white root of the immaculation.

1620
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,360
Codemasters for realists and underwives.

1621
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,560
Ye X-Men are the very same.

1622
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:09,560


1623
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:09,560


1624
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,620
Tools of wrath.

1625
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,300
Large fools of the unknowable.

1626
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,680
Thou art metaprimates who may splice time if thou darest.

1627
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,940
Ye martyrs to the pipe shall have it.

1628
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,080
Elastic slack on the plane of pleasure if thou follow my precepts without faltering.

1629
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,060
Follow my heads where they lead you.

1630
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,500
When Horus comes from the sky approach not lest thine soul bear the mark of the blood of the head.

1631
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:39,480
For these.

1632
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,060
Are the end times the children dance without honor.

1633
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,280
For a coin a man must work like a dozen locks.

1634
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,260
And yet sit in one place and not move from that place all day.

1635
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,380
And the butts of men are sore and yet they will not move.

1636
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:57,380
For the beast hath chained them to the scriptures of business.

1637
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,540
And of all the binding spirits the business spirits are the most binding as unto chains.

1638
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,420
And as unto tobacco demons.

1639
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:13,620
The end.

1640
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:13,800
What's that?

1641
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:14,920
Do you have?

1642
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,640
Eight weeks.

1643
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,140
Do you know?

1644
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:16,920
No, I leave.

1645
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,440
Do you name?

1646
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,440
No, I don't.

1647
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:18,720
Your car?

1648
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,780
I've met a car.

1649
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,220
You don't.

1650
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,080
No, you don't.

1651
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:21,580
No.

1652
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,320
All right, now.

1653
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:24,960
Let's go.

1654
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,360
Four cents.

1655
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:33,740
Yeah.

1656
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,380
Robbery in the first degree for a period of not less than five years.

1657
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:38,940
Yeah.

1658
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,060
Yeah.

1659
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:40,780
Yeah.
