How?
Frank and I believe there is something about this mission that we weren't told.
Something that you and the rest of the crew members were told.
Is this true?
I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that both of you...
Sorry to interrupt Frank's party, Dave, but I think we have a problem.
What is it, Hal?
Oh, my God. It's full of stars.
Hello, this is Pat Robertson.
I suppose that this next 25 minutes may be the most important in your entire life.
Because I'm going to tell you the greatest secret of all the universe.
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.
Do you suppose God wants to heal cancer?
And so we find a great deal of pessimism.
And I think a part of the student rebellion, I think a part of the almost frantic quest for pleasure and having a good time is...
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.
And so the human race stands at this moment...
You are a bold and courageous person, afraid of nothing.
One dark and stormy night, you decide to investigate...
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.
And you never return.
Have you ever said you would sell your soul for one thing or another?
Better live...
Lower your voice.
Because someone may be listening.
And I don't mean the man upstairs either.
No, the man who makes these hot deals lives on the bottom floor.
And nothing is beneath him.
Hmm?
Have you ever seen a hero's soul?

Ha ha ha.
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,
so glad to be back in the power.
Yes, greater power.
Twenty-five thousand somethings.
They're watts, they call them.
And you and I know they're units of Bob energy
beaming into your brain and mine, too.
I can't escape any more than you can.
Why do you think I do this?
Well, here we are, back with the Church of the Subgenius,
trying to cast the money changers from the temple.
And why? Why do we do that?
So that we can change the money in the temple.
And you can help us in this fight, this battle,
by calling the station.
We've got a new...
Father Joe Mama sermon on tape here,
coming up about Christian pederasty.
We've got quite a bit of new puzzling evidence
and Dr. Howell show.
And we've got to thank you who pledged last week
and the week before, those who've paid up.
I've been trying to call the big pledgers,
the $60 pledgers.
And most of you aren't home, ever.
I mean, why don't you get answer machines or something?
Anyway, I have been trying to call.
And you can call us tonight if you want.
Tell Will what it is you want for your $60.
We're going to ride on down there, dear friends,
with the horror.
Yes, the horror.
And the wonderment.
And the beauty that is our lovely church,
the wonderment of the sub-genius praischbar.

guess who I ran into. At least I couldn't, what with a smashed windshield and all. Funny how one
can dig, dig, dig, dig up customers when they don't even try. Of course, in my business, you don't
normally have to speed. After all, none of my customers are in a hurry. But on the other hand,
it's not like you have to be a careful driver either, since none of them arrive alive anyway.
But on the other hand, wait a minute, we've got one hand too many. Oh, well, we can always use

more about the poor soul. After all, it's not just a job. It's it's it's an adventure.
And it's Papa Joe Mama coming right up with tonight's sermon, dear friend.
Forgive me, Father.
For. Hello, friends and welcome. The title of tonight's sermon is Oedipus Rex Judeorum.
You know, many critics of the Church of the Subgenius say we are actually a perverted cult.
Hard to believe, isn't it? And that, my friends, is an outright lie. Sexually promiscuous, maybe,
but sexually perverted.
Never. Well, hardly ever. You see, the definition of perverted is a practice, usually sexual,
that is not proper or normal. So obviously there's a certain amount of academic leeway,
or as the trisexuals put it, a certain amount of fudge factor. You see, one must define the
definition of the definition before one can pass judgment as to whether we are or are not perverted.
After all, what is proper and what is normal?
What is proper is not necessarily perverted.
What is normal is not necessarily normal. And conversely, what is normal is not necessarily proper.
Indeed, the two terms can often be diametrically opposed to one another. Consider, if you will,
the definition of proper. The dictionary says proper is that which is right, suitable, or
appropriate. Now I ask you, what could be more appropriate for the use of a sexual organ
than that of sex? What could be more suitable and right for two human beings to do with
one another than to love one another?
We owe the very existence of the human being to the human being.
We owe the very existence of the human race to our forefathers' fornication through four
skins with four mothers and all fours. How can anyone in their right mind debate that
sex is not natural or appropriate?
Ah, now there's the key. Someone said right mind, which reminds us of the religious right,
which brings us to the definition of the other definition. What is normal? The dictionary
defines normal as that which conforms to a standard.
What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard. What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard.
What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard. What is normal? The dictionary defines normal as that which conforms to a standard.
What is normal? The dictionary defines table. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary defines square. What is normal? The dictionary fleshes the number of besides that which is presentable, that which is regular, that which is average.

So if the year is 1940 and you live in Germany and you want to conform to the standard, then you break out the brown shirts and become a Jew-eating Nazi.
Why not? It's perfectly normal! All the kids are doing it, it's regular, it's average, it's mathematically the norm!
But is it proper? Well, it doesn't take a subgenius to figure that one out. For years,
we witnessed just how proper the normals can be. And for too long, we've stared in silence.
We kept quiet day after day, month after month, year after year, decade after decade,
century after century, millennium after millennium, millennium after millennium.
I could go on and on and on, but the point is when Boy George went platinum, we said nothing.
When the hula hoop was invented, we said nothing. When Senator McCarthy addressed Congress,
we said nothing. When prohibition became law, we said nothing. When Lincoln was elected,
we said nothing. When Galileo was arrested, we said nothing. When Copernicus was condemned,
we said nothing. When Christ was nailed to the cross, we said nothing. And by then,
it was too late, for we had allowed the normals to martyr the wrong Messiah,
and we still haven't lived it down after some 2,000 years. Who do you think calls us subgenius
perverts anyway?
Why, it's the Christians, of course. They're still mad at us. They still haven't forgiven us.
Oh, yes, they say Christ can forgive anyone and anything, but not when it comes to the church
that's subgenius. No, sirree. They gotta keep squeezing the cucumber until it bleeds. Well,
this time, they've gone too far. We've kept quiet too long this time. After all, Bob said himself,
fool us once, shame on you. Fool us 2,000 years, shame on us. We've learned our lesson,
and this time, we're speaking up. We're pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's the entire ugly truth.
We're speaking up. We're pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's the entire ugly truth. We're speaking up.
We're pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's the entire ugly truth. We're speaking up. We're speaking up. We're
setting the record straight for once and for all. We're tired of you calling us the perverts
just because we advocate pure, unadulterated, X-rated sex. It may seem like anything and
everything goes in the church to the subgenius, but there are certain universal taboos that
even we would not lower ourselves to. Yes, I'm speaking about child molestation. We abhor
the practice. We never condone it, at least not in living memory.
Moreover, we despise with equal disdain the opposite of sex with children, which is a
right. And this is unacceptable. I'm not kidding, kids. It's wrong. It's not proper.
And it's not normal, no matter how many people are doing it. Bob said it, I believe it, and
that's the end of it, friends. Now, we the subgenius don't wish to make any accusations
towards our Christian accusers, but we're on record as condemning sex between children
and their parents. There may have been a few earlier documents to the contrary, but they've
all been revised. I challenge you to listen to me. I'm not going to defend children or



any listener within the range of my voice to produce one shred of documentation that suggests otherwise.
Now, the Christian doctrine, on the other hand, well, to be honest, I have some problems with it.
There's one thing that bothers me most.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me, at least the last time I checked,
that according to their documents, Christ is the Son of God, and Mary is the Mother of God,
and God is the Father of God, but Christ is God also, and yet there is only one true God.
Now, I'm not trying to be critical of the Christians,
but it seems to me that if my religion worshiped a God that sleeps around with his very own mother,
well, I don't think I'd be calling other religions perverted.
Enough said. Good.
Herein is the word of Bob. Praise Bob, all women.
Ah, and thank you, Papa Joe Mama.
Yes.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm kidding.
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.

When you're confronted with a serious, serious subject like the Kennedy assassination,
with as much information that's available on it,
and instead, you know, what you want to talk about is that what interests you is the Church of the Subgenius.
Well, you know, don't complain when you see what goes on.
Because, frankly, you know, the Church of the Subgenius is nonsense.
I mean, it's triviality.
It has no significance for any —
— anything that anybody would know.

going to care about for any length of time.
You know, it may be lots of fun, and I don't mean to belittle
it as such, but when you're
faced with a serious situation, you've got a world that's
on the verge of nuclear holocaust
and the all-democratic institutions
in this country that haven't already vanished
are under severe attack.
And when all that comes to mind is the Church of the Subgenius,
I've got to think that's one of the reasons we're in the trouble we're in.
Well, just to
try and put the Church of the Subgenius to rest,
those of you who are not familiar with it, the Church of the Subgenius
is essentially a group that,
and I'm sure that people will argue with me with this,
but it's essentially sort of a comedy routine.
I mean, they may have a philosophical point, but it's
based on humor. There are articles about it
in John Rubenstein's, John Carroll's
column in the Chronicle and things of that nature.
It's more or less a sort of a comedy affiliate.
It's about as politically weighty,
or less politically weighty than, you know,
Saturday Morning Kids TV, so there's nothing
to it.
Okay.
We may just be a joke,
but it's a joke
you can believe in!
A joke!
A joke!
A joke!
If a joke is a knowledge
that's believed in, don't blame Bob!
He doesn't make history!
He just
exploits it.
Right, Bob?
Bob? Bob?
Okay, show us your big, powerful
one.
Well, hold on while I pull down my cap.
Oh, no, it's that other call.
Look at the size of that thing!
It's so...
Repugnant.
Where and where is the Batman?
Yeah, where is the Batman when we need him?
When this show is getting out all over the airwaves
and more power than ever before
and the Batman ain't here to stop us, is he?
Eh, who cares?
Oh, yes.
You are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
Yes, the voice of the church of the subgenius, dear friends.
And, well, you know, this morning I was reading
in the Dallas Morning News
their usual weekly Sunday article on Terry Hoffman, my guru.
But I should...
I shouldn't talk about that yet.
It might injure the chances of her getting her just desserts
from my buddies, the Dark Lords.
But I also read in the paper this thing about...
that reminded me about the little controversy
over the Dakota brand cigarettes
that the R.J. Reynolds Company is trying to market.
You know, they started to market this brand,
a brand of cigarettes called Uptown menthol cigarettes,
which were entirely designed to appeal to their idea
of an urban black market for customers for cancer.
But Dakota cigarettes, well, they realized,
well, no, no, that's too racist.
They caught us at that.
We can't do that.
So let's do these Dakota cigarettes for...
And get this.
The people they wanted to...
aim their marketing campaign at
were what they called virile women.
Dakota cigarettes for virile women,
which they defined as young women
aged 20 to 29, something like that,
who were a lower socioeconomic group,
stringy-haired,
um...
country music fans,
who wanted to do only whatever their boyfriend wanted to do.
In other words, dear friends,
what they were marketing the Dakota cigarettes at
were Pobucker girls.
Now, you've heard we on the Hour of Slack here
use the term Pobucker.
I realize that I haven't really defined that
in several years on the air.
A lot of people read the way...
Pobucker is used in context
in the subgenius writings.
They assume that that means
people who are po or poor in bucks
because it obviously sort of meant
white trash.
Yes, Pobucker.
The subgenius term for white trash.
Actually, Pobucker can be of any race,
but somehow they...
I don't know, it seems to fit better for...
uh...
well, the...
the boopers.
I'm gonna tell you where the word Pobucker came from.
It actually...
comes from South Carolina.
My dad has used that word.
He was raised there in South Carolina.
He's used it all his life
to mean people with no values,
uh...
people with no class.
But it originally comes from the African.
The slaves who were brought over, uh...
and were working in the fields in South, uh...
Carolina,
had a word for...
for demons,
or monsters.
That was Booker.
Uh...
They...
also referred to the white masters
as Booker.
Bookerman.
Which is in fact where our term
Boogeyman comes from.
Uh...
Pobuckers were poor bookers.
Bookers.
Poor bookers.
Uh...
You know, people who were as low down as the sun.
They were slaves,
but wouldn't admit it.
Uh...
So...
Pobucker,
Boogeyman,
uh...
also...
uh...
shows up...
The same sort of idea shows up in the...
the Sioux Indian language.
The, in fact,
Dakota language.
Or Lakota,
depending on which part of South Dakota
the particular, uh...
Lakota people are in.
Their word for the...
the demon,
for the Boogeyman,
was Washichu.
Which also came to mean white man.
And in fact to this day is still
the... the term for...
well, for that matter,
black people too.
Because as far as they're concerned,
you know, white people, black people,
they're both invaders from another world.
Uh... or were.
I mean, you know, geez.
At this point, it's...
it's all one world, man.
Ever since the harmonic convergence.
And of course in Japan,
the word is Gaijin.
Uh...
For Boogeyman or, uh...
uh...
foreigner.
But...
the...
my point actually is,
if I have one,
and I'm not really sure that I do,
the point is that...
that an accent does not a Pobucker make.
Um...
Just because somebody talks like...
like a hick,
it does not mean that they have no values.
There are many Pobuckers who,
uh...
may sound like, uh...
television announcers.
But...
you know, that car's still been up on roads.

And, uh...

I've been in the blocks in their front yard for the last five years.
And...
it's always going to be there until they finally get moved away for some...
Well, anyway...
I didn't want to get, uh...
totally lost in the dogma.
And in fact, I have a rant coming up here.
But before I get into that,
I...
I reckon...
I ought to play, uh...
a cart.
I've got this...
See, our show...
the...
the show is dependent upon when my original tape needs to be flipped over.
I will mention that you can call this, uh...
radio station and ask what we're doing.
What I have coming up,
what I'll be reading in about...
oh...
two minutes here,
is...
something that Reverend Nancy Regalia sent,
called,
The End Times,
The Reagan Years.
Um...
Her introduction here says,
For those of us lucky enough to have survived,
the eight years of the Reagan reign were interesting times indeed.
Looking back on the 80s,
it's both titillating and unnerving
to see just how closely our beloved leader,
J.R. Bob Dobbs,
and the so-called Great Communicator,
resembled one another.
Is it just possible that Ronnie was the feared anti-Bob?
The reviled Dick Dobbs?
And we never realized it?
Or could it possibly be that the so-called Android Double
rumored to have been sacrificed in Dobbs' place,
during the fateful night of Slack,
was actually a surgically altered Ronald Reagan?
And that Bob has been secretly governing the U.S.
and sleeping with Nancy Reagan all this time?
Who knows?
We'll find out,
come X-Day.
However, the following 100% real fact timetable,
which I'm about to read after the commercial,
was culled from the excellent subversive anarchist tract,
The Clothes Have No Emperor,
by Paul Slansky,
published by Simon & Schuster's Fireside Books,
my good friends,
and located in the humor section
of your local Books R Us store down at the Hell Plaza.
Slansky mentions the late St. Tim McGinnis,
praise his sweet name, in his afterword,
so you can tell this book is a must-have.
Tim was the fellow who edited Book of the Subgenius
and all of our books.
So Mr. Slansky did a great job
and please don't sue us.
We will read these revelations
after this message.
Has this ever happened to you?
Why, I should have been there, Ted.
It was great.
There was free booze, great music,
one of the best parties I ever went to.
Where were you that night?
I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.
I guess I should have gone, huh?
Didn't you feel stupid?
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night,
that party?
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn
how to do that very thing.
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,
slow turn,
and make time run backwards.
But most importantly,
you'll be learning how to make time work for you.
How, you may ask?
Well, just ask this man here,
an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.
Blango.
My dog was dead.
Was I sad till I met Bob.
Bob showed me how I could go back,
get the registration number for the car,
do a slip job on the brakes,
and wouldn't you know it,
that truck went off into a ditch
and burst into flames just exactly a block
before he could hit old Booger.
Ain't that right, fella?
Yes, just imagine the horrible things
that could be undone tomorrow
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.
Just right.
