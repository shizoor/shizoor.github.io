1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
So, I was like, you got a new spot?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,500
Reverend Stangy's back?

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,820
Yeah, yeah, finally back.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,660
Finally back?

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,920
Finally, glad to be back in Cleveland.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,800
You know, I...

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,820
Actually, we have a sad show tonight

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,960
because a famous comedian

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,420
who was a big influence

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,640
on a lot of the subgenius type of humor

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
died just a couple of days ago.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,260
He wasn't somebody I knew,

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,160
but he was somebody that I felt like I knew, you know?

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,300
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,940
Okay, okay.

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,560
He's a member of a group called the Fire Sign Theater.

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,180
Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:34,960
Okay.

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,320
It happens.

20
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,040
It happens.

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,820
That's what goes with being a life form.

22
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,580
Hey, we all gotta go.

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
Go, go, go.

24
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,300
What are we doing?

25
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,800
Oh, yeah.

26
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,140
Tonight on the show,

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,260
we're gonna have the Thumb Brothers,

28
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,520
Hangnail and Sneaky.

29
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,100
They're gonna be with us.

30
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,320
Wonderful, wonderful.

31
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,660
Oh, the I Ching for this evening.

32
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,600
We might as well get to this

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
in the slow part of the show here at the beginning.

34
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,320
Deliverance.

35
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,620
When heaven and earth deliver themselves,

36
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,140
thunder and rain set in.

37
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,240
When the thunder and rain set in,

38
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,820
the seed pods of all fruits, plants, and trees break open.

39
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,380
The time of deliverance is great indeed.

40
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,800
That's wonderful to hear.

41
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,720
Very good indeed.

42
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,080
The Crawford brothers are gonna be here tonight.

43
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,120
The Crawford brothers?

44
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,240
Broderick and Joan, yes.

45
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,680
It's gonna be a nice time.

46
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,480
There's a Russian poet.

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,020
He's gonna read Leaves of Grass.

48
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,480
Yeah, Ubon the Terrible.

49
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Ubon.

50
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,120
Ubon the Terrible.

51
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,780
That's a German pronunciation.

52
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,080
Oh, there's gonna be a music.

53
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,800
There's gonna be a musical group here later on.

54
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,040
The Dreadful Great are gonna be here.

55
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,720
The Dreadful Great?

56
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah, Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

57
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,140
Harry Truman, Adolf Hitler, and Abraham Lincoln.

58
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,480
Is that Adolf Hitler I or Adolf Hitler II?

59
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,100
Both.

60
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,360
Both. All three of them.

61
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,380
Good evening.

62
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,400
This is Louis Marshman speaking for myself

63
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,100
and my thousands of fellow professionals

64
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,620
who, like myself, are responsible for speaking to you

65
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,080
as I am at this time.

66
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,140
We are all involved in a national movement

67
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,140


68
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,680
that is the result of a global news emergency

69
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,480
of such magnitude that only now can we pause for a moment

70
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,820
to distort its proportions back to our own limited perspective.

71
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,180
The credibility gap now stretches beyond the international dateline

72
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,620
so that lies fabricated in the foreign press

73
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,600
are repudiated in our local papers the day before they appear

74
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,420
in the country of their origin.

75
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,300
The advance of science now allows us to bounce our information

76
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,340
off the planet Saturn, but none of it has returned,

77
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,520
leaving our global home bereft of news.

78
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,380
And so, concerned citizens like myself sit here tonight

79
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,740
with absolutely nothing of any importance to say.

80
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,640
Then let it be said, not to enlighten, but to inform.

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Our generation has achieved failure at the cost of its own success.

82
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,340
And our great-great-grandchildren are paying for that powerful failure.

83
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,040
But they're too young to work in the dark,

84
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,220
so we must lend them the little immense energy left

85
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,500
to help them shoulder that important task.

86
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,500


87
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,720
The world is now a place of fear.

88
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,540
The world is now a place of fear.

89
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,320
We have learned to hoard despair and make it pay great dividends.

90
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,020
The shadow of a chicken in every pot.

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
The freeways jammed with empty holiday cars.

92
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,800
One hundred million television sets turned to face the wall.

93
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,920
Yes, a rich land with cream in the coffee bread lines in their palms.

94
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,480
And yet, we have to face the wall.

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,480


96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,480


97
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,840
But the memory banks are closing,

98
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,940
because our youth and the young at heart refuse to gossip the good talk,

99
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,360
refuse to dance on the grid, refuse to even pretend to be duped.

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,380
And a nation that can't be duped can't be made fun of itself.

101
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,640
I, and every other mind sewn together in this great circle of world thought,

102
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,720
gave up the declining years of their boyhood,

103
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,300
beat off every desire and phantom lover,

104
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,960
to conjure up all the little people on the billboards you've loved to eat so much.

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Crunchy Caramel, Mr. Peanut, Captain Crunch, Snappy Tom, Little Bite-Sized Godzilla.

106
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,320
They're the children of my career.

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,860
Throw them in the gutter, and you drown my breakfast.

108
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,740
So come on, let's be kids again.

109
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,780
Let's listen to the radio and spoil our appetites.

110
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,700
Let's put on daddy's shoes and invent the atom bomb.

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,840
Or at least let's say we did it.

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,120
Or at very least, let's start storing up some respect for the people whose job it is to tell us about it.

113
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,200
Actors and soldiers are people too, you know.

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,220
There's one at your door right now, reading your number.

115
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,560
Let him in.

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,380
Just because he's got a snappy uniform on doesn't mean he isn't a cripple.

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,020
Just because I'm talking to millions of you doesn't mean I'm not lonely.

118
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
So give us a dime.

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Or give us a call.

120
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
But for God's sake, don't give us away.

121
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,280
Thank you.

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
And now back to the news.

123
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,940
This has been an important editorial from the management of this radio station.

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
You're normally such a slacker.

125
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,940
It's the first time you've heard of him.

126
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,580
Shoes for industry.

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,580
Shoes for the dead.

128
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,640
Shoes for industry.

129
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,280
Hi, I'm Joe Beetz.

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,080
Hey, what chances does a returning deceased war veteran have for that good paying job, more sugar, and the free mule you've been dreaming of?

131
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,260
Well, think it over.

132
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,900
Then take off your shoes.

133
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,320
Now you can see how increased spending opportunities means harder work for everyone.

134
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,680
And more of it, too.

135
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,300
So do your part today, Joe.

136
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,160
Join with millions of your neighbors and turn in your shoes.

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
For industry.

138
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Yes?

139
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,560
That was a nice break.

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,500
You have some correspondence?

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,020
Shall I read?

142
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,260
I could read finally after all three weeks of promising.

143
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,820
I shall read a Richard Brautigan poem.

144
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,760
Real fast and loud.

145
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,700
Fast and loud.

146
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,320
Let's hear it.

147
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,660
I like to think, in the sooner the better, of a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky.

148
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:13,660
I like to think, right now please, of a cybernetic forest filled with pines and electronics where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms.

149
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:24,460
I like to think, it has to be, of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over.

150
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,660
By machines of loving grace.

151
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,740
That's a nice idea.

152
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,600
I like his head.

153
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,740
He has a nice head.

154
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,360
Then I drunk a gene physic and got drunk.

155
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,140
I met Jake, my son.

156
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,400
And he says, Father we'll have a good time.

157
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:40,760
Here comes Mr. Brodeck.

158
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,480
He is an oakum fiend.

159
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,480
Smoke's oakum.

160
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,660
Every night he got a million dollars.

161
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,660
Last night he says, Father I feel bad.

162
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,000
I think I'll go to St. Louis.

163
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,680
Then he took a silver pencil filled with white water out of his pocket and shoot it in his arm and he got a million dollars.

164
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,680


165
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,680


166
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,680


167
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,680


168
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,680


169
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:54,680


170
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,540
And in two minutes, he was governor of New York.

171
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,420
One more shoot, and he would be president of the United States.

172
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,100
He gave me a shoot once.

173
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,460
I got so foolish, I paid the rent.

174
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,180
I go back to Yale with Peter Bergman.

175
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,700
And when I first got there, I connected up with the Yale Dramat.

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,720
And Peter wrote the lyrics for two musicals that I did while I was at Yale.

177
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,460
And we maintained a connection after Yale that eventually led to my getting together with him

178
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,880
in Los Angeles when I was out there after doing a show called The Amorous Flea, a musical there.

179
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:37,220
And I discovered he was the Wizard of Oz doing this late-night talk, counterculture, phone-in show

180
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,680
on KPFK, listener-supported radio.

181
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,800
And that's where I started playing with him on the radio.

182
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,600
Met the other two guys, Phil Lawson and David Osman.

183
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,160
We discovered we were all fire signs.

184
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,960
I'm a Leo.

185
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,860
He was a Sagittarian, as is David Osman.

186
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,440
And I was a Leo.

187
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,040
And Austin's an Aries.

188
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,620
So we quite foolishly named ourselves the Oz Fire Sign Theater,

189
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,180
which later just became the Fire Sign Theater.

190
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,500
It is a constant source of confusion and happiness to many people.

191
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,720
Now, patient, you have ten seconds to tell us what you've got and beat the Reaper!

192
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm shaking feverishly.

193
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,740
My hands are all...

194
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,380
I'm turning yellow.

195
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,820
My God, I've got jaundice.

196
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
Jaundice it is!

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,380
Give it to me!

198
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,780
So when you first met him, do you remember what you thought about his personality?

199
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,760
Yes!

200
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:44,620
I mean, he was bursting with creativity and smart as a whip and very gregarious and outgoing

201
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,820
constantly all his life.

202
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,180
And that never changed.

203
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,280
He was just the kind of person that you liked being around because he was...

204
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:53,960
always in...

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,980
He was informative and funny.

206
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,080
Peter was also very lefty and very opinionated.

207
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,180
Yeah, when...

208
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,160
At Yale, he was like a...

209
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,360
He got a B.A. in radical ideas.

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,220
What can I say?

211
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,000
He was a Rhodes Scholar at some point.

212
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:14,840
You know, I don't know all of his history, but I know that he was involved in studies of labor and politics.

213
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,080
And he remained fixated with that vision all his life.

214
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Now, according to Wikipedia, it says that Peter claimed to...

215
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,900
You've coined the word love-in in 1967.

216
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Yeah, he had a...

218
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,440
This is part of the promotions for Radio Free Oz.

219
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
And he had an event in Elysian Park.

220
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,460
I participated in it, pretending to be a Russian expatriate poet named Yuri Gafnov.

221
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,860
And he drew a huge crowd, thousands of people.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,700
But he did.

223
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,720
He called it the love-in, coined the phrase so far as I know.

224
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,660
Yes, friends.

225
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,880
As you probably...

226
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:59,760
Peter Bergman of the Firesign Theater boarded the saucers prematurely.

227
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,900
On March 8th, he died of complications from leukemia.

228
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,880
He was born in 1939 and was 72.

229
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,460
And he was doing Firesign podcasts up until the day he died.

230
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,500
Friends, the Firesign Theater kept me alive when I had no girl for that.

231
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,260
And they accidentally gave me a career to boot.

232
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Speaking for all the old-timey radio subgeniuses,

233
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,060
we probably owe Firesign Theater more than we do Robert Anton Wilson,

234
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,560
the Zap comic artist, Ray Harryhausen, or the Mothers of Invention.

235
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,040
Maybe even as much as the old Warner Brothers cartoon people.

236
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,100
And that's saying something.

237
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,400
The weird Saint Jeroen of Amsterdam told us on tape,

238
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,240
While you're alive, you better make a...

239
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,500
lot of noise, because when you die, you shut up like hell.

240
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,420
Saint Peter Bergman lived that way.

241
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,520
Praise Peter.

242
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,500
His biography is on the FiresignTheater.com website.

243
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,660
Theater spelled with R-E at the end, not E-R.

244
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,840
And I'm going to read it.

245
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,300
I didn't know a lot of this.

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,420
Peter Bergman was born in Cleveland, Ohio.

247
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:21,900


248
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,100
The day after Russian invaded Finland and the day before Winston Churchill,

249
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,080
Peter's hero, turned 65.

250
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Peter's comic career began in the 6th grade,

251
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,200
writing comic poems for his mother for library class,

252
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,940
a penchant that developed into co-authoring the 9th grade humor column,

253
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,880
The High Hatters, and his own creation,

254
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,220
Look and See with Peter B., for his high school newspaper.

255
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,360
Peter's audio career was launched in high school

256
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,880
as an announcer on the school radio station,

257
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:51,880


258
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:51,880


259
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:51,880


260
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,680
the radio system, from which he was banished

261
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,200
after his unauthorized announcement

262
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,360
that the Chinese communists had taken over the school

263
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,340
and that a, quote, mandatory voluntary assembly

264
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,220
was to take place immediately.

265
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,860
Russell Rupp, the school principal,

266
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,280
promptly relieved Peter of his announcing gig.

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,480
And this is very similar to my high school radio history, by the way.

268
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,480
Rupp was the inspiration for the principal poop character

269
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,780
on Don't Crush That Dwarf.

270
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,620
Hand me the pliers.

271
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,940
While attending high school,

272
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,860
Peter formed his first recording group called The Four Candidates,

273
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,640
turning out a single titled Attention Convention,

274
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,080
parodying the 1956 Democratic Convention.

275
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,820
It received airplay in Cleveland and Pittsburgh.

276
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,400
At college, Peter was managing editor of the Yale Comedy magazine.

277
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,560
He wrote the lyrics for two musical collaborations

278
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,240
with Austin Pendleton,

279
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,880
a close friend, incidentally.

280
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,240
of Princess Wee's family,

281
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,120
both of which starred Phil Proctor.

282
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,460
He graduated as a scholar of the House in Economics

283
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,540
and played point guard for the liberal basketball league,

284
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,640
whose members have since lost their dribble,

285
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
but not their politics.

286
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,760
Peter spent two graduate years at Yale

287
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,040
as a Carnegie Teaching Fellow in Economics

288
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,840
and as the Eugene O'Neill Playwriting Fellow

289
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,880
at the Drama School.

290
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,580
Quite a fellow.

291
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,380
After a six-month stint as a grunt

292
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,880
in the U.S. economy,

293
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,380
he went to Berlin on a Ford Foundation fellowship.

294
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,240
There he wrote and directed his first film, Flowers,

295
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
and connected with the living theater,

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,620
a major influence on his art.

297
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,900
Peter worked briefly in London with Spike Milligan

298
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,720
and the BBC

299
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,760
of Goon Show Famousness

300
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,340
before returning to America in 1966,

301
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,300
where he secured a nightly radio show

302
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,100
on Pacifica's KPFK in Los Angeles.

303
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,860
Radio shows were his first,

304
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,860


305
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,860


306
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,860


307
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,860


308
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,080
Radio Free Oz,

309
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,540
around which the Fireside Theater coalesced and gestated.

310
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,020
Peter coined the term Love Inn in 1967

311
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,300
and threw the first such event in April

312
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,040
of that same year in Los Angeles.

313
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,680
That event ultimately drew a crowd of some 65,000 people

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,680
blocking freeways for miles.

315
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,260
This so impressed Gary Usher of Columbia Records

316
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,060
that he offered the Fireside Theater

317
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,400
their first record contract.

318
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,880
In the 1970s,

319
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,640
1970s, Peter diversified his comic career as president of a film equipment company.

320
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,340
They made the first affordable flatbed editing table, the Showcron, which I used for years on

321
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,800
my day job as a film cutter. He also helped produce a machine for viewing angiocardiograms

322
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,320
and measuring the blockage of the arteries of the heart. In the 1980s, Peter turned to film and

323
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,040
tape, producing the comic feature J-Men Forever with Phil Proctor, as well as producing television

324
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,240
shows that featured members of Firesign. Starting in 1995, Peter began turning the country as a

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:08,980
quote, high-tech comedian, unquote, delivering lectures and keynote speeches to computer-oriented

326
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,220
companies and conventions. He worked on publishing the website for one of the candidates for mayor

327
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,140
of Los Angeles. His latest venture, in association with St. David Osman,

328
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,080
started in the summer of 2010, the podcast revival of Radio Free Oz. So ends the bio.

329
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,520
Thanks for everything, Peter, and I do mean everything. Were it not for you and your friends,

330
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:42,100
there'd probably be no Church of the Subgenius, but not with me running it, and possibly no me

331
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,800
at all. We only met once, but you were there when I needed you, long, long before that happened.

332
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,780
I owe you big time. Catch you on the flip-flop.

333
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,360
It's all right, it's all right. The electrician called the plimey.

334
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,540
Ah, I have an address.

335
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,060
You do have an address?

336
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,600
I have an address where one can send away and buy the best hashish and cannabis indus.

337
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,500
Ah!

338
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:13,560


339
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,660
Ah!

340
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,960
Ah!

341
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,140
Ah!

342
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,640
Ah!

343
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:17,900
Ah!

344
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,560
Ah!

345
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:18,960


346
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:18,980


347
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:18,980


348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,000


349
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,000


350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,000


351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,000


352
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,020


353
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,020


354
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,020


355
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,020


356
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,020


357
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,040


358
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,040


359
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,040


360
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,040


361
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,040


362
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,220
Ah!

363
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


364
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


365
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


366
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


367
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


368
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


369
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,220


370
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,540
Ah!

371
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,400
Ah!

372
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,280
Ah!

373
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


374
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


375
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


376
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


377
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


378
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


379
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


380
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


381
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


382
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


383
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


384
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


385
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


386
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


387
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


388
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


389
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


390
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


391
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,280


392
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,560
No repeats. That's it.

393
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,180
No repeats?

394
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:28,640
That's it.

395
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,320
You aren't saying anything more.

396
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,560
Best hashish and cannabis indus.

397
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,080
Did anybody win the contest yet?

398
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Oh, did anybody win the contest?

399
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,760
No, we have a few letters.

400
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,140
We have been having letters from lots of people.

401
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,680
Here's one, for example.

402
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,320
Gentlemen, never lower Tilly's pants.

403
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,140
Mama might come home.

404
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,140
Commonly thought to mean Vietnam is a TV show.

405
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,520
Actually, it's slang for spiteful.

406
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,760
gyrose gesticulate electrically.

407
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,340
No.

408
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,620
That's not it, and neither was anything else.

409
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,500
Which twins the clone?

410
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,860
Well, the answer may surprise you, but not...

411
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,780
Salamander.

412
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Salamander.

413
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,660
If you say this enough, a terrarium should slowly start to form around you, within you,

414
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,440
without you.

415
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,920
Around it by a thin, thin, thin, all-digital shell, and inside, it's delicious.

416
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,040
In fact, these are the only genuine, genetically modified, semi-organic whole beef halves endorsed

417
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,700
by the Firesign Theater themselves.

418
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,700
Don't believe me?

419
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,200
I wouldn't.

420
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,300
Just ask this one here.

421
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,940
Well, you know, Harv, the greatest thing about these little honeys is not...

422
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,980
Here, look at this.

423
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,360
Just pull the wings off, and they don't scream too much.

424
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,140
They're the perfect snack for Todd or Maude to accompany the next broadcast of the Firesign

425
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,780
Theater Fools in Space on XM Satellite Radio.

426
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,960
And, uh, when would this be heard?

427
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,080
A clem?

428
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,900
A clem?

429
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,100
I don't know, but, uh, I'll bet this announcer does.

430
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,120
The richly textured sounds of the Firesign Theater's Fools in Space can be heard Saturdays

431
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,100
at 9 p.m. in the East, 6 p.m. in the West, Tuesdays at 3 p.m. in the East, 12 noon in

432
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,940
the West, and Thursdays at 3 a.m. in the East and midnight in the West.

433
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,820
And to aid those who are legalists, perhaps the next quadrennial manual should have printed

434
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,820
on the cover in large letters, this is not God's word, but a necessary.

435
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,680
Crutch.

436
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,200
Here, here.

437
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,640
Here, here.

438
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,020
Time for that.

439
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,640
What?

440
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,800
This was on the table when I walked in tonight.

441
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,540
I gotta watch what they leave on the table.

442
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,940
Why buy a farm, Orgy?

443
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,740
Now that you're out of high school and you've come here to the bank to find out what to

444
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,320
do with the rest of your miserable little life, I'd like to ask you the question that

445
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,620
all financial counselors are asking people like you, why buy a farm?

446
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,060
Mr. Jones, why should I buy a farm?

447
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,220
I'm glad you asked, Orgy.

448
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,880
Some men buy farms for a livelihood, some for preservation of investment capital, and some

449
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,580
for a spatula.

450
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:46,900
Orgy?

451
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:46,900


452
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:46,900


453
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,120
For preservation.

454
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,020
Other men want farms because of a strong desire to return to the modernized version of the

455
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,280
environment they lived in and enjoyed as a boy.

456
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,220
We're flowing through the estate over your grandmother's paisley shawl.

457
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,160
I like the way you talk.

458
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,500
Hello, dear friends.

459
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,660
This is Eric Burton.

460
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,320
Yes, they did take away our music, but now you can have it back on these three wonderful

461
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,900
voice prints of the city.

462
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,340
The 60s.

463
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,740
All your magic memories of flying over the music capitals of the world will come rushing

464
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,340
back with the first twang of a lead guitar.

465
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,200
Now listen to all the monsters of the 60s at once.

466
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:35,540
The Rolling Who, Derek and the Taylors, Clive Beadle, Bing Crosby Stills and Ogden Nash.

467
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:43,280
Songs like I've Got My Hand on Your Mouse, Helicopter 59, Tight Shoes, I'll Be Gumping

468
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,860
You, and hundreds of others.

469
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,300
Goodness gracious.

470
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,760
Great God almighty.

471
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
It's like having now right in your living room.

472
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,520
So don't wait till the midnight hour.

473
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:59,740
Send 15 seconds in code or credit to Rocker Roll Memory Bank, Hong Kong, New York, York.

474
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:12,060
In the light of that, I should like to read a revolutionary statement for our time, which

475
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,900
I found here.

476
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,120
That's the bourgeoisie.

477
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,840
March for one.

478
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,740
Okay.

479
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,820
Here it is.

480
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,400
No power to anybody.

481
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,300
That's right, drughead.

482
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,420
That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right

483
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,040
of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government, laying its foundation

484
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,840
on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely

485
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,900
to affect their safety and happiness.

486
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
That's what it says right there.

487
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,600
You know what, drughead?

488
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,580
So I think it's time.

489
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,840
Why change it?

490
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes.

491
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,500
You know what you can do?

492
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,880
What kind of a man is it?

493
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,020
You can forget it.

494
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,740
You remember that old high school phrase, forget it, kid.

495
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,260
Well, that's what you can do.

496
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,720
If you forget the government, it'll go away.

497
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,200
Right.

498
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,860
For an Irishman like myself, it's rewarding to see a potato like you in such a position

499
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,040
of industrial responsibility.

500
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:12,280
And now, ladies and gentlemen, and particularly the ladies, this station takes great pleasure

501
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,980
in bringing you that little Frenchman who's been tickling your face.

502
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


503
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


504
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


505
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


506
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


507
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


508
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


509
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


510
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


511
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,040
The palates all over this universe.

512
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,220
Our own fresh chef.

513
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,840
Hello, lady.

514
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,800
Take off your dress, slip into someone comfortable, and tie up your little apron.

515
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,040
Be ready for some French cooking.

516
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,700
And I'm your host, the French fresh chef.

517
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,120
Today, ladies, thank you.

518
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,720
Bonjour.

519
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,820
Bonjour, chérie.

520
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,980
Today, ladies, potatoes in syrup.

521
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,900
You will need one half pound.

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,740
One half pound of slag.

523
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,180
This is skinned slag.

524
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,460
That is, you know, you mustn't pick the pulpy ones, although it's spotted with gray.

525
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,680
It's needlessly expensive, and you won't be satisfied.

526
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,580
We need an ounce of very sweet, dry, crystallized sugar.

527
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,840
Two pounds of potatoes, soft with yellow skin.

528
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,180
And, of course, wine of sufficient quantity.

529
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,640
We are now ready to begin step one, the peeling.

530
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,820
Take it off.

531
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,680
Take it all off.

532
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
Oh, thank you.

533
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,680
Thank you.

534
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,140
Now, step two.

535
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,720
Integrately, ladies, gently.

536
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,560
Disengage and take the potatoes into small dimensions, like this.

537
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,040
Let them to cook during ten minutes in boiling wine and hot oil, lightly perfumed.

538
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,960
I'm using my favorite wine, of course, on the Thunderbird label, Nippon Cadet, Oat 69.

539
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,020
Now, step three, ladies.

540
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,300
Taste them.

541
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,180
Mmm.

542
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,460
And pour the potatoes in cold water to make goose pimples.

543
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,280
Ah!

544
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,080
Good.

545
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,440
Now, test them again.

546
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,360
Then, and this is very important, that you do it loving them.

547
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,060
You must ep-loosh them.

548
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,460
Finally, slip them into a casserole.

549
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,880
Cover it with this crystallized sugar.

550
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,520
Oh, the entire potatoes, please.

551
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Remember now, cover them with water and let it set for sufficient time to be very sweet,

552
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,300
just until the potatoes become transparent.

553
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,020
Serve them cold.

554
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,820
Like dessert.

555
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,100
That's it, ladies.

556
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,620
Eat hearty.

557
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:26,240
And until next week, my sylvan beauties, this is the fresh chef.

558
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,240
Oh!

559
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,740
Oh!

560
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,940
Saying bon appetit.

561
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,260
Ginsberg!

562
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,440
Ginsberg!

563
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:35,840


564
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,020


565
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,740
Ginsberg!

566
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,940
Ginsberg!

567
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,500
Ginsberg!

568
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,500


569
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,500


570
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,500


571
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,500


572
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,500


573
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,540
Ginsberg!

574
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,760
Ginsberg!

575
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,460
Ginsberg!

576
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,100
Ginsberg!

577
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,260
Ginsberg!

578
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,360
And this is the grand gCAR.

579
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,880
Conservatist time!

580
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,160
No problem!

581
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,200


582
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
Have a good weekend.

583
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,560
And I've wanted you this year and to pay trás Healing Greece where ever.

584
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,260

may

588
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,000

589
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,300
That's me.

590
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,300


591
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,220
To

592
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,240

594
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:15,660


595
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,080
You

596
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,420
Can

597
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,680
see our boy at the back.

598
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,080
Dog food for the doggy?

599
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,260
Well, doggone it,

600
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,360
we've got all six varieties

601
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,260

602
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,840
Talk to Charlie Cranepool,

603
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,700
Ed's dad,

604
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,440
at our liquor department

605
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
about Choice USDA

606
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,100
bourbon and rump roast

607
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,160
cocktail party mix.

608
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,140
Last and least,

609
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,360
there's plenty of seasick

610
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,940
fresh produce

611
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,000
at our vegetable counter.

612
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,120
Don't worry about the flies,

613
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,100
we won't weigh them.

614
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
So weary shoppers,

615
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,160
take the lift out of life

616
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,120
and drop your load

617
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,040
on the giant toad.

618
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,200
We give double discounted

619
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,380
multiple identity stamps!

620
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,360
Oh, this is the department

621
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,160
of Christmas presents

622
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,220
I forgot to give David.

623
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,980
Wow.

624
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,740
Down Mamory Lane.

625
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,380
For you, David.

626
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,220
Phil Yottamotto.

627
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,560
A small cellophane bag

628
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,300
of what I think are

629
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,000
Chinese non-psychedelic mushrooms.

630
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,040
Labeled Cloud Ears.

631
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,480
Cloud Ears?

632
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,840
Cloud Ears.

633
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,340
It was the war

634
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,460
against the cloud clam.

635
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,500
That was the booty.

636
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,280
Oh, that's nice.

637
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,180
Being sold now in Chinatown

638
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,000
in Los Angeles.

639
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,260
I'll pin it up above my desk

640
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,840
along with the rest of the ears.

641
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,620
Right.

642
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,460
Thank you.

643
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,520
As ears go by.

644
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,120
It's an old...

645
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,340
Come in.

646
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:18,780
Come in.

647
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,160
Huh?

648
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
I'm not expecting this.

649
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,200
Oh.

650
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,420
It's U-Band the Terrible.

651
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,900
Hello.

652
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,800
Oh.

653
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,780
Hi there.

654
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,620
Send me over.

655
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,540
Clayton.

656
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,860
Thank you, thank you,

657
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,600
thank you, thank you.

658
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,380
Maledets, Tavareschi.

659
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,720
Oh, it's so nice

660
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,460
to have you here.

661
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:34,860
Prekrasna.

662
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,700
Prekrasna.

663
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,760
How are you, Terrible?

664
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,400
Oh, wonderful.

665
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,920
Listen, I've got

666
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,980
some great poems

667
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,020
from the Russian Underground

668
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,920
that I'd like to read

669
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,340
for you today.

670
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,800
Prekrasna.

671
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
How are the subways?

672
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,640
Horror show.

673
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,320
What a horror show.

674
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,760
Horror show.

675
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,060
And they're just like

676
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,940
dvoryets, you know,

677
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,660
which is the Russian word

678
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,380
for palaces.

679
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,580
They have magnificent statues

680
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,800
of strong men

681
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,700
and beautiful women.

682
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,220
Not necessarily in that order.

683
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,820
Strong men

684
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,440
and beautiful women?

685
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,260
Yes, and pictures of Lenin

686
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,700
and all those other

687
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,460
groovy cats.

688
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:02,960
Lenin all hang out,

689
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,400
isn't that what it says?

690
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,580
Yes, that's what it says

691
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,960
in Russian.

692
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,480
Prekrasna.

693
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,260
And I hang them

694
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,760
on the grocery wall.

695
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

696
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,240
Well, folks,

697
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,480
what can I do for you

698
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,780
today?

699
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,020
Mr. Liverface,

700
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
you're a butcher.

701
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,000
You're up to your knees

702
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
in fresh-killed meat

703
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,820
every day.

704
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,440
What's the best food

705
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,240
for my dog?

706
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,780
Give him what every dog

707
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,680
loves to eat.

708
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,500
Cat.

709
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,320
Cat?

710
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

711
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,940
No, I'm serious.

712
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,340
There's enough proteins

713
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,980
and minerals

714
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,440
in a teeny kitty's body

715
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,700
to keep a big dog

716
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,640
healthy and happy

717
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,560
all day.

718
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,600
And there's a full litter

719
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,240
of kitties

720
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
in every can

721
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,700
of my Mr. Liverface

722
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,380
dead cat dog food.

723
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,460
Well, that's good.

724
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:44,920
That's all right

725
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,180
for our little doggy

726
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,380
Ronnie, Mr. L.

727
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,920
But what do we feed

728
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,500
our cat?

729
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,460
Dog.

730
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,780
Not Ronnie.

731
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,940
Not Ronnie, wife bait.

732
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,500
But there's a full pound

733
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,180
of ground pound hound

734
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,060
in every can

735
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,200
of Mr. Liverface

736
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,040
dead dog cat food.

737
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,280
We'll take one of each.

738
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,400
You are one of each.

739
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,920
Oh, dogs and cats,

740
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,260
cats and dogs,

741
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,300
your pets can eat them all.

742
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,240
They run through my yard.

743
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,940
I whop them

744
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,480
with a stick

745
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,540
and I hang them

746
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,480
on the grocery wall.

747
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,660
Oh, oh, oh.

748
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,860
Well, I think it's wonderful

749
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:20,920
for a Friday.

750
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,060
I really got into that, too.

751
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,860
Everybody should go by

752
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,420
and see that.

753
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,140
Fried chicken stand

754
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,720
right in front of the old zoo,

755
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,600
you know, and you get

756
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,500
these weird legs,

757
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,320
but they're all covered

758
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,860
with batter.

759
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,980
That is a chicken, chicken.

760
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,180
That's hippopotamus

761
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,840
as they serve.

762
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,800
Oh, come on.

763
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,440
Oh, yeah.

764
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,520
Every once in a while

765
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,000
you'll get them.

766
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,140
A tongue stick

767
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
that weighs 800 pounds,

768
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,060
I tell you, this is chicken.

769
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,500
It's got batter on it.

770
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:39,980
An ibex.

771
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,400
$1.90. Half pound of ibex. Something that looks a lot like a sheep head, right?

772
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,560
Right.

773
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,960
Or a zebra foot.

774
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,920
They got a little batter on it.

775
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,680
This is a leg.

776
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,360
You want to know

777
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,480
how the Eskimos feel about it?

778
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,200
This is how the Eskimos

779
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,800
feel about it.

780
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,880
The Eskimos have a word for it.

781
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,460
Right.

782
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,420
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

783
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,780
The greatest peril of life

784
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,900
lies in the fact

785
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,700
that human food

786
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,800
consists entirely

787
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,000
of souls.

788
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,700
Hmm.

789
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,220
All the creatures

790
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,520
that we have to kill and eat,

791
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
all those that we have to strike down

792
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,840
and destroy

793
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,080
and make clothes for ourselves,

794
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,820
have souls like we have.

795
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,340
Souls do not perish

796
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,040
with the body

797
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,320
and which must therefore

798
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,700
be propitiated

799
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,380
lest they be destroyed.

800
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,380


801
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,660
Lest they should revenge themselves,

802
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,580
Sonos,

803
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,220
for taking away their bodies.

804
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,400
Why without propitiating

805
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,740
next to the eagle

806
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,900
and thinking about that?

807
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,380
Man, Jesus.

808
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:22,380


809
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,560
Souls flowing everywhere.

810
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,220
It's a constant flow of souls.

811
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,740
What is?

812
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,300
What is?

813
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,340
When propitiating.

814
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,200
Propitiating?

815
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,420
Yeah.

816
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,000
There's a...

817
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,220
Are you drunk again, Pastor?

818
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,840
Yes.

819
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,980
Yes, I am.

820
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,540
You've gotten

821
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,160
bummed in the vestry again.

822
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,940
Yes, I am.

823
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,160
No, I got a bum in the vestry.

824
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,780
Yes.

825
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,160
Yes.

826
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,720
I got a bum in the vestry

827
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,700
and I got a...

828
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,300
I was one of the brave soldiers.

829
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,360
I was doing picketing.

830
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,600
Picked so many chickens,

831
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,260
I was afraid

832
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,160
to go to bed at night.

833
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah.

834
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,120
I was afraid

835
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,980
I would lay there.

836
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,360
While I was fighting

837
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,280
at the Battle of Santiago,

838
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,340
15 balls pierced

839
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,360
my manly bosom.

840
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,720
And didn't kill you?

841
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,220
No.

842
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,360
How was that?

843
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,860
They were codfish balls.

844
00:28:59,420 --> 00:28:59,780
Oh, man.

845
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,420
One ball went right through me

846
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,600
and killed another man.

847
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,840
They had me arrested

848
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,500
for murder.

849
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,020
Murder?

850
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,960
They said it was through me.

851
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,240
The other man got killed.

852
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,220
I was where the bullets

853
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,160
were the thickest.

854
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,320
They were just rolling

855
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,000
all over me.

856
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,120
Yes, there was a hole

857
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,380
in the middle of the wall.

858
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,680
In the bottom

859
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,640
of the ammunition wagon.

860
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,260
Poor Vintage Schumer.

861
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,400
Uh, the...

862
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,500
All the passengers

863
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,680
was heaving.

864
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:20,980
Yeah?

865
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,520
And if that wasn't enough,

866
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,720
the captain gave orders

867
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,180
for the ship to heave, too.

868
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,020
Oh!

869
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,820
Har har har har har!

870
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,980
That's one of those...

871
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,740
Oh, my God.

872
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,680
That's a good one.

873
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,580
My God.

874
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,700
My God.

875
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,420
That's a...

876
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,320
My God.

877
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,280
That's a good one.

878
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,020
You got your job.

879
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
No, no, Phil.

880
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,900
Phil.

881
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,120
You got your job.

882
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,940
You're stuck.

883
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,300
Phil, Phil, Phil.

884
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,900
It's a good one.

885
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,300
You're driving good.

886
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,040
You are...

887
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,860
You are...

888
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,160
You are thinker.

889
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,560
You are thinker.

890
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,800
You are so smart.

891
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,060
You see...

892
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,000
You are...

893
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,920
You got surprise for you.

894
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,380
You got the biggest surprise

895
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,680
coming.

896
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:56,920
That's a good one.

897
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,180


898
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,680
You are...

899
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh, my God.

900
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,960
I get you good.

901
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,340
That's it.

902
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,740
Get you good.

903
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,100
Oh.

904
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,720
That's another language lesson

905
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,980
from the Firesign Theatre Hour Hour.

906
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,500
He's got to drive home

907
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,300
through sector 13

908
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,180
to get to where you live

909
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,620
in an hour now.

910
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,280
Yeah, you got to talk

911
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,300
like that in sector 13.

912
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:09,900
Yeah, you got to...

913
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,740
Oh, you're not getting

914
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,340
my car, you big surprise.

915
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,120
You can ride with me.

916
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,520
All right.

917
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,460
Easy, easy rider.

918
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:15,800
Those of you going through

919
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,440
12, you'll have to use

920
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
the old Peter Lorre accent

921
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,820
to get through the night.

922
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,160
That's right.

923
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,860
Sector 12.

924
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,460
Let me through.

925
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,780
I've got to get home.

926
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,440
My children are burning.

927
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,600
You go through there

928
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,420
and you get to sector 11.

929
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,580
Ronald Coleman is the image

930
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,260
in sector 11

931
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,080
to get through the city.

932
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,200
There's a far, far better thing

933
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,000
I do than I have ever done.

934
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,880
Tis a far, far better world

935
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,500
I leave than I have ever left.

936
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,340
My father, oh,

937
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,380
I'm ready.

938
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,200
Conflicted to him only by marriage.

939
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,060
There's a comma in there.

940
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,000
It doesn't apply...

941
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,380
That's right.

942
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,320
That's it.

943
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,440
Then you're home.

944
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,700
There's Robert Q. Lewis.

945
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,300
I think.

946
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,020
Everybody listened to Robert Coleman.

947
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,880
Robert Q. Kelly.

948
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320

There is good news.

965
00:31:50,100 --> 00:32:09,040
Oh, come on, man. I haven't seen that. I know, I know.

966
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,660
Seen what?

967
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,440
The cars in the little cubes.

968
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,600
Yeah, the visions. Everybody has a movie.

969
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:12,940
I saw them in a movie.

970
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,720
I have dreams about people throwing long metal spears now, man.

971
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,900
When I go to bed at night, just before I go to bed,

972
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
I put myself in some place like a fantasy world.

973
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,260
And as I begin to drift off,

974
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,660
sometimes I see myself liked with Gandalf

975
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,340
and making the trip against the darkness,

976
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,440
and now I've got this thing with the spears.

977
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,580
Oh, yes.

978
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,740
Oh, my God.

979
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,320
Oh, metal porto.

980
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,320


981
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
Piki, piki, piki, piki, piki.

982
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,100
Hey!

983
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,200
Hey!

984
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
Piki, piki, piki, come and get it.

985
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,880
Come and get it.

986
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,500
Laugh a minute in the pork barrel.

987
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,400
Here we go down the Primrose path,

988
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,380
Gonna open up that door.

989
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,400
that never closes and visit with our good, kind, Buddha friends,

990
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,240
Mutton Chops at the Mutton Chop Shop.

991
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Hey, Mutton Chops!

992
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,660
That's right.

993
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,180
That's right.

994
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,740
That's right.

995
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,320
That's right.

996
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,680
That's what happened to the Indians.

997
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,120
Their virility went down the drain.

998
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,700
They didn't even have modern plumbing.

999
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,580
Ah, mutt.

1000
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,640
It's a condition of the peddling system.

1001
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,580
That's what it is.

1002
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,420
You know, the Depression's hurt everyone.

1003
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,140
Even the mills have closed down.

1004
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:35,960
They did?

1005
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,420
I didn't know that.

1006
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,060
Oh, yeah.

1007
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,800
They moved out.

1008
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,020
They left the furniture and everything.

1009
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,200
Oh, my goodness.

1010
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,900
The streets, you know.

1011
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,620
We know the streets.

1012
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:42,640
The streets?

1013
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,140
Well?

1014
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,220
They told me they were heading for Bird City to go into the headache business.

1015
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,860
Oh, well, you know, frankly, I always thought the little mills boy was a little soft in the head, you know, I thought.

1016
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,160
Don't say.

1017
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,220
No, I just did.

1018
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,280
What makes you say that, Chops?

1019
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, the writers.

1020
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,980
Well, I can agree with you.

1021
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,720
Oh, that's good.

1022
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,000
That's what it says here, anyway.

1023
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,920
You know, just the other day he come in here to steal gumballs,

1024
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,740
and he bought this big container of chocolate ice cream, you know?

1025
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,020
Yeah.

1026
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,300


1027
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,280
No, he stands there and he takes the top off in the container, see?

1028
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

1029
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,780
Then he pushes his face right in the ice cream, see?

1030
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,400
Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,940
Standing there right in front of me, and he says,

1032
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,800
Look, I've invented the spoon.

1033
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,400
Uh-huh.

1034
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,760
He's crazy, all right.

1035
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,460
Crazy as a loon.

1036
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,060
Yeah, you should have thrown him out, you know.

1037
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,840
I did throw him out.

1038
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,740
You did throw him out?

1039
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,800
That serves him right.

1040
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,440
Oh.

1041
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,440
Oh, Mr. Mott.

1042
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,500
Oh, Mr. Chops.

1043
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,280
Oh, well.

1044
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,960
Here comes Mrs. Gunderson.

1045
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,140
Mrs. Gunderson.

1046
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,160
Yeah, who that is.

1047
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,940
Mr. Mott.

1048
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,760
Oh, right all the way up.

1049
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,300
Oh.

1050
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:41,740
Do you?

1051
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,760
All the way up Spine Hill.

1052
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,740
Well, well, well.

1053
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,900
Just here, let me rest my arm here on the...

1054
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,660
You just sit down there, Mrs. Gunderson.

1055
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,820
I'm looking for some liver.

1056
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,860
Liver, are you?

1057
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,200
I'd like two pounds of liver and a crock of urine, if I could please.

1058
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,420
Oh, just a second, Terry.

1059
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,380
Before you get to that, Mott, would you hand me some of those police-slung shots and billies?

1060
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,120
Oh, well, yes.

1061
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,460
Oh, yes.

1062
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,180
They're right over here.

1063
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,180
And I can take care of that with you.

1064
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,040
You take care of old Mrs. Gunderson over there, okay?

1065
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,060
Yeah, yeah.

1066
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,600
The very...

1067
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,180
Mrs. Gunderson's liver.

1068
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,640
I'll get those police hooks.

1069
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,200
What were those?

1070
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,540
Police-slung shots and billies.

1071
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,300
Yeah, I can...

1072
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,700
I can...

1073
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,380
She can find that.

1074
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,080
How about get a couple of decoys, Ducks, while you're back there?

1075
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,800
Oh, yes.

1076
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,840
I'll just sit down here on the classics.

1077
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,460
Yes, sure.

1078
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,040
Are these lard containers supposed to be here, Chops?

1079
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,600
That's Vaseline.

1080
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,280
Lard containers.

1081
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,260
No, no.

1082
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,100
That's the cow Vaseline.

1083
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,860
What about the paprika?

1084
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,600
The cow Vaseline.

1085
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,220
What about the paprika there?

1086
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,040
Oh, this paprika, Hungarian warm, it goes next to the chives, freeze-dried.

1087
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1088
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,960
And I forgot to tell you now, we need a reorder, you know, on number 237.

1089
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,260
The very...

1090
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,160
Oh!

1091
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,960
Oh!

1092
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,620
Have you got...

1093
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:41,620


1094
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,100
Have you got any batteries for the electric belts you sold me?

1095
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, you...

1096
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,440
You've been wearing...

1097
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,460
You've been wearing them electric belts?

1098
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:48,940
Yes!

1099
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,320
Oh!

1100
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,280
Or do they do anything for your...

1101
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,880
For your manly virility?

1102
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah, for my...

1103
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,220
They do.

1104
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:55,780
Yes!

1105
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh, I've been...

1106
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:02,020
How many of those can you get for like $10, which is what I got to spend on them?

1107
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,880
Electric belts?

1108
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,540
Electric belts, that's what I want.

1109
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,320
Well, look, here's a 295 peerless vapor bath cabinet.

1110
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,840
Oh, yeah.

1111
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,440
Like our brown bath cabinet number two.

1112
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,160
Or maybe a milk oil sheep dip.

1113
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,340
I think that we should have some of those.

1114
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,500
Do you have any low hawks?

1115
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,820
Low hawks?

1116
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,660
No, I don't, Mrs. Feberstam.

1117
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,160
I'm afraid that we ate them all.

1118
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,120
Oh, no.

1119
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,520
Yes, well, times have been hard.

1120
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,740
We sent out for an order of slug festers, and we got back instead those car hooks.

1121
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,680
Oh, listen, baby Timmy's got the dropsy on his eyes.

1122
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,700
Tell me something.

1123
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,760
Yes, I'll tell you anything.

1124
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,300
I understand that your grandmother's strung out.

1125
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,500
Strung out, yes.

1126
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,440
Yeah, I walked by her house the other day.

1127
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,760
I noticed she's walking around.

1128
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,420
She's got all clothes.

1129
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,540
She's hanging on all the lines.

1130
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,780
I've been out there for over a month.

1131
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,720
That's because she's got the weeps.

1132
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,660
Is that what it is?

1133
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,320
She's walking around the house naked, you know.

1134
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,620
Yeah, that's right.

1135
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,140
Weeping out of every pore in her body.

1136
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,640
Well, I hope she gets better.

1137
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,720
I hope she gets better.

1138
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,860
Oh, just a minute now, bud.

1139
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,280
Listen, that's, um, uh...

1140
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,800
Inovner, I thought you were supposed to be back at the smokehouse smoking.

1141
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,740
Why, don't hit on me, Mrs. Fendon.

1142
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,160
You're the only slave I've got.

1143
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Well, I'd come in to see if you got any junior warden's females.

1144
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,720
Or pills for female disease.

1145
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,740
Nabner, Nabner, that's what you come in here for.

1146
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,640
Little Nabner.

1147
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,640
Well, maybe you could give me some of that Dr. Hammond's knife and brain pills.

1148
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,760
Is this for your mistress there, Nabner?

1149
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,800
Yeah, I'd like a couple half dozen of genuine German herb laxative tea, too.

1150
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Well, that's up on the top there.

1151
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,280
You get it up there, you can find it.

1152
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,620
Mr. Mutt, would you pick me up a cup?

1153
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,660
A couple of gross police-slung shots and billets.

1154
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,960
Oh, we sold those already.

1155
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,780
They's already gone, I'm afraid.

1156
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,960
Mr. Mutt, this lever is spotted.

1157
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,120
Oh, it's all right, as long as it's not gray.

1158
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,680
I mean, I'd like one of them double-action revolvers.

1159
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,020
I think I'd like one of them new-sized double-action revolvers.

1160
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,480
Well, listen, we got to get some new ones.

1161
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,300
I think maybe I'd like a couple of those.

1162
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,860
Well, there's a gross of them up there.

1163
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,040
...frontier and target revolvers.

1164
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,700
There's no way he's out there in L.P.D.

1165
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,640
I can't even move.

1166
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:07,940
I can't even move.

1167
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:08,600
I can't even move.

1168
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,540
That's why I'm here.

1169
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,600
I can't even move.

1170
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,140
I can't even move.

1171
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
I can't even move.

1172
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:31,080
I can't even move.

1173
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,040
Oh, by the way, if I have time, I should mention that NPR show with the Church of the

1174
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,900
Subgenius interview has come out.

1175
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,880
And it's not bad.

1176
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:53,480
It's part of the show called To the Best of Our Knowledge, which you can find at ttbook.org

1177
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,340
and search for Ivan Stang Church Subgenius.

1178
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,080
You can hear it and download it there.

1179
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,380
I was pleasantly surprised, because out of a 40-minute interview, they kept my mentions

1180
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,100
of puzzling evidences and Susie's shows.

1181
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,120
And there's a nifty little weird mix near the end.

1182
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,640
With clips from old hour of Slack, including Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Televangela.

1183
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,440
As I predicted, they removed my mentions of Dr. Drummond, Dr. Howell, and other major

1184
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,780
co-subfounders.

1185
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,920
Thank you.

1186
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,500
And now back to this.

1187
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,960
Hey, I get it.

1188
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,520
You're not the professor anymore, you down.

1189
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,180
I'm not.

1190
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,240
This is a free university, you bum.

1191
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,560
All right, if I'm not the professor anymore, then who's the professor?

1192
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,040
Well, who wants to wear the hat?

1193
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,120
Is it something else?

1194
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,120


1195
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,120


1196
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,120


1197
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,120


1198
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,120


1199
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,020
Who wants to carry on the great tradition of education?

1200
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,680
You bums, you kids.

1201
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,460
I'm dropping out.

1202
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,140
I am running for president.

1203
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,800
President of the United States.

1204
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Do I have to listen to this?

1205
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,920
Leadership and power is deformed and abnormal.

1206
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:55,900
Let's hear it.

1207
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,220
Power must be the element in all the people.

1208
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,860
Thank you, Jesus.

1209
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,440
Leadership must be addressed to all the people.

1210
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,280
And the president must be curious to lead them.

1211
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,440
Keep power as an atmosphere, an in and out stream.

1212
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,360
Our good feelings about people.

1213
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,220
Some really fine growth.

1214
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,660
Apply leadership to life giving, greater existence and rapid growth.

1215
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,120
It's Japanese.

1216
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,980
Sincerity of power and the leadership with enthusiasm.

1217
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,860
Eats electricity.

1218
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,880
The people's desires are simple.

1219
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,400
Lasers stop him not.

1220
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,760
Whole towns in water.

1221
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,160
They need no fears, no hate, no doubt.

1222
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,360
Visions of ending.

1223
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
No envy to waste their power on.

1224
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,320
All town surprised.

1225
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,080
They want poise, enthusiasm, sincerity like their body of power.

1226
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,800
As a wonderful backbone.

1227
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Fear and cattle fall down together.

1228
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,840
No meat.

1229
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
To make life hold.

1230
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,860
To indicate the magnitude of life.

1231
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
Then to change this power into leadership.

1232
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,100
Power makes our wants in taps and shakes.

1233
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,020
Thank you, Robert.

1234
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,240
That's graphs in proportion.

1235
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,120
Thank you, buddy.

1236
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,240
Thank you, buddy.

1237
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,600
Leadership positions are body in our hands.

1238
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,140
Thanks, John.

1239
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,480
And our wants are acceptable.

1240
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,240
And thank you, man.

1241
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,040
Perhaps a source in waiting for the electrician or someone like him for the politician's speech

1242
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,940
about three quarters of the way through the record.

1243
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,060
I, as president, the news press.

1244
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,080
Power like a drum and leadership like a violin.

1245
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,800
All doubt needs is the change of ideas.

1246
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,140
Take enthusiasm as an example.

1247
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,280
Enthusiasm has the ideas of certainty, faith, realize, and optimism.

1248
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,940
Pick out any idea.

1249
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,280
What are you talking about?

1250
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,580
Compare ideas.

1251
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:26,980
What?

1252
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,840
With the one idea left, you have no doubt.

1253
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,800
And without a doubt, we have enthusiasm.

1254
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,520
Yes.

1255
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:32,860
Yes.

1256
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,020
Yes.

1257
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,240
Yes.

1258
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,920
Yes.

1259
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:33,980


1260
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,480
Yes.

1261
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,480


1262
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,520
Yes.

1263
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:34,640
Yes.

1264
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


1265
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,660
As the unusual idea in good leadership, it revamps leadership to the—

1266
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,040
Who am I?

1267
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,560
And inflate its power in the right element, our kind of enthusiasm.

1268
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,660
What is reality?

1269
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,020
I was talking yesterday.

1270
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,000
It's as easy as a bridge.

1271
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,700
With Bobby.

1272
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,680
Power and leadership like a twin.

1273
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,260
And I would say here on the astral planet forever, if you want to.

1274
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,620
Of the United States of America.

1275
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,660
Yeah, and they said, well, we did it once upon a time.

1276
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,300
My name is Ed Groves.

1277
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,740
Yeah.

1278
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,680
what I've been playing comes from the fourth episode of the Firesign Theater Radio Hour Hour

1279
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:18,320
from February 15, 1970, when I was in the 11th grade. I got it from the book and MP3 collection

1280
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,960
Duke of Madness Motors, assembled by Reverend Taylor Jessen, and available from Negative Land's

1281
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:33,020
Sealand Records, negativeland.com or firesigntheatre.com. This contains Firesign's

1282
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:42,160
first three years of shows from 1970 to 72. The newer sounding promos for the now defunct XM Radio

1283
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,920
were written and produced with the Firesigns by our very own Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

1284
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:57,240
who's usually the voice that introduces the Hour of Slack. He's deservedly proud of how well their

1285
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:03,000
work meshed. XM, however, was too pink for Firesign for me.

1286
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:14,660
Oh, and this is a good place for me to read an excerpt from that book, Duke of Madness Motors.

1287
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:15,920
Quote,

1288
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:23,240
Yesiree, friends, these guys are some funny. Definitely ha-ha funny, but also funny dramatic,

1289
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:29,960
funny poetic, funny dada. It's movies for the mind that have only ever been matched by the

1290
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,000
likes of Ken Nordean, Gene Shepard, and Joe Franchi.

1291
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,960
You can hear the tradition continuing every Friday morning on Negative Land's Over the Edge

1292
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,200
series on KPFA and shows from the Church of the Subgenius, like Puzzling Evidence and The Hour

1293
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,540
of Slack. Where this kind of radio survives in America, it does so only through the grace of

1294
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:56,200
a similar comedo-religious ecstasy and probably the fact that the host isn't being paid.

1295
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,880
The best shows in this bulldada format, even though they may have been on the air for decades,

1296
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,760
still carry through every minute of every hour a whiff of what was in the air when Firesign was

1297
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,040
broadcasting in 1970. If not necessarily the scent of the medicinal herb the boys were so fond of,

1298
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,500
then at least a general and lasting feeling that the person behind the microphone

1299
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,920
can't quite believe that he's getting away with this shit.

1300
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:32,040
That was from Duke of Madness Motors, that segment by Taylor Jessen, Reverend Taylor Jessen.

1301
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:38,860
When we announced Bergman's death in Subgenius Internet Land, there were many poignant responses,

1302
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:46,580
of which I shall now read a few in Dr. Memory of Pete. Reverend Louie Louie said,

1303
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,920
sometimes you beat the reaper, sometimes the reaper beats you. Let's all ritually let the air

1304
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,900
out of our shoes in tribute to one of the originals that made it all possible. Joe Provo said,

1305
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,680
as long as we inflate his so he can cross the river,

1306
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:12,520
sticks. And Reverend Felix Automaton said, I shall fly my fly at half mast. Unknown said,

1307
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,580
I've got a case of Bear Whiz beer and every one I pop will be raised to the memory of Mr. Bergman.

1308
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,980
Good night, clown prince. Jay Lee said, there's one less bozo on this bus.

1309
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,480
Bill Trujillo said, back from the shadows again. Rick Bell said,

1310
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:41,100
waiting for the electrician no more. Goodbye, my friend. Al Bryant said, Peter is gone,

1311
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,360
but Kenny G still lives to blight our lives. Can't fair. How can you be in two places at

1312
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:54,080
once when you're not anywhere at all? Morgan Lewington said, shoes for the dead.

1313
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Blake Michener said, pretty much everything I heard of Firesign on the Hour of Slack was

1314
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,760
exceptionally good.

1315
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:11,000
Bob is smoking him now as it must eventually be for us all. Arthur Ratnick said, he is certainly

1316
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,520
embarking on a journey that may well change his life forever. Kathy Thomas said, he's already

1317
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:25,000
beatified, so his saint titles settled. Reverend Mark Morey said, in a just universe,

1318
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:32,100
this would be as newsworthy as the passing of Bob Dylan will be. Jeff Sykes said,

1319
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:39,540
thanks to them, the letter E will always stand for excellent, and I will never run out of gas.

1320
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,120
Congratulations, Peter, on making your escape to the pleasure saucers. We'll miss you.

1321
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,260
Michael Moon Bear said, meet you at Bob's Berserko Lounge.

1322
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,980
Katahdin Legume said, R.I.P. Stan Lee. Thanks for Batman.

1323
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,260
And if you want to say goodbye,

1324
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,140
you can go to FiresignTheatre.com slash Peter Bergman.

1325
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,420
And if you look at YouTube under Peter Bergman Firesign, do a little search, you'll see a

1326
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:22,380
wonderful video tribute or two. At some Starwood several years ago, a bunch of us performed as the

1327
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:30,440
Firesign clones and reenacted three of the classic albums on stage, reading from the scripts in

1328
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,640
Firesign Theatre's big book of plays.

1329
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:43,480
If you had a lasting memory of the story and what people were saying the story was to you,

1330
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,060
you've got to put it in front of your eyes.

1331
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,880
What you're reading is about,

1332
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,120
the inspiration that comes from your own beliefs,

1333
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,160
from your own personal 느낌이 andthan you'rebank.

1334
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,520
From your own topic to any other topic,

1335
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,440
the story's going to be the next one.

1336
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,280
This is a two-line line from Mark bemis,

1337
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:09,540
Hysterical yoga, yuck-yuck, yoke of egg, egg shell, ego shell, yoke, new yoke, literally the sleeping servant.

1338
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,300
God bless Gary Snyder.

1339
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,220
Juleps were first invented, as I suppose, in Arabia, and my reason is because the word julep is an Arabic word.

1340
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,260
It signifies only a pleasant potion, as is vulgarly used by such as are sick and want help,

1341
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,080
or such as are in health and want no money to quench their thirst.

1342
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,600
Let me give you that address again, friends, for the best hashish and cannabis in dukes.

1343
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,840
Here, right?

1344
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,400
No, it's FCC time.

1345
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,160
Space charge, a gathering of electrons near the cathode of a vacuum tube.

1346
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,020
You know, radio.

1347
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,380
Okay, it's time for lids of grass again.

1348
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,920
My business has gone to the wall. What business are you in?

1349
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,840
I'm a paper hanger.

1350
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,300
Oh, 1934.

1351
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,160
Yeah, ach tun yuk tun, we all scream.

1352
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,400
Putsch off, buster.

1353
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,760
Putsch off, right. Beer back in a minute.

1354
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,800
Okay, Peter. All right, everybody.

1355
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,240
Shot the principal and made a movie.

1356
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:02,820
Goodbye.

1357
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,620
Time once again for the Howl of the Wolf movie.

1358
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:19,240
Today's feature, High School Madness, has been preempted in order that we may bring you the 13th annual Awards Show Awards Awards Show.

1359
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,660
The award-winning awards show that awards awards to outstanding awards show.

1360
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,300
And for our awards show awards, awards show pre-show.

1361
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,060
Which, incidentally, has coveted more than just...

1362
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,660
Just a few awards.

1363
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:35,040
We switch you live to our correspondent, Manny Milk, who is standing by foaming at the mouth at the San Luis Obispo Poe Buckers Foam Dome.

1364
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,380
Manny.

1365
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,260
Manny.

1366
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,240
Seems like there might be some technical difficulty with our foam dome.

1367
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,620
Oh, Manny's got bad leverage.

1368
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,680
Oh, it's swell. That leaves us free to talk about...

1369
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,220
Yes, sir.

1370
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,940
A foam that starts with an F.

1371
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,900
Oh, a fire sign theater.

1372
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,720
Oh, yes.

1373
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,460
Those madcap, wacky rapscallions have traded in their goofballs for sensible shoes.

1374
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:57,960
And have...

1375
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,600
Organized themselves to the point where they now do a live show.

1376
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,460
Can you believe it? Every month.

1377
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,140
There's another fire sign theater. Fools in Space again.

1378
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,220
Real soon.

1379
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,200
On XM Comedy 150.

1380
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,320
And, uh, he wouldn't have any of those little growth clusters around, would you, Mike?

1381
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,020
No, that's...

1382
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,460
Ed.

1383
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,840
Stop torturing me, Ethel.

1384
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,280
Saturday nights, Tuesday afternoons, and in the wee hours, Thursday morning.

1385
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,480
Only on XM Comedy 150.

1386
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,440
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1387
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,920
Well, golly, what'll they think of next?

1388
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,760
Them fire sign theater fools in space fellas ain't really going away.

1389
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,780
No, no, they just set in a spell.

1390
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,880
They just grab your corncob, do the same.

1391
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,180
It's XM Comedy 150 right here.

1392
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,720
I'm sitting on my corncob.

1393
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Because we're subgeniuses.

1394

1403
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,600
My friends are all crazy.

1404
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,300
They're mad as loons.

1405
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,540
They talk all at once.

1406
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,960
It's a hundred tunes.

1407
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,740
You hear them at night as you push down the highway

1408
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,120
Like loons landing, elusive loon fly away

1409
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:15,920
And oh, can it be true

1410
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,100
Y'all feel free to just join in

1411
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,860
That there's no rest for the wicked

1412
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,120
And oh, peace for us too

1413
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,620
Amazing what sounds you can get out of a banana

1414
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:38,280
Now the laughers and screamers, their cross talk is incredible

1415
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,360
It's all you can do to believe they're inedible

1416
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,620
And policemen and doctors hover round the edges

1417
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,260
As they drag in new converts and make them sign pledges

1418
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:53,840
And oh, can it be true

1419
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,960
And oh, can it be true

1420
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,600
Well, that there's no rest for the wicked

1421
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,680
No peace for us too

1422
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:21,420
Now me and my sweetheart have tried to escape

1423
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,820
We're secretly in love with each other

1424
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:23,820


1425
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:23,820


1426
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:31,920
And we're sending it out to all the men here

1427
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,480
Don't you talk all at once

1428
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,680
So you'll wind up right here

1429
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:43,540
And oh, can it be true

1430
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,020
That there's no rest for the wicked

1431
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,820
And oh, peace for us too

1432
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1433
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1434
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1435
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1436
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1437
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1438
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1439
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,120
Peace for us too

1440
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,520
Alright, one more verse

1441
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,940
A passage of loons to their home in the sky

1442
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,820
Don't tempt me a bit

1443
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,040
But think I'll pass it right by

1444
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,520
So listen up friends now

1445
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,640
You've heard my sad tune

1446
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,320
Don't be tempted to talk all at once like a loon

1447
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,980
And oh, can it be true

1448
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,700
That there's no rest on the wicked

1449
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,900
No peace for us two

1450
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,440
Y'all sound beautiful

1451
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Well, I don't know

1452
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,280
I don't know how far out in space you have to get to get that far out, friends

1453
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,000
Hey, that's quality on this show, you know

1454
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,840
Beyond the orbit of the asteroids

1455
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,080
We're lucky we're sponsored, I tell you that, Hilario, you know

1456
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,960
Now that football's been outlawed by the interstellar console

1457
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,660
There's things in my genes

1458
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,020
There's some part of my codon that says, thanks, I did it

1459
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,760
And you know, I still want to go back and make it happen

1460
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,140
I can't

1461
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,060
That song, Loons

1462
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,700
Was by Phil Austin

1463
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,660
From Year of the Rat album

1464
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,920
Yes, friends

1465
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,200
Radio Free Oz is off the air

1466
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,780
And you better get used to it, kids

1467
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,940
This trend of large mammals dying

1468
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,020
Has actually been going on for some time

1469
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,680
It's funny how indestructible and immortal

1470
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,780
Most people, including me

1471
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,300
Feel when they're young

1472
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,120
On the one hand, when I was like 25

1473
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,980
I was sure I wouldn't live past 45

1474
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,180
My forebrain was sure anyway

1475
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,340
My middle brain felt like Superman, though

1476
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,080
The problem is

1477
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,720
Sickness and cell deterioration notwithstanding

1478
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,580
Any of us could die any time

1479
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,700
And everyone in the world

1480
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,080
Except those paying subgeniuses who live until X-Day

1481
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,200
Will die

1482
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,620
Some lucky subgenie

1483
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,120
Such as Leguin

1484
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,500
And G. Gordon Gordon

1485
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,800
Get to die multiple times

1486
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,460
But this kind of luck is reserved only for killers

1487
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,380
And both of them happen to have been hitmen for Bob

1488
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,500
I've seen too many 30-year-olds

1489
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,320
Suddenly croak from cancer or accidents

1490
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,600
I've watched old people croak

1491
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,360
Right in front of my very eyes

1492
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,840
I've nursed people who were three-fourths dead

1493
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,900
And going down fast

1494
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,440
And what I got from all this is

1495
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,120
If you can still stand your parents

1496
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,280
And old friends

1497
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,680
Spend as much time with them as you can

1498
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,920
As Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I worked out

1499
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,020
After Chaz Smith died

1500
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,080
We should treat our friends like they're already dead

1501
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,080
We tend to be much more forgiving of dead people

1502
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,340
Than live ones

1503
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,220
And that's maybe not the best approach

1504
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,540
But this hour of slack from subgenius.com

1505
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,500
Will now close with Peter Bergman's

1506
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,280
Truly Innocent Story

1507
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,280


1508
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,280


1509
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,280


1510
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,120
And inspirational last words to us

1511
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,460
From his last podcast

1512
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,220
Made March 6th

1513
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,860
Two days before he unexpectedly

1514
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,000
Boarded the escape vessels

1515
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,720
Take heart, dear friends

1516
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,380
We are passing through the darkening of the light

1517
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,180
We're going to make it

1518
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,260
And we're going to make it together

1519
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,780
Don't get ground down by cynicism

1520
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,080
Don't let depression darken the glass

1521
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,400
Through which you look

1522
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,340
This is a garden we live in

1523
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,000
A garden seeded with unconditional love

1524
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,360
And the tears of the oppressed

1525
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,360
And the tears of the frustrated

1526
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,780
And the tears of the good

1527
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,820
Will spring those seeds

1528
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,200
The flag has been waved

1529
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,900
It says occupy

1530
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,120
Occupy Wall Street

1531
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,800
Occupy the banks

1532
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,940
Occupy the nursing homes

1533
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,320
Occupy Congress

1534
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,300
Occupy the big law offices

1535
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,280
Occupy the lobbyists

1536
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,820
Occupy yourself

1537
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,940
Because that's where it all comes together

1538
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,580
I pledge to you

1539
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,160
From this moment on

1540
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,820
Whatever it means

1541
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,820
I'm going to occupy myself

1542
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,260
I love you

1543
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,500
See you tomorrow
