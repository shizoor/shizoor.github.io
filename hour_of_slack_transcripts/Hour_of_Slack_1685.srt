1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:12,080
The power of self from the church of the church of the set up

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,680
Jesus.com and and or dot dot com.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,860
The air rays.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,300
The universe from the top of the Empire State Building and broadcasting loud to all time zones around the world in stereo.

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,880
This is Bob.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,080
There came an awful sound.

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,460
And from his lips there came an awful sound.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,820
Bob.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,100
Where'd you two take this elevator from Shangri-La?

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,760
I was supposed to be a boy named Thomas.

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,520
Me.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,120
I'll get him.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,100
But no talking behind my back.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,380
Ponderosa.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,400
What's that?

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,560
What's that?

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,680
That's the home place of the Cartwright.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,340
My name's Joe Cartwright.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,480
House Cartwright.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,520
And this is Adam.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,540
Yes, we've met.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,340
Oh, Ponderosa.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,880
The dream.

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,740
Ponderosa.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,100
You come out here, you run down our country.

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,200
It's a country we love.

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,660
It's a country we're proud of.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
I think I'm stronger than you.

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,080
We don't boo you because you support Russia.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,260
Get ready to Dwayne the Swamp at Electomania 2020.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Take a run around here looking like a big fat bowl of fruity pebbles.

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,640
It's an all out smackdown of democracy.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,620
You're right. He is scared. You're right.

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,380
We're looking at what would happen if a homeless lumberjack banged a nupa lupa.

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,840
Electomania 2020.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,060
Only on C-SPAN 2.

00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,020
Information wants to be free.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,200
Access to computers and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works should be unlimited and total.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,160
Always yield to the hands on imperative.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,900
All information should be free.

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,200
Mistrust authority.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,080
Promote decentralization.

Information wants to be free.

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,620
Hello, friend.

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:44,700
You know, hordes of starving subgenius artists are dying to build a wall for you.

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,380
Hello, this is Clark Farkington.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,720
You remember me as Mr. Funston or that Gorilla Man.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,880
Well, now I have something serious to say to you.

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,980
Soon, people will be knocking on your door and asking you for a donation.

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,680
Take a look around your home or car right now.

56
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,220
Chances are there are walls on either side.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:26,780
Well, thanks to the people at the Church of the Subgenius, these walls can be reinforced so that stray psychic conspiracy energies can be deflected and safely...

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:40,100
warded off or stored, keeping the pinks at bay and energizing your home with simple-to-use methods available in any kitchen or display case.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:50,920
So, stand by, please, for further instructions and do whatever these people tell you because they know what they're talking about.

60
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
Now I'm getting it.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,140
I was going to say he's going to have to, you know...

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,400
Okay, it's recording now.

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay.

64
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,600
Hello, check.

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,240
Everything's going fine.

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,780
And these are okay.

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,000
So it's X Day again, the festival.

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,880
And the day also, with the significant action already passed.

69
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,460
We waited for the saucers.

70
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,100
And we're still waiting.

71
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,400
Try them. I'll try a different one.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,760
A distant contrail showed the X-Esteem.

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,060
Turned up their multiple noses once again.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,320
An actual landing and embarkation.

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,080
Their sense of time is not ours.

76
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,780
Who knows?

77
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,220
The slightest thing could have set them off.

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,040
A hair out of place.

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,880
One color.

80
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,320
One blade of grass mistakenly crushed.

81
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,740
The configuration of the vehicle's...

82
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,360
The vehicles on the road could have offended them.

83
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,100
They are sensitive spirits.

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,240
The world, filled with attachments and aversions and the rest, is like a dream.

85
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,020
It appears to be real as long as one is ignorant, but becomes unreal when one is awake.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,760
According to...

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,800
Yeah, but what?

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,120
What?

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,300
Whoa, what?

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,380
What?

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,740
Yogey...

92
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,540
Roy Eugene Davis.

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,660
The Yogic practitioner.

95
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,120
We also have On the other side of the screen, the On the other side of the screen, we have

96
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,220
yogi bear comics for sale up here, including one which contains the disturbing story The

97
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,500
Sеrt Bear, in which yogi beats up ranger smith with a shovel, supposedly by accident,

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,980
but it's a very unwholesome thing.

99
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,640
However, it's in one of the yogi bear comics, which...

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,840
we will be offering at the

101
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Baldada auction

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,000
so

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,280
never forget that the treasures

104
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,700
of time lie high

105
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,680
ready for our acquisition

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,220
even the gods

107
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,320
and goddesses taste only a particle

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,060
of the unlimited bliss of

109
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,200
supreme consciousness

110
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,820
and enjoy

111
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,000
according to their

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
purity the shares of that segment

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,400
of bliss

114
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,060
the irreducible

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,300
substratum

116
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,040
after the negation of all tangible objects

117
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,880
from PR news in Washington

118
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm blasting President Trump

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,260
in a show of force

120
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,180
striking a US bomber

121
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,740
calling Trump explosive

122
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,980
saying quote they won't be PR news

123
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,060
much longer without elaborating

124
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,220
further no

125
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,040
Germany has ended but it's

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,860
far from clear with Angela Merkel

127
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,220
the first projection of results

128
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,440
show that 32.7% of

129
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,780
Angela Merkel's has 13.4%

130
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,380
making them only 20.2%

131
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,920
tens of thousands

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,740
of people are still living outside

133
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,060
Berlin because all have refused

134
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,300
to party with them

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
and the BBB BBC says

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,860
the inside current the

137
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,500
is fleeing a BBC crackdown

138
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,880
the BBB BBC

139

the United Nations High

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,500
Commissioner for Refugees says

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,780
this is PR news

142
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,660
in Washington

143
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,400
you can hear the kitchen

144
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,140
crew in the background

145
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,500
they're

146
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,460
preparing for the last supper

147
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,680
which will be taking place in about

148
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,460
an hour and a half

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,840
would you say

150
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,620
it's starting to cool a little bit the breeze

151
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,520
is starting to pick up

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,080
I would not say that

153
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,020
the only way

154
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,680
you're likely to

155
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,720
have any

156
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,340
cooling is if

157
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,440
you were to dive

158
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,100
into

159
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,860
Old Sequa's lair in the pond

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,440
see I did

161
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,220
I did that last year and it was just gross

162
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,160
they have

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,980
reportedly cleaned

164
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,560
the

165
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,580
bulk of the algae

166
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,240
oh

167
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,480
it's no leeches

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
no

169
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,800
no goo

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,440
and gunk

171
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,700
you can't even think about it

172
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,380
and most of the walnut oil has been

173
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,620
no kidding

174
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,440
skimmed off

175
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,100
okay

176
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,460
so then all you really have to worry about is the genital ripping menace of Old Sequa

177
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,920
well there's also the candiru worm

178
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,100
the candiru flies

179
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,260
oh yeah

180
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,380
those are always a fear

181
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,920
no matter where you are

182
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,500
uh huh

183
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,920
what do they do

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,320
the flies

185
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,260
the candiru

186
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,340
the candiru are known for

187
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,840
crawling up your urethra

188
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,960
oh no

189
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,760
not mine

190
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,820
fun for the whole family

191
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,740
you gotta wrap that rascal before getting in the pond

192
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,300
absolutely

193
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,720
yes

194
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,080
I don't have no truck with that

195
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,340
it happens

196
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,140
you never know when it's going to happen

197
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,040
but it happens

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,600
so I'm just writing here

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,360
Hal Robbins

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
Professor Brainyard

201
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,320
oh my god

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


204
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


205
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


206
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


207
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


208
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


209
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


210
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


211
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,320


212
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,640
these are extremely sensitive microphones

213
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,440
and that is an extremely loud pen

214
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,880
it is a very good thing that I am not hung over right now

215
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,960
because I would yell at him for scraping that pen across my ears

216
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,200
this is as it happens folks

217
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,160
this is the real life

218
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,540
here at X-Day 21

219
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,320
this is not fantasy

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,000
a mere

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,860
shoot

222
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,360
sorry

223
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,300
a mere 14 hours ago

224
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,300


225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,920
14 hours away from the end of the world

226
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,500
which has to happen

227
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,980
this time for sure

228
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,600
Bristol

229
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,880
is that too loud

230
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,140
it's just perfect

231
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,440
just perfect

232
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,360
I don't know if they can hear the music that we can hear but

233
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,300
can you hear the music

234
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't hear the music but go baby go

235
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,300
that's the spirit we have today well we've done it

236
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,300


237
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,300


238
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,320
we've suffered a small setback

239
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,860
aliens that seem not to have arrived yet

240
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,080
but

241
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,920
you saw them fly by earlier

242
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:29,960
yes

243
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,040
through the drive-by

244
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,780
they didn't want to set themselves down

245
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,680
just dump the ballast you know on the earth

246
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
it's got full of

247
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,120
it's the bilge tanks you know they've got huge bilge tanks on these spaceships

248
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
big enough for that?

249
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,240
yeah

250
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,640
This kind of scary sound back here behind us, Dr. Howell.

251
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,640
And they bring invasive species to mess with our biota.

252
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,120
Yeah, they have no natural predators on Earth, so...

253
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Well, we have a few here at X-Day.

254
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,660
You know, I just went by the hassle shack,

255
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,220
and we delivered a page of the enumeration of all who are here at X-Day.

256
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,560
And it's curious.

257
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:27,060
I noticed that the list of banned people is longer than the list of people who are actually here at X-Day.

258
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Oh, really? That says a lot.

259
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:37,280
It's a huge, lengthy list of bad actors and malfeasers who are not to be admitted to X-Day.

260
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,920
And I ran my eyes over that list, and an interesting list it is.

261
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,200
There's a real rogues gallery of horrible people.

262
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,680
Well, I don't know if they're horrible. We just don't want them here.

263
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,240
It would be horrible for us to have them here.

264
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,580
To have them here, right, right.

265
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,440
They're not necessarily horrible people, but it's hard for us to get along with.

266
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,300
Well, somebody who took the trouble to drive all the way across the country to get here last year

267
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,020
had to be turned away at the gate.

268
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,040
And that, you know, at least they take the trouble to drive here.

269
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,200
Yes, only the crazy...

270
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,000
Creme de la creme are accepted here.

271
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,360
We want a higher class of weirdo.

272
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,580
We don't want just your standard gutter trash weirdo.

273
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,860
We want your extremely talented, intelligent weirdo.

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free here at Wisteria.

275
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,540
To swelter in subgenius probity.

276
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,460
Bob.

277
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,980
Bob.

278
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:52,980


279
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,140
This is the battle of sex as an animal act.

280
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:06,240
The human animal struggles vainly to control his natural animal instincts.

281
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,280
So to be better able to fit into the norm of society.

282
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,940
A contradiction in terms.

283
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,460
Sometimes.

284
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,880
However, either due to chemical or hormonal imbalance.

285
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,100
A fist of facts.

286
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,260
Or a flagrant disregard for the outdated and inhibitional so-called code of ethics.

287
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:42,160
The thin line which separates the animal from the vegetable is obliterated.

288
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,260
Leaving them free to intoxicate their need to fulfill.

289
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,160
The lowest common denominator.

290
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,740
Bob.

291
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,960
Only through the threat of constant danger.

292
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,620
Or the imprisonment of incomprehensible pain.

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,640
Can they find a suitable distraction to veer them away from the dull reality.

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,380
Which they seek so desperately to escape.

295
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,200
Bob.

296
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,240
The reality that.

297
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,360
That they will never.

298
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,740
Ever.

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,920
Be.

300
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,780
Another Charles Manson.

301
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,940
Jim.

302
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,460
Morrison.

303
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,240
Jim.

304
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,240
Jones.

305
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,280
Jack.

306
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,080
The Ripper.

307
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,540
Tex.

308
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,220
Ritter.

309
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,520
Clint.

310
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,500
Eastwood.

311
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,240
Mario.

312
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,720
Andretti.

313
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,420
Mohammed.

314
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,620
Ali.

315
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,040
Lenny.

316
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,440
Bruce.

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,920
Lizzie.

318
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,540
Borden.

319
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,820
Andy.

320
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,900
Warhol.

321
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,120
Or.

322
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,080
Bob.

323
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,740
The fact that they're going to be struggling every other day of their lousy goddamn lives.

324
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,860
Just to be able to afford the cost of living yet another hopeless rotten existence.

325
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,400
Full of heartaches.

326
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,280
Bum deals.

327
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,260
Bad trips.

328
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,080
Burnouts.

329
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,600
Rip offs.

330
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,260
Fuck ups.

331
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,760
And every other stinking lousy abuse you want to fling in the face of these poor miserable.

332
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,400
Misfit.

333
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,440
Reject.

334
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,780
Loser.

335
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,060
Outlaw.

336
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,060


337
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
Yeah.

338
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,040
Bob.

339
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:28,020
The kind of people that don't fit in to your society because to fit in would be the

340
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,400
kiss of death.

341
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,360
Dull.

342
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Dumb.

343
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,260
Square.

344
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,680
Bob.

345
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,480
Because that's what it's all about.

346
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,060
We have to speak on matters of more importance.

347
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,940
portent and moment to subgeniuses.

348
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,680
So I think this is today as we shall designate this day

349
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,240
as the day of disappointment.

350
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,180
Well, now that's being a little bit...

351
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,260
Well, it's the day after X-Day that didn't happen,

352
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,200
so what could be worse?

353
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,380
It's the biggest disappointment in human history.

354
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,300
Perhaps it's the day of waiting for the other shoes to drop,

355
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,400
the other 279 shoes of the multi-legged master of Saucer Prime.

356
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,240
But we have not come to the end of today yet.

357
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,180
Which one is this one?

358
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,260
We don't know how it's going to...

359
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,040
Which one is this one?

360
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,240
Well, it must be...

361
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,640
Jeepers, I don't know it.

362
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,540
It must be the Anvil of Krom from the 1982 movie

363
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,480
Conan the Barbarian,

364
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,180
about a late-night talk show.

365
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:55,660
Yes, a weird anvil where the spirits gather around it

366
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,700
but cannot touch it because it is made of iron

367
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,400
and you touch one of them with iron

368
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
and they have to disappear or go away.

369
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,540
I don't remember this one passage in this song.

370
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,440
It sounds like it's something different.

371
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,240
It's been added, augmented.

372
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,860
Do you have a list on the...

373
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
screen of what cut it is?

374
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,880
This is kind of strange.

375
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,220
What we really need is a line out of that little box down there

376
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,500
back into the mixer so that we can get it in the recording

377
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,060
because now it's just coming in through the mics.

378
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,480
Well, we'll have to deal with that because...

379
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,820
Maybe we'll do that after the break.

380
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,340
All right, yes.

381
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,100
Pledge your break now.

382
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,780
In Washington, I'm flat when adjusted for inflation.

383
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,780
Democratic presidential hopefuls Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton

384
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,900
would be a step back to the 21st century.

385
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
Clinton ratcheted up again yesterday

386
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,860
and she said they should get back to violence and ethnic bloodletting.

387
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,260
Wall Street, 12, 3, 7, 3, 2, and 11.

388
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,380
The Senate killed seven people in Washington.

389
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,240
The Commerce Department says this is PR news.

390
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,000
PR comes from bamboo and cork flooring.

391
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,820
Which probably sounds good with the propeller.

392
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,780
I just discovered when you step out of Caffeina's into the breeze,

393
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,700
the propeller actually spins.

394
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,320
Well done.

395
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,500
That is, yes.

396
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,700
For those of you who aren't paying extra for the video service,

397
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,600
this is my propeller hat.

398
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,000
I scoured Metro Detroit to find a propeller hat for this occasion.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,140
The official Flash Hercules beanie.

400
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,840
That's right.

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
So since I'm Reverend Fanboy,

402
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600
I did some sort of ventilator.

403
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,400
So, it's false advertising on the box.

404
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,000
There's a lady flying through clouds

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,140
and I haven't flown for a second yet

406
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,300
since I put this thing on.

407
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,340
You haven't been with Philo yet.

408
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,740
No.

409
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,020
I think that'll probably get me...

410
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,720
Philo just drove through with a dinosaur in the bed of his pickup truck.

411
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,260
Mm-hmm.

412
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,080
You know, it's just not X-Day without a dinosaur.

413
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,220
One year it was Barney and he was the subject of the...

414
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,660
Yeah.

415
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,940
Of the campfire at the end?

416
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes.

417
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,240
Yes.

418
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,400
Oh, there's been so many X-Days.

419
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,300
And this is yet another one.

420
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,520
The Slacker X-Day, as we're calling it,

421
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,960
because people are just hanging out, having fun.

422
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,520
It has to happen sooner or later.

423
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,200
Sooner or later.

424
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,200
Well, you know...

425
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,600
Eh...

426
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,400
The 5th of July...

427
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,580
7 a.m. on the 5th of July comes every year.

428
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,020
1998, whenever it may land.

429
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,420
That's right.

430
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,180
Whatever 1998 you happen to need,

431
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,000
it's gonna happen eventually.

432
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,220
And we'll be there.

433
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,380
Because no matter where you are, there you are.

434
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,660
Everybody's gotta be somewhere.

435
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,740
Everybody's gotta be somewhere.

436
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,240
Yeah.

437
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,780
That one calls for a good Echo's voice.

438
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,500
I'm the...

439
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,160
Seamus Eccles.

440
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,900
And I've got friends in.

441
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
Oh, man.

442
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,020
Oh, man.

443
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,860
Yeah, the energy level is just being crushed.

444
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,360
What is energy?

445
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,300
Crushed.

446
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,040
What is energy?

447
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,760
This is...

448
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,040
The slack level, on the other hand, is through the roof.

449
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,040
I'm okay with that.

450
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm okay with that.

451
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,580
But not too far.

452
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,400
Not too far through the roof,

453
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,120
because then you're in the sunlight, and it's hot.

454
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,760
Remaining in the shade is definitely called for.

455
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah.

456
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,520
Did we mention it's hot?

457
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh, by the way, it's hot.

458
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,560
And guess what?

459
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,100
It's hot.

460
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,040
So there's definitely feelings of sadness for most of us.

461
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,420
Yes.

462
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,000
And also feelings of...

463
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,200
As you said, let's get rid of this trash year of...

464
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,040
The 21st post-X Day year.

465
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:29,580
If we cannot get rid of the world, we can at least get rid of the misery.

466
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,320
Mm-hmm.

467
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,180
And find something else to do, which is why I'm currently sitting in front of a microphone.

468
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,800
Mm-hmm.

469
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,780
Well, you've got to have something to do.

470
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,900
This is true.

471
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,820
Mm-hmm.

472
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,020
Mm-hmm.

473
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:44,580
Mm-hmm.

474
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


475
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


476
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


477
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


478
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


479
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


480
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


481
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


482
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


483
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


484
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


485
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


486
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


487
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


488
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


489
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


490
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580


491
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,140
I've been sitting in front of my computer all day long,

492
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,500
which is why I'm sitting in front of my computer right now.

493
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,680
See, I'm with you.

494
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm a man of stature myself,

495
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:58,020
and if I spend too much time cavorting and gallivanting out in this heat,

496
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,400
I will probably melt into a puddle.

497
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,300
So hiding here is a good idea.

498
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,460
It's got to happen sooner or later.

499
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,120
Sooner or later.

500
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,540
Ah.

501
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,920
But this doesn't make me...

502
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,560
The propeller beanie does not make me as warm as I thought.

503
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:14,780
I thought it would.

504
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,580
It's nice.

505
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:16,860
It's very thin.

506
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
It's very thin.

507
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,800
It's very light.

508
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,860
Now, is the propeller beanie going on auction as well?

509
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,780
No, this is mine.

510
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,480
Oh, fair.

511
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,000
This is my...

512
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,680
Well done.

513
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,120
This is part of my costuming.

514
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,500
Well done.

515
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,040
Yes.

516
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,200
Yes, Alton.

517
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,080
Yes, Reverend Fanboy is cosplaying as Flash Hercules this year.

518
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
He just needed his Cub Scout uniform.

519
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,380
Either that,

520
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,860
or Beanie from the Beanie and Cecil cartoons.

521
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,520
Ah, yes.

522
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,400
A Bob Clampett cartoon.

523
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,300
I made that my avatar for a while.

524
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,080
Because I figure everywhere I'm going,

525
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm wearing a propeller beanie.

526
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,640
You just can't see it.

527
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,720
This is the first time that people can actually see the propeller beanie

528
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,360
that is on my head at all times.

529
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,200
I was on the back.

530
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:21,180
That music seems to be much lower than Reverend Stang indicated

531
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,220
on his really high quality notes here.

532
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,400
Well, of course, he wasn't...

533
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,580
Put it up to three.

534
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,840
...hooking it up exactly the way it was hooked up here.

535
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,520
So there could be some slight variation there.

536
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,020
No doubt.

537
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,800
How have you found Wisteria so far, Philo?

538
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,480
How have you seen it?

539
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,120
Any unusual sights or creatures here?

540
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,440
Hmm.

541
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,780
Well...

542
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,800
Like a giant vulture, for example?

543
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,720
I didn't see a giant vulture eviscerating a rabbit.

544
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,900
I saw a rabbit last night.

545
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,520
It ran in front of the car.

546
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,580
I didn't actually see it.

547
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,780
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.

548
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,560
Saw a flattened frog.

549
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,420
A flattened frog is only two points,

550
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,640
but at least you saw that.

551
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,420
We saw a live frog right in here.

552
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,340
In Caffeinus.

553
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,860
Did you eat it?

554
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,500
No.

555
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,560
Reverend Dr. Mother Miller picked it up

556
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,100
and put it in the cool, wet grass outside.

557
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,040
That was very nice.

558
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,480
And...

559
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,440
That frog probably went home into its little frog families

560
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,000
and said,

561
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,000
you won't believe what happened to me tonight.

562
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,060
We've seen many long-legged, round-bodied spiders, of course.

563
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,700
I was wandering around in this place.

564
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,520
These people were about to step on me,

565
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,560
and somebody saved me.

566
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,840
They took me out to the grass.

567
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,480
I was able to scamper back to my little home.

568
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,740
And family.

569
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,540
My domicile.

570
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,580
And you guys, you kids.

571
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,460
Yeah, the tadpoles were glad to see Dad.

572
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,280
The tads were.

573
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,100
So, we have done some good here,

574
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,240
and perhaps the exes will look on us with favor

575
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,880
because we are now living in harmony with our environment

576
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,900
and all that sort of thing.

577
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,360
And how about those?

578
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,400
They're not biting mosquitoes.

579
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,500
None of them have bit me so far.

580
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,500
They're falling down on the job.

581
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,380
And I like that.

582
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,460
Yeah, it feels good.

583
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,400
Usually, they swarm around me, biting me.

584
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I mean, it doesn't feel good.

585
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,320
Well, that part doesn't feel good, no,

586
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,160
but it's good that they have lapsed their usual vigilance.

587
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,300
I have so many of Reverend Stang's plugs and stuff.

588
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,400
It makes me paranoid.

589
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,960
Well, you can't knock success, but...

590
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,260
I'm afraid I'm going to lose a plug.

591
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:42,640


592
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,560
But you can't just plug it in.

593
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,480
in and see what happens. And forget it.

594
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,080
Well, just set it

595
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,420
and forget it. Experiment

596
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,460
a little bit. That's what made this

597
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,100
country great.

598
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,820
But, if we

599
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,260
have everything happening

600
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,460
and things are plugged in. That's some heavy, heavy

601
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,620
rumble there. Uh-huh, yes.

602
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,780
Listen to the rumble, the rattle

603
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,440
and the roar.

604
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,740
She's coming round the mountain.

605
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,600
Wabash Cannonball.

606
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,280
That low frequency hum

607
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,340
is the sound of

608
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,540
disappointed subgeniuses

609
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,100
at X-Day.

610
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,160
Who feel, once again,

611
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,140
obscurely cheated that the

612
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,080
X's have shown

613
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,340
their typical flighty behavior

614
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,140
and altered their landing

615
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,420
schedule. Leaving us all

616
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,480
with dinosaur egg

617
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,340
on our face. It's the PA feeding back.

618
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,160
Um, the, um...

619
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,400
We don't really... I think maybe I've got it

620
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
too close to the speaker.

621
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,040
Feedback, eh?

622
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,100
Ha, ha, ha.

623
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,960
So, things are really

624
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,200
happening at X-Day. It's a happening time.

625
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,720
We're going to put those bobbleheads

626
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,200
behind the midget

627
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,860
speaker.

628
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,500
That might work.

629
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,140
Now we're getting feedback, though,

630
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,180
of no uncertain kind.

631
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:15,880
.

632
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:21,940
.

633
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:27,620
.

634
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


635
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


636
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


637
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


638
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,620


639
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,640
.

640
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:27,660
.

641
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,680
.

642
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:27,720
.

643
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:27,760
.

644
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:27,880
.

645
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:27,880


646
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:27,880


647
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:33,860
.

648
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:33,880
.

649
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:33,900
.

650
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:33,920
.

651
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:33,940
.

652
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:33,960
.

653
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:33,980
.

654
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,000
.

655
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,020
.

656
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:55,900
So yeah, this is, it's amazing. It's completely amazing. The people, the places, the times, it's just stuff rolling around.

657
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:04,540
And we are here in an unusual piece of ground also. Wisteria is not like other places.

658
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:11,120
When they had the big power meltdown a number of years ago, only Wisteria was spared.

659
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:17,220
Where for some reason this place had power and the rest of the state was...

660
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,260
They probably forgot about it, you know.

661
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,380
A forgotten piece of just power spewing out.

662
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,780
Hey, what about that pipe over there? Oh, don't worry about it.

663
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,400
That power just leaks out.

664
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,640
All the 7-Elevens and Circle Ks were sweltering without air conditioning.

665
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,280
The power just falls out of those receptacles onto the ground.

666
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,660
Gas stations refused to pump.

667
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:51,760
Wouldn't that be weird if you had to like put it, something in there like gas, you know, to keep the power from falling out when you weren't using it?

668
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,700
Well...

669
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:00,420
Sometimes it squirted out a little bit, you know, out of the little receptacle.

670
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:10,440
That's reminiscent of James Thurber's aunt who was always afraid when a light bulb wasn't screwed in that electricity would be leaking out.

671
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:10,800
Yeah.

672
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,960
It makes sense. I can see how somebody would think that.

673
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,540
Makes a lot of sense.

674
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,540
People should probably give money to somebody.

675
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,920
Somewhere, for something.

676
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,460
To help out somewhere with something.

677
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,940
And what about that phenomenon?

678
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,260
People found that a long time ago, that money helps.

679
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,560
It's a terrible disadvantage that Reverend Stang is not here.

680
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm sure you'd agree.

681
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,100
But there's...

682
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,860
There's a slight advantage, though, where we can talk about things that he would keep us from talking about.

683
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Yeah, like movies?

684
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,760
Well, no, that's what we always talk about.

685
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,040
What I was thinking of, though, is that huge banned list of banned people that I had to give to the administrators.

686
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,160
Where is that? Do you have a copy of that list?

687
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,960
It's up at the shack with the guards.

688
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,840
What's the deal with that?

689
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,780
The people who give you a hard time when you come in.

690
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,000
What's the deal with that?

691
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,440
Are the church and subgenius...

692
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,000
Is it really that selective?

693
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,920
Well, we don't want all these folks coming in because they disrupt the harmony of our conciliancy here.

694
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:32,220
Just because it's a church of non-joiners, doesn't that kind of mean that there's going to be people that don't like to join coming here?

695
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,160
Well, Philo, there's a rumor I've heard.

696
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,660
We can even talk about this, that you might be in charge of X Day in the future.

697
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,420
And if...

698
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:48,160
If that is true, maybe you might have different admission policy and let all these troublemakers in at once.

699
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:57,180
Have a giant X Day of nothing but the bad and banned people, since their list is now larger than the people who are actually here.

700
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:05,260
Yeah, but then we'll have built a gladiatorial combat, and their admission will be they have to go to battle in the arena while the rest of us watch.

701
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,820
We have that at Burning Man, the Thunderdome, where people are...

702
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:09,980
Yeah.

703
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,420
Well, we'd have...

704
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,560
We'd have our own version of that, only it would be much rougher and much more deadly and...

705
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,180
Of course.

706
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,800
...able to hurt yourself.

707
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,980
That's not really a good idea, because remember, there have been serious injuries...

708
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,420
But this is the list of the banned.

709
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,660
We already don't like them.

710
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,520
...the hospital folks out here.

711
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,620
When the blood wrestling occurred, there were unfortunate injuries, I recall.

712
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,080
But, right, but this is the list of the banned, Dr. Howe.

713
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,100
We already don't like them, so we don't care about what they think, so we can...

714
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,280
Well, Philo...

715
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,380
...if they get hurt, it's okay.

716
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,720
If this is gonna be your deal, you could declare...

717
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,020
They get hurt for our pleasure.

718
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:52,860
...subgenius amnesty, and give them a chance, which of course they'll follow up, to redeem themselves once more.

719
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,640
Yeah.

720
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,600
And so...

721
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,640
You know, have a big mountain in the middle of our gladiatorial combat arena that they battle to get to the top of.

722
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,060
We call that Washout Mountain.

723
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,120
Well, as long as somebody else besides me builds it, I have...

724
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,200
No basic objection.

725
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
Okay, I'm gonna talk about a movie for a minute.

726
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,700
All right.

727
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,880
Did you ever see that one that had Jet Li in it called The One?

728
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,160
The One.

729
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,720
Is it dubbed?

730
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,960
No, I think it was English.

731
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
Okay, then unauthentic.

732
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,700
All right, don't worry about it.

733
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,160
Never mind.

734
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,740
Never mind.

735
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,040
Nobody here saw it.

736
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,080
Well, you see, Hong Kong, they dub them all.

737
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,640
It's a good movie.

738
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,400
It's an action flick, you know.

739
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,180
Uh-huh.

740
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,980
All action.

741
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,500
And you mentioned this because you're thinking of swinging into action and...

742
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,060
There was a scene at the very end of it where all of the ones that are trying to get to be the one

743
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,700
are trying to get the one who's at the top of the mountain.

744
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,540
They're running up at him and he's taking them on from all sides.

745
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,660
Sure, kids like to play that game.

746
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,720
It's awesome, yeah.

747
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,480
King of the Mountain.

748
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,160
Mm-hmm.

749
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,480
I'm King of the Mountain.

750
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,840
I'll take on all comers.

751
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,040
As long as you have the stamina.

752
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,560
It's like King of the Wood.

753
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:21,740
The King of the Wood had to take on all comers because everybody was trying to get to be him

754
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,280
and he had to fight them off.

755
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:31,100
Yes, the best is a secure position that people aren't competing to get in.

756
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,660
Yeah.

757
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:33,660


758
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,560
Yeah.

759
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,560
Yeah.

760
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,640
Yeah.

761
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,660
Yeah.

762
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,500
Yeah.

763
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,120
Yeah.

764
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,780
Yeah.

765
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,400
Yeah.

766
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


767
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


768
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


769
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


770
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


771
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


772
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


773
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,400


774
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,180
Hey, what's going on?

775
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,320
Eight-foot cola! Eight-foot cola!

776
00:34:51,820 --> 00:35:09,140
Eight-foot cola!

777
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:39,140
Eight-foot cola!

778
00:35:42,840 --> 00:36:09,140
Eight-foot cola!

779
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,160
Eight-foot cola!

780
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,280
What was the question? Is he talking about this?

781
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,120
Did I see any strange signs?

782
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,280
Yeah, you do.

783
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,240
Did you see anything that might shed some light on where we are now?

784
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,640
We didn't see anything. That's what was unusual.

785
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,580
We didn't see any... There was absolutely nothing.

786
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,680
Just an empty void.

787
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,780
All the way here.

788
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,400
Empty. Void.

789
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,360
No cars, no people.

790
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,380
No zombies or anything.

791
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,420
Anything.

792
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,100
Just anything.

793
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,360
Just completely devoid of animals and mammals.

794
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,360
Like all the stuff we were anticipating somehow already happened and we missed it.

795
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
The world gave up on itself early.

796
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
It's about time.

797
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,580
How are those greens?

798
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,740
The slaw is fine.

799
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,220
These greens...

800
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,040
Oh, good, you got slaw.

801
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Some people would say lettuce doesn't really count as greens, even though it's green.

802
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,260
It's mostly water.

803
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,320
Green water.

804
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,460
Doesn't even have that much fiber.

805
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,680
Fiber.

806
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,380
You can overanalyze.

807
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,480
Now, you take you some collards. That's got some fiber in it.

808
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:49,700
Oh, yeah.

809
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,300
You say we're going to take a collar?

810
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,420
Yep.

811
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,580
Yeah, I wish we could take a collar.

812
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,080
A certain collar.

813
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,860
We would love to have Reverend Ivan Stang himself call in and give us his blessing and benison on this day.

814
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,000
More difficult than others to pass.

815
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,280
Should we prop more?

816
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,100
Yes.

817
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,320
While we eat?

818
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,260
Yes.

819
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,280
Here on Mount Froppmore.

820
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,440
Little Johnny Froppmore.

821
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:17,740
Oh, look at that.

822
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,980
I had service when it was down here.

823
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,420
Moved my phone up a bit and it's gone.

824
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,100
There's absolutely no service again.

825
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,220
It's just a teasing service.

826
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,460
It's us.

827
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,620
In a cloud of fropp smoke.

828
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,260
Hey, did you see that they said that...

829
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,260


830
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,400
That Jurassic Park is not really that far off from a reality.

831
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,660
They can actually do that.

832
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:45,880
Really?

833
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,820
That's what they said.

834
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,780
I don't know.

835
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,580
Using DNA stuff.

836
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,700
I saw that coffee makes you live longer somewhere.

837
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,880
Now that is true.

838
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,440
Well, then I should...

839
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,240
I've picked my own...

840
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,120
Coffee makes you live longer. Yes.

841
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,240
But they can't produce dinosaurs. No.

842
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,600
At 104 years old.

843
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,180
Now I know when I'm 103, I'm gonna go, oh man.

844
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
When I'm 104.

845
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,900
Good thing I drank all that coffee.

846
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,560
First of all, nobody has a complete DNA sequence.

847
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Yeah, everybody I know ever knew is dead.

848
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,300
Even if you get rid of all the other problems.

849
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
That coffee sure was good.

850
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,960
But at least there was coffee and it was good.

851
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,220
The herb that lifts...

852
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,160
I try to talk those other idiots into drinking coffee.

853
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,060
They'll learn.

854
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,340
Wow, that's a cool bubble pipe you got there.

855
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,740
Yeah.

856
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,400
Nice.

857
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,100
Yeah, I see that.

858
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,120
Like grapes?

859
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,740
Is that that edible bubbles?

860
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,860
Ain't taking the trouble to blow my bubbles away.

861
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,300
They have edible bubbles now?

862
00:39:59,560 --> 00:39:59,820
Yeah.

863
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,720
What do they taste like?

864
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,140
Yes, they have...

865
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,100
Soap?

866
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
It tastes like soap.

867
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,780
In a way, why wouldn't you just eat the bubbles anyway?

868
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,600
It's just a little bit...

869
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,060
They have catnip bubbles.

870
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,140
Catnip bubbles.

871
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


872
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


873
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


874
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


875
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


876
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


877
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


878
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


879
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


880
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,140


881
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,360
Yeah, I saw that.

882
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,600
For your cat to chase.

883
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,540
Now that is good.

884
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,200
See, people have been thinking...

885
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,820
Yes.

886
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,000
...about what this world needs now.

887
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,320
I remember trying to smoke catnip.

888
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:31,680
Boy, there have been some desperate times we've gone through, pulling the pieces of probable

889
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,280
marijuana out of the carpet.

890
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,240
Yeah.

891
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Going back through the ashtray.

892
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,120
Yeah.

893
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,620
and finding the ashes that weren't totally burnt through.

894
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,180
And having your cat smoking it.

895
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,280
He'd better not.

896
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,300
And not sharing.

897
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,380
And not sharing.

898
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,140
Damn it.

899
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,780
Yeah, the cat hiding the lighter.

900
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,540
He said,

901
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,540
Don't you think you've had enough, Frop, Philo?

902
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,000
Who said that?

903
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,380
Leroy, I am the Frop.

904
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,360
The people's moderating instincts.

905
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,440
Go ahead, eat some of those bubbles.

906
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,600
They taste like grapes.

907
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,500
Believe me, they do.

908
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,620
Go ahead.

909
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,800
Tastes like grape soap.

910
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,120
They might make you a bit irregular.

911
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,360
Isn't that interesting?

912
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,800
I mean, they make soaps that smell so good that you want to drink it or eat it.

913
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,780
Consuming soap is not good for the human.

914
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,680
It's just something you probably shouldn't do.

915
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,180
Think about that.

916
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,500
That's your job,

917
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:37,980
is to make,

918
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,620
things that smell so good that you want to eat it,

919
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,980
but they're just made out of chemicals,

920
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,400
and you're just tweaking these chemical compounds.

921
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,180
Smells so good, you want to scarf it down.

922
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,480
And then you use the stem cell.

923
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,080
It's kind of like a detector of pain and good taste and bad taste,

924
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,700
and it registers an electronic output and tells the researcher,

925
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,120
yeah, that smells good.

926
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,480
It's good.

927
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,320
Remember they had those apples a few years ago that smelled like grapes.

928
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
They were called grape apples.

929
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,140
Yeah.

930
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,980
Or grapples.

931
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,780
Those were a kind of a fad, I think.

932
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,320
Yeah, they were.

933
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,880
They didn't taste like grapes.

934
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,060
I saw how they did it.

935
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,220
They just take regular apples and just soak them in like a grape-flavored brine.

936
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:25,780
Terrible.

937
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,040
It just draws you to it, and you spend like four extra bucks for six apples

938
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,080
that smell like grapes but taste like apples.

939
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,980
What kind of?

940
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,580
Grapes.

941
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,420
There were many different grapes and many different flavors of grapes.

942
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:38,800
White grapes.

943
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,640
Whatever kind of grapes they make grape Kool-Aid out of.

944
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,320
Concord grapes, like Mogan-David?

945
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,700
Yes, exactly.

946
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,120
Mogan-David apples.

947
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,380
Mad Dog 2020 apples.

948
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,860
Would you drink that?

949
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,700
Eat that?

950
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,660
I would try it.

951
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,020
Yeah, sure.

952
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,940
I would try it.

953
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,740
Because I try to try anything and everything at least once.

954
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,720
I would tell them to order tomatos and ponzas, and I would drink keepers.

955
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:08,720


956
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:08,720


957
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,120
Look Bob, wear my hat.

958
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,560
Bob.

959
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,220
Bob?

960
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,840
Hey Philo, are you eating the hell out of that sloppy joe?

961
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,360
Did they give you a donut too?

962
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,560
I hope I don't die later.

963
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,080
That donut was incredibly delicious.

964
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,800
You got a good amount in that mustache.

965
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,420
There you go.

966
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,460
It's not until the next day that's when you go,

967
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,880
Oh, what's this? Oh, it's corn.

968
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,760
The next day.

969
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,980
It's a potential soup receptacle.

970
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,640
Think about it. You could get enough stuff

971
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,080
if you don't clean it very often.

972
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,520
You get enough crumbs in there, you can just boil it

973
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,020
and make soup out of it.

974
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,400
Oh yeah, beard soup.

975
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,860
Exactly, beard soup.

976
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,680
Doc Howell needs to grow a beard now.

977
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,840
I would if I was him.

978
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,260
Yeah.

979
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,160
But for me, it's all about not shaving.

980
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,800
Right.

981
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,620
The shaver.

982
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:17,900
The shaver of our mysteries.

983
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,700
I was saying you should grow a beard.

984
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,820
Like the D-Rose under Mount Shasta.

985
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,640
My face is so smooth, it's almost like a baby's butt now,

986
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,840
but it's covered in hair.

987
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,360
White men have smooth faces with fuzzy baby butt.

988
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,980
Like a fuzzy, hairy baby's butt.

989
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,820
Well, now I think that's a little bit of an exaggeration.

990
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,440
Because it really wasn't that little of a baby.

991
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,940
Yeah, but the butt was smooth.

992
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,220
The butt is silk.

993
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,540
By the highway in northernmost California,

994
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,380
in California's lost coast area,

995
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,980
where I just was,

996
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:03,540
there's a place of Bigfoot's bad taste world

997
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,200
with carvings of bears and yetis and things all carved out of redwood,

998
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,920
all sorts of tourist stuff.

999
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,680
Also lawn gnomes and things like that.

1000
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,620
There, they had the world's most beautiful,

1001
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,680
the world's largest lawn gnome.

1002
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,640
This amazing sculpture of this gigantic thing.

1003
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,200
It was really well sculpted.

1004
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,620
You went behind it where its fat hands were folded behind it.

1005
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,640
The anatomical detail was superb.

1006
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,140
But the thing itself must have weighed many tons.

1007
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,140
And this year when I went up, it was gone.

1008
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,300
This gigantic lawn gnome disappeared.

1009
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,300
How?

1010
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,240
Who could call it out?

1011
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,440
I don't know.

1012
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,040
Those damn scrappers?

1013
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,720
They have some crappy, fairly big lawn gnomes.

1014
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,260
Why? Why?

1015
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,820
They are no way a replacement for this thing,

1016
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,500
which was far larger than any human's stature.

1017
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:57,760
But how? How?

1018
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,480
It was a goliath of lawn gnomes.

1019
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,480
And they've got some badly sculpted things that are fairly big,

1020
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,520
but nothing like that.

1021
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,420
How could they have done such a thing, Doctor?

1022
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,260
It's on a mountain road.

1023
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,060
It's by the big trees that you have to drive through,

1024
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,720
winding around and around and around.

1025
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,020
Only an army of gnomes?

1026
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,140
Only an army of gnomes would have attempted such a thing.

1027
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,660
No.

1028
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,740
Well, I'm sorry that that happened.

1029
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,080
And I once got myself photographed standing by it.

1030
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,960
So I will now treasure that photograph.

1031
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,320
It's the garden golem.

1032
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,620
You see, it just walked away on its own.

1033
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,240
They also had a sculpture of a yeti stomping on a garden gnome.

1034
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,920
I've seen those.

1035
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,820
You have?

1036
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,320
Yes.

1037
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,500
This is the first time I ever saw something like that.

1038
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,660
I saw where they have a bear.

1039
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,320
No, it's a yeti.

1040
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,020
It's a Sasquatch.

1041
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,680
It's a Sasquatch.

1042
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,960
And he's stomping on a garden gnome.

1043
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,420
And I don't see my girlfriend,

1044
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,560
but I bought her a pair of socks there

1045
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,820
that show a UFO abducting a yeti woven into the fabric.

1046
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,760
Perhaps she still has them on.

1047
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,100
I think that that's what happens.

1048
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,300
They, you know, X-Day, yetis have X-Days every year.

1049
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,400
And their spaceship comes.

1050
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,680
The ecstasy of X-Day.

1051
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,760
They just don't like us.

1052
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,860
They like yeti.

1053
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,040
Or they come, but there's some problem with that.

1054
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,040


1055
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,920
Where there are actually only a few molecules.

1056
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,200
If I could grow a beard, just quit shaving.

1057
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,500
What?

1058
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,280
Quit shaking?

1059
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,140
A bear, you think?

1060
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:23,980
I didn't grow this beard.

1061
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,800
Oh, a beard.

1062
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,140
Just quit shaving.

1063
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,100
This is my normal face.

1064
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,020
This is my normal face.

1065
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:28,440
Right.

1066
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,960
I was saying if everyone stopped shaving, we could all maybe look more like yetis.

1067
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,480
And maybe the yetis, I think, are the ones that are getting picked up by the saucers.

1068
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,220
They look more like the Duck Dynasty crowd.

1069
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,680
No, we don't want that.

1070
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,460
And we're expected to curtail our philosophy.

1071
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,740
No, we don't want that.

1072
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,400
Those guys grew beards.

1073
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,740
They didn't just stop shaving.

1074
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,240
Oh, yes, of course.

1075
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,960
It's show business.

1076
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,140
What can one say?

1077
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,220
The magic of...

1078
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,100
They do have good beards.

1079
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,200
I've watched that show just for looking at the beards.

1080
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,060
Oh, yeah, the beards are good.

1081
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,460
You can't hold anything they say against the beards.

1082
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,260
No.

1083
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,320
But they are dicks.

1084
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:08,860
Otherwise.

1085
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,440
But that's the attraction.

1086
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,760
I never even listen to what they say because I'm watching the beards so much.

1087
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,340
Well, you see, they're all...

1088
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,340
You know, self-regarding...

1089
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,080
Transfixed by the beard.

1090
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,080
The government has no business telling me not to...

1091
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,660
Transfixed with fascination.

1092
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,240
Duck beard.

1093
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,720
What?

1094
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,380
I'm transfixed with fascination.

1095
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:41,440
And their beards keep them warm, supposedly, as they huddle in duck blinds waiting to exercise their Second Amendment rights with the overflying waterfall.

1096
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,140
It will keep you hot.

1097
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Actually, I find that...

1098
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,720
I find it different.

1099
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:55,640
Okay, Philo, you forced me to ask this question, and that is, when you sleep at night, do you put the beard on the outside of the covers or inside?

1100
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,280
I put it on the outside.

1101
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,540
By God, I knew it.

1102
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,360
I knew it.

1103
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,960
Because I don't want the covers doing this to my chin at night.

1104
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,680
Right, right.

1105
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,920
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

1106
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,500
That makes perfect sense.

1107
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,460
And now I know.

1108
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,260
That 20 centuries of stony sleep were...

1109
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,440
Oh, well.

1110
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,560
They were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle.

1111
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,200
But I got that beard thing.

1112
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:24,760
Yeah.

1113
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,520
Sometimes I wrap rubber bands around it, but I don't have any of them with me.

1114
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,480
When they snap, it must be an unpleasant...

1115
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,060
Then you look like Captain Hugh Albano.

1116
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,020
They're hair bands made for little girls.

1117
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,280
Oh, yeah, thank you.

1118
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,660
So it kind of brings out the little girl in me when I do it.

1119
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,160
She doesn't have herself.

1120
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,240
No.

1121
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,660
She doesn't have her socks on.

1122
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,120
Oh, well.

1123
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,080
Oh, well.

1124
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,120
It's still a little warm.

1125
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,820
Oh, no.

1126
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,600
She doesn't have her socks on.

1127
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:57,340
I wanted to show off those Yeti alien abduction socks.

1128
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,280
Oh, I get it.

1129
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:58,800
Okay, okay.

1130
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,800
Your no sock girlfriend.

1131
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,420
I have an urge, since I just pulled it up on Facebook...

1132
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,020
That's what she said.

1133
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,020
...to read this post of Stang's.

1134
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,340
I think it should be read into the record.

1135
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,700
Fair enough.

1136
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,840
I don't want to wreck a mood, but...

1137
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,780
So this is from Reverend Ivan Stang.

1138
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,440
I won't be at X Day.

1139
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,760
My niece Claire died on Sunday night.

1140
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,880
As some of you may know from the GoFundMe I often circulated,

1141
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,940
Claire was the victim of a chronic, incurable, degenerative disease of the connective tissues

1142
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,520
called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or EDS.

1143
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,520
She posted on Facebook about her constant struggle and pain,

1144
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,140
and she and her mother, my sister who also suffers from EDS,

1145
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,280
were our neighbors at the ranch in Texas, and we were very close.

1146
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,320
My sister is in jail for assisting the suicide of her daughter last Sunday night.

1147
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,840
I have to be back at the ranch in Texas as soon as possible.

1148
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,540
Princess Wee and her mom will be driving our van full of X Day gear and necessities

1149
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,660
from Cleveland to Wisteria on Wednesday,

1150
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,980
and I hope other good subgenius doctors who are there

1151
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,480
will help her unload and set up the festival infrastructure,

1152
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,460
such as it is, the way I usually do.

1153
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,960
It should be a normal, in quotes, X Day,

1154
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,920
ha ha, except that I won't be running around taping everything.

1155
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,040
I am including instructions for setting up Tarzan's radio studio,

1156
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:36,280
which we will be bringing along with much of the swag and decorations and Bobby Awards.

1157
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,000
Reverend Heathen has the giant pulpit and some of the swag and bull dada auction stuff.

1158
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,780
Our little hound dog Buddy and I

1159
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,680
will be taking a rented car to Texas as soon as we see Wee and her mom off.

1160
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,020
I need to bring my portable office back with me,

1161
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,460
because it may be a while before I'm back in Cleveland to clean out the house

1162
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,420
and get it up for sale as fast as possible.

1163
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,580
I'm glad I was able to stop crying long enough to type this.

1164
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,420
So that's the serious business.

1165
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,160
That's the underpinnings of X Day 21.

1166
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,540
We got that yesterday in the afternoon.

1167
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,540
Yes. Yep.

1168
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,740
So that's the backbeat of what's going on here,

1169
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,820
which is, I think the next big thing that's going to happen is dinner, honestly.

1170
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,360
Yes.

1171
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,760
Doesn't seem like anything else is going on.

1172
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,460
No, I have not seen Princess Wee down here yet.

1173
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,400
No. Understandably.

1174
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,200
So that's fine, you know.

1175
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,240
I think people are having a good, I'm having an excellent time reconnecting with you.

1176
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,500
I think that's what people are doing right now, just like...

1177
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,900
Reconhaven too.

1178
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,840
Reconhaven and reconnecting. Yes.

1179
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,560
Reconnecting Havoc.

1180
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:52,660
So this is Jane's Podcast Studio in lieu of Tarzan's radio station.

1181
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:52,940
Had to happen sooner or later.

1182
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,640
Had to happen sooner or later. I think that's the theme here.

1183
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,880
Yeah, we're definitely just kicking back and making the best of it.

1184
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,440
Hopefully that's the theme tomorrow at 7 a.m. It had to happen sooner or later.

1185
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,640
It had to happen sooner or later.

1186
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,760
Because things do.

1187
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:09,840
Things do.

1188
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:18,840
No matter what happened, you know, all we're doing is chronicling the passing of one second after another.

1189
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,840
And noises occur around those seconds. They're picked up by our crude equipment.

1190
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,460
Turned into something you could potentially listen to later. Or not.

1191
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,120
I'm not sure if that's what she said in the moment.

1192
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,080
No. It's definitely not. It's definitely not.

1193
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,740
Well, I was thinking about the picked up by crude equipment to be heard later by everyone.

1194
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,080
Yeah. Crude indeed.

1195
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:53,800
We'll be back after this break after a word from our sponsor, Thompson's Motor Oil and Salad Dressing.

1196
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,700
Did you say pee in the gene pool?

1197
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:07,420
No, I didn't. But on the other hand, it's A-C-T-H. You see, the pee doesn't enter into earthly genetics.

1198
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:14,940
Not around here. Not on this little part of the solar system.

1199
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,880
I'm going to have to run a line, though.

1200
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,120
The piece of original material.

1201
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,420
Actually, it sounds kind of loud.

1202
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,700
Solar detritus.

1203
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,500
Which covered a vast distance by our standards.

1204
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:36,580
But what is left is enough for a world sized to our own needs.

1205
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:44,160
Well, it is possible that we have now discovered companion worlds in our nearest stellar neighbor.

1206
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,800
Alpha Centauri.

1207
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,320
That's the cough mic over there.

1208
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,720
Earth-like planets.

1209
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,740
We just use that for coughing, too.

1210
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:58,940
But as Earth-like as they may be, if they happen to be of a greater gravitational pull than ours, then there's hardly any point in going.

1211
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,400
If you need to cough, Dr. Howell, there's a cough mic right behind you.

1212
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,640
It's not the cough that carries you off. It's the cough that they carry you off in.

1213
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,480
I know I was going to cough, but I suppressed it, you see.

1214
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,900
Yeah, it's good to suppress a cough.

1215
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,820
You don't have to cough right into the...

1216
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,220
There's no spit suppressor here in front of these microphones.

1217
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,500
Have you seen those spit guards they have?

1218
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,880
Well, theoretically, these are kind of like spit catchers.

1219
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,600
So you can't...

1220
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,000
These catch the spit.

1221
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,740
They hold it. It holds it for a while.

1222
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,360
And then while it's holding it...

1223
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,620
This is...

1224
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:36,940
It's spewing...

1225
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,060
It's causing it to ferment.

1226
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,340
...impassioned saliva.

1227
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,820
So you have this fermented saliva.

1228
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,260
Well, one can be too much of a...

1229
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,840
Dried and embedded.

1230
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,380
...queasy, squeamish...

1231
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:54,560
It's like a fossil. It's kind of like a fossil. It takes over the material and actually becomes the material.

1232
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:01,520
A Roderick Usher character. And it's possible to be too sensitive. You know, you've got to buckle down and...

1233
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,460
Don't ever smell it.

1234
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,560
Yeah, well, that's...

1235
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,260
Please, don't. I'm warning you.

1236
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,880
It's not worth it.

1237
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,960
But you can't forbid the allure of...

1238
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,020
Those hairs on your nose are worth or for something. They protect your nose.

1239
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,280
Forbidden.

1240
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:31,400
They do. And if you have chemotherapy, they fall out and then your nose runs because there's nothing to keep that from happening. An indignity of those...

1241
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,700
Yeah, well, you've got to trim those... It's like filters. They're filters.

1242
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:41,540
Yes, indeed. And they must indeed be hacked back. The wild brushes must be hacked.

1243
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:49,040
And I do hack them back all the way from here to all the Rackham sack. The only place I'd ever want to be.

1244
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,320
In Rackham sack.

1245
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:59,980
But you see, it's as Dr. Morrow said, the beast flesh must be cut back bit by bit. I'm not allowed to accumulate.

1246
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,100
So true.

1247
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,640
And I think a lot of the places where you get this...

1248
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:13,980
Phenom is where there is cellular damage because, sorry, too much exposure to the sun, too much solar radiation, now you've had genetic damage to your skin.

1249
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,340
And what's this? One inch long hair growing out of the anti-tragus of your ear. That's not supposed to be there.

1250
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:30,520
And so you have to be prepared to hack down these abominations should they erupt.

1251
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,640
Or else have a grisly...

1252
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,080
Aspect indeed.

1253
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:47,880
Not that one would have a single brow and two fingers of the hand of identical length.

1254
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,540
Somebody said, what would you do if you had an ear on your chin?

1255
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,500
Well, that would be sad, dude.

1256
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,820
You'd hear yourself eating all the time.

1257
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,900
Like those mice with a giant ear on their back.

1258
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Every time you're eating it would sound so loud.

1259
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,180
The ear grown on the mouse's back.

1260
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,620
Chomping, slopping.

1261
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,960
Chomping sounds all the time.

1262
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,500
You'd hear your larynx gulping, you know.

1263
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,420
Well, that you hear inductively.

1264
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:15,840
All these sounds.

1265
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,540
That is not necessarily even coming through the ear but vibrating from the inside of your...

1266
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,800
Of course, I think you could hear down.

1267
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,900
Maxilla and mandible action.

1268
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,540
You could hear down.

1269
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,960
And once again the curious human with...

1270
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,540
Because it's pointing right off of your chin.

1271
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,680
More versatile than almost any other part of the...

1272
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,900
The animal kingdom.

1273
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,660
Unlike the crocodiles and reptiles and so forth.

1274
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,640
The jaw can just go up and down.

1275
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,140
The same thing with birds.

1276
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:51,760
But with the mammals, they can move the jaw all around for complicated grinding motion.

1277
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,940
Well, Dr. Howe...

1278
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:58,500
It absorbs all that passed between its ravenous slavering.

1279
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,540
I think this is about to run out.

1280
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,340
We should take a pause here.

1281
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:02,860
All right, yes.

1282
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:12,600
And so that brings you to the end of this episode of the Tarzan's radio station broadcast from X Day 21.

1283
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1284
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,120
Bob?

1285
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:32,840
That's Salvation and Infotation at www.subgene.com.

1286
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:32,840


1287
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,160
Or got that pencil ready?

1288
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:42,620
P.O. Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1289
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,460
Okay, friends on the internet where I can flog or swag legally.

1290
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,640
If you want to help yourself and the Church of the Subgenius

1291
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,740
and get a pretty cool package with like 25 different nifty things in it,

1292
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:10,040
like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card,

1293
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:16,200
you need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.

1294
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,180
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get.

1295
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,640
And you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum,

1296
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,640
which is members only and where we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1297
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,620
Much more.

1298
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,540
Much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1299
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,340
Isn't that funny?

1300
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,580
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of

1301
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,980
with Bob's face on it.

1302
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,120
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics.

1303
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:48,460
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs

1304
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,080
and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1305
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,420
And best of all, from our main online store,

1306
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,860
you can buy the Book of the Subgenius,

1307
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,520
which is by far the greatest thing we've ever done.

1308
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,100
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book,

1309
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,920
22 bucks, in print for over 30 years,

1310
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:10,160
and every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1311
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,020
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also.

1312
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,380
Keep my fingers nimble.

1313
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,540
That's subgenius.com and remember, it's only money.
