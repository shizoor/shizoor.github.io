Of course you're going to get pot.

My house smells inside.
My favorite thing is that the food comes out.
My husband hates chicken, so I made the chicken the other night.
And he's like, chicken, chicken.
I really appreciate the fat on the meat.
Another thing that's really nice, you can have a cocktail.
My favorite thing.
Is the fact that it's my family.
You salmon is too dry, a little too soggy.
And the family kept saying,
I like the oven.
I came home and made my husband chicken.
Such a wonderful shock.
We just love that machine.
The machine surprised me.
In the woods, it's fabulous.
I love electricity.
Call now and order the all-purpose chicken video
and an instructional nonstick platform.
Order right now.
And you'll also get 30 gloves worth $250.

Hurrah!
Hurrah!
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small.
By giving you no time instead of it all.
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school.
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool.
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules.
A working class hero is something to be.


A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years.
Then they expect you to pick a career.
Then they expect you to pick a career.
When you can't really function
You're so full of fear.
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
Keep you doped with religion, sex and TV
A working class hero is something to be.
Keep you doped with religion, sex and TV.

A working class hero is something to be.

And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top, they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero
is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
I am a subgenius and by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than men
I dare you to kill me, I am not a dupe of the conspiracy, I know more than they do
I am a subgenius, that's all I need to be
Fuck, I'm one of the good guys, I shall prevail
Let out the crazy man inside you, he knows what's what
Smile when you call me a fanatic, me primate, me overman
I say to the pigs, give me your money, you won't need it, the future offers you not for destruction
Unlike this 500 pound mouse that is inside of you
Jesus spoke of it when he said, here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty
The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding
Members of Congress of both political parties agree that the United Nations Security Council is a threat to peace
We agree that horrible poisons and diseases
And gases and atomic weapons
Since we all agree on this goal, the issue is how best can we achieve it
What I can't understand is why no one has seen them until now
Many Americans have raised legitimate questions
If they follow the usual pattern of their species, the nest may contain from several hundreds to several thousands
The head of more than 30,000 anthrax had likely produced two to four times that amount
And that's why I'm here
If we know dangerous weapons, does it make more dangerous weapons?
This is capable of killing at least 20 people
We produce thousands of tons of sarin nerve gas
These actions killed or injured at least 20 people
More than six people died in the attacks
And surveillance weapons
Every chemical and biological weapon of the war in 91
And we do despite isolation from the civilized world
How she got that way will never be known
In a region where more than 135,000 American civilians with a likely range of hundreds of miles
That could be used to disperse chemical or biological areas
We're targeting Saudi Arabia, Israel and other Turkey nations
Without leaving any fingerprints
And of course, all that might be required are a small container in the United States to deliver it
Now you're talking, talking like a man
And that is including 12 Americans killing an American passenger
We know that Iraq and the United States of America go back a decade
We know that Iraq and the United States have had high level contacts
These include chemical and biological weapons
And biological attacks
We've learned bomb making
And poisons
And we know that after deadly gases
We've gleefully celebrated
The instruments of mass death and destruction
May God
Leave it all
Just the one he got to hitting that bottle
And an era of new hope will begin
Right
Right
Right
Right
Yes
Jed Clampett's awesome experiments will never leave this room.
Yeah!
You know?
We just need to get out of here now.
What's that spell?
What's that spell?
Yeah.
What's that spell?
No, I don't think we...
If one of those Kraut gunners get him, he's a goner.
Or maybe we should...
Ah, yes, dear friends.
That was ESO Radio.
Thanks to WCSB and Claymore.
And thanks to...


Thanks to Professor Chaz, Smith, Lonson Cowboy, Dave, Princess Wiardo, and your surely Reverend
Ivan saying, we've also been hearing lots and lots of Leemur.
That's right, cut-ups by Fernandinende Leemur, the great graphic artist of alt.binary slack
and now the great class cut-up of our of slack.
Slack, good slack.
And speaking of slack, friends, I was poking around on the internet.
Looking at alt.binary sounds MP3 full CDs.
And I found this Brazilian band.
It had a cool name, Ligia Urbana.
And it was doing...
Most of their stuff was in Portuguese, but they were doing this one song in English that I was familiar with.
And I downloaded it and listened to it.
And it's...
Friends, it falls into the category of Inadvertible Data.
In this case, tell me if you don't think this is Jim.
Jim Morrison beats Billy Idol.
This is Jim Morrison, the original sequencer strange, belong to
the past, who Quantum linen is from Winterqueen.
This move stops the pattern.
It has to be said.
That is a mediocre version.
No doubt.
It's difficult.
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Love, sister, it's just a kiss away
See the fire burning down my street
See the fire burning down like coal
See the fire burning down my street
See the fire and there's no fucking place to go
Where are the drugs? Where are the drugs?
Where are the drugs? Where are the drugs?
Give me a shelter
Come on, baby, give me a shelter tonight
It burns like a red coal carpet
Burns like a red coal carpet
Burns like a red coal carpet, man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See a storm is coming
Yeah
My very life, my very life
Yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Give me a shelter
Give me a shelter
Give me a shelter
Give me a shelter
Mother Street today
Sebu
Where are the fucking drugs?
Sebu
Oh, Far Easter drugs, dear friends.
Far Easter drugs.
The Brazilian band Lixiao Urbana.
Ah, yes, yes, yes.
And now this.
Well, it's time to declare the voting
on the Mystery Girl of the Week contest closed
and open the envelope.
Mystery Girl of the Week this week goes to North Korea
who dumped that one.
I love the way they dumped the news.
They were in a meeting and they just sort of looked at the Americans
and said,
Of course we have the fucking bomb, you moron.
I think pretty much, I think Zimbabwe's got the bomb.
I think Upper Mongolia or whatever it's called,
yeah, Outer Mongolia might have the bomb, too.
I think we've reached the level that they talked about.
The Tagalog Islands, everybody.
Pongo, Pongo.
Timor has a 200 nuki.
So what are you going to do about that?
You're just going to go plowing every place,
waving the bomb?
Yeah.
And hoping they don't bomb everything back?
It's kind of silly.
Well, you've got to deliver the bomb.
I mean, you can't just have a bomb.
Right.
You've got to have one of those mailage postage systems.
You just have a bomb and you detonate it,
then you blow yourself up.
Yeah.
You have to deliver it somehow.
Yeah, you have to make it go somewhere else,
you know, whoever, whatever you don't like,
and then have it blow up there.
And you need one of those mailing systems, too,
because Stan knows that from the Church of the Subgenius.
I did download a tactical nuke video that was amazing.
I think he's sick, bro.
It was shot with like a,
like about a 50 or 60 foot long cannon.
Really?
Yeah, a big recoil thing.
One of those track.
Yeah, they're like,
yeah, those tubes they use now.
And the thing shot,
and then about two seconds later,
the mountain range way off in the distance just went white.
And then,
you'd
worship the gods of war.
And then, where there once was a mountain.
Stand at the stone feet of the red god of war.
This was just punched with a cannon into the hill, you know.
They call them tubes now.
There's a lot of baby acrimony going around in the Shvelt world.
They're probably letting a lot of these type videos out so that, you know.
So we can see it.
I've also noticed a lot of stories that kind of talk about how cool it is
that when America goes to war, it goes to war packing everything.
And they started talking about how we're,
that some of the things being ordered for the war and being packed was,
well, a sumo wrestler's suit was one of them.
That's not much of a suit.
A sumo wrestler's suit was going to be a thing.
Going along with the rest of the guy's gear?
Yeah.
Well, sheesh.
They're going to have some entertainment there.
They call it sumo wrestler for the news purposes,
but what they really mean is the extra costume for the superhero.
Oh, and the belt that he's wearing actually that goes up his crotch
actually propels him over Baghdad and drops him asunder like some mighty sack of...
All that mutant stuff.
All those movies with Spider-Man,
all these mutant power guys and so forth that are coming into vogue now.
Real big budget, exciting, well done.
Comic book movies.
It's all based on...
It's Donald Rolfe.
But the gist of the stories are generally that nobody goes to war like the U.S. does.
Nobody takes as much stuff with it.
Sheesh.
Well...
It's kind of self-effacing, not self-effacing, but, you know, too overconfident.
Pretty arrogant, really.
Yeah, arrogant. That's the word.
I knew it started with an A.
Well, they sort of control space.
Um...
Every blade of grass, dang.
They want to control every blade of grass and every molecule.
They want to control the planet.
They have, uh...
From outer space.
That was scary watching Dave do that one.
Well, because I missed it.
I'm not gonna look over there anymore.
I'm not looking over there anymore.
I'm looking...
You're in the wrong direction. I missed it.
I'm gonna go look at porn on the internet or something.
I don't want to see that again.
I could see Donald Rumsfeld as a superhero.
Couldn't you?
Like wearing a sumo belt, bare-chested, bare-legged, like maybe with long, like, uh, lawyer socks on or...
And the power belt between his legs propelling him through space.
They said he was afraid of birds, but wasn't he some sort of Pleistocene bird himself?
I'm so kind.
Wasn't that beak made for chopping lamb chops?
Isn't that nozzle made for eating human flesh?
Donald Rumsfeld!
Don't look under your television set.
He's bad.
No!
How about Dick Cheney?
How about Dick Cheney?
The grandson of Lon Cheney.
No, no, no.
He is actually...
The man of a thousand billion dollar faces.
The man of a million petrodollars.
Tonight in your theater.
Don't come if you've got a heart condition or wear sunglasses past twelve.
Don't come if your knees are too...
Huh?
Pants!
Oh, I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.
The Senate will come to order.
The Chaplain will leave the Senate in prayer.
Gracious God, you have made grief.
As a Senate family, we thank you for our dear friend's untimely deaths.
We are grateful for Saul and Sheila Wellstone's courageous deaths.
And his indefatigable commitment to help the debt of our society.
We praise you for grief for all people.
Particularly police officers and those who serve to make the Senate run smoothly.
Dear God, you have enriched all of our lives so generously through their untimely deaths.
Heal our grief over maintenance personnel.
And fill us with your untimely deaths.
Amen.
The Senate prayer delivered by Fernanda Nende-Lee Murr.
So that's a sign of oppression from the ubermanship that are keeping us down with their ragged bags and feet.
These ragged, raggedy, old baggedy, faggity feet.
Smelling us.
My pups are barking, boy.
My pups is dead.
I'm a smelly friend, you know what I mean.
Yeah, you gotta feed them.
You gotta feed those puppies.
I've just been so whooped and beaten down by the conspiracy, I just gave up.
You know what they like, Stan?
They like when you trim your toenails, you grind them up, you put them in a little bit of hot sauce, and you drip them back on your self-same toes.
That's appreciation for you.
Recycling?
Yes, it's a form of internal sacrosanct-sif-sifity.
You know, you make yourself holier than you thou or something.
Every day.
At least I do.
I, uh, I gave up on that, on thou, holiness, and than.
Well, making yourself holy.
I wish you gave up.
I can see it.
Give up!
I can see it.
Give up!
Give up!
Holy and holy.
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...
Holy and holy.
It is holy and holy.
Holy and holy.
To think of the...
Christianity is stupid.
Isn't it about the...
Communism is stupid.
Communism is good.
Do you have a copy of that we could play real loud?
Common sense is stupid.
Common sense is stupid.
Common sense is stupid.
Common sense is stupid.
Common sense is stupid.
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes
me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?
So what I want you to do is imagine that you're, uh, you're in the car with the windshield
wipers going and you're listening to this, uh, religious show on the radio.
Okay.
And you're wondering to yourself, who are these guys?
Gotcha.
Okay, I'm there.
I'm driving.
I'm beginning to visualize now.
Oh, uh, what?
Don't take your eyes off the road though.
And now I can see it.
I can see it.
I can begin to see the beginnings of it.
And...
Tranks and tucks and sumpsh.
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days,
driving around Texas.



The, the, you know, Texas.
I understand that Texas is about the size of, of Iraq.
Really?
Yeah.
Is that true?
So when they say, go in and see if you can find some nukes, my test would be, well, let's
go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas somewhere and say, now go see if
you can find it.
We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.
You know, I think that...
That would work.
You could buy that.
You could build an invisibility chamber if you had to and put it into the...
Hide it in Texas?
And hide it in Texas.
You could put up by Amarillo next to, um, Cadillac Ranch and then...
I'd take it out to the...
They just wouldn't see it.
To the, uh, the Texas triangle, which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda
triangle, but on land in Texas.
And I would just put it out in the middle and it would disappear.
Wow.
Until...
That's like a playa out there.
I needed to find it.
That was Dear Friends Puzzling Evidence.
Dr. Ford.
Philodrum and Dr. Howl...
Howlin' be funny.
Dr. Howl on KPFA in Berkeley.
This, uh, genius more than an hour, less than a show type show.
The, the, the show that dare not speak its name.
And now...
The past year resembles nothing so much as the, the bad alternate timeline that the
hero of a cheap science fiction book has to go back and fix.
It, it...
And you, the listener, are that time traveler.
Yes, you, humble listener.
If only your memory could be restored to you.
You are the humble time traveler.
I know what you mean though, uh, it, it does...
It's been weird.
Yeah, that would explain a lot.
It would explain the wooden headed people coming up to us while we're taking our sulfur
baths.
It would certainly explain all the money that's now going to be flowing into arms.
And legs.
And think of how fully well laundered that money it is.
Must be very squeaky clean.









It's squeaky clean by now.
Mm-hmm.
Just think about George the bushy haired one himself and counting that money back in some
room.
You gotta replace those behind the oval orifice.
Well, now, that's not what this is all about.
No.
This is all about, uh, revenge.
That's it.
Taking over Mars.
And, and, and to, uh, yes, eventually to take over, to take back Mars.
Yeah.
Take over Mars.
To take Mars back.
Our rightful home.
That we, the true Martians, were expelled from.
To take over Mars.








So that they, the oil sheiks and the, the oil billionaires and all the oily characters
would have some, they, they, they.
So we're living in the Martian time slip?
Oh, I can grok to that.
In this time continuum.
I can grok to that, my water brother, but by the same token, when do we.
We were enslaved.
We've got to go back in time and kill Bob's mom.
The psychic shakka took us off our own generals.
After, after Bob was born.
They came and took us off our own generals.
We were enslaved.
Thousands and millions and bazillions of years ago.
Does it, does it mean that there's a big, big.
The psychic shakka took us off our own generals.


We can go to the shakka and steal out the evidence.
With all the money we want, we are the friend of our house and we can pick it up and, and
just.
It doesn't mean anything like that.
No, man.
It just means that we were kidnapped from our home world and we're stuck here with
you twerps.
Yeah, you guys, you just, you guys.
He's a space junkie cowboy just looking for a fight.
His mama's calling, son of Stiner's his mama.

The Cubans in the mafia said, man, he'll be okay.
But the cowboy in a space gun have got to save the day.
Defeat the force of evil with his whistling.
Well, the space junkie cowboy, he will not be denied.
There's pot roast on the table.
Many more villains to roast outside.
I'll never forget that.


He's fighting all the criminals who stopped him sitting low
The whiteys came from Europe to kill you, no they wouldn't
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day
Defeat the force of evil with his real spade

Well the space junkie cowboy, he does not give a damn
His mama says, come on in boys, his mama got a plan
I'm gonna fight the men in white sheets who come from the Klu Klux Klan
They're fixin' to kill a black man who grows by the name of Sam
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day
Defeat the force of evil with his Neato Space Bride!
Well the space junkie cowboy, he will not be coerced
His mama says, come on in sir, and his mama got a plan
I'm set to fight a bad man who's killing all the Jews
Make him mincemeat of his continent, gotta stop him before he's through
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day
Defeat the force of evil with his real spade
Space Bride!
Space Junkie Cowboy
Space Junkie Cowboy

And now back to, well, some Lemur-ish cut-up collages.
Hustling evidences, howling over men, lonesome cowboys, and Chaz right here.
Well, we were through the looking glass with David Ferry and Nico.
One, two, three, four.
That's good. There we go, George. You're looking good on camera.
Yeah, don't worry about it. Your hair looks fine.
Uh, boss, you want to make sure his hand stays up in the wave gesture for a long time. We got to go off over here.
Looks like there's about 45 of them ready to go.
Mr. President, 30 seconds.
Do you want to take some of the shine off the big guy's nose? I can't get back in there again. It smells like shit.
The commies keep talking like that, I'll be throwing some food over the concentration camp fence to you. How's that?
Right after the baths, eh, Stank? Come on in and take a bath.
Hey, look at this special emollient they put in the bath water. It makes you feel so good. You don't want to think about things.
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Knee pads truly make a world of difference.
Yep. Yep.
More proof that makes knee pads possible.
Yep. Yep. Yep.
Call now to order the two-piece ratchet knee pads or clamp set.
737-338-1310-881.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Then of course there was the time when the old woman came out of the house and tried to fit the baseball bat in my corner.
I think you can't use that either, man.
And then there was...
MK Ultra.
MK Ultra? Hey, he knows about the mind control experiments.
Wow!
What, did they, did they...
Hey, you know what, they thought...
Oh, he signed off because he's scared.
He was silent.
He was scared.
They stopped him.
Well, they stopped him mentally a long time ago in the past. See, that's what he doesn't understand. It was also a time control experiment, much like the Church of the Subgenius is, and therefore...
Ours will be.
Right.
That's one of the ipso-hipso's of the time biz.
Yeah.
Yeah. But this guy wasn't hip to that fact, I think, as he danced jolly-lee-lee-lee down there in this lane.
Well, let us know that he was hip.
You know, if you...
Might have been.
A what?
A horse.



Like, HAHA!

That was a pal begins his steps.
Apparently he's a mutta or nou on ya dear.
Ah, well.
Did you know that they—

They're g Odyssey machines Oxygen renovats 7 Oh ya?



Lots of that stuff.
This is an old hatır-

experiments. Think of it that way, if you can. Huh? For example, you know, people look at an
elephant and it just looks so enormous, but, or someone told me earlier, you know, you eat a,
or given enough time they can, can an ant eat an elephant? Precisely. By eight properties,
I don't think you could. It'd be impossible. For example, you folks all are now unsophisticated
barbarians. And breaking news out of Bethlehem right now, Israeli forces leaving a trail of
sludge to prevent gunmen from seeking refuge in the explosive device at a checkpoint late this
afternoon. This in retaliation for a Palestinian church in Jerusalem. The passenger apparently
grabbed the sludge, killing 11 people. Cleanup boats menace the coastline, causing an environmental
hazard. Tom Daschle and other wannabes of creating security threats to his family.
Hard Car correspondent David Schuster has the story.
The question is, has Tom Daschle gone too far or is Tom Daschle a sore loser?
This program is known for asking you to call him.
With his majority gone and his party floundering, Tom Daschle handling defeat poorly.
But Democrats routinely unpatriotic and un-American. Tom Daschle, shrill, nasty, and dangerous.
In Washington. Foment hatred, the very essence of anger that we love.
Hey, Bob.
Hey, Bob.


















Hi, Fernanda Nende.
Lee Moore.
I often want to say to a couple,
Bob, do their mouths with Duke. I put him down with my pizda, and then she shrieked,
we're hungry for you.
Guy back off.
Guy back off.
Guy back off.
Guy blown away.
And they bury the dog in the cracks with mouths full of my cheese.
Bob, my cheese.
Bob, my cheese.
Bob, my cheese.
Bob, blown away.
As husbands and wives come together, Bob creates a glow within you.
I lost our minds, and I needed to do something else.
I was struck recently by a hole in their seeking cheese, and they don't get it.
Oh, you mean that kind of bone-crushing time.
That kind of bone-crushing.
God died unexpectedly in an automobile accident this weekend, and they don't get it.
They are normal.
Bob threatened to be ripped asunder by God.
And Jesus has been in a series of unsatisfying relationships with men, invites him into a relationship with Bob.
And they bury the dog in the food.
But I can't say that, and they don't get it.

Also at Zug's Rift dot 4MG dot com.
That's Zug's Rift at 4MG dot com.
Don't let her know.
This is the voice.
This is the voice of London College.
This is the voice of the BBC.
Somebody's parked a bus in my butt.
Well, there's an explosive device in there.
We're talking about a code yellow.
You are not using the force, young bad boy.
We are at code yellow right now, you guys.
I'll have you know that.
Code yellow in what?
In Portuguese, which is...
These are not the drugs you're looking for.
Amarillo.
No, we are at code yellow.
Code yellow right now.
The force is not with us, you silly arses.
Come on, man.
First place cops looked was at that.
I've fallen, and I can't get up.
Just lay there.
She's lying.
What are you going to say?
Pack the car near Havangad or something?
I mean, come on, boys.
Let's stop this inane game here.
Let's nail the hammer on the head.
The president signed up.
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay.
Trying to attack Canada.
I can't do the president.
They're prime minister of Canada.
I can't do Jean Quatien.
I can't do his voice.
And we are tired of what they are saying.
South of the border.
We have the right as a nation.
How many people showed up on the mall in D.C.
to protest the war that you didn't hear about in the news?
Bob was there.
Bob was?
Somebody sent me a picture of Bob standing there
with a couple of kids with their faces fuzzed out in a photograph
because the kids didn't want to get caught.
But there was...
Bob?
Bob often shows up at protests.
And, in fact, has even been filmed by CNN and the like.
But in this case, a friend of one of the kids saw Bob,
photographed him, sent it in, got a rim job,
and that was the sum totality of Bob's involvement in the...
Is this part of the success seminar thing that he's doing down there now?
No, he works for the CIA.
He works for the CIA sometimes.
He was just taking notes.
So the success seminar is just like a pizza front for Black Ops, for the CIA?
No, that's Church of the Subgenius.
Is the pizza front for...
More or less, yeah.
Okay, but which is the core of the Black Ops?
Is it the CIA or the church?
The Austin office that's the church.
The Austin office or the church.
Those guys are nuts.
They get 10 bucks for every address.
For every address.
So they can actually come around and say,
we know where you live, right?
Well, see, the thing is...
The thing is now, because of the new law,
they can just get it off the internet for free.
Your computer is part of the internet.
My computer is.
And if you touch your computer,
your brain is part of the internet.
And it's all recorded.
Every bit of it is on google.com,
which will soon be called bigbrother.com or something like that.
But it's all going to be on one big website.
I'll be able to look up your thoughts.
You'll be able to look up my thoughts.
Go search.



It's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.

Well, in some ways,
the evildoers can no longer hide their evil.
But by the same token,
it all just evens out.
There's just such a flood of endless information
about everybody's inner thoughts
that finally it just becomes a sort of a slurry,
a blank mush because it's just overload.
It's just a white static.
And when you see the sign,
it says our beak,
our back,
it's maxed free.
You'll know that you're going to finally get some work done around here.
Right.
Look at those smokestacks crack.
Everybody gets to toggle in, man.
Yeah.
When it started going,
going down this week,
I started sweeping up my leaves in the yard.
Did you?
That's all that's left to do.
That's all you can really do.
God,
hallelujah.
I don't care if you're fat.
I don't care.
I don't care.










I don't care.





Who's in front of you?
Facts of when?
He's doing.
I've been prospering that morning,
but I was talking this would do with the in you would price
the present in you.
Great.
How did I get on that?
Damn it.
They love shoes and
they love shoes and pajamas.
God has gone before.
I'm persuaded.
I'm persuaded.
God hallelujah!
What we are engaged in is essentially a struggle for communication.
The corporate industrial complex is a heavily armed fortress
dictating the baloney propaganda we are fed daily via multimedia channels.
We hear only what they want us to hear.
So long as the man prevents the message from reaching the masses, justice is impeded.
The Unabomber used terrorism to gain publicity as an end in itself.
Notice how the press seeks to channel the public's interpretation of the Unabomber,
covering it as a serial killer story of crime and insanity,
while deliberately excluding consideration of the ideas themselves.
Imagine, if you will, mass communications not subject to corporate control.
Why, people might say anything, even things not fit to print.
Exactly.
When the ABC nightly news gets renamed Disney World,
you'll cherish the memory of your Unabomber vote.
Don't waste your vote, friends.
Unabomber in 19...
1996.
Whoa!
And, uh...
Yes, that was from www.paranoia.com, which is a fun little website.
Uh, what the hell...
According to my records, I've sent you 33 pages of information plus a postcard.
Most of what I sent you proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that much of what you've sent me is crap.
Only a person like you would be able to do that.
With your almost total lack of...

I like that.
All of you.
One jelly donut.
All right.
So you get the abstract meaning of the ladies owing them a jelly donut.
You know, there have been problems with the church.
And, of course, there have been many problems with the armies amongst these very stern DIs who like to take it up all the way up, all the way up to the top of Jack Hill.
Well, you know, kids are going to be learning this stuff.
For you know what?
The softer soldiers that aren't going to make it through boot, you know, have to make regular trips to the john.
Well, with one swell foop, we laid one on our military.
We hope our brave boys out there don't feel compelled to jump in the shack with the first drill instructor that she.
You know, that would be.
We hope that they carry a picture of W in their breast pocket.
And they carry.
An orangutan's breast on the top of their feet.
Because most of them won't come out.
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.
That's true.








I did read a story that there are drone planes already flying the southern parts of Iraq destroying anything they see.
That's what they're selling.
They've already started that.
They've been doing that for ten years, haven't they?
Have you seen the Army commercials?
Well, they unleashed like a fresh batch of them, like, just go terrorize everything.
Have you seen the new Air Force commercial where the kid is out with his little plane
airplane?
Hey, what is drone a euphemism for?
What?
Are they drones?


Are they really sending out little drone robots?
Or are they dressing up little drone men as drone robots?
It's the chimpanzee clone syndrome and those crazy right wing evangelicals behind it, as
usual.
They're just drone planes.
They're unmanned planes that just fly around looking for targets.
But have you guys seriously seen those spots, those Air Force commercials that show the
kid flying his little robot plane and then in the last scene he's like moving one of
those joysticks and you see one of those random shots over Iraq?
Really?
Oh yeah, this is for real.
Oh, hmm.
Yep, they're selling the remote robot clone planes pretty good nowadays.
Gosh, with the sun setting on our show soon.
And the sun setting on the American empire.
Or shitting on it.
No, no, no.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know.
With Anna Nicole's play show, I think we have a chance.
Well, and now that rim jobs have come back into popularity.
Really?
With Anna Nicole.
Although, I, frankly, to me, I think they're going to be a little bit more popular.






That's just really weird.
Pacific rim jobs?
Well, there's a big, there's a...
Man, that's pretty wild.
Pacific rim jobs.
Let me put it this way.
That's pretty twisted.
You can use your butt.
You can use your butt for sitting or you can use it for shitting.
And I say there is one H of a difference between sitting and shitting.
Till next week.
Tell your friends.
Till next week.
Keep your hat on tight.
Back in more fun.
See you next week.
