1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:08,300
Part one of this two-part show, my dear, dear friends, is about the Church of the Subgenius,

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:16,460
but this time taken largely from the soundtrack re-edited by yours truly of a new video by

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:24,240
Father Joe Mama himself, a video that is not yet available, and I think you'll like this

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,880
little introductory piece, I really do, and part two, the second half hour, will be the

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,220
world's probably first radio airplay of stand-up comedy by Bill Hicks, probably because I'm

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,220
maybe the first person who ever took the trouble, the really hard work of cutting his profuse

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:53,240
cussing out of it, so that you can hear this example of the greatest new non-subgenius

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,220
pre-tribute.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,680
Preacher says Lenny Bruce, and so you can go out and buy his uncut work.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,980
Anyway, let us not ever stop.

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,680
You can get in there and mix and mix and mix and get such a beautiful sound.

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,080
I want to have a stereo of where it goes up, the sound goes up and behind and underneath,

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,600
you know, but all you can get now is across and across.

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,640
Watch.

15
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,620
Watch.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,320


17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,260
Watch.

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,960
Watch.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,380
Watch.

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,500
In the early 1980s, while most Americans went about their normal lives,

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:13,780
a bizarre religious cult called the Church of the Subgenius sprung up in the otherwise conservative city of Dallas, Texas.

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,520
Believing it was nothing more than an elaborate hoax, authorities failed to intervene early.

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,000
The resulting spread of the phenomena surpassed even the deadly AIDS virus in its speed of transmission.

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,900
But unlike AIDS, this cult robbed its victims of more than just their physical health.

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,360
Their mental and spiritual well-being was likewise destroyed.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,660
Fortunately, the plague was eventually contained, its carriers either sterilized or destroyed.

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,860
But the images of its leaders and some of its followers were carefully preserved on videotape

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,500
to serve as a source of information for the public.

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,980
To serve as timeless examples of what could happen again if society fails to keep itself clean.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Here, then, are those images.

31
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,240
Some of them may be too strong for young viewers.

32
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,180
Parental discretion is advised.

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,860
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

34
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,500
The subgenius.

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,360
The subgenius hour of...

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,120
Slack.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:37,000
The subgenius hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,940
and only in the city of...

39
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,700
And without a doubt...

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,340
...

41
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,480
...

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
...

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,400
...

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,460
...

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


48
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


49
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


50
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


51
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


52
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


53
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


54
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


55
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,460


56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,420
I'm just a fool

57
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,080
Small animals or other children becoming exposed

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,800
to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and grain frequencies

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,780
constantly scanned throughout our program

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,200
should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,480
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,400
that it's often a photon that light releases,

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,620
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,400
Hoping your time is all time

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,020
and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

66
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,780
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

67
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,140
My first impression was his presence was so strong.

68
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,020
It was sort of like stepping into a field of electricity.

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,000
And I don't know if it's because of the giant amps

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,500
that he was working with or just being a superstar

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,860
and having all that energy directed at you.

72
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,500
But I wish there had been a way that this tape

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
could have captured some of that energy.

74
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,340
Vibrancy that I felt at that moment.

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,540
I control the lives and the brains of all the inhabitants here.

76
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
I keep them alive as I see fit.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,420
Just as a shepherd controls the sheep

78
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,480
and then at any moment shears the sheep.

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
Enough now with explanations.

80
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,700
I will indicate to you which burned-out students must be replaced.

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,020
Do you want to live forever?

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,020
Yes.

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,060
Do you want to live in paradise?

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Yes.

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Will you die for me?

86
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes.

87
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,920
Will you kill for me?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,300
Yes.

89
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,880
Will you kill for me?

90
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,140
Yes.

91
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,340
If the Bible is true, then I am Christ.

92
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,300
But so what?

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,360
What's so great about being Christ?

94
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,980
A man nailed to a cross, a man of sorrow, acquainted with grief.

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,500
You know, being Christ ain't nothing.

96
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,520
They twisted my words.

97
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,140
Mocking me.

98
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,080
They're laughing at us.

99
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,940
Holding us up to ridicule.

100
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,820
But they cannot stop the message.

101
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,120
It's here!

102
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,660
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slang.

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,880
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

104
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,560
I feel like the Church of the Subgenius is a very helpful thing.

105
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,200
I know it's done good things for me and for other people that I know.

106
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,040
It's allowed them to get hold of their bad child

107
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,660
and get out and run with it.

108
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,060
And the church is chock full of eccentrics, too.

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,140
Ha ha!

110
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,500
Really exquisitely weird people.

111
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,640
People you would never suspect were the way they actually are.

112
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,160
It's about going through all this land, you know, this mythical.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,400
Because that's what I like to do is write a lot of mythical things.

114
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,220
You know, like the history of the wars on Neptune and all this mess, you know.

115
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,820
And the reason why the rings are there, you know.

116
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,860
You have all these...

117
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,900
See, like, how they've got the Greek gods and all that mythology.

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,380
Well, you can have your own mythology scene.

119
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,660
Or write, you know, fiction.

120
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,440
Complete fiction, you know.

121
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,800
I mean, anybody can say, well, I was walking down the street

122
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,220
and I see an elephant floating through the sky.

123
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,520
Well, it has no meaning at all, you know.

124
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,840
There's nothing to imagine except this is an elephant there, you know.

125
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,920
And if you don't watch out, it might break your neck.

126
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,500
Ten! Establish the new order.

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,140
This will be a world for a select few.

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
Only certain types will be fit to belong in this society.

129
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,240
We will have the grave responsibility of deciding who belongs.

130
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,480
Life will be... will continue,

131
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,120
but on proper terms.

132
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
Never orderly lies.

133
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,000
Dear friends, you see.

134
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,960
And I was never one of the orthodox.

135
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,520
You know, there's all the other docs, you know, that are orthodox.

136
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,580
And there's me and I...

137
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,940
I really am not in that clique, you know.

138
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm not an orthodox, you know.

139
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,180
I'm like a schismatic.

140
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,740
So for a while, you know, the early part of it, they really needed some rebellion.

141
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
And, you know, he'd already seen me rebel here and there and stuff for a while.

142
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,480
It was good to have a rebel in the Church of the Subgenius.

143
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,600
But now, you know, it's all...

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,380
It's all doled out, you know.

145
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,980
And it's all...

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
It's all a sound bite that he wants to project.

147
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,040
And he's...

148
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,560
You know, it's just like everything else.

149
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,820
The Church of the Subgenius predicted that it would go totally pink before 1998.

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,620
The inhabitants here do not have the intelligence to be utilized anymore.

151
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,800
For that reason, I have summoned you.

152
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,460
I hope that you remember those.

153
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,740
Now, of course, all of this will be printed up in your instruction documents and your kit.

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,100
Your special end-of-the-world pill kit.

155
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,300
That comes...

156
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,280
We will be mailing those out at some point in early 1998.

157
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't worry about that.

158
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,980
We won't.

159
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,080
Just because we've been a little bit late on some of our publications and things...

160
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,400
You will get your kit.

161
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,120
I promise.

162
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,460
Maybe we'll spend about two hours a day going through the Subgenius mail.

163
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,920
It's pretty interesting.

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,500
Some weeks we get huge packages.

165
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,680
There's this one fella.

166
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,660
Every week we get a gigantic package.

167
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,440
Sometimes...

168
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,920
Sometimes perfume bottles.

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Sometimes...

170
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,540
Big jars of bodily fluids.

171
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,680
Sanitary napkins.

172
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,480
It just depends.

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,080
You never know.

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,160
Food.

175
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,280
Beer bottles.

176
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,560
It just never ends.

177
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,500
A gun.

178
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Another gun.

179
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,700
Twenty-two.

180
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,240
Everyone staying?

181
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,820
Another gun.

182
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,920
Another one?

183
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes, sir.

184
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
What kind?

185
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,900
Twenty-two.

186
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,080
Unloaded.

187
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,060
All right.

188
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,160
Here you go.

189
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,840
Have we got any twenty-two shells?

190
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,740
Not yet, but I'm finished.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,700
Lord is with me like a dread champion.

192
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,200
Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and not prevail.

193
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,700
Now, what I need to know is, are you ready to live the message?

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,280
Are you ready to live by the book?

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,360
Are you going to bitch and whine because it's too hard to be holy?

196
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,340
Will you follow me?

197
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,140
Yes.

198
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,160
Will you follow me?

199
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,740
Yes.

200
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,980
Yeah, it's funny.

201
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,780
We got a call from People Magazine yesterday wanting to pick my brains as an expert on

202
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,780
fringe cults and so forth.

203
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,040
They wanted to...

204
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,820
I guess they wanted a prediction on who would be the next version of the Branch Davidians

205
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,360
in Waco, who would be the next violent armed cult and so forth.

206
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,120
I told them to check out the battle cry of aggressive Christianity, free love ministries

207
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,420
in California, and the...

208
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,360
And Elizabeth Clare Prophet.

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,880
Of course, the Church of the Subgenius is the kind of peaceful organization that doesn't

210
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,560
have to worry about an armed insurrection in the end times.

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,340
The end times are certainly coming, but we're going to be the ones who are protecting the

212
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,580
people.

213
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,500
We're going to be the ones who are protected by others, other bigger forces.

214
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,720
We don't need to rely on weapons.

215
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:54,380
And all of those rumors about the genitals and vice grips in Dobbs Town, the big stashes

216
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:01,740
of weapons, the drugs and the harems and the orgies and so forth, that's all the kind of

217
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,620
thing that disgruntled ex-members always try to bring up.

218
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,660
They're just trying to get money out of us, essentially.

219
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,040
Well, you know, these...

220
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,800
These people come to us and they wanted to rent some of our weapons and do some target

221
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,140
practice out on our land, and we didn't have any problem with that.

222
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
We'd be willing to rent the stuff too, and their money was plenty good, but after a while,

223
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,520
we kind of got the feeling that these people were kind of weird.

224
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,860
I mean, they kept saying subgenius, and they never would explain what that was.

225
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,680
I think we made the right decision.

226
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,860
I think these people are dangerous, and I think that we did well not to do any business

227
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,260
with them.

228
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,820
Well, there's a tedious notion, Cherish.

229
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,880
Many immature intellects that the Church of the Subgenius itself is some kind of art

230
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,380
statement.

231
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,600
This notion must be dispelled violently or otherwise.

232
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,300
Bob Dobbs' ministry reaches far beyond any manner of mere statement, even philosophical.

233
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,680
It's exactly what it says it is, a religion.

234
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,020
The art, the styles associated with it, are there to be found?

235
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,020


236
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,220
They are solely to buttress it.

237
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,260
Just as the Catholic Church sponsored both the monstrous Inquisition and the Sistine

238
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,840
Chapel sealing, our faith has promoted both frenzied head launchings and the DX15 computer

239
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,880
virus, which irrevocably infects both computer and user.

240
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,980
All of the machines were destroyed.

241
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,500
The inhabitants regressed rapidly.

242
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,000
I became the only one with the knowledge to construct machines.

243
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,080
I will make these machines invincible.

244
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,960
Then I will be able to conquer the galaxy.

245
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,760
You must help me to replace some of my circuits that were damaged by the alien forces.

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,560
Without all of my circuits functioning, some of my memory banks are blocked.

247
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
I was great.

248
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,360
I look...

249
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
Hello.

250
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, that's Steve.

251
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


252
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


253
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


254
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


255
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


256
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


257
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


258
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


259
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


260
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


261
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


262
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


263
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


264
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


265
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


266
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


267
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


268
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


269
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


270
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


271
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,720
Damn Japanese stock reports keep on zizzing and dripping through my X-barks.

272
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,240
What now?

273
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,520
Originally, I was most interested in proving the existence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, because there's

274
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,660
evidence of him, supposedly, in magnetic recording materials and so forth.

275
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,500
And after I had available to me through the Freedom of Information Act a number of recordings

276
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,860
made by Bob in the 1950s, I assumed that once they had arrived, I could analyze those.

277
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,960
And truly find evidence, sound bites and so on.

278
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,200
The tapes arrived after two years, and they were mostly like this.

279
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,360
They're seven and a half IPS recordings.

280
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,740
I run them through the four track here.

281
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,720
They're run then over to here, where we have a clostron frequency analyzer, which takes

282
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,800
all the various bits of data and analyzes them statistically according to where they're

283
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,840
located on the tape.

284
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,820
The analysis of the tape was very interesting.

285
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,900
Some of these tapes have been completely degaussed.

286
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,100
There's absolutely nothing left.

287
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,060
They're completely blank.

288
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,380
Others, conversations between J.R. Bob Dobbs and members of the corporate infrastructure,

289
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,920
have been spliced so many times, there's nothing left of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

290
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,720
There's someone talking, then there's a splice, then there's someone talking, then there's

291
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,300
a splice.

292
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,220
All the responses, all the portions that Bob Dobbs supposedly put in, have been carefully,

293
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,600
painstakingly removed.

294
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,920
The analysis of the tape shows this to be standard 1958 polyester stock.

295
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,980
It's nothing unusual.

296
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,100
But the splicing tape is all from 1984.

297
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,360
This is the year of J.R. Bob Dobbs' assassination.

298
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,740
Coincidence?

299
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,340
I think not.

300
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,760
Did you kill Bob?

301
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,660
Of course I killed Bob.

302
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,880
For sales.

303
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
It was an agreed upon event.

304
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:21,660
On the way from the airport, before the 84 show, we decided that somebody was needed

305
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,680
to push sales into the stratosphere, and the best thing to do in America is kill the leader

306
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,060
of whatever organization or church you have.

307
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,180
Well, I think there's only one direction that the church can actually go in, and that's

308
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,740
the really, really, for once, key.

309
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes.

310
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,340
That's a worry.

311
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,680
I don't see the church as a lucky group.

312
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,500
But they officially, it's not as if there were ever any.

313
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,040
What does that necessarily mean, do you think?

314
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,080
That was the idea of that show, that's just just one of those different ways I think

315
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:58,740
people react to their Christianye zul?".

316
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,200
I didn't mean all those people who hate the church to matter, and you don't end up information

317
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,200


318
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,200
an implicit comment that politics in Rochester, maybe across the country, has gotten to be

319
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,400
just as phony as the televangelists are?

320
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,260
Possibly. Possibly. I'll leave that for you and the listeners to decide.

321
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,200
I mean, it certainly conveys that message to me, really.

322
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:31,060
Well, Bob comes from Marsh McLuhan, a Canadian professor.

323
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,800
The medium is the message.

324
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,460
Exactly. And this campaign is based on the radio talk shows and the power of the voice of the people.

325
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,080
Namely, the people out there should be making the decisions, not the politicians.

326
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,860
I think we should take a vote on everything, even the most mundane objects.

327
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,460
That sounds like Ross Perot writ large and taken to the extreme.

328
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,120
Well, you know, now Ross Perot, I have a strange, perverse admiration for him.

329
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,780
I think he's...

330
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,120
He's elected president. The trains would definitely run on time, you know, and Gary Walker would be happy.

331
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,860
But that's another bad joke.

332
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,180
That's another station entirely. We won't even talk about that.

333
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:23,420
But I want to know, really, more than anything else, whether or not this whole thing is basically a statement

334
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,800
that there is nothing here going on except media, there is nothing going on except logos,

335
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
there is nothing going on except bumper stickers, signs.

336
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,020
And that's what the political process has come to.

337
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,960
It's all devoid of content.

338
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,200
God has spoken to me.

339
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,040
So many ask if they can join the church of the subgenius.

340
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,580
The answer is no, they cannot.

341
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,880
Because one does not join the subgeniuses.

342
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,080
One either is or is not a subgenius.

343
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:01,240
Of course, the only way you can find this out is to make the attempt to live the life of the subgenius.

344
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,700
To be in a sense like...

345
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:02,980
Bob.

346
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,140
Each subgenius must be a little Bob and have something of his Dobbs-given Bob-like nature.

347
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:16,140
For it is only through the emanations of the over Bob, the controlling world soul of Dobbsishness,

348
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,900
that the true subgenius can achieve full fruition.

349
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,220
People say that you're cynical.

350
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,560
Okay, they don't understand.

351
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,520
Because maybe you hate everything, or maybe you're afraid of everything, or maybe you're angry at everything.

352
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,780
But the word cynical does not really exist.

353
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,540
It doesn't really apply to you.

354
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,560
You really do think mass starvation is funny.

355
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,880
I mean, you really think that.

356
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,600
You think that the extinction of vast numbers of animals is funny.

357
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,920
Because the fact that the Earth is going to be swallowed by the Sun in a few million years is kind of funny.

358
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,820
So you have a higher sense of humor.

359
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,140
A lot of people would say, well, that's black humor.

360
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,320
It's a black sense of humor.

361
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,760
But see, that's just a value judgment they put on you.

362
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,060
It's no blacker than anyone else's.

363
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,680
It's actually a white sense of humor.

364
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,160
It's so black that it's white.

365
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,580
I'd have to say, uh, J.R.R. Bob Dobbs is a mystery.

366
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,080
Unfolded by an enigma, bound by a puzzle, wrapped in a strip of bacon,

367
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,100
surrounded by creamy nougat and a rich milk chocolate coating,

368
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,720
held together with a toothpick,

369
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,220
served on a greasy paper napkin.

370
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,620
An indigestible canapé for the no age.

371
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,160
A

372
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:49,520
They might not be ready for that particular thing.

373
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,360
They might be coming to the concert as critics, you know,

374
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,060
instead of as people, you know, wanting to get into some entertainment.

375
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,860
And then from then on they could build it more.

376
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,800
But there's no response at all.

377
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,760
It doesn't bother me to make a statement.

378
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,140
I don't want to touch it all.

379
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,640
It just makes me play a little more music, you know.

380
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,500
See, you know, that's the way I think.

381
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,320
I think in no negative terms at all,

382
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,880
because it takes up a whole lot of space in your mind, you know.

383
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,020
And some people only use one tenth of their brain capacity anyway.

384
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,220
And so, uh, you know, there's so much more room to think other good ways, you know,

385
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,020
and try to turn them on regardless.

386
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,060
It feels like a hospital when a patient might be kicking,

387
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,720
and he doesn't want an operation, and he knows good and well, you know,

388
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,760
it might be good for him in the long run.

389
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,160
But he's scared, and he's kicking around in the bed,

390
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,640
and the nurses are trying to strap him down.

391
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Well, I'm the nurses, you know,

392
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,640
trying to get him together and trying to prove to him that this is right.

393
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,220
We do have this, uh, radio ministry every Sunday night,

394
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,160
which has been getting a might bit of criticism of late

395
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
for these last few months,

396
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,320
uh, complaining that there weren't enough true believers

397
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,840
from the Dallas clenches represented upon the airwaves.

398
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,460
Huh! Well.

399
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,900
The great waves of Bob Dobbs.

400
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,220
It's like some great raging beast,

401
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,600
and it will try to destroy us too before it dies.

402
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,660
And the Babylonians will offer their 30 pieces of silver

403
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,220
to the Adrians

404
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,020
and the Michelles of this world.

405
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,220
People who will lie about me.

406
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,780
About us.

407
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,040
Jesus had one Judas.

408
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,400
Will there be more?

409
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,700
Will you be my Judas?

410
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,940
Yeah, well, when I first joined the subgenius, you know,

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,900
they told me for 20 bucks I could get slack.

412
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,240
So I thought, hey, that's a good deal.

413
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,640
I went ahead and sent them my check.

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,420
And I waited and waited.

415
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,060
It never really came.

416
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Uh, you know, I thought maybe my check got lost in the mail or something.

417
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
So I sent them another one.

418
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,580
And I waited again.

419
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,900
And, you know, this slack, I'm not sure what it is,

420
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,120
but it never really came.

421
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,920
So I kept sending them checks and waiting for the slack.

422
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,140
And, uh, gosh, I've spent two or three hundred bucks on this thing now.

423
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,440
I don't know if I've got the slack or if it's supposed to be coming,

424
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,560
you know, later or what the deal is.

425
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,200
So at this point, I'm thinking about getting a lawyer

426
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,560
and trying to look into this thing because I need to get a definite,

427
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,680
you know, what is slack?

428
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,980
You know, when's it coming?

429
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,760
What's the deal?

430
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,260
You know, this can't go on.

431
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,560
This is ridiculous, you know.

432
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,700
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the lapel and screaming at it.

433
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,500
Slack is, uh, is something that can't be bottled and sold.

434
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,800
You actually were born with slack.

435
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,620
You were born with original slack.

436
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,240
But from that moment on, the conspiracy has been trying to take it away from you.

437
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,880
They don't even know what it is.

438
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:58,280
But that won't stop them from trying to suck up every tiny bit of it they can get.

439
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,240
The conspiracy has 50,000 followers.

440
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,100
They've got 50,000 nuclear weapons.

441
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,660
And the Church of the Subgenius?

442
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,040
We've only got three.

443
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,600
But yet we dare to fight them anyway.

444
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,440
And that's the miracle of it.

445
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,800
Because, see, it's always been the crazy people,

446
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,360
the crazy people who were dumb enough to stand up against the colossus.

447
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,980
Well, the Church itself never defines what the conspiracy is.

448
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,740
But we believe that the conspiracy of normals, as we talk about it,

449
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,800
is society itself.

450
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,500
And it's society itself that must be destroyed.

451
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,340
Human society.

452
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,480
Well, it's like there's this subtext of violence to what they talk about.

453
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,340
Like, the stuff they say about destroying the normals, you know.

454
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,340
It sounded like a joke at first, but I started thinking about it.

455
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,360
If these guys really did achieve world domination, like they say,

456
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,700
destroy the normals?

457
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,200
What are they gonna do?

458
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,120
Are they gonna round them up into camps or something?

459
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,780
What do they mean?

460
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,060
What do they mean, destroy the normals?

461
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,180
I've got friends who are normals.

462
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,980
I mean, maybe I'm normal.

463
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,600
I don't know.

464
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,260
What would they do with me?

465
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,660
Unlike the hypocritical teachings of brotherly love that flow from Christianity

466
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,820
or the sickening sweetness and light crap that flows from the New Age,

467
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,640
the Church of the Subgenius is unabashedly a religion of hate, ladies and gentlemen.

468
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
Praise the Lord!

469
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,820
And they shall bleed and travail in their sorrow.

470
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,780
But unto them shall come the voice of the ark of the heavens, and say,

471
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,820
Let there be no wailing and remonstracing.

472
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,740
For ye all now walk in the house of Jehovah one.

473
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,520
And if thou dost not walk, thou shalt crawl on the stumps of what were legs.

474
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,220
For mine is the hand that makes, and mine is the house.

475
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,480
Of pain.

476
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,660
The flower does not bloom.

477
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,560
The leaf does not fall from the branches of a tree that I don't just hate.

478
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,740
Hate.

479
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,420
And no, hate is what most religions are really all about.

480
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,620
We're just the only ones who would come out and admit it.

481
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,640
Hate and scorn for the normals.

482
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,700
Hate for the conspiracy.

483
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,920
Hate.

484
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,200
Expectation.

485
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,320


486
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,360
Hey!

487
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,640
Hey!

488
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,260
Hey, you!

489
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,300
I was at the end of my rope.

490
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,980
It came to me that the only solution to my problems was suicide.

491
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,660
And I didn't even have the money for a Saturday night special!

492
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,600
I was walking to the pawn shop,

493
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,540
Praying to Bob that I had enough money to buy a Wednesday or Thursday night special

494
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,520
to blow my brains out!

495
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:02,500
I happened to glance down into a mud puddle, children, and there in that mud puddle, covered with mud, was a pamphlet.

496
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,180
Well, I picked up that pamphlet, children, and I read it, and what it said in essence was,

497
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,240
get in on the ground floor of a lucrative new cult now while rates are low.

498
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,820
They're basically sellouts at the Subgenius Foundation.

499
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:25,720
They have so much money moving through on a day-to-day, a month-to-month basis that they're corrupted by it.

500
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:33,100
They've lost sight of the goals of the subgenius itself, and they're just doing it as a business.

501
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,240
Tired of acting normal? Sick of all the have-a-nice-day humans?

502
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,960
Want to quit your job? Then you need Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

503
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,720
Only Bob can return the slack the conspiracy stole away.

504
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,740
Call a subgenius hotline now and get the scoop.

505
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,720
You'll hear an actual subgenius rant about Bob.

506
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,720
Slack and the conspiracy.

507
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,680
Or call Connie Dobbs for her subgenius secrets of love.

508
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,840
That's 1-900-990-5085, extension 324.

509
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,200
And hear the word of Bob.

510
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,060
Extension 325 will get you Connie.

511
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
Only $2 per minute with a 5-minute max.

512
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,320
Adults only. Touchstone phone required.

513
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,740
Don't burn out on boredom.

514
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,080
Let Bob Dobbs set you free.

515
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

516
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,420
If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob, you're gonna burn.

517
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,360
Mother Teresa, I don't care how many people she's helped.

518
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,720
If she hadn't sent her $20 into jail, Bob Dobbs is gonna burn in hell.

519
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,860
Well, I'm not really at liberty to discuss actual annual income of the Subgenius Foundation

520
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,520
or the Church of the Subgenius or any of the other affiliated companies.

521
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,900
But, you know, the way we would have to look at it, I mean, we believe in freedom of religion.

522
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,640
And if somebody wants to send money to us or any other religious organization,

523
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,280
then probably it's gonna be more wisely spent by us.

524
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,060
Before I became a Christian, I was in the Church of the Subgenius.

525
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:04,400
A lot of my friends were doing that, and I just went along with them.

526
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,480
I thought it was pretty funny.

527
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,640
Well, I guess they're laughing at me now, but I know Jesus.

528
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,440
And I also know...

529
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,200
that Bob is evil.

530
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,600
And he's leading all of those people to hell.

531
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,100
People have been accusing us of being some sort of devil worship cult.

532
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,800
This is really absurd, and, you know, people see a devil worship everywhere,

533
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,460
and the Procter & Gamble logo or what have you, but it's all untrue.

534
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,620
We have a special relationship with the being that is called the devil.

535
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,560
We're not...

536
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:54,360
we're not worshipers precisely, but we are aware, as was he, that God, or as we call him, Jehovah One,

537
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,820
has gone slightly insane.

538
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,980
We can tempt sinners better than the devil can.

539
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,260
We're tempting them away from the devil.

540
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,340
Now, where are we tempting them? Where they go after that?

541
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,380
It's up to them, although Bob wouldn't be a bad stop on the way.

542
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,360
Just write for more information about how to sell your soul to the devil

543
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,620
from Bob at Post Office Box.com.

544
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:25,660
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

545
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,300
Ah, yes.

546
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,420
Now, once again, that number, and it is free information, although, you know, you do get what you pay for.

547
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:43,640
Uh, Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

548
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,340
Uh...

549
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,760
That's that.

550
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,120
That's that...

551
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm going to go find you a big guy soon.

552
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,400


553
00:29:59,900 --> 00:29:59,900


554
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
Never mind.

555
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,400
After that, Bob would go by his old name.

556
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,400


557
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,780
And must agree to know, he can just go back to the canine of the hermit I met before.

558
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:03,940
He asked her to help him.

559
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:03,940


560
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,160


561
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,960
That's right now.

562
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,180
Next week a new masterpiece to beautiful movie.

563
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,600
A double project.

564
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:10,600


565
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:10,600


566
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:10,880
Jet host?

567
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:10,880


568
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,940
Our Frottmeister has retired, and, you know, if anybody can, uh, oh, well.

569
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,940
823-7490.

570
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,160
What you've been listening to here, and a lovely selection of material it's been,

571
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:47,080
uh, most of this is from a re-edit of, uh, Kurt Kursteiner's film,

572
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,560
Church of the Subgenius, Slack, Sect, or Satanism.

573
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:57,800
And voices that you heard on Side 1 of show were Pope S. Cecilia,

574
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,120
Reverend Buck Naked, Willa Dobbs, David Koresh,

575
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,220
Zaphod Rakotansky, Palmer Vreides,

576
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,920
uh, the computer from Cosmos,

577
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,840
Jeff Robbins, yes, the Hal Robbins brother,

578
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:17,120
mm-hmm, uh, the fake Bob in Rochester, who seems to be a little mixed up,

579
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,180
uh, Hal Robbins, that's Dr. Hal,

580
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,900
the great Michael Pepe,

581
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,680
Tommy Lopez, Trickster Shaman,

582
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,360
Kenneth Huey, Janer Hypercletes,

583
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,160
Sterno Keekhaver,

584
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,480
and, uh, uh, and coming up, I guess, all of them again,

585
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,140
and Sister Mary Squire,

586
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,080
uh, and in the background, of course, the swinging love corpses.

587
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,940
On the way.

588
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,240
The thing that draws you in is that it seems so funny.

589
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,980
But, uh, as time went along, I got scared.

590
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,860
There's something dark about the Church, Church of the Subgenius.

591
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,900
There's something evil.

592
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,140
Like, there's one thing I should, I wanted to tell you,

593
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,140


594
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,140


595
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,740
there's this ritual they've got.

596
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,560
Uh, I went to one of their D-Vivals,

597
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,500
yeah, they call it a D-Vival,

598
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,040
that's the way they think.

599
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,500
And they have this thing where they, they launch

600
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,800
the bleeding head of a World Cup golfer.

601
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,740
Uh, now that's weird.

602
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,820
That's weird and that's kind of scary.

603
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,160
They get up on stage, and one guy would get a golf club,

604
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,780
and they'd have this head,

605
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,120
and the guy would, uh, he'd have a golf club, and they'd have this head,

606
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,120


607
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,120


608
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,480
and he would hit it with the golf club,

609
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,100
and send it zooming out over the audience,

610
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,140
spewing what looked like blood and brains all over the audience.

611
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,540
What does that mean?

612
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,620
And why did they chant,

613
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,240
bleeding head good, healed head bad?

614
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,920
Bleeding head good, healed head bad!

615
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,540
The whole head launch thing is considered obscene by some groups.

616
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,940
It's true. We get a lot of opposition.

617
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,120
That's what, you know, that's why people say,

618
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,140
we shouldn't do it in front of a mass audience.

619
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,720
Uh, that it's okay to do it privately in your own home.

620
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,300
Uh...

621
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,140
But in front of people is obscene.

622
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,780
Yeah, out in front of people.

623
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,960
You know, just because...

624
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,620
Well, why do you do it then?

625
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,160
We don't, we don't think that the human body is obscene.

626
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,020
We don't think, uh, decapitating a golfer is necessary.

627
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,900
Obscene, you think that the two are one and the same.

628
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,520
Inalienable rights.

629
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,720
What does it mean?

630
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,620
The launching of the head.

631
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,280
Well, the meaning is so obvious, I don't...

632
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,540
I can hardly see the need to explain

633
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,520
the meaning of the launching of the head.

634
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,520
Child molestation.

635
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,040
Uh, rape.

636
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,060
Murder. Torture.

637
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,060
The violation of human rights.

638
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,020
Uh, all these things are part of, of, uh, Jehovah's ongoing joke,

639
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,600
which he laughingly refers to as existence.

640
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,680
Subgenii know this at the bottom of their hearts and in their souls.

641
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,780
Subgenii are able to swim in the ocean of the horrendous miracle

642
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,120
of pain and agony and suffering.

643
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,860
And blow bubbles.

644
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:35,700
Now, friends, some people like to call this church of the subgenius a joke.

645
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,080
A joke.

646
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,140
Oh, it might be a joke.

647
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,980
It just might be the greatest joke ever told.

648
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,000
If Earth can make it to the punchline.

649
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,760
We can't give you all the answers.

650
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,540
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

651
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,400
The effect I'd like to have for it on the audience is maybe in a hypnotic state,

652
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,080
if not an awakening state, you know.

653
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,680
So therefore, that's why we don't preach necessarily violence unless it's a certain incidence in a song.

654
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,400
It should have some kind of solution, you know, at the end of a song,

655
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,120
every song that we give out to people, you know.

656
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,800
Because it's all, it's almost all philosophy, our music is, most of it is,

657
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,000
in a very hazy form because it's still, you know, it's still a very hazy form.

658
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,500
It's still progressing, you know, it's just like a little baby.

659
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,240
And it hasn't even reached the stage that I call for it to walk by itself, you know.

660
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,880
For that reason, I have summoned you.

661
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,600
Decompression chamber. Maximum duration, ten seconds.

662
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,660
Repeat, ten seconds. Clear the area.

663
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,880
Okay, that's my cue, that's my cue.

664
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,320
I gotta get, get outta here.

665
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,620
And, uh, oh no, we're not leaving yet.

666
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,260
No, no, we gotta put on the Bill Hicks stuff.

667
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,320
I, God, I worked so hard cutting the cuss words out of this.

668
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,080
Friends, you'll, I don't see how anybody could ever play this guy's material on the radio

669
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,840
without having done what I had to do.

670
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,760
I'm sorry that I, uh, had to do it, but otherwise you wouldn't hear him at all.

671
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,380
And I do want you to pay attention to this, uh, ama-

672
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,340
You know, we don't usually play comedians on this show.

673
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,820
It's not a comedy show.

674
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:43,000
Uh, and this Bill Hicks fellow off of this album, Relentless,

675
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,620
well, he's, he's a pretty good preacher as well as a, uh, comic, you might say.

676
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,600
He's got another record called Dangerous out, and, uh,

677
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,940
well, I'll just, uh, let you check it.

678
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,960
You ever dance with the devil in the moonlight?

679
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,280
I don't know what my attitude is. I'm trying to work on it all the time, you know.

680
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,720
I'm drinking water tonight. That's pretty amazing.

681
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,860
Water's a way, it's really weird how your life changes, you know what I mean?

682
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,500
Water. Four years ago? Opium.

683
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,540
Isn't that weird? I mean, really.

684
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,120
Night and day.

685
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,360
Some of y'all may remember me as a drinker. Uh, I was a weekend drinker.

686
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,200
You know, I'd start on Saturday, end on Friday, and, uh,

687
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,680
thought I was controlling it there.

688
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,260
I don't drink anymore. I don't do drugs anymore either than I'd say the average touring funk band.

689
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,860
If I had to add it up.

690
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,320
I don't do drugs anymore either.

691
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,440
But I'll tell you something about drugs. I used to do drugs.

692
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,620
But I'll tell you something honestly about drugs. Honestly.

693
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,700
And I know it's not a very popular idea. You don't hear it very often anymore.

694
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,280
But,

695
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,200
it is the truth.

696
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,720
I had a great time doing drugs.

697
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,900
Sorry.

698
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,240
Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife, or kids.

699
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,340
Laughed my ass off.

700
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,560
And went about my day.

701
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,680
Laughed my ass off.

702
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:35,680


703
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,040
Laughed my ass off.

704
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,800
Laughed my ass off.

705
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,420
Laughed my ass off.

706
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,720
Now, where's my commercial?

707
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,260
Laughed my ass off.

708
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,800
Why don't I get a commercial? Why is it always that other guy that gets the commercial?

709
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,840
I lost my job, then my house, then my wife, then my car, then my kids.

710
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,420
Don't do drugs.

711
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,180
Well, I'm definitely not doing them with you.

712
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,480
Laughed my ass off.

713
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,180
Man, you're bumming me out. Get him out of here.

714
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,880
The guy by the dip, he's bumming everyone out.

715
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,420
I mean, I've lost my car before. Okay.

716
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,920
Found it the next day. You know, no biggie.

717
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,520
I don't think that warranted a commercial.

718
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,120
I lost my car, and uh...

719
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,680
Oh, there it is by that dumpster.

720
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,660
Forget it. See you tomorrow.

721
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:26,980
Laughed my ass off.

722
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,360
You know, I've lost stuff. I'm not saying that.

723
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:30,800
Laughed my ass off.

724
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,480
I knew we were in trouble in that damn egg commercial.

725
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,820
That was the government's take on drugs.

726
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,240
Here's your brain.

727
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,780
I've seen a lot of shit on drugs. I've never, ever, ever, ever, ever looked at an egg and thought it was a brain.

728
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,940
Not once. Alright?

729
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:55,260
I have seen UFOs split the sky like a sheet, but I have never, ever, ever looked at an egg and thought it was a brain.

730
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,620
Not once.

731
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,740
I have had seven balls of light come off of a UFO.

732
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,640
Lead me onto their ship.

733
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,540
Explain to me telepathically that we are all one and there is no such thing as death.

734
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,940
But I have never, ever, ever, ever looked at an egg and thought it was a brain.

735
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,120
Now, maybe I wasn't getting good sh-

736
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,320
I admit it. I see that commercial. I feel cheated.

737
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,160
Hey, where's the stuff that makes eggs look like brains?

738
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,700
That sounds neat. Did I quit too soon?

739
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,940
What is that, CIA stuff?

740
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,260
You see the guy in that commercial? The guy's got a beer gut.

741
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,180
Alright, this is it. Look at it, man.

742
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,460
This is your brain.

743
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I ain't doing this again. That's your brain.

744
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,900
The guy's drunk doing the commercial, man.

745
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,160
That's your brain. That's an egg. That's a frying pan. That's a stove. You're an alcoholic.

746
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,140
Dude, I'm tripping right now.

747
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,460
And I still see that as an egg, alright?

748
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,080
I see the UFOs around it, but that is an egg in the middle.

749
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,300
There's a hobbit eating it.

750
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,220
I got that hobbit. It was eating an egg.

751
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,720
He's on a unicorn, but that's...

752
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,260
Nope, that's good.

753
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,300
How dare you have a wino tell me not to do drugs?

754
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,100
Why did you quit?

755
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,440
Why did I quit?

756
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,340
Because after you've been taken aboard a UFO, it's kind of hard to top that, alright?

757
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,440
You know, they have alcoholics.

758
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,100
They don't have alcoholics anonymous. They don't have alien anonymous.

759
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,500
Tell you what, though, going to AA meetings, which I have to do,

760
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,380
but going there and hearing people talk about the booze stories, you know, I'm sitting there.

761
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,140
You know, I delighted the taste of gin.

762
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,520
I went drinking with aliens.

763
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,060
Shut up!

764
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,260
I lost my wife.

765
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,000
I lost an alien culture who wanted to take me to the planet Arcturus.

766
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,420
And I don't know if I've gotten the resentment, you know, forgiveness part down in the...

767
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,460
One day at a time.

768
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,480
I just cannot, you know, believe in a war against drugs when they have anti-drug commercials on TV all day long, followed by,

769
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,680
This Bud's for you.

770
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,940
I got news for you, folks.

771
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,280
A1, alcohol is a drug.

772
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:21,120
B2, and here's the rub, alcohol kills more people than crack, coke, and heroin combined each year.

773
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,280
So, thanks for inviting me to your little alcoholic drug den here tonight.

774
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
You fine, upstanding citizens.

775
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
You, wink wink, nudge nudge.

776
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,940
Now, you know why?

777
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,980
If I was gonna have a drug be legal, it would not be alcohol.

778
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,480
You know why?

779
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,460
There's better drugs and better drugs for you.

780
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,200
That's a fact.

781
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,260
So you can stop your internal dialogue.

782
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,480
But wait a minute, Bill.

783
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:54,540
Alcohol is an acceptable form of social interaction, which for thousands of years has been the norm under which human beings have congregated and formed socialist groups and they would congregate...

784
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,900
Shut up.

785
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,920
Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you.

786
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,720
Pot is a better drug than alcohol.

787
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,040
Fact, and I'll prove it to you.

788
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,920
You're at a ball game, you're at a concert, someone's really violent, aggressive, and obnoxious.

789
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,720
Are they drunk or are they smoking pot?

790
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,400
Drunk.

791
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,760
The one and only correct answer.

792
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,960
Tell them what they want, Johnny.

793
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,600
I've never seen people on pot get in a fight because it is impossible.

794
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,380
Hey, buddy.

795
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,420
Hey, wood.

796
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,140
End of argument.

797
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,620
Say you get in a car accident and you've been smoking pot.

798
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,200
You're only going four miles an hour.

799
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,280
You get something.

800
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,380
Forgot to open the garage door, man.

801
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,200
Yeah.

802
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,820
Time to get the garage door open so Domino's knows we're home.

803
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,380
Yeah.

804
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


805
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


806
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


807
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


808
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


809
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


810
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


811
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


812
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,380


813
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,600
But I'll tell you the truth.

814
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,540
I have never heard one reason that rang true why marijuana is against the law.

815
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,360
That rang true now.

816
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,360
I'm not talking about the reasons the government tells us, because I hope you know this.

817
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,880
I think you do.

818
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,780
All governments are lying.

819
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,480
Oh, .

820
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,300
Yeah.

821
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,300
Yeah.

822
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,720
Yeah.

823
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,520
Yeah.

824
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,040
Yeah.

825
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,940
Yeah.

826
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,180
Yeah.

827
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:50,820
Yeah.

828
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:50,960
Yeah.

829
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:51,940
Yeah.

830
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,180
Yeah.

831
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:52,320
Yeah.

832
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:52,920
Yeah.

833
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


834
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


835
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


836
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


837
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


838
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


839
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


840
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:52,920


841
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,560
All right.

842
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,840
I mean marijuana grows everywhere, serves a thousand different functions, all of them

843
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,280
positive.

844
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,020
To make marijuana against the law is like saying God made a mistake, you know what

845
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,240
I mean?

846
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,360
It's like God on the seventh day looked down at his creation, said, there it is, my creation,

847
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,920
perfect and holy in all ways.

848
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,060
Now I can rest.

849
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,540
Oh my me.

850
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,340
I left pot everywhere.

851
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,380
I should never have smoked that joint on the third day.

852
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,080
If I leave pot everywhere,

853
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,220
that's going to give people the impression

854
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,520
they're supposed to use it.

855
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,200
Shit.

856
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,040
Now I have to create Republicans.

857
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,240
Republicans.

858
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,480
So you see, it's a vicious cycle.

859
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,520
And I'm not promoting the use of drugs, believe me.

860
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm not.

861
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,380
I've had bad times on drugs, okay?

862
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,460
I mean, look at this haircut.

863
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,040
I'll tell you, I live in New York now.

864
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,740
I mean, I'll tell you, man,

865
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,140
the war on drugs has definitely taken a ceasefire there.

866
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,680
I mean, it's incredible.

867
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,640
They sell drugs out loud on the streets.

868
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,260
Heroin, heroin, heroin, coke, coke, coke, smoke, smoke.

869
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,700
Heroin, heroin.

870
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,500
Those guys fuck with me.

871
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,580
So I'm walking down the street one day.

872
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,460
This guy's walking ahead of me,

873
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
passes one of those dealers.

874
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,100
He looks at him.

875
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,940
He goes, heroin, heroin, heroin.

876
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,600
I pass him.

877
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,120
He looked at me.

878
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,580
He goes, glue.

879
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,640
I can afford heroin.

880
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,920
I'm doing laundry right now.

881
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,120
As soon as my shirt's out of the cleaners,

882
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,740
I'm coming back and buying some of that from you.

883
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,060
He embarrassed me to death, all right?

884
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,940
I was mortified.

885
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,140
Glue.

886
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,600
Where's a bank machine?

887
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,080
Come here.

888
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,120
Come here, Mr. Dealer.

889
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,520
Come here.

890
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,460
I'm going to show you my balance.

891
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,960
Then I'm going to buy heroin

892
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,400
from that little kid across the street.

893
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,380
I'm going to buy heroin from that little kid across the street.

894
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,380


895
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,380


896
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,500
New York's a rather tense town.

897
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,740
See, I think drugs have done some good things for us.

898
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,240
I really do.

899
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,260
And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us,

900
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,820
do me a favor.

901
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,360
Go home tonight, take all your albums,

902
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,380
all your tapes, and all your CDs, and burn them.

903
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,900
Because you know what?

904
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,660
The musicians who made all that great music

905
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,680
that's enhanced your lives throughout the years?

906
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,580
Real high on drugs.

907
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,920
Man, the Beatles.

908
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,680
The Beatles were so high,

909
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,500
they let Ringo sing a couple of tunes.

910
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,860
Tell me they weren't partying.

911
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,960
We all live in a yellow submarine.

912
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,460
Yellow submarine.

913
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,100
We all live in a...

914
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,720
You know how fucking high they were when they wrote that?

915
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,580
They had to pull Ringo off the ceiling with a rake.

916
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,020
John, get Ringo.

917
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,800
He's in the corner.

918
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,860
Ooh, look at him scooch.

919
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,300
Grab him.

920
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,040
Hook his bell bottom.

921
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,020
Hook his bell bottom.

922
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,800
He's got a song he wants to sing us.

923
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,600
Something about living in a yellow tambourine or something.

924
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,020
Ringo, Yoko's gone.

925
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,620
Come down.

926
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,700
We can party again.

927
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,920
They were real high.

928
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,080
They wrote great music.

929
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,980
Drugs did have a positive effect.

930
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,920
Okay, I'll tell you what else.

931
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,060
I'm gonna extend the theory to our generation now

932
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,080
so that it's more applicable.

933
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,280
The musicians today who don't do drugs

934
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,020
and in fact speak out against it,

935
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,360
we're rock against drugs.

936
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,440
Boy, they suck.

937
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,540
Suck.

938
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,780
Ballest, soulless, spiritless, corporate little bitches.

939
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,940
Each and every one of them.

940
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,240
We're rock against drugs

941
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,060
because that's what George is.

942
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,960
That's what George Bush wants.

943
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,960
George Bush wants.

944
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,440
George Bush wants.

945
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:14,460


946
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,620
That's what we want, isn't it?

947
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,860
Government approved rock and roll.

948
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,340
Don't you want to be at a concert one night,

949
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,580
look to your right and see Dan Quayle right next to you, man?

950
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,200
You know you're partying.

951
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,640
Then you know you're on the edge.

952
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,360
If the Quayle monster's here, there ain't no coming back.

953
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,680
We might be up till 11 tonight.

954
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,580
We're rock stars who do Pepsi Cola commercials.

955
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,460
George Bush wants.

956
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,560
George Bush wants.

957
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,680
George Bush wants.

958
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,000
Here comes a fella named Vanilla Ice.

959
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,680
Here comes MC Hammer.

960
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,820
Here's Madonna with two heads.

961
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,280
It's only your dignity, suck it.

962
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,080
MC Hammer, oh, I'm sorry, it's Hammer.

963
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,180
He dropped the MC.

964
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,540
I can't wait till he drops the Hammer, too.

965
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,240
How about this?

966
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,880
Drop it off.

967
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:12,700
Good.

968
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,540
I am available for children's parties, by the way.

969
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,900
Some of y'all might have a young and coming of age

970
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,120
and not want to go the traditional clown balloon animal route this year.

971
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,260
Might want to look me up.

972
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,220
Beelzebozo.

973
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,960
Clown from hell.

974
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,900
Ah, kids, it's Beelzebozo time.

975
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,760
Tell me something.

976
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,760
Who here out of you young'uns has never smoked a cigarette?

977
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,400
Come here, kids.

978
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,140
What's your name?

979
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,460
Tommy, Tommy, how old are you?

980
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,840
Five.

981
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,880
Five years old.

982
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,340
And you mean to tell Beelzebozo you're not smoking cigarettes yet?

983
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,580
Come here, Tommy.

984
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,940
Hold it in.

985
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,400
Tommy.

986
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,620
Nope, it's Beelzebozo time.

987
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,720
Tell me something.

988
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,460
Who here out of you young'uns has never watched a skin flick?

989
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,140
Come here, kids.

990
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,260
Mommy.

991
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,060
That is your mommy.

992
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,600
Come on.

993
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,480
It's Beelzebozo time.

994
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,920
Clown from hell.

995
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:20,360


996
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,440
See, I don't know.

997
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,320
I just differ, you know.

998
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,180
Like, remember those summer trips you take with your folks growing up?

999
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,660
Instead of doing that, why don't families take mushrooms,

1000
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,980
stay home, and trip together?

1001
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:39,420
.

1002
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,620
It would be a much better trip.

1003
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,340
The whole movies would be tons more fun.

1004
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,360
Just 20 minutes of someone's thumb.

1005
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,440
.

1006
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,580
You see, son, the thumb is opposable.

1007
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,720
That's why we can use tools and live indoors.

1008
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,020
.

1009
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,060
Speaking of indoors, you get the impression

1010
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,020
the walls are breathing?

1011
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:11,660
I do, Mom.

1012
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,800
.

1013
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,080
It's like we're all one consciousness

1014
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,140
experiencing itself subjectively.

1015
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:18,800
.

1016
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,000
There is no such thing as death, son.

1017
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,160
It's only illusion that we are separate beings.

1018
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,060
In actuality, we are all one con...

1019
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,480
.

1020
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,780
God is love, and love is all there is.

1021
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,620
And if that's all there is, there can be no opposite.

1022
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,320
Cool, Dad.

1023
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,080
.

1024
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,560
I think that'd be such a neat trip.

1025
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,220
In a way.

1026
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,020
Except your parents.

1027
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,180
Get them some food now.

1028
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:49,900
Just in case I had to make you worry andший responded to a

1029
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:55,480
I know you worked in a company right?

1030
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:55,600
.

1031
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:55,640
Oh, yeah, going to that community now.

1032
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:55,640


1033
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:55,640


1034
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,240
Your homie completely People's Dictatorship 8 told

1035
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,440
me the following thing.

1036
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,880
and et cetera, et cetera, down the line.

1037
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,620
Okay, great.

1038
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,940
But no one knows what pornography is.

1039
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,020
Supreme Court says pornography is any act

1040
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,760
that has no artistic merit and causes sexual thoughts.

1041
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,020
That's their definition, essentially.

1042
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,500
No artistic merit causes sexual thought.

1043
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,720
Hmm.

1044
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,860
Sounds like every commercial on television, doesn't it?

1045
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,640
You know, when I see those two twins

1046
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,920
on that double-met commercial,

1047
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,040
I'm not thinking of gum.

1048
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,760
I am thinking of chewing.

1049
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,620
Maybe that's the connection they're trying to make.

1050
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,000
What?

1051
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,220
You've all seen that Bush beer commercial.

1052
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,540
The girl in the short hot pants opens the beer bottle

1053
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,160
on her belt buckle, leaves it there,

1054
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,620
and it foams over her hand and over the bottle,

1055
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,880
and the voiceover goes,

1056
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,800
Get yourself a Bush.

1057
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,680
Hmm.

1058
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,600
You know what that looks like?

1059
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,440
Nah, no way.

1060
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,720
I'll tell you the commercial they'd like to do if they could,

1061
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,740
and I guarantee you if they could,

1062
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,700
they'd do this right here.

1063
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,500
Here's the woman's face.

1064
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:11,900
Beautiful.

1065
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,020
Camera pulls back.

1066
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,740
Naked breast.

1067
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,440
Camera pulls back.

1068
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,520
She's totally naked.

1069
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,640
Legs apart.

1070
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,260
Two fingers right here.

1071
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,520
And it just says,

1072
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,560
Drink Coke.

1073
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,400
Now, I don't know the connection here.

1074
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,880
But I have a Coke getting on my shopping list that way.

1075
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,620
Dr. Pepper.

1076
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,880
Dr. Pepper.

1077
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,360
Snickers Satisfying.

1078
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,440
Damned if I'm not buying these products.

1079
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,000
My teeth are rotten out of my head.

1080
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,900
I'm glued to the television.

1081
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,040
I'm as big a couch.

1082
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,740
More Snickers.

1083
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,560
More Coke.

1084
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,360
That's what I find ironic, too,

1085
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,960
is that people who are against these things that cause sexual thoughts

1086
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,520
are generally fundamentalist Christians

1087
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,780
who also believe you should be fruitful

1088
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,240
and multiply.

1089
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,660
Boy, they walk a tightrope every day, don't they?

1090
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,880
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1091
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,640
How do we be fruitful and multiply and not think about it?

1092
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,140
We could sing hymns during it.

1093
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,900
One stroke at a time.

1094
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,980
Sweet Jesus.

1095
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,360
One stroke at a time.

1096
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,600
Sweet Lord.

1097
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,520
I did that joke in Alabama in Fife,

1098
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,360
and these three rednecks met me after the show.

1099
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,080
Hey, buddy, come here.

1100
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,300
Mr. Funny Man, come here.

1101
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,440
Hey, buddy, we're Christians.

1102
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:58,900
We don't like to talk about it.

1103
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:58,900


1104
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:58,900


1105
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,620
We don't like what you're saying.

1106
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,900
I said, then forgive me.

1107
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,560
Later, when I was hanging from the tree,

1108
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,760
here is my final point.

1109
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,840
Oh, thank you, God.

1110
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,660
About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography,

1111
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,840
whatever that is.

1112
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,100
What business is it of yours

1113
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,780
what I do, read, buy, see, or take into my body?

1114
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,260
As long as I do not harm another human being on this planet.

1115
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,040
Amen.

1116
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:33,840
Amen.

1117
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,200
Woo!

1118
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,200
Come on.

1119
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,540
And for those of you out there

1120
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,440
who are having a little moral dilemma in your head

1121
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,340
how to answer that question, I'll answer it for you.

1122
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,020
None of your business.

1123
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,160
Take that to the bank, cash it, and go renovation out of my life.

1124
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,600
But see, here's their argument to that each and every time.

1125
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,940
But we have to protect the children.

1126
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,460
We have to protect the children.

1127
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,760
Let me tell you something.

1128
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,340
Children are smarter than any of us.

1129
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,040
You know how I know that?

1130
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,920
I don't know one child with a full-time job and children.

1131
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,060
Yeah, quit these kids, man.

1132
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,280
But where did this veneration of childbirth come from?

1133
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,660
I missed that meeting, I'll tell you that.

1134
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,700
Oh, childbirth is such a miracle.

1135
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,720
It's such a miracle.

1136
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,560
Wrong.

1137
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,240
If it were a miracle that not every nine months

1138
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,360
any yin-yang in the world could drop a litter

1139
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,280
of these mewling cabbages on the planet.

1140
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,420
And in case you have not checked the single mom statistics lately,

1141
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,020
the miracle is spreading like wildfire.

1142
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:35,620
Hallelujah.

1143
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,960
Trailer parks all over America filling up with little miracles.

1144
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:41,960
Thunk.

1145
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,160
Thunk.

1146
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,280
Thunk.

1147
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,440
Look at all my little miracles.

1148
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,440
Thunk.

1149
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,480
Filling up my trailer like a sardine can.

1150
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,160
Look at them.

1151
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,240
Thunk.

1152
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,040
You know what would be a real miracle?

1153
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,800
If I could remember your daddy's name, though.

1154
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:58,580
Thunk.

1155
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,200
I guess I'll have to call you Trucker Junior.

1156
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,120
That's all I remember about your daddy

1157
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,820
was his fuzzy little pot belly riding on top of me

1158
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,880
shooting in to produce my little waterhead miracle baby child.

1159
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:10,880
Thunk.

1160
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,300
There's your brother, Pizza Boy Delivery Junior.

1161
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,420
Thunk.

1162
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,680
There's your other brother, Exterminator Junior.

1163
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,380
Thunk.

1164
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,800
There's your other brother, Will Work for Food Junior.

1165
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,360
Thank you very much. Good night.

1166
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,000
Bill Hicks, dear friends.

1167
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,360
That was indeed.

1168
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,740
Bill Hicks from his album Relentless.

1169
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,340
And it is indeed.

1170
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,260
You can hear the uncut version of that on the album.

1171
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,780
What I've been playing was very, very edited for Radio Airplay.

1172
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,660
Had to do it myself.

1173
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,700
It was worth it, though, I think.

1174
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,840
Bill Hicks, remember it.

1175
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:52,600
You heard it on the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

1176
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,220
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

1177
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,520
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1178
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,360
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1179
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:17,100
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1180
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:24,700
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1181
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,140
Stay tuned and pray.

1182
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,720
Praise Bob.
