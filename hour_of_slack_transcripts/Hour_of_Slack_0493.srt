1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
But Bob is good all the time.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,920
Is this thing running?

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,640
Can I say Bob?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,480
Bob. I just say Bob.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,700
Okay, I thought you said Bob.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,100
Yeah, you're supposed to say Bob.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,040
Excuse me.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,520
Dear friends.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,500
What we're listening to in the background is a solid gold CD

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,940
that was sent to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack,

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,240
here in Dallas, Texas, with very little explanations on it.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:50,040
And it just has this sort of music that goes on and on and on in the background.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,840
And what we would like to do this show is...

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,580
It's rolling right now?

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,440
Oh, no!

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,080
Oh, I don't...

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,060
Dude, man, I gotta get ready.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,420
Um, okay.

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,360
I'll cast a little...

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,800
Okay, let's see.

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah, right.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,440
Your nightmares come alive.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,240
Yeah, there. That's more like it.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,320
Now prepare yourselves for a terrifying hour that won't be easy for you to forget.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,960
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,540
You will now hear all of the positive messages contained in the subliminal portion of this tape.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,280
These messages...

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,740
have been carefully designed to help you achieve the success you desire and deserve.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,460
I use rest stops regularly.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,200
You choose to be in control of your life.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,880
You choose to be happy.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,860
You choose to be happy.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,440
You are a happy person.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,700
You are a winner.

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,880
Because I got a 3220 built on a graveyard frame.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,940
Shoots tombstone bullets, balls, and chains.

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,360
Said I'm tough as cowhide, swift as lead.

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,780
I was born in the jungle where they never go to bed.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,680
Wild throw a brick through midnight and break broad daylight.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,600
Because my eyes is made of bulletproof glass.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,800
I like being in control of my life.

42
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,940
I know I can be who I want to be.

43
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,840
I-

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,900
Have a nice trip.

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,600
You're such a damn fool.

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,120
You lost your grip!

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,840
What the hell does it take?

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,860
To get you to awaken.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
No matter what you say!

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,960
A equals A equals A equals A equals A!

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,520
These messages will now become subliminal, but your subconscious mind will be hearing and accepting all of the positive messages.

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,700
Listen to the tapes as often as you can. The more you listen, the sooner success will come.

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,600
That's enough. Cut off the telecommand. Are you crazy? Cut off the telecommand, I say. We must maneuver freely. That would be an act of insubordination.

54
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,360
And if they say anything against God or Elvis Presley, they get thrown out on the rest again.

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:39,480
He said, you're insane. He said, you need to be put away. He said, you're a sick woman. And I said, if this is sick, I never want to get better. I want to stay in critical condition for the rest of my life.

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,500
And he filed for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty, and Elvis was item number two, excessive devotion to Elvis Presley. And I said, I love it.

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,260
Hit one of them, Bob.

58
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,480
Not with the rage.

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,540
Run into him.

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,920
The program has been banned from the air, and you know that, too.

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,060
I know, but it's too vital to the radio.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,380
Not only was the ban on the program overruled, now I don't understand anything.

63
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
This almost seems like a joke, but...

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,260
I made the judge understand the importance of this program to the radio.

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,480
Can't say it's a blamer.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,520
Sure.

67
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,140
The show can cause tropical fish to pop when waved over the tank.

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,820
The show sterilizes dogs and house cats within a three-block radius.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,420
The show removes rust, earwax, and questionable stains of passion.

70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,500
And now, the subgenius.

71
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Our love, black.

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,640
Black.

73
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:50,880
Black.

74
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,760
Black.

75
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,420
Black.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,580
Stormy black.

77
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,540
Black.

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,640
Black.

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,000
Black.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,220
Black.

81
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,380


82
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,420
Black.

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,480
Black.

84
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,480


85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,480


86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,720
Black.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,720


88
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,720


89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,720


90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,720


91
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:08,860
Silver.

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,380
White.

93
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,120
White.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


95
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


96
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


99
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


103
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


104
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,120


105
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


106
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


107
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


108
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


109
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,420
Very black.

110
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,500
Black.

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,100


112
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,280
Black.

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,280


114
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,520
Black.

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,200
Black.

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:20,920
Black.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,520
Black.

118
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,120
Black.

119
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


121
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,920
Subgenius in the name of J.R.

122
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,520
Bob

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,480
Dose

124
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,760
But all I can say is I get lots of recurrences when I do this

125
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,080
and I get a few leaks

126
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,620
So my own tendency is if the rectum seems normal

127
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,580
perhaps with a bit of anal disease

128
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,460
not to do an immediate colectomy and ileo-rectal

129
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,740
but to do a subgenius

130
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,960
say a total colectomy or proctocolectomy and ileostomy

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,860
Poor control over a period of years

132
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,060
can also cause target organ damage

133
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,800
that can eventually lead to blindness, renal failure, amputations, neuropathy, coronary artery disease

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,180
exercise

135
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,300
quitting smoking, reducing sodium and cholesterol intake, increasing dietary fiber

136
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,980
All these are measures we're taking to help prevent

137
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,720
Dog

138
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,260
Dose

139
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,660
For amusement they toss children into pits with hungry dogs

140
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,140
Are we not men?

141
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,660
We are

142
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,600
The subgenius

143
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,740
Ah!

144
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:21,860


145
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,900
In nomine Patris et Fili et Spiritus Sancti

146
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,940
Amen

147
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,200
Nance, no sense of humor

148
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,580
And of course a lot of them have a normal rectum

149
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,540
so it's very attractive to

150
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,820
Keep the rectus subgenius and then after a year or so

151
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,700
consider joining the patient up

152
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,660
What if you punch two up?

153
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,160
Have a good time, you know what I mean?

154
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,840
That's what I have to do

155
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
I think

156
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Well, stop thinking and get on down to Studio X Atomic Disco Lounge

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,680
Well, don't think it's time we stop

158
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,180
Here we go

159
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,020
The acceleration, the pressure, it's tremendous

160
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,080
Now take it out

161
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,700
Velocity

162
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,080
The action begins with magic

163
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,300
68 seconds, 69 seconds

164
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,080
It's happening, it's happening

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,460
70 seconds

166
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,500
71 seconds

167
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,360
Lock it away!

168
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,460
Lock it away!

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,960
I rock it to the moon!

170
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Hmmmm!

171
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,440
It's a rocket!

172
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,580
It's a rocket!

173
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,260
Wait a minute, we better check everything

174
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,460
We got 48 hours to save a lot of money

175
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,060
What a swells the time

176
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,540
We got 48 hours to save a lot of time

177
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,340
What a swells the time

178
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:47,840
What a swells the time

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
Music concrete, dear friends

180
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes!

181
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,880
Yes!

182
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,600
Man!

183
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,940
Oh, yes dear friends, and I guess it's gonna be another musical show tonight

184
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,740
Because there's so much, what you might call music

185
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,980
What you might call a lovely noise like little knives in your ears, yes?

186
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,680
But we've got the amazing Devo cover collection

187
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,860
Which I think, well, it's one of the funniest damn things I ever saw in my life

188
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,000
And some news of those great proto-subgeniuses, Devo, coming up

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,780
More Zug's Rift and the Rudy Schwartz docudrama

190
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,900
So much music from people you've never heard of

191
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,760
But you'll want to hear them again and again and again

192
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,120
Speaking of people you've never heard of

193
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,580
Boy, that collage that opened the show

194
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,360
Was a, oh, that's a couple years old

195
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,160
That's from Hour of Slack number 355

196
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,300
Tonight we're doing Hour of Slack number 493, I believe it is

197
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,480
And, yeah, yeah, yeah

198
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,040
Yeah, that collage was, boy, there was a little, you heard a little bit of everybody in there

199
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,740
Some of that was edited by yours truly, Reverend Devo

200
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,380
Reverend Ivan Stang

201
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,200
But also, I'm sure, Puzzling Evidence had a sticky finger in it

202
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,180
And the Young Technocrats

203
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,600
Who knows, probably some Chris Gross

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,740
And all kinds of people you've never heard of

205
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,440
And a few that you will later on in the show truly wish that you hadn't

206
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
Ah, yes

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,760
They tell us that we lost our tents

208
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,000
Giraffes and Nets all jumped the fence

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,180
Just to brought up ladies and gents

210
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,620
Are we not class?

211
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,220
Clowns?

212
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,020
We are bozo

213
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,540
Are we not clowns?

214
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,160
Eyo, eyo

215
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,240
We have red hair

216
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,800
That stands up straight

217
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,460
We have a red nose

218
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,940
That's so ornate

219
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
Are we not clowns?

220
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,860
We are bozo

221
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,620
Are we not clowns?

222
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,940
Eyo, eyo

223
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,080
Are we not wang?

224
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,260
We are dildos

225
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,620
Are we not clowns?

226
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,120
We are soj

227
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,620
Thank you.

228
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,040
Thank you.

229
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
Thank you.

230
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,020
Thank you.

231
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,520
Thank you.

232
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,700
Thank you.

233
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,340
Thank you.

234
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,540
What is this?

235
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,860
What is this?

236
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,680
What kind of?

237
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,140
Oh, yes, dear friends, truly a definitive

238
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,000
version of the

239
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,780
of that classic old Devo song, Mongoloid.

240
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,040
That one was done by a band called The Deadliners.

241
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,860
And before that, we heard Jaco Bozo by The Firemen.

242
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,120
Uh, yes.

243
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,980
And, you know, I don't know about you,

244
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,600
but I consider Devo to be one of the preeminent of the,

245
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,440
well, you might say pre and early subgenius bands.

246
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,420
And Devo, of course, was originally one of Dobbs' pop culture experiments,

247
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,980
sort of like the Monkees.

248
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,540
Not many people know that Dobbs also was behind the Monkees originally.

249
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,620
And, well, it's been a while since Devo has been performing,

250
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,480
and Wired Magazine had been trying to get hold of Mark Mothersbaugh

251
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,100
to see what he was up to, aside from TV themes and things.

252
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,160
And he wasn't returning their calls, so they asked me to call him, and I did.

253
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,920
And I wrote him a little article about it, but I haven't heard back from him,

254
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,320
so I might as well just tell you what I learned

255
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,600
as to what those wacky fav mop tops are up to these days.

256
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,380
This little article was called,

257
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,260
He Brought Home the Bacon So That No One Knew.

258
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,340
And you'd hardly recognize Mark Mothersbaugh.

259
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,240
From his Devo days, he said.

260
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,320
Ah, shoot.

261
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,840
That old, that poor old tape.

262
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,160
Listen to that.

263
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,840
I can't, I can't.

264
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,200
Hold on just a second, friends.

265
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm going to run across here and grab this.

266
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,800
That's so sad.

267
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,880
That old Devo Muzak tape has obviously gone the way of so many cheap conspiracy manufactured tapes.

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,980
We'll try this more sedate Mark Mothersbaugh music in the background.

269
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,340
This is from his music for Insomniac.

270
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,340
You'd hardly recognize Mark Mothersbaugh from his Devo days, he says.

271
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,960
He sports a Cyclops look following radical cosmetic surgery.

272
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,640
Through the use of orthopedic clamps and painful surgery,

273
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,380
he's had his right eye gradually shifted to the middle of his forehead.

274
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,060
The left eye was ditched entirely.

275
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,540
When the bandages come off, he figures it'll inspire hundreds of Hollywood copycats.

276
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,420
Actually, Mark said that he didn't forget.

277
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,420


278
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,400
He's throwing his left eye away, but he's got it in a jar.

279
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,640
Um, I haven't seen it yet, but I hope to.

280
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,700
In the meantime, Mark's been one busy spud boy with all 12 fingers embedded in at least

281
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,180
a dozen different pies, some of them really gooey.

282
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,820
His music company, Mutato Muzica, or yeah, I guess that's pronounced Mutato.

283
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,360
The secretary says Mutato, but I like Mutato.

284
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,400
Muzica in LA has brought him so much slack that he rarely uses it.

285
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,400


286
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,560
He barely gets any sleep.

287
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,840
Companies give him music-less videotapes.

288
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,560
He slaves them to his computer.

289
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,960
And sooner or later, they come back out not only musically scored, but loaded to the gills

290
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,660
with whatever subliminals struck Mark's fancy that day.

291
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,280
As far as Devo goes, friends, first, you know, the forces of normality, of course, tried

292
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
to kill Devo.

293
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
And then Devo tried to kill itself.

294
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,380
But Devo refuses to die.

295
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,380


296
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,400
Even now that society itself has become a Devo.

297
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,760
The Mothersbaugh and Casale boys got together again for the Tank Girl movie title song,

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,660
which is a redo of Girl You Want, as well as a new song for the Mighty Morphin Power

299
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
Rangers movie.

300
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,700
Mark says that most of these songs only involve two or three words of lyrics, and the way

301
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,800
he works with these big movie companies is.

302
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,360
He charges them with a lot of money.

303
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,940
Mark charges a certain amount per word of lyrics, but they get the music and the subliminals

304
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,660
for free.

305
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,240
Usually it's like, yeah, yeah, no, no.

306
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,700
That's like maybe a $60,000 production.

307
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,800
When somebody's mounting a really big buck production, they'll request as many as five

308
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,860
or six words.

309
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,740
And he'll throw in things like, yeah, baby, you know, oh, I love you, whatever.

310
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,840
Mark's name has been scrolling by at breakneck speed.

311
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,180
And the credits of several TV shows, the weirder kids stuff like Rugrats, Beakman's World, and

312
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,960
Medicine Ball, as well as Sliders.

313
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,000
But now he's got five new shows to deal with.

314
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,020
And two of them are Nickelodeon cartoons, one called Kevin's Kitchen and one called

315
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,840
Santo Bigito, a cartoon about cockroaches living in a border town between Texas and

316
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,260
Mexico.

317
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,880
For Fox, he's scoring a couple of sitcoms.

318
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,460
Two something.

319
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,280
And if not for you, as well as a promising weirdness fest called Strange Luck from the

320
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,560
producer of Erie, Indiana.

321
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,420
And then there are the commercials, friends.

322
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,840
Professor Mothersbaugh has been packing subliminals into ad jingles for years now.

323
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,300
You may not have known about that.

324
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,360
Back in the Hawaiian punch days, he had to be cautious.

325
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,820
But the more subliminals he packs in there, the better that dumb ad boys seem to like

326
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,060
it.

327
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:22,540
And since these extra sort of warped out verbal sounds being used as percussion in the background

328
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,420
are subliminals, he can tell the client they say one thing when they actually say something

329
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,020
else entirely.

330
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:36,660
He's fond of embedding words like submit, obey, along with the more personal brainwashing

331
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:44,840
lines like praise Bob and we smell sausage, which if you play that phrase backwards, you'll

332
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,440
be surprised.

333
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,920
It's a very common phrase.

334
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,260
It's a phrase that we realize says Jesus loves you back masked.

335
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,840
It really does.

336
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,040
We smell sausage.

337
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,220
Now play this phrase backwards.

338
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,520
We smell Bob.

339
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh, and he's got, he's packing those into such clients as Nike and seven up.

340
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,360
Hard to believe, you know, from such humble beginnings in Akron that they would end up

341
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,180
with such humble.

342
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,980
Uh, beginnings.

343
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,880
Then there are the movie scores, which a mother's ball creates pretty much solo.

344
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,900
He scored this movie called the new age last year.

345
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,880
Uh, one of it, which was directed by a subgenius member, by the way, Michael Tolkien.

346
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,040
He also did the rapture, which is a damned weird film.

347
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,100
Um, one of Mark's favorite upcoming movies is called the flesh suitcase, which is a story

348
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,920
involving the.

349
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,820
The misadventures of drug smugglers waiting to excrete balloons of dope out of their colons.

350
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,500
And another one is called a movie.

351
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,600
He's he's scored is called the last supper, a sick comedy in which right wing redneck

352
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,140
bill Paxton dares some sappy liberal grad students to kill him.

353
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,120
And after they take him up on it, they decide it's kind of fun and they move on to murdering

354
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,680
fundamentalists and gay bashers and Rush Limbaugh.

355
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,900
But I think in the end, Rush Limbaugh.

356
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,840
Kills them.

357
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:24,960
Um, and Mark also toiled as music producer for Quentin Tarantino's, uh, four rooms, uh,

358
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,160
working with combustible Edison, busy, busy, busy out there in LA.

359
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,380
Then there are the CD ROM games.

360
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,740
New Taito provided the music and sound effects for the Johnny mnemonic CD ROM and Mark and

361
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,980
Jerry Casale co-designed from the get go.

362
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,040
The Devo game adventures of the smart patrol.

363
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,460
I haven't seen that game.

364
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,580
I can't, I couldn't, I don't have a machine to play it on anyway, but, uh, those are both

365
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:02,960
supposed to be really challenging CD ROM titles compared to most of what's out and, uh, and

366
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Mark's working on software, interactive software, um, not so much in, in creating new CD ROM

367
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,720
games that are fancier than the last big hit or required.

368
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:13,960
I mean, I don't know.

369
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:13,960


370
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,800
They're expensive new machines to run, but the opposite, quick bare bones ornamental

371
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,760
programs or a little Dingle Berry's as he calls them valuable, more for their sick concept

372
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,480
than for complexity and distributed and marketed entirely through the internet.

373
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,180
Uh, and just exactly what these Dingle Berry's might actually be is still top secret.

374
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,100
But one of Mark's goals in music.

375
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay.

376
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah.

377
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:49,460
find the exact subsonic tone that would cause the audience's bowels to loosen uncontrollably.

378
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,240
So friends, you may extrapolate from there. Thank you.

379
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,140
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee. We don't take no trips on LSD.

380
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,740
We don't burn our drop cards out on Hale Street. We like living right and being free.

381
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:35,180
We don't make a party out of lovin'. We like holding hands and eating wood.

382
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,600
We don't let our hair roll long and shabby.

383
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm a hippie.

384
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,680
I smoke in San Francisco too.

385
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,020
I'm proud to be an Hokie from Muskogee.

386
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,240
A place where even squares can have a ball.

387
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,880
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse.

388
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,720
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all.

389
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,140
And your boots are still in style for manly footwear.

390
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,100
Beads and Roman sandals just won't do.

391
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,480
Football skills, the roughest thing on campus.

392
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,560
And the kids still respect the college key.

393
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm proud to be an Hokie from Muskogee.

394
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
A place where even squares can have a ball.

395
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,700
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse.

396
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,680
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all.

397
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,960
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.A.,

398
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,760
It's hard to discern the point at which fantasy becomes reality for Rudy Schwartz.

399
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,800
As we follow him around his trailer,

400
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,800
we find him performing the most mundane of daily tasks

401
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,060
while carrying on arcane conversations with Joey Bishop,

402
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,540
whom Schwartz seems quite convinced is present with us in the room.

403
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,100
Living out a sad, paranoid delusion,

404
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,120
Schwartz fixes a pot of coffee

405
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,680
and whines incessantly about his recent exclusion from the Rat Pack.

406
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,060
He tosses out an idle threat to quit returning phone calls

407
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,020
and to begin working up a stage act with Larry Storch and the Ritz brothers.

408
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,420
Grainy images of doodled weaver Blair from the television

409
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,000
as Schwartz's dog Gunter begs for sausages.

410
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,600
I ask Schwartz if he knows there are small rodents sleeping in his food processor.

411
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,060
He replies that he doesn't, but that if I'll hum a few bars, he'll fake it.

412
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,080
I soon learn that a visit to the Schwartz's

413
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,280
is a maddening series of dated vaudeville routines

414
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,160
and distasteful images that sour the stomach.

Well, a little bit of the

447
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,880
Okie from Muskokie done by

448
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,980
the Bakersfield Bougie

449
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,920

some more from the Rudy

455
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,800
dear friends.

456
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Thanks to Joe.

457
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,980
Joe Newman.

458
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,920
Let's see what's on this little

459
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,080
bran flakes here to take us out to the end.

460
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,480
At that very moment, not for a word.

461
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,480
Biggie, Biggie, make the switch.

462
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,040
Make the change.

463
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,880
Just say no to plays.

464
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,500
Get some quick as men.

465
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,860
It's not that easy when he's bought.

466
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,520
I'm a police officer.

467
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
I'm a police officer in Sparks, Nevada.

468
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,280
And I'm not an addict.

469
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm definitely not an addict.

470
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,680
No, it's definitely not.

471
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,180
No correlation of balls and something.

472
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,640
Oh, you want those?

473
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,720
The glazed ones.

474
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,240
Okay.

475
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,800
Yeah, that's better.

476
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,120
I stand before you, brethren,

477
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,700
to share with you my revelation.

478
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,100
To tell you of a vision of the coming desolation.

479
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,700
There are forces working all around you vying for control.

480
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,800
They won't even wait until you're dead to try and steal your soul.

481
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,780
They pull your strings like puppeteers from the moment you were born.

482
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,440
They masturbate to suffering and you provide the porn.

483
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,620
They tell you to sit down from the time you learn to walk.

484
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,660
And they tell you to shut up from the time you learn to talk.

485
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,320
They send you to a school where they teach you evil lies.

486
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,500
To believe in evil lies.

487
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,980
To believe in what you're told instead of what's before your eyes.

488
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,940
They tell you all about their God and how the world was built.

489
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,940
And how his poor son Jesus died so you could have some guilt.

490
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,760
You have to get a haircut so you don't look like a slob.

491
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,980
And take off those ratty sneakers or you'll never find a job.

492
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,600
You go to work and pay your bills and try hard to survive.

493
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,920
You pay the cost of living while you try to stay alive.

494
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,820
You have to be a good citizen and don't break any laws.

495
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,420
Because men in cars,

496
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,480


497
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,400
with flashing lights,

498
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,740
will come to break your balls.

499
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,880
The only thing that you can do is hide and watch TV.

500
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,020
The little glowing box that says,

501
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,980
real life is just like me.

502
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,400
Relax and creature comfort as it irradiates the room.

503
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,160
Stare blankly at the electric image that tells you to consume.

504
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,260
Just kick back in your plastic chair on your acrylic rugs.

505
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,140
Smoke a joint and watch a TV show about the war on drugs.

506
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,960
Or you can join the army.

507
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,380
Now won't your dad be thrilled?

508
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,160
You look so good in uniform.

509
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,700
A shame that you got killed.

510
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,620
But friend, you don't have to play their game or follow stupid rules.

511
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,940
That are made to pen us in like sheep to be slaughtered like blind fools.

512
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,060
Stand up for your right to be who you are, to do whatever you please.

513
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,200
You can stand on your own two feet or die down on your knees.

514
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,000
Because this evil game won't work unless everybody plays.

515
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,660
Throw down your hand and make your stand or in the coming days,

516
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,200
these evil forces will seize the day.

517
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,300
And you'll be out of luck.

518
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,300
It won't matter who's doing the .

519
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,660
Because you're the one who'll be .

520
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,320
Let's say we just forget it.

521
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,480
I could be off enjoying myself.

522
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
Counting my head into a brick wall.

523
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,460
Over and over.

524
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,660
Running down the street with my brains hanging out of the back of my skull.

525
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,460
Dragging along the sidewalk.

526
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,600
Looking for a way to logo your show.

527
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,720
Nobody took all my credit.

528
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:53,760
Gotta screw the 405 Debbie show.

529
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:53,860
Making it look silly that I'm not allowed to make a great quality we freely

530
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:53,860

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:53,860


532
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,520
Actually helped me work on pornography.

533
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Come over mythology and write up the organisations under me and stop me.

534
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,820
I'm gonna've to workout more.

535
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,820

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,640
To share with you my visions of the things I think are right.

540
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,040
To find the darkest shadows and expose them to the light.

541
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,960
The horrors that surround me give me righteous cause to grieve

542
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,980
for the ignorance of people and the things that they believe.

543
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,200
That pipe leading from the factory that spews forth toxic waste

544
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,520
is not the cause of cancer or the water's funny taste.

545
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,420
The businessmen who own it have nothing but respect

546
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,880
for the families in the area and their kids with birth defects.

547
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,900
I'm a man of the law.

548
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:03,900


549
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,320
The police are here to help you in your time of dire needs

550
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,580
and to lock you in a cage for a pocket full of weeds.

551
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,020
There are preachers who will lead you to the land of milk and honey

552
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,340
but they will leave you high and dry and pocket all your money.

553
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,560
The politicians smile at you and promise to deliver

554
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,440
but they'll fuck you, then they'll kill you, then they'll throw you in the river.

555
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,440
So people open up your eyes and see things as they are

556
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,820
or be extinct like dinosaurs sinking in the tar.

557
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,360
Don't listen to the lies.

558
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,360


559
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,080
the liars and don't believe the lies. The truth is there to plainly see. Just open up your eyes.

560
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,380
Oh, yes, dear friends. Dr. Legume, the great Dr. Legume. We just heard there some

561
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,180
amazing intercuts of two giants of the Church of the Subgenius. Yes,

562
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:06,480
the great and good Dr. Legume intercut for censorship purposes with that other

563
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:14,000
giant of the church. One of many, actually. There are a lot of gigantic things,

564
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,900
hairy, sweaty things, men, yetis, what have you. This other, the music there was by

565
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,100
that great yeti Zug's Rift. I'm about to give you a couple of

566
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,560
addresses.

567
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:37,240
Zug's Rift is available through King of the Pacific Post Office, box 18765.

568
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:48,640
That's box 18765 in Encino, California. 91416. That zip code again, 91416.

569
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,480
And hold on, I'm going to get the address of Dr. Katahdin Legume so that you can

570
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
send off for his materials.

571
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,680
Huh, now see, that didn't take but a second. Friends, you got that pencil ready? Dr. Legume

572
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:09,320
has quite a pleasure pack of horror and a horror pack of pleasure for you if you want

573
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:18,760
to make that a love offering to Dr. Legume. That's L-E-G-U-M-E at number two, 7th Street.

574
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:26,940
Yes, once again, that's number two, 7th Street in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania. Dr. Legume.

575
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:36,980
Brookhaven, Pennsylvania. 19015. Yes, we tried to let you know where to get more uncensored

576
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:47,680
versions of these, uh, great subgenius heroes. Uh, yes. And as for what's next, I don't have

577
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,320
the slightest idea.

578
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:56,900
Tom, I guess you heard that I found the Lord. I found him in a can of beans once.

579
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:56,940


580
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:56,940


581
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:03,140
What was that night? Yup, I was stirring me a can of beans and I thought that little

582
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:09,900
chunk of fat said something, and I looked down and it was Jesus' head, talking to me

583
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,800
about my soul and stuff.

We'll see you next time.

We'll see you next time.

590
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,460
You know, friends, the conspiracy radio DJs and hosts don't have to do that

591
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,960
because they only play stuff that's been approved by the conspiracy

592
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,540
and is available in every Best Buy in the universe.

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,840
Whereas we try to go out of our way to make sure that you can't get the things you hear on the Hour of Slack

594
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,800
anywhere but the Hour of Slack.

595
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,800
And if you can, we destroy those rival distributors.

596
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,560
But no, no, actually we give the address of the places where you get them

597
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,400
because, by God...

598
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,500
Gosh, you know, nobody's getting paid for any of this.

599
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:31,260
And if we have naught but fame, then at least let us have our short moments of infamy.

600
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,720
What we'd like you to do is observe any change and report to us about what goes on.

601
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,880
No, not again.

602
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,820
Do I get paid for this?

603
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,540
Yeah, you do.

604
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,780
Your check's in the mail.

605
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,060
My check's in the mail?

606
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,380
Yeah.

607
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,440
I said I wasn't drunk.

608
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,780
I'm just a crazy man.

609
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,140
I like this program very much.

610
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,240
We're in trouble, man.

611
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
Are you a skull farmer?

612
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,520
No.

613
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,620
No, okay.

614
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,260
Well, see, a lot of people involved in this show are skull farmers.

615
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,960
In the background, we've got a camera focusing right on the Skull Farmer Convention.

616
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,160
In the background there, you can see they're pounding on the drums and making archaic rhythms

617
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,960
and, of course, adding to the general mayhem in the audience area.

618
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,900
Yes, the future's not a pretty sight.

619
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,300
But these shows can help you.

620
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,320
Yes, they can help you.

621
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,420
You'll be able to discern certain trails that'll lead you to some kind of future.

622
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:29,140
Righteousness, perhaps even a little bit of slack, as it were, in time for those, oh, those end times that are coming up.

623
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,860
You can assure your family's safe, secure comfort.

624
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,860
But hurry.

625
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,780
But hurry.

626
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,680
But hurry.

627
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,480
But hurry.

628
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,720
A man cannot buy his way into the fold or into heaven.

629
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,640
The price was paid at Calvary by the blood of Jesus Christ.

630
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,580
But we're told plainly in the Bible that we're to give our tithe.

631
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,040
And I'll offer.

632
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,360
Or else.

633
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,980
Or else.

634
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,360
Or else what?

635
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,260
Well, you probably don't even care.

636
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:13,140
But at the same time, our nobler aspirations are stirred onward and upward by the sweep in the emotions,

637
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,620
lifted by the waving flag and the fields of frown.

638
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,520
If you...

639
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:28,200
If you act like a dumb, stupid fool, they'll treat you as an equal, Bob said.

640
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:39,220
And I would say to you and your classmates, uh, that as you go on into this abattoir, this slaughterhouse,

641
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:48,200
this, uh, brothel and butcher shop that we call life, just remember that the fighting Jesus,

642
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,460
the fighting Jesus,

643
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:56,580
never fell back on jingoistic slogans about family values for Nazis.

644
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,020
No!

645
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,800
No, sir!

646
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,060
The fight Jesus!

647
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,040
The praised Bob with a sword and a gun.

648
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,580
With a bullet in his gun.

649
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,720
And with a great big electric marital aid.

650
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,980
With batteries that vibrated.

651
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,660
Strapped on, yes, with big patriotic red...

652
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:19,660


653
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,180
Red!

654
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,380
Strapped!

655
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:30,440
And with his boxing gloves on, yes, he would wade forward into the fray, his machine gun blazing,

656
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:39,600
his bible strapped across his chest like a bulletproof vest, and his Bob tattoo there on his forehead,

657
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,920
protecting his brain from enemy missiles.

658
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,580
Ah, yes.

659
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,580
Ah.

660
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:56,240
But after hearing my president and his friends speak, I was moved!

661
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:03,840
Watching the Republican convention, it reminded me what America is all about.

662
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,120
And I'm moved to announce that we were just kidding with all this subgenius stuff.

663
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,900
Oh, and by the way, we're not Jewish or gay, and, uh, in fact, we all became Christians again.

664
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,320
Yeah.

665
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,360
And, uh, and I'm a white male.

666
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,880
Uh, Christian.

667
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,380
Of Anglo descent.

668
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,080
With a family!

669
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,440
With a family, that's the most important part.

670
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,920
And I want Oliver North and Phil Graham to be president in 1996.

671
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,000
And I have this great big flag!

672
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,540
See?

673
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,220
See me?

674
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:37,960
See me?

675
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,840
I'm normal.

676
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,280
I'm normal.

677
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:40,660
I'm...

678
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,280
Everything's okay.

679
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,620
Uh...

680
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,080
It is okay, isn't it?

681
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,400
I...

682
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:48,840
I...

683
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:49,580
I...

684
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,000
They're not...

685
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,780
They're not gonna do anything to me yet, are they?

686
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,900
Oh, they're probably not until after the election.

687
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,660
I'm sure they wouldn't, uh...

688
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,620
They wouldn't do anything like...

689
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,520
Like that.

690
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,680
No, they're not.

691
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh.

692
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,320
Oh, thank you.

693
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:03,900
Thank you.

694
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,020
When we accept this, uh, nomination...

695
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,700
Ah, yes.

696
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,500
Well, it's very possible that in the next few minutes, you may be terribly, terribly

697
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,880
hurt.

698
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,660
Uh-huh.

699
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,140
Is it made here to mind?

700
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:18,380
Uh, yes.

701
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


702
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


703
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


704
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


705
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


706
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


707
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


708
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


709
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


710
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,380


711
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,160
To me, it's minor.

712
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,520
To you, I think it's gonna be extremely major.

713
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,000
No, no, please!

714
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:23,880
Please!

715
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,240
I want to know everything I possibly can about Bob.

716
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,200
But seriously, folks, no.

717
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,960
We really...

718
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,920
We really have to get down.

719
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,780
I want...

720
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,200
I want...

721
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,700
I want information.

722
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,900
I'm a news person, and I want hard...

723
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,720
Some hard facts.

724
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,700
So let's start over here.

725
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,800
Let's start over here with Gary, uh...

726
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,040
Gabofam.

727
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,420
Uh, hello.

728
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,920
Gary, why don't you, uh...

729
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,360
Just pull up your phone.

730
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


731
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


732
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


733
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


734
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


735
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


736
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


737
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


738
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


739
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,360


740
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,400
I'll pull the microphone over to you.

741
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:49,840
That's right.

742
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,720
We can edit out all this.

743
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,340
Yeah, that's right.

744
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:51,740
That's right.

745
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:51,780
Look, it's...

746
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,420
You've got Paul's microphone!

747
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,280
Where are my amplifiers?

748
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,920
What, in your view, is the Church of the Subgenius?

749
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,700
Hello, Dan.

750
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,780
Well, don't hold this poster of Bob up to the microphone.

751
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,380
He's all mixed up, don't worry.

752
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,900
What is the Church of the Subgenius?

753
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,600
Yes, that's right.

754
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,620
He's got all his religions mixed up.

755
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,600
I keep...

756
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,340
He's got your own show, doesn't he?

757
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:11,880
That's right.

758
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,300
Well, I don't think I can answer that question, because the Church of the Subgenius now is

759
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,340
such a large and complex organization.

760
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,340


761
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,340


762
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,360
That it can't be just summed up into a... into a what?

763
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,440
The last thing we saw was his maniacal grin right before he burst the sacred pig bladder.

764
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,800
But I'm staggering like a fiend!

765
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,200
You have too much money!

766
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,780
Arrgh!

767
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,260
Or even a wear.

768
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,160
But it is not a fan club.

769
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,560
It is not a fan club.

770
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,120
No, Bob's not a fan club.

771
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,680
They have taken him up to surgery.

772
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,320
Arrgh!

773
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:55,280
And that he is, according to our administrator, Mr. Blankert, he is in very serious condition.

774
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,340
Oh, no.

775
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,100
No, Bob's not a fan club.

776
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,460
It is not a fan club.

777
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,800
It is not a fan club.

778
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,980
But it is not a fan club.

779
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,380
It is not a fan club.

780
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,340
As friendly alter egos and other selves intimately confident about their possible...

781
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,220
No, no, no, wait a second.

782
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,720
No, no, okay.

783
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,860
No, like, who is Bob?

784
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,840
That's a good question.

785
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,320
Well, that...

786
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,220
Who's the saint of sales?

787
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,520
I was going to come to that.

788
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,820
Now, if it is a church...

789
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,960
It is a church.

790
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,400
It is a church.

791
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,160
Yes, the church of the subgenius is a church.

792
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:30,800
Uh-huh.

793
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,160
Well, what do you believe in?

794
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:32,900
Slack.

795
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,500
Yes.

796
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,240
Slack.

797
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,220
The rules of Slack.

798
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,840
Through Bob.

799
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,100
Bob shows us the way that we can gain slack.

800
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:38,720
Right.

801
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,600
Right.

802
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,820
And Bob is...

803
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,080
Bob is like the god figure of the church of the subgenius.

804
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,420
No, Bob's just a salesman.

805
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,000
We don't believe Bob's God.

806
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,080
I don't believe Bob's God.

807
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,200
I don't believe Bob's God.

808
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,220
What is Bob?

809
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,180
Bob's a salesman.

810
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,980
Bob was a tree or a car.

811
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,580
That's right.

812
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,940
Because he was there?

813
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,240
That kind of thing?

814
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,780
Uh-huh.

815
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,680
Like all religions, you have to have that Armageddon.

816
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,280
You have to have that coalescing event at the end, which causes everybody to send their

817
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,200
wallets in the first place.

818
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,860
Yeah, July 4th, 1999.

819
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,780
The exes come.

820
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:10,480
Don't forget that.

821
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,360
The exes come.

822
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,060
Don't forget that.

823
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,920
The exes?

824
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,640
Who are the exes?

825
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,100
The exes.

826
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,880
Oh, they kind of look like Philo, but they're much scarier.

827
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,040
They know the joke.

828
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:18,180
They know the joke.

829
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,180


830
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,180


831
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,180


832
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,180


833
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,180


834
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,700
I mean, for instance, I worked on yours on who killed Kennedy.

835
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,980
Finally found out and then worked up a little problem.

836
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,320
Why?

837
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:23,960
You did it.

838
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,140
And the exes laugh at that kind of stuff.

839
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,460
The exes laugh at just about everything.

840
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,140
They know the joke.

841
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,860
And they'll be back to remind us what the joke is.

842
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,880
Dr. Rothman, I feel an idea welling up inside you.

843
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,540
There's no joke.

844
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,460
There are a lot of subgeniuses in government.

845
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,220
We were really astounded by the amount of-

846
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,440
Several in Minnesota, too.

847
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,780
Any bad movie gives you the prophecy you need to know about what's happening.

848
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,160
Any movie that shows up between-

849
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,160


850
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,600
One in the morning and the end of our show.

851
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,080
The end of the world subgenius style is sort of like the end of the world Christian style,

852
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,200
except it's like as if all the parts have been played by really bad actors, and if all

853
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,600
the props have been done by B-movie studios.

854
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,560
It'll be much worse in that way.

855
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,420
It'll be done poorly.

856
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,700
Plus, it'll happen over and over and over again.

857
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,520
It won't just be, that's the end, and you suffer.

858
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,460
But the end will be continuous and worse and worse all the time.

859
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,620
People don't seem to understand that the end could be boring, and that's it.

860
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,940
But not for the good of the movie.

861
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,160
Not for the good of the movie.

862
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,700
Not for a subgenius, I must hasten to add.

863
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,880
You'll be able to see how they made all the flying saucer parts out of cheap little Coke

864
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,380
bottle parts and stuff like that.

865
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,140
Little colanders for the aliens' costumes.

866
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,320
It's going to be really bad.

867
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,640
So you said the end will be boring, but not for subgeniuses.

868
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:35,900
Right.

869
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,220
It'll be exciting and slackful in this case.

870
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,880
They won't be here.

871
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,540
Much rejoicing and exultant triumphance,

872
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,680
tribulations of heyday, flesh and blood,

873
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,100
repelling merrymaking-

874
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,720
On the final day,

875
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,180
you won't require the petty things you now desire.

876
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,840
Shiny cars and fancy attire,

877
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,840
microwave ovens and designer hair dryers.

878
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,380
The trapping of all the compulsive buyers,

879
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,300
a gift-wrapped box from the government liars,

880
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,460
contains suicide capsules for those who conspire

881
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,080
to stop all the madness and put out the fires

882
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,860
that glow every night from the funeral pyres.

883
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,060
It's better to stay home and plug in the wires

884
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,400
while the agents in black slash your spiritual tires

885
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,260
so you sink like a dinosaur into the mire,

886
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,860
then they pull out all your teeth with stainless steel pliers.

887
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,640
So you'll never say anything that may inspire

888
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,560
some other doomed bastard to aim a bit higher,

889
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,380
or to plot the downfall of the evil empire,

890
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,600
which passes down edicts and judgments most dire

891
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,660
upon all of the peons who work and perspire,

892
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,760
but the stench doesn't rise to their ivory spires

893
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,360
built with the bones of the slaves they acquire.

894
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,340
And if you don't do all the things that they say,

895
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,940
they'll kick in your door and jump into your bed.

896
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,600
They'll beat you until you beg to be led.

897
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,620
You'll be just like a prostitute selling your head,

898
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,480
being beaten by pimps for your daily bread.

899
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,120
You'll follow the path that they want you to tread,

900
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,440
for these are the sins for which Jesus Christ bled.

901
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,480
From the holes in his palms, the blood that he sheds,

902
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,620
stains his bone-handled pistols a beautiful red.

903
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,980
Just drink of his Kool-Aid, and then you'll be dead.

904
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,380
Thank you.

905
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,660
Lee Harvey Oswald was a subgenius.

906
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,280
Ruby refused to join.

907
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,420
So we shot him.

908
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,680
What did you say, Bob?

909
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,260
I said, good Lord.

910
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,060
Repeat! Quit your job!

911
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,240
Slacker!

912
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,920
You have been driven to the brink of insanity

913
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,860
by the conspiracy!

914
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,940
You're a slacker, Lee Harvey Oswald!

915
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,920
You're a lot closer than you even think!

916
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,580
Bob is the way! Bob is the path!

917
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,280
Believe or die!

918
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,500
No! No!

919
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,320
Oh, not the anti-Bob, no!

920
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,700
Bob is not the answer!

921
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,080
And neither is anything else!

922
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,660
True Bob! I'm not giving anything!

923
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,940
Bob tells you lies for me!

924
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,020
He's best possessed by the anti-Bob!

925
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,480
That's right, Bob is a loser!

926
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,500
Bob ripped me off from all of my slack!

927
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,320
Bob is a big boy!

928
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,820
Bob is a big boy!

929
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,020
He just takes it all for himself!

930
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,640
He can call the slack!

931
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,880
He can call the women!

932
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,560
He can call the fraud!

933
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,880
Fraud!

934
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,840
Kill Bob!

935
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,320
Kill Bob!

936
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,440
Kill Bob!

937
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:34,880
Kill Bob!

938
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


939
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,260
That was an experience he can't catch!

940
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,140
That's it!

941
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,980
Bob fakers our crucifixion

942
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,820
so he can be resurrected and become your personal savior!

943
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,580
That's right, Bob!

944
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,420
In the back of the limo right now,

945
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,000
getting hands from your girlfriend!

946
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,120
Grab your favorite gun, pull it!

947
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,600
Wack it!

948
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,760
WACK IT!

949
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,760
And now you're the tripping thing!

950
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,620
Right next to the bleeding head of Bob

951
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,240
standing far no forward!

952
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,040
That's right, the second time he has robbed

953
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,000
he'll be a slaughterer!

954
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,600
The false father J.R. Bob

955
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,800
has laid you off!

956
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,540
Bob!

957
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,260
Kill Bob!

958
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,760
Kill Bob!

959
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,080
Kill Bob!

960
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,180
Kill Bob!

961
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,860
Kill Bob!

962
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,840
Kill Bob!

963
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,680
Come out!

964
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,260
Kill Bob!

965
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,500
Kill Bob!

966
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,260
Kill Bob!

967
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,400
Kill Bob!

968
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:23,840
Haaaah!

969
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,080
Bill Bob,

970
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:26,620
kill Bob!

971
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,860
I haven'tunrecognized you any reverse,

972
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,940
I've sinned against you!

973
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,460
Please forgive me!

974
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,160
Blaze Bob!

975
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,920
Blaze Bob!

976
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Blaze Bob!

977
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,100
Blaze Bob!

978
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:41,380


979
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:41,380


980
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:41,380


981
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,540
Blaze Bob!

982
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,500
Blaze Bob!

983
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:45,060


984
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,600
Hail, kings of feedback.

985
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,000
Hail, kings of feedback.

986
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,240
Yes, friends, and oh, here's my background music.

987
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,300
It's so good to have background music when you're taking the show out and doing credits and so forth.

988
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,560
And what did we hear there?

989
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:32,980
Why, we heard some more of Dr. Legume, the evil Dr. Katahdin Legume,

990
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,060
preaching in a coffeehouse somewhere in Philadelphia.

991
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,700
On the end of the world there.

992
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:51,900
We heard also the KPFA more than an hour, less than a show, show doctors being interviewed by someone else in 1983.

993
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,580
Puzzling evidence, Gary Gabrog, Fran, Mobius Rex, and...

994
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,120
I'm rendered speechless, friends.

995
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:10,440
Actually, I'll tell you why I'm rendered speechless, because I don't really want to be doing this show right now.

996
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,860
I want to go back to my computer, where everything is controlled.

997
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,320
It's all mine.

998
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,920
I can just...

999
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,480
And, friends, if you would like to get some more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1000
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,080
please write for that free information.

1001
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,560
Just drop us a postcard.

1002
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,340
Drop Bob a postcard.

1003
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,220
Yes, you can write to Bob.

1004
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:49,880
You see, you know, you get tired of doing these shows, partly because you get tired of saying Bob in that smarmy way.

1005
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,060
I guess it's good you say Bob.

1006
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,760
I know you say it, brave Bob.

1007
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,320
We got more musical endings on this show.

1008
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,620
Anyway, yeah, that pencil to write to is...

1009
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,080
Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1010
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,680
That's P.O. Box 140306.

1011
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:15,160
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1012
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,880
That's in beautiful, beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1013
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,480
Isn't it so pretty out there right now?

1014
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:25,680
Why, there's grapefruit the size of black pickup trucks falling from the sky.

1015
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,040
And the streets are a bit slick.

1016
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,800
And those black pickup trucks don't know how slick it is.

1017
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,320
And they're trying to get me again.

1018
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,260
They were.

1019
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,940
I was just on my way to the print shop to get the ad stickers printed up.

1020
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,120
And the free information.

1021
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,660
About...

1022
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,760
About the Church of the Subgenius.

1023
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,280
Which you can also get at Box 140306.

1024
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,560
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1025
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,680
Where you can learn how to get hold of the book of the subgenius.

1026
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,060
And how to join in this mystic fellowship.

1027
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,120
Yes, dear friends.

1028
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,580
This mystic fellowship of mutants, misfits, and disbelievers.

1029
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,900
And those who believe in Bob.

1030
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,400
And in killing Bob.

1031
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,460
To prove that it really is Bob.

1032
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,220
So...

1033
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,360
Why don't you go ahead and take the plunge this time, friends?

1034
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,540
Go ahead.

1035
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,700
Let us have your real world address.

1036
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,100
What's to lose?

1037
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,540
A little time?

1038
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,700
Hurt your ego a little bit, baby?

1039
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,900
You probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now.

1040
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,420
So, that's no big deal.

1041
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,420
So, why not?

1042
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,040
So, why not?

1043
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,260
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

1044
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,080
I don't know.

1045
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,180
You don't know.

1046
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,660
You don't know.

1047
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:39,600
You don't know.

1048
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,200
And you will never know.

1049
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,300
You have signed the application.

1050
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,600
You do have the kit.

1051
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,840
None of those things are important.

1052
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,720
But there is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.

1053
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,220
And you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives and

1054
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,140
uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is going to say about it.

1055
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,800
Because nobody else is going to pay your bills for you.

1056
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,660
Why not?

1057
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,820
You don't know.

1058
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,120
And you will never know.

1059
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,000
And who knows?

1060
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,740
Just maybe.

1061
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:15,960
Just maybe.

1062
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,300
You could have one of the biggest...

1063
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,680
I don't know.

1064
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,180
But even more important.

1065
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,640
You don't know.

1066
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,220
And you will never know.

1067
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,480
And you will never know.

1068
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,360
Just maybe.

1069
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,940
You're in for a new and exciting experience.

1070
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,260
You have signed the application.

1071
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,640
You've probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now.

1072
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,140
So that's no big deal.

1073
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,620
And that last little bit there, friends.

1074
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:09,240
A classic collage edit by Puzzling Evidence, the great Dee Woodman Atwell, first and foremost

1075
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,240
the killer of Bob.

1076
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:16,640
And it makes my eyes water listening to that old cut whenever I do.

1077
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,740
Ah yes, The Harvest.

1078
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,380
What are the different ways to be annoying?

1079
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,420
One, the artsy approach.

1080
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,020
Dress in black.

1081
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,160
Wear a goatee, even if you're a female.

1082
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,240
Write a poem about everything you see.

1083
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,160
Everything.

1084
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,860
It doesn't mean that every time you see a beautiful sunset, you should write a heartfelt sonnet.

1085
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,500
It means that you should read your heartfelt sonnet to everyone you see, whether you know them or not.

1086
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,440
When you're in a bookstore, recite clever literary limericks to the cashier.

1087
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,480
A good first line would be,

1088
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,740
Sit in coffee shops and draw sketches of other patrons.

1089
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,560
Then insist on making the sketches personal gifts.

1090
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,260
This comes naturally to most people.

1091
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,700
Complain about everything, even stuff that doesn't exist.

1092
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,280
You're only saying hello because you think you have to, aren't you?

1093
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,340
Three, the clever approach.

1094
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,700
Laugh at inappropriate times.

1095
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,800
Did I ever watch television?

1096
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,360
For that matter, am I ever doing anything?

1097
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,280
Oh, you still read books?

1098
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,360
How quaint.

1099
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,020
I don't read anything written after 950 B.C.

1100
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,360
Claim that the New York Times crossword puzzle has a misspelling in it.

1101
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,920
Then, just when you've convinced everyone of your intellectual pensions,

1102
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,500
change directions violently.

1103
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,180
That Mike and Maddie show really speaks to me.

1104
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,140
What if I get on my own nerves?

1105
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,300
That means you're doing it wrong.

1106
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,240
Ideally,

1107
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,420
you're doing it wrong.
