1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:10,380
This is Philo. Are you there? Are you just hiding out in the back? Are you really here back? Are you still in Corpus?

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,660
Hey, what's the deal?

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,420
Um, call me at the Hawthorne Suites.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,000
At the telephone number is... forgot it.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
So, bye.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,760
This is Philo.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,520
And I'm asking you please to stay away from Bob on the Hour of Slack.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,300
Wherever it is.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,820
And now, the subgenius Hour of Slack!

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:14,140
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:27,860
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

12
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,980
The show has been known...

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,020
The show has been known to curdle dairy products when waved over the container thereof.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,400
The show should not be played in the vicinity of card-carrying Christians as spontaneous combustions have been known to occur.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,480
The show can cause tropical fish to pop when waved over the tank.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,300
The show sterilizes dogs and house cats within a three block radius.

17
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,940
The show removes rust, earwax and questionable stains of passion.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,360
The show should not be tossed aside casually. It should be thrown with great force.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,980
The show should not be tossed aside casually. It should be thrown with great force.

20
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,200
The show will temporarily fix flat tires, heat up burritos and either take in or let out the waistband of pants upon demand.

22
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,480
The show can locate lost car keys.

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,000
The show will drive salesmen, noxious relatives and Jehovah's Witnesses from the front door.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,940
The show needs no feeding, batteries or litter box, but it does like to be stroked from time to time.

25
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,300
The show may bite occasionally, but the bites are non-poisonous.

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,300
In fact, they may even be enjoyable if you're feeling low.

27
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,680
The show throws a really mean fastball.

28
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,400
The show can cure acne, dandruff and headaches when waved over the suffering party, but the show has no power over cases involving probate.

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,400
The show cures impotence, relieves symptoms of PMS and will slow but not halt tumor growth in white lab rats.

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,420
The show will change traffic lights to your advantage.

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,200
The show bends over and takes it like a man.

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,860
The show should not be left on the dashboard during hot weather.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
The show contains no PCBs, no flashlights, no flashlights.

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,280


35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,320
The show is a perfect example of the power of the show.

36
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,440
The show can be taken internally in complete safety, but should gastrointestinal distress occur, the show will act as its own emetic.

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,700
The show can dance like James Brown upon request.

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,380
The show will squirm around, make rude noises and generally embarrass you if you try to take it to church.

39
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,260
The show hasn't matured enough to handle a BB gun safely.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,760
The show likes enthusiasm, but will snap your neck if you throw beer bottles at the stage.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,260
The show was just recently handled by the National Association of the People's Republic of America.

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


43
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


44
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,700
The show is a perfect example of the power of the show.

45
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:35,780
The show can be taken in a way that will make you feel like you're in a church.

46
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,780


47
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,220
The show can kiss it and make it all better.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:45,640
The show is over 21 years of age and can be legally taken across state lines, although it will expect dinner and a movie first.

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,620
The show can be stopped if necessary, but deadly force may be required.

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,720
The show refuses to vote, but will complain about the results all the same.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,240
The show is courteous to all, but respects no one.

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,760
The show can wear a tuxedo and a big red rubber nose and still look cool.

53
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,540
Above all, the show is the show.

54
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,980
Okay. Okay.

55
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,300
Hi. Hi. Okay.

56
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,660
Here's one now, stridulating from tree to tree.

57
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,240
Is it really stridulating?

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,980
Boy, this is a triumphant moment.

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,620
I've often wanted to see one of these amazing creatures.

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,440
Their eyes actually flash as they stridulate.

61
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,640
Look at it go.

62
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,860
Let's put the little directional mic right next to it and see what it has to say.

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
Gosh, isn't nature wonderful?

64
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,040
Just listen to this little fellow.

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,440
If we could only understand him, communicate in some fashion, just what would he have to tell us?

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,140
But he's telling me it's the secret, the wisdom of the ages.

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,640
I see it all. It's within my grasp.

68
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,560
I... I... It's... It's gone.

69
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,420
It's gone.

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,080
What?

71
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,440
Come on in.

72
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,500
It's unlocked.

73
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,300
It's them.

74
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,040
An SNL crisis costing over a trillion dollars,

75
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,660
a soaring crime rate, unemployment, homelessness,

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,100
racial tensions flaring,

77
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,220
and a deep recession in the works.

78
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,240
You're finally losing what little independence means.

79
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,520
The people may have had.

80
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,180
But here...

81
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,460
Ah, yes, dear friends, but here, but here, everything is...

82
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,320
Well, we like to think it's slack.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,100
Well, that's what we like to think.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,900
Ah, feel that... feel that slack coming up and rising.

85
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,900
Yes, it was kind of spotty sounding slack there in the background, isn't it?

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,380
Ugh.

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,700
And, uh...

88
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,580
Oh, friends, we have a trippy show tonight for you terrible teenagers.

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,940
This is a good one to wear headphones for.

90
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,380
Oh, in stereo.

91
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,920
It's such lovely, hideous stereo.

92
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,820
Well, what we've heard so far, a little bit of Johnny Flash here in Dallas

93
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,380
with his concordant...

94
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,190
Concordant opposition and fountain of slack.

95
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,910
Little clips of that which will be popping up through the show.

96
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,130
By the way, thanks to Johnny Flash for sending that tape of last week's show.

97
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,770
Uh-huh.

98
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,190
We're trying to get our act together here.

99
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,830
In fact...

100
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,050
In fact, uh, yeah, we need a lawyer is what we need

101
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,570
if we're ever gonna get our act together.

102
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,950
Ugh.

103
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,890
And lawyers can call the station, dear friends.

104
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,650
Uh, not just lawyers, but doctors, too.

105
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,730
Yes, doctors, come on in.

106
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,470
Come into the show, and we'll lay out a patient for you,

107
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,430
somebody you can cut upon.

108
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,650
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

109
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,610
Yeah, this show's, um...

110
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,710
Yeah, this one's cut to pieces all right.

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,110
Also, what we heard there was some sedition commission,

112
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,910
a little Independence Day fit,

113
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,330
and some KPFA subgenius land,

114
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,370
and, uh, Hell Pope Huey from there in Arkansas.

115
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,410
Ah, yes, more of those things coming up.

116
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,150
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

117
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,830
Oh, we have some sad news, though.

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,690
Here in Dallas, the Little Dubrogue-Fran Coffee Clench...

119
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,910
Clatch is shut down.

120
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,990
No more Friday nights at the...

121
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,550
the, uh, Little Dubrogue-Fran's.

122
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,690
Too bad. I never did make it by there.

123
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,050
Too much book.

124
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,690
Had to do too much book.

125
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,290
Yes, your Reverend Ivan Stang has gotten himself

126
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,230
into a deadline crunch

127
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,310
meaner than mongolfofofo

128
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,410
on a bad day.

129
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,810
Uh...

130
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,250
But, but there is good news.

131
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,610
Yes, there is good news, and I can...

132
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,690
I should switch to this other music for this.

133
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,970
Well, I don't know if this is good.

134
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,170
Actually, this is a tragedy,

135
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,430
because, friends, suicides are up 500%,

136
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,130
according to the, uh...

137
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,470
Uh...

138
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,130
I don't know what newspaper this is from,

139
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,510
but...but it's from some newspaper,

140
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,250
so it must be true.

141
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,730
Bad trip, it says here.

142
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,150
LSD, like flu, sweeps across Europe.

143
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,110
Ah...

144
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,550
Ah...

145
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,450
By Keaton James, special correspondent.

146
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,350
An LSD-like flu is sweeping Europe

147
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,330
and will soon cross the Atlantic to the United States,

148
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,530
threatening the health and sanity

149
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,210
of millions of innocent Americans

150
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,150
who don't have the psychological strength or stamina

151
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,070
to endure a full-blown acid trip.

152
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,910
Doctors say the virus is chemically similar

153
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,550
to lysergic acid, diethylamide,

154
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,850
the, uh, famed, uh, hallucinogen of the 1960s,

155
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,170
and actually causes victims to shiver,

156
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,490
sneeze, shake, and hallucinate like crazy,

157
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,270
sometimes for weeks on end.

158
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,070
I had fever, chills, aches, pains,

159
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,310
and talked to God himself,

160
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,650
said one French victim.

161
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,330
I also found out that trees can walk.

162
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,070
If that victim's experience with the flu virus

163
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,350
sounds extreme, consider this.

164
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,590
A staggering 2,000 people in Romania

165
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,830
were hospitalized for treatment of, quote,

166
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,470
severe psychological trauma

167
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,450
less than 24 hours after they came down

168
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,910
with the so-called acid flu.

169
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,890
The situation was even worse in Germany,

170
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,550
where suicides jumped 500%

171
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,910
during the six weeks that the virus was active there.

172
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,690
And you can see those Germans

173
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,290
jumping in the background there.

174
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,170
There are literally thousands of flu viruses

175
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,950
that mankind has to deal with,

176
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,190
but this is clearly the worst.

177
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,850
I'm sorry, French virologist,

178
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,110
Dr. Jean-Michel Clement,

179
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,810
told reporters.

180
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,530
I have no doubt that people with previous LSD experience

181
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,570
might enjoy this sickness, he added,

182
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,730
but millions of other people

183
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,690
don't want nothing to do with it.

184
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,430
When they get these symptoms, they are terrified,

185
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,050
and some of them quite rightly think

186
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,370
that they are going insane.

187
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,950
I advise my patients to take antibiotics,

188
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,330
get plenty of rest,

189
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,650
and if the hallucinations get too intense,

190
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,930
lock themselves in their rooms, in their homes,

191
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,670
until the visions and delusions end.

192
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,510
German banker Karl Wolf

193
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,170
came down with the flu on December 14

194
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,550
and suffered terribly for five years.

195
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,090
Five hellish weeks.

196
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,410
At one point, he had a sustained fever of 105

197
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,190
and thought his wife of 11 years was a squid.

198
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,130
Crazy doesn't begin to describe what I was feeling,

199
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,210
said the 35-year-old Berliner.

200
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,670
I argued economics theory with a ball of lint

201
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,410
and imagined that my pet cat

202
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,310
controlled the entire universe.

203
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,010
Sometimes I was overcome by a terrific, unexplained fear,

204
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,170
but at other times I was perfectly at peace with myself

205
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,030
and the universe, he added.

206
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,050
Nobody knows where the virus came from,

207
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,610
but Clermont suspects that it originated in Russia

208
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,890
and spread west.

209
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,910
We viruses are constantly changing and mutating,

210
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,570
so we're never really sure what's going to turn up next,

211
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,250
said the expert.

212
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:46,290


213
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,970
Fortunately, this LSD virus seems to have run its course in Europe.

214
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,990
The next battleground will be the United States.

215
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,290
Oh, oui, oui.

216
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,990
Doo-doo.

217
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,550
But here, it's Papa Joe Martin.

218
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,130
And Bob's down.

219
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,410
It's them.

220
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,810
It's them.

221
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,490
We come now to that portion of foundation doctrine known as slack.

222
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,890
Let us meditate the next few minutes

223
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,610
on how this mystery to many subgeni

224
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,870
can have a more profound effect on our lives.

225
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,690
It is written that true slack is by definition indescribable.

226
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,770
If you had to ask what it is, you've probably never had it.

227
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,890
True slack, though, can be loosely sensed

228
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,330
as the accidental randomness of the multiverse,

229
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,850
or as a new continuum.

230
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,350
True slack can also sometimes be bought.

231
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,650
False slack, on the other hand,

232
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,070
is easily available for money.

233
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,670
It's those street drugs cut with latrino,

234
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,210
that cheap wine in the log box.

235
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,310
That's the only after-sense.

236
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,190
To describe how I got into trouble,

237
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,930
I could say that by using psychedelic drugs,

238
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,330
I became tuned in

239
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,230
on the network of neurological signals

240
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,850
and cellular wisdoms

241
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,990
that radiate hundreds of millions per second

242
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,210
within my body.

243
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,230
Hey, Eddie.

244
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,610
Bad acid party at Headband's house.

245
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,190
Yeah, Headband said he'd be there.

246
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,110
Do you think Bad Acid-y will be there?

247
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,610
Hey, man, I think Peace wants to kick your...

248
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,330
...Band's ass.

249
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,790
Hey, Peace child, you wanna buy a hundred lot of weed?

250
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,650
I mean, I guess you could call it a pretty cool party.

251
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,470
I mean, we were just six people at the emergency room,

252
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,130
and...

253
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,110
I mean, Devil-san with his hand

254
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,970
started talking to Bad Acid-freak-out,

255
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,290
and Bad Acid-freak-out started just beating his head over.

256
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,210
For the last six years,

257
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,990
I have taken the void out of my mind,

258
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,330
into my head,

259
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,330
into my cells,

260
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,450
over 300 times.

261
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,670
Oh, wow, Headband's just boob-dee-ding over on the wall.

262
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,370
What's going on, man?

263
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,850
Look at him faggrapain with his puke.

264
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,510
Isn't that cool?

265
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,910
I mean, he just beat his head against the wall

266
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:30,070
until his brains came out and his ears all night, even.

267
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,190
You wanna stop a papyrus, man, or wait, man?

268
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,690
Well, that just trips me out.

269
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,230
I mean,

270
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,890
when Peace just cut his arms and legs off

271
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,070
and just started death-tripping

272
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,650
on the house's dance floor,

273
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,010
I just gunged on him.

274
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,230
He laid him out like a peace sign

275
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,610
and just sort of wallowed around us.

276
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,810
I mean, unless six people go to the morgue,

277
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,450
I don't really call it a party.

278
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,670
Hey, man, this party's like weed stock.

279
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,790
Look at that.

280
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,190
The man with the long hair is laughing.

281
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,750
Yeah.

282
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,650
Yeah, like...

283
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,470
Yeah, man.

284
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,090
Yeah.

285
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,390
Yeah, like...

286
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,210
Yeah.

287
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,750
Yeah, I mean, like, you know, like death-tripping.

288
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,650
Yeah.

289
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,370
Yeah.

290
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,950
What a party.

291
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,750
From the clear, open sky to no sky

292
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,690
except a tiny pistol,

293
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,530
a total assaulter.

294
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,850
And I went down to the lowest level of all.

295
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,350
I had never been at that level before.

296
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,710
No one ever asked to go there.

297
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,070
And when the door opened, I understood why.

298
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,230
There was every conceivable kind of device

299
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,950
and a big sound that said,

300
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,350
help yourself, try them out.

301
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,970
And, you know, I was in the middle of a

302
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:08,970


303
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,470
And I remember the people always asking me,

304
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,710
and I always say, you know, you go look,

305
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,150
and then you come back and tell me.

306
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,170
Nobody ever comes back and tells me.

307
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,190
Eddie's mattress said she needs a lie.

308
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
That'd make a cool tablecloth.

309
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,030
Yeah.

310
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,110
I mean, we were just, it's all too sicking out on you.

311
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,870
Huh?

312
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,210
We could, like, throw that neck in jail.

313
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,210


314
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,210


315
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,210


316
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,830
I mean, there's a chick on there.

317
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,610
Maybe Junebug crawled up on there.

318
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,170
He's Junebugging?

319
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,930
Is he crazy?

320
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,830
I mean, we were just, like, metronomes.

321
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,130
What's he doing walking around with his joint in his hand?

322
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,870
I mean, if we went any, I mean, if we went any further,

323
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,630
that party would have been six people in an emergency room.

324
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,510
Is Eddie still here, man?

325
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,670
I'm gonna get in on this finger paint.

326
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,170
Who made you this-

327
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,450
Hugh.

328
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,530
I mean, we were cliquey.

329
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,870
Danny, you know.

330
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,070
I think you gave me too much of your life.

331
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,170
I used to stay up shootin' a that friend from watching,

332
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,430
knowing that you would walk into work here like that

333
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:18,430


334
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,230
And I wait and I'm like,

335
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,330
What a happy pager are you?

336
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:21,330


337
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,310
and it'll come to you sometimes,

338
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,390
and he's like theчик you got on the right hand side of his

339
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,510
hand.

340
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,050
Oh, man.

341
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,410
It was just like a real scene, you know what I mean?

342
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,790
And once you've been through the egg beater, you're never the same.

343
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,370
As long as we're getting a bit technical,

344
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,810
like the way we've immersed women and children,

345
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,510
can perceive higher frequencies of sound than most men.

346
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,130
This demonstration consists of a continuous sweep of audio frequencies

347
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,870
from 50 cycles to past the limit of audibility.

348
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,650
First, 50 cycles to 500 cycles.

349
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,250
500 cycles to 5,000 cycles.

350
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,810
5,000.

351
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,750
Hey!

352
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,270
Hey!

353
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,710
All the dogs and cats.

354
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,350
Hey, don't kick me!

355
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,430
Don't kick me!

356
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,210
Don't kick me!

357
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,650
Don't kick me!

358
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,330
Don't kick me!

359
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,330
It was an inferno.

360
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,990
We were just like helpless and defeat.

361
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,050
Oh, man!

362
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,170
I mean, I was just like totally gripping my bed until I was just like dizzy.

363
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,310
I mean, it was just like totally...

364
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,350
Bad-ass party!

365
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,770
Sort of scoped this chick out.

366
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,430
It's kind of a bad-ass party!

367
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:21,810
It's like a run.

368
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,150
It looks like a run.

369
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,710
Over extinguishers

370
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:25,750
and I gotaniu sıkable ici.

371
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,030
Very strange!

372
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:46,550
Too much of shit!

373
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,990
10,000 to 15,000.

374
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,870
But why this break?

375
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:53,350
You...

376
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,350


377
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,350


378
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,350


379
00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:01,750
It's a voice that says I want more than I have right now.

380
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,670
15,000 cycles to infinity.

381
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,330
I mean, she was just so far around.

382
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,830
She's a little bit like Veda.

383
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,990
Space cats who give their food, you know.

384
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,510
I mean, I was like digging her with a steam shovel.

385
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,050
I mean, she was like over there in her groove,

386
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,330
and I was over here in my groove.

387
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,630
I mean, she was just like leopard skin mini skirt with a halter top in it.

388
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,670
I mean, she was like over there in her groove,

389
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,570
and we were over there in our groove.

390
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,930
I mean, I mean, she was so heavy.

391
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:50,970
I was just like dripping.

392
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,010
I was drowning in my own drool.

393
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,190
I mean, I just started sliding over into her groove, dig.

394
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,970
I mean, it was just like completely early 60s,

395
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,290
surfer Billy guitar solo, you know.

396
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,550
I mean, we just like jumped on a boom, chaka-boom, chaka-boom-boom-boom,

397
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,150
rode it to the guitar solo, and then got off the floor.

398
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,930
I mean, what's wrong? Don't you think this is groovy?

399
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,270
I mean, later we after-seen it, my pad,

400
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,330
and I just like dated him all night.

401
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,810
It was the ninjiest.

402
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,050
Hey, get Annie's mattress.

403
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,230
I mean, we were just like flashbacking on the present.

404
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,650
Hey, babe, don't you think this is groovy?

405
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,870
I was like trying to, you know, race him away.

406
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,050
Don't you think this is groovy?

407
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,450
But we were just totally, totally present.

408
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,570
Don't you think this is groovy?

409
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:50,110
I mean, it was just like, you know, they're like, you know, I mean, just like totally, like,

410
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,730
you know what I mean, like, they were like,

411
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,830
Hey, don't you think this is groovy?

412
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,050
I mean, don't you think this is the ninjiest?

413
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:07,230
I mean, don't you think this is just like the six people tried to commit suicide in one nightiest?

414
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,430
Man, don't you think this is groovy?

415
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,170
It was a trip as far as I was concerned.

416
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,350
Hey, Annie, man, don't you think this is groovy?

417
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,590
I mean, I don't care if six people tried to commit suicide.

418
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,750
I thought it was good.

419
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,930
I mean, they were just like french fries.

420
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,490
We were crispy frigged.

421
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,670
We were baked.

422
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,170
We were charbroiled.

423
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,610
We were barbecued.

424
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,270
I mean, we were like maximum metro wasted.

425
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,130
I mean, you can wallow in it.

426
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,990
I mean, you can grovel to it.

427
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,590
I mean, and when the band just hit a smooth groove,

428
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,070
and we just rode it home until midnight.

429
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,570
I mean, don't you think this is groovy?

430
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,270
I mean, we were just like, don't you think this is groovy-ing on it?

431
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,490
Don't you think this is groovy?

432
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,150
Tired of the same old vacation spots

433
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,890
where there's always a bill the length of the Dead Sea Scrolls,

434
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,670
yet the beds feel like slabs of granite,

435
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,730
and there's only a bleeding lizard in the bidet?

436
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,110
Wouldn't go to Euro Disney if they paid you

437
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,530
because the French talk funny and pee in the street besides?

438
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,810
Can't even drive the kids to the store,

439
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,250
much less to bloody Florida,

440
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,450
without giving them the Homer Simpson headlock?

441
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,130
Well, we have the solution you've always dreamed of.

442
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,990
Toss away that raveled sleeve of care

443
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,330
with a refreshing dip in that molten big top

444
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,490
we modestly like to call hella.

445
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,050
It's the vacation hot spot that really puts some weight behind the name.

446
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,710
Just imagine the slides you'll have to show your friends.

447
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,850
Visit with many of your old childhood enemies,

448
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,410
former bosses and girlfriends who never made the cut.

449
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,730
See Elvis, Jimmy, Janice, Keith Moon, and Spike Jonze

450
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,230
perform in the ultimate band that's too hot for heaven.

451
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,690
Incredible warm-up act by Sam Kinison.

452
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,310
Set up cut-rate deals with a variety of demons

453
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,790
who'll be all too glad to give your current tormentors

454
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,310
a taste of what awaits them below.

455
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,410
Enjoy lava smoothies while basking in our really hot hot tubs.

456
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,730
Take your candy with the nightly videos of the top 1,000 really juicy sins of the week.

457
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,950
Into the demonic sock hop dance contests and burn up the floor for real.

458
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,990
Spit and belch in a custom competition beyond your wildest nightmares.

459
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,950
Watch your pal Bob arm wrestle Satan three falls out of four.

460
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,710
See the guilty forced to watch decades of their grandparents' own movies

461
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,850
over and over and over again.

462
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,590
Play red hot poker pogo with the dams.

463
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,290
They'll never forget.

464
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,270
They'll never see you as a wimp again.

465
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,850
Once you ski the lake of fire barefooted.

466
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,870
Yes, once you've visited lovely hell.

467
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,370
The kids will never ask you to take them anywhere again.

468
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,510
And when you leave, we'll punch your ticket

469
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,470
so you can do comparison shopping in heaven.

470
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,630
It's the vacation deal of the millennium.

471
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,290
You haven't lived until you learn what it's like when you die.

472
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,110
So hustle on down to your local satanic tabernacle

473
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,310
and get in line for your turn to visit beautiful hell.

474
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,270
Hell, hell.

475
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,550
Family discounts available.

476
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,030
Ha, cha, cha, cha, cha.

477
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,670
Tell the subdivision of Prince of Darkness Media.

478
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,350
A hobo came out of the alley and he became very frightened.

479
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,030
He thought the fist was threatening him.

480
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,070
And I brought the fist along to my home.

481
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,750
I helped the kid with the VC at

482
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,330
Lake.

483
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:54,810
And he did it.

484
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:54,810


485
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:54,870
He got the mountain on his head and he's talking about

486
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,870


487
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,870


488
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,870


489
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,870


490
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,650
Singin' about the music that's a team because it'sไร.

491
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:03,010
Singin' about the music that's a team because it's Además.

492
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,370
Singin' about the music that's a team because it's básico.

493
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,090
Singin'?

494
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,170
See how easy it is.

495
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:07,990
Dance and keep sharp eye on the music.

496
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,730
That's ass.

497
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:08,970
She came from Argo RJ.

498
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,010


499
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,170
Go somewhere else.

500
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:09,650
Go.

501
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,790
Unworthy lowlife is not good enough for you to talk to what I'd rather do this short on collateral

502
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,950
This lowlife is God as far as you concerned. Hey, hey lighten up

503
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,810
Let the kids some slack

504
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,910
Who the hell are you talking to son

505
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:33,030
Your egos writing checks your body can't cash. Oh, you got five minutes to store your gears get moving

506
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:46,950
Oh

507
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,050
Today

508
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,950
We don't want to but the people of our people's no doubt

509
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,110
They've already destroyed a third of our country

510
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,270
Oh

511
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,910
He told you those fight back for today

512
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:19,350
The earthmen now will have to take their own medicine. That's right

513
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,650
or I will unleash

514
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:47,210
the power of Satan

515
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,950
Satan is killing all the individualism

516
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,630
Satan wants a large government so he believes in socialism

517
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,230
The city of God there is only private property

518
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,950
Do fences get in the way?

519
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,910
Well they may have need for fences

520
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,550
Kill Satan, slay Satan

521
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,070
Kill who?

522
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,210
Kill children of Satan

523
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,230
And old perverts

524
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,630
Kill the children that they rape

525
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,790
They have been tainted

526
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,270
Yes, no, Satan we're infusing

527
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,090
They wrecked it

528
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,090


529
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,090


530
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,830
They're evil

531
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,730
They're depraved

532
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,510
They're wretched

533
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,130
Satan grew by 282% last year

534
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,930
One and double

535
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,610
That's sad

536
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,030
What will we do?

537
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,430
We will sort them out

538
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,170
Kill them

539
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:18,850
Forgive them

540
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,230
Kill

541
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,850
Forgive

542
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,290
Kill

543
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:20,950
Forgive

544
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,510
Kill

545
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,070
Forgive

546
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,110
Kill

547
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,110


548
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,430
Kill

549
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,710
All of us look decrepit

550
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,350
278% more people worship Satan

551
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,050
He is in our schools now

552
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,630
6XX is seen everywhere all over our school

553
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,050
All over our schools

554
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,970
Today kids don't just smoke crack

555
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,570
They ran

556
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,330
They hang themselves to be cool

557
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,070
You have to drink some water and you'll be fine

558
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,950
They jump into a noose to be accepted as a kid

559
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,310
Satan enters through music of the devil

560
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,390
The government is Satan

561
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,190
Police lock themselves in a circle

562
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,670
Around a burning fire

563
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,910
They start laughing crazy mad like some kind of satanic ritual

564
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,790
And these weeds they burn

565
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,850
And the pagans, are they ritualists?

566
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,870
Agents of the devil

567
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,370
Of Satan

568
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,250
Through who?

569
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,990
Through the government

570
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,150
Through the dead

571
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,790
They're pagans

572
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,570
They die

573
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,250
They kill

574
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,030
They're Christians

575
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,650
Kill Satan

576
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,590
You killed him

577
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,830
The Christian army needs you

578
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,970
Jesus Christ is looking for a few good men

579
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,650
Matilda and I are turned into LOVE

580
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,050
Everyone's had their춘

581
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,750
Anyone who stirs up evil

582
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,750


583
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,750


584
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,870
It all starts with listen

585
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,590
Don't talk about you

586
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:22,590


587
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:22,590


588
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:22,590


589
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:22,590


590
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,130
2

591
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,670
Some

592
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,710
Said

593
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,670
Who am in that place

594
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,290
Holy

595
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,090
God

596
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,210
Worient

597
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,210


598
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,210


599
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,210


600
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,530
Legs shit

601
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,730
Pigs

602
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,630
Plus

603
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:35,850
florio

604
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,590
Jesus Christ is looking for a few good men.

605
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,010
Join the victorious army.

606
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,970
God will be our general. Let's pray.

607
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:55,430
Lord God, please help us maim an entire generation of people of Satan.

608
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,910
Let them die.

609
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,830
Let us kill.

610
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,270
For you alone we will wash our hands in the blood of the enemy.

611
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,470
For me. For Holy One. For Jews. For Christians. For God.

612
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,450
For all souls who have stayed to be joined and judged and punished.

613
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,730
Stay to wit this blood on your daughter's face.

614
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,350
Die right now, Eden.

615
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,010
Jesus is not the answer.

616
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,130
No one may not die here.

617
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,330
Jesus is not the answer.

618
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,470
Subgenius Film Furies Unlimited presents the horror epic of the decade.

619
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,130
Attack of the 50-foot.

620
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,470
Bob.

621
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,750
The sales guru supreme strikes the earth like a colossus.

622
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,330
Bringing ruin to the pink and delight to the twisted.

623
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,130
The age of normalcy sees the curtain drawn over its black and despairing works.

624
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,010
As the age of slack hits the world stage like the tractor pull of the gods.

625
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,590
Attack of the 50-foot.

626
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:48,790
Bob.

627
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,730
He's the cool gone daddy-o from the diva dimensions.

628
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,850
The zoot-zoot-zabber that put the flat feet on the lost generation.

629
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,590
The hip-hop bishop of beat.

630
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,750
He's the one who taught Minnie to mooch, Groucho to grouch, and Long Dong Silver to act.

631
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,070
He built the ruby slippers.

632
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,090
Flew the Hindenburg.

633
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,230
Blindfolded and made of mint from the Peterpump.

634
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,250
He brought MIT to a grinding halt.

635
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,290
He made them think they had to laugh or else.

636
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,970
Attack of the 50-foot.

637
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,210
Bob.

638
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,970
See the horrifying spectacle of foot glands being turned inside out.

639
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,730
See Connie sit on Doug's face full force.

640
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,370
See Dobbs forcibly insert telephone poles where the sun don't shine.

641
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,630
See the Bills crush Reverend Stang's workshop into kindling.

642
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,070
Witness Rush Limbaugh's prostate suddenly blow up to the size of an army surplus weather balloon.

643
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,110
What a riot.

644
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,670
Attack of the 50-foot.

645
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:32,970
Bob.

646
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,910
See stubborn adherents to creaky fundamentalist religions pop like cheap balloons as the Uber

647
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,430
Dobbs waves his hellish pipe over their enclaves.

648
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,790
See the beast that made dogs laugh out loud.

649
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,530
Smell the gorge-clogging leftovers from the consumption of the normals.

650
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,150
Be delightfully overwhelmed by the awe-inspiring aroma that emanates from the pipe of Dobbs

651
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,710
as society willingly crumbles before his mighty psychic stench.

652
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,290
Attack of the 50-foot.

653
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,550
Bob.

654
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,530
See David Letterman get spanked senseless for refusing to let the church on his pathetic little show.

655
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,250
See the froth flow like new.

656
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,930
See the milk and honey rushing into a peyote smoothie.

657
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:11,710
Witness a tube of K-Y jelly the size of the Goodyear blimp during the brain-blistering, weightless orbital pleasure dome orgy scene.

658
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:17,390
Watch Bob struggle for a word to describe the precise moment at which a big, healthy dog Jake turns white.

659
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,030
Have more fun than you thought inhumanly possible.

660
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:27,390
Yes, even Freddy Krueger and Herschel Gordon Lewis cringe under Jeffrey Dahmer's kitchen table at the first sign of Attack of the 50-foot.

661
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:27,750
Bob.

662
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:28,950
Fun fit for children.

663
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,930
Deadly to house pets when played on the VCR.

664
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,710
However, it clears up constipation.

665
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:38,390
Sometimes violently in so-called adults and causes gales of unfettered laughter in real subgeniuses.

666
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,950
Attack of the 50-foot.

667
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,150
Bob.

668
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,130
You've got to smell it to believe it.

669
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:48,370
Gene Siskel gives it a hearty four pipes up and then slapped that disgusting smarmy slug Roger Ebert right out of his chair.

670
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,710
Wow, I always wanted someone to do that.

671
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,090
Attack of the 50-foot.

672
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,350
Bob.

673
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,210
You'd rather sit in a hot church wearing tight shoes for six hours than miss it.

674
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,330
Rated S for slap.

675
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,690
Opens everywhere July 5th, 1998.

676
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,610
Yeah.

677
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:00,890
Yeah.

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,570
Yeah.

00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:01,930
Yeah.

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,270
Yeah.

681
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,270


682
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:02,990
Yeah.

683
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,350
Yeah.

684
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,890
Yeah.

685
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,490
Yeah.

686
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:15,930
Yeah.

687
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


688
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


689
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


690
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


691
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


692
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


693
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:15,930


694
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,450
Well it sounds like you've got this machine running on you.

695
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:23,910
Rated S for all wrestler.

696
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,910


697
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,970
But I feel like I should be in the slag avatars.

698
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:23,970


699
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:23,970


700
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:23,970


701
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,490
Next up is the 말 триگер, the man when I Als есть pordepth.

702
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,030
I've got two boobs for you.

703
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,410
So I'm only taking you.

704
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,330
I'm a always amazzling adult.

705
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,070
Once more from Jack.

706
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,310
Indeed, it's time to stress that I need everything in place to keep my mouth open.

707
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,910
This baby went to torture.

708
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,530
to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

709
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,490
Keep listening, you idiot!

710
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

711
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,910
Else I shall kill you!

712
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,990
Well, it's the only end in the band's house.

713
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,670
Don't you think this is worthy?

714
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,510
Don't you think this is worthy?

715
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,550
Pills.

716
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,570
I just lost it, man.

717
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,490
Yeah, pills.

718
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,370
Pills.

719
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,230
Well, pills to the left of me.

720
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,890
Pills to my right.

721
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,830
Pills in the day and pills in the night.

722
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,870
Yeah, pills.

723
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,050
Pills.

724
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,950
Talking about pills.

725
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,130
Pills.

726
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,990
Pills for the bad and pills for the good.

727
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,890
Pills for the young.

728
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,490
Pills for the young and misunderstood.

729
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,930
Yeah, pills.

730
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,270
Pills.

731
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,230
Talking about pills.

732
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,330
Pills.

733
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,550
Well, pills in my hamper.

734
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,150
Pills in my socks.

735
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,130
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks.

736
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,130
Yeah, pills.

737
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,270
Pills.

738
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,230
Talking about pills.

739
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,290
Pills.

740
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,890
Pills always tell me things to do.

741
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:01,890


742
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:01,890


743
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,230
Pills are better friends than you.

744
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,270
Yeah, pills.

745
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,410
Pills.

746
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,730
Talking about pills now.

747
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:13,410
Pills.

748
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,290
My friends the pills.

749
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,730
Oh, just give me some of them pills.

750
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,750
Oh, give me those pills, Bob.

751
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,570
Can we have some pills over here, please?

752
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,690
Here, have some pills.

753
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,250
Pills.

754
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,010
I don't think you should be taking all those pills in the morning.

755
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,890
Can I have some pills, please, from my heart?

756
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,310
More pills.

757
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,270
Yeah, that's right.

758
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,530
Here at Bugville Tech, we don't like to touch bugs, but we do.

759
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,830
Well, yeah, I do.

760
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,870
That's true, but that's no reason to get all huffy and puffy about it.

761
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,750
And as we look out on this sea of caps and mortarboards,

762
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:56,870
we notice that the insect graduating class this year is greater than it's ever been,

763
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,070
and we think maybe a little smarter than it's ever been.

764
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,070
Yeah.

765
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:10,070
In Reims, France, a five-year-old girl chasing butterflies snagged a real prize,

766
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,130
the world's smallest UFO.

767
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:21,050
Yes, little Angelique Roland brought her tiny treasure to her mother, Marie,

768
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:29,370
who notified neighbors that her daughter had netted the miniature spacecraft and its half-inch humanoid pilots.

769
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:34,190
But before scientists could arrive to inspect Angelique's catch,

770
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,310
the little craft blasted away into the sky,

771
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,590
getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared.

772
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,250
What a relaxing night's show it is, too, folks.

773
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,970
Isn't it?

774
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,510
I guess it's time to do credits.

775
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,430
Yes, credits so you know who you hear.

776
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:20,250
And we heard some slack offerings as we first got into the anti-drug special of the week.

777
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,990
Heh.

778
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,550
Um...

779
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,750
Slack offerings there from M.S. Funkmeyer,

780
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,510
and Sam there in Austin, Texas.

781
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,630
I guess they had an X-Day revival down there in Austin,

782
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,730
and not too many people showed up.

783
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,370
Trickster was there and had a good time.

784
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,650
And that's all we know.

785
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,650
Perhaps all we should know.

786
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,110
A little bit of, um...

787
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:53,530
It was kind of a warped Timothy Leary there from Slack Collage by William Gillespie.

788
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,350
And cutting in and out through things,

789
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,890
the lovely song by Southland Corporation,

790
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,590
Bad Acid Party,

791
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,450
with Jane or Hyper Cleats there,

792
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,190
and Southland Corporation on vocals.

793
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,950
Living in Hell by Hell Pope Huey.

794
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,510
Who else?

795
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,990
Some KPFA subgenius hour,

796
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,430
less than and more than show,

797
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,390
with Dr. Howell and Puzzling,

798
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,750
moving evidence.

799
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:34,290
And, uh, the, uh, amazing ranting there from Church of the New Faith,

800
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,870
what sounded like, uh,

801
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,550
really, really hardcore Christian fundamentalist ranting.

802
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,330
That's what it's all about, dear friends.

803
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,070
That's Church of the New Faith from their album,

804
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,350
Your Sins Kill Him!

805
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,530
With music by our friend Reverend Ron Slabe,

806
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,370
running in the background on that one.

807
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,470
Um...

808
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,910
Hell Pope Huey once again with the attack of the 50-foot bomb.

809
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,850
I can't wait to see that.

810
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,190
That, although, you know, now that that honey I blew up the kid is out,

811
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,490
they'll think we ripped them off instead of the other way around.

812
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,430
We heard from Ren and Stimpy as we try to every show.

813
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:25,370
And, uh, some more Bad Acid Party jam there from Jane or Hyper Cleats.

814
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,510
And Southland Corporation.

815
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:34,090
The song Pills by Reverend Gleepo Abernathy.

816
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,470
Oh, yes.

817
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,070
And, uh, some KPFA...

818
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:48,350
show borrowed there from the Berklee, uh, Subdimi Clanchers.

819
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,110
I think that's what they call themselves, the Raving Subdimi Clanchers.

820
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,710
You know, they're real bobbies, the puzzling evidence is.

821
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,410
Dr. Howell.

822
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:56,910
That's true.

823
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,030
After that was over, another one came on, which was even better,

824
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,150
which was made in the 60s,

825
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,310
where an international interracial crew goes to the moon

826
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,790
and claims it for Earth, but unfortunately,

827
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,450
they encounter moon creatures who freeze North America solid.

828
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,430
And Washington, D.C. and everything is under snow.

829
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,550
Oh, yes.

830
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,410
Here's some more Ivan the Survivor fact sheets

831
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:24,390
that help our listening public make those decisions that are so inexcusable.

832
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,370
Oh, yeah.

833
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,250
And they're so unbelievable in today's difficult atmosphere.

834
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,530
Yes, some of these stories are hardly air-worthy.

835
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,710
They are extremely distasteful.

836
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,370
Those are the ones we can't tell our listening public about.

837
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,590
I'm going to take a short break here.

838
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,050
Not right here in the room, for heaven's sakes.

839
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,650
Oh, good Lord.

840
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,010
And try to find a way to...

841
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,710
I'll even bring a little, a little, uh, sticky money for the general populace

842
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,070
to find ourselves more relaxed.

843
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:53,990
Yes.

844
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,470
And I'd certainly like to have more of that, uh,

845
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,150
feropedelic, uh, bubble-atomic, uh,

846
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,650
delicios that's out there.

847
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,550
Yum, yum, yum.

848
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,650
But I won't.

849
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,730
I'll stay at my post as long as there is breath in my body.

850
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,870
Yeah, yeah, until your, your, your...

851
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,710
Until my lips fall off my face.

852
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,950
Full inventory is, is available from Bug University.

853
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,330
Yes, that's right.

854
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,970
The Dean of Bug University.

855
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,830
Professor Kissing Bug is indeed here.

856
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,610
Uh-oh, here he comes now.

857
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,750
Bob, a poet, folk singer, businessman, and senatorial candidate,

858
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,130
is a wonderful man.

859
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,950
Brought up on a commune, he has gladly rejected his parents' hippie ideal

860
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,450
to become a sanctimonious right-wing singer and songwriter

861
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:46,270
whose favorite subjects are insect science and welfare abuse.

862
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,050
Bob has preserved little more of his 60s four-bearers

863
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,850
than the guitar-plague insects...

864
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:53,750
It's gorgeous.

865
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,850
...in a super-sincere manner.

866
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,630
But he does occasionally recast familiar images of Bob Dylan

867
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,510
to fit a 90s mindset.

868
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,430
There he is.

869
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,990
He's roaming around completely untethered at the end of an unconnected microphone.

870
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,910
Look at him. Look at him.

871
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,910
This is my colleague, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,

872
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,750
puzzling evidence floating near the ceiling in zero-g

873
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,830
on a microphone that has no cord.

874
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,850
And yet you can hear every word.

875
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,430
How does he do it? How does he do it?

876
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,390
Space station.

877
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,150
Sadly, the world has grown crowded and complex,

878
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:36,150
and old-fashioned he-men just don't have much of a place anymore.

879
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,530
Like large bewildered birds of prey in a growing suburb,

880
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:47,890
they're bashing into plate-glass windows and dropping down stunned with no idea what can happen.

881
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:53,370
They seem to lack the radar and agility granted to leaner, meaner beings.

882
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,190
Hell, Peter.

883
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,530
I beg your pardon?

884
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,410
Nothing.

885
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,990
So, my problem here is in knowing who to believe.

886
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,150
It's a very, very tough one.

887
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,530
Let me quote from Mr. Atman.

888
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,650
Okay, go ahead.

889
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,550
It refers to the 1985 intelligence assessment on the papal assassination issue

890
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,110
as an example of the imposition of intelligence without evidence.

891
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,930
Now, here's what he said with regard to that same assessment.

892
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,470
So what did Bob do?

893
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,590
Bob rewrote the key judgments.

894
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,490
Bob rewrote the summary.

895
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,050
Bob dropped a very interesting scope note that said,

896
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,970
in trying to explain the methodology,

897
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,270
that we only looked at the case for subgenius involvement.

898
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,370
We didn't look at any of the evidence.

899
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,030
The very, very puzzling evidence,

900
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,550
and I might add, very, very good evidence from very, very sensitive sources

901
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,630
that would have explained, that would have clarified,

902
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,830
that would have made everything as clear as leaded crystal.

903
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,030
Bob's fortunes are ultimately helped by a political ploy

904
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,330
so sneaky it sets a new standard for dirty tricks.

905
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,510
Bob has wicked humor.

906
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,570
And it also has teeth.

907
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:05,890
Seen along the Pennsylvania campaign trail is a stunningly mean-spirited Bob,

908
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:11,970
a television commercial meant to smear Bob's venerable rival of rickly paste

909
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,170
played by Buck Hinckley,

910
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,410
who tries to discuss serious issues,

911
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,770
but is tarred and feathered and written on a rail for his supposed dalliance

912
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,850
with a 16-year-old insect.

913
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,150
You should have seen the trouble they exposed.

914
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,630
Yeah, really, really, especially when you peel that stuff off.

915
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:27,990
Whew.

916
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,270
Well, once lice in a glitzy wonderland,

917
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,470
Ivan Rump is now a serious person.

918
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,250
But I don't suppose any of you out there are interested in that.

919
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,150
And the Rump family is, of course, going through the normal trauma

920
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,810
of a family rendered asunder by little tiny news clips.

921
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,910
It was the year of the Rump with good King Captain Frump

922
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,310
when these insects began their heroic and historic voyage to these shores.

923
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,090
Yes, insects, too, came over on the Mayflower.

924
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,150
Yes, and the leaders of these insect families were graduates of the Bug Academy,

925
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,310
as we mentioned earlier.

926
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:06,030
So Bug University was really an old-world school

927
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,990
before it ever achieved the universal appeal that it has today.

928
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,810
Yeah, with the college of hard knocks that most of these exoskeleton-idle people find,

929
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,830
it's hard enough to get through the day.

930
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,630
Sneepy, sleepy, sleepy.

931
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,230
Tell me, uh, Mr. Insect, if you can talk.

932
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,210
No, not you.

933
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:36,410
I just wanted to ask your views on the onset of neo-fascist mercantilism in Central Europe.

934
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,110
Please, help me.

935
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,110
Now, see, what you have here is, uh, too many people are trying to do the bug,

936
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,450
and not enough people are trying to actually direct the movie.

937
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,070
So it's sort of a confusing situation.

938
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,410
You're telling me.

939
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,230
Well, I guess we're not gonna get much out of this little guy,

940
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,250
except tobacco juice.

941
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,150
Tobacco juice?

942
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,190
Yeah, didn't you know they chew tobacco?

943
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

944
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,510
Oh, that's quite all right. Just stand out here.

945
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,010
I'm sorry.

946
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,550
If I have a...

947
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,930
Here, let me take a Kleenex. I'll just get this right off you, and, uh...

948
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,130
Okay, there we go.

949
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:25,690
It's astonishing, amazing, unthinkable, fantastic, unbelievable.

950
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,530
Wait, you're saying that nobody thinks about it?

951
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:33,830
Well, uh, I'm afraid that these days, unless it's a feel-good, uh, be-happy type of story,

952
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,090
um, nobody thinks about it at all.

953
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,110
No water fountain anymore, either.

954
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,830
And then...

955
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,370
Transcribing down through the ages...

956
00:48:54,250 --> 00:49:02,130
A surgeon who used a marker to draw a happy face on the genital area of two patients

957
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,930
said Wednesday in Cincinnati, Ohio,

958
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,550
a surgeon's group investigation has cleared him of all misconduct

959
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:13,870
and has awarded him the American Medical Association Medal for Creative Surgery.

960
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,750
Dr. Glendi Worden, chief surgeon at the Shriners Burns Institute,

961
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:25,490
acknowledged using a magic marking pen to draw a happy face on a man's, uh, object

962
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,830
and a woman's, uh, you know, thing that was an attempt to ease their tension

963
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,630
over the surgery.

964
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,430
He said the patients and their families had consented to the drawings

965
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,790
and would proudly sport them with pride.

966
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:38,950
Ah, good morning.

967
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,650
Guten Morgen.

968
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:41,650
Good morning.

969
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:41,690


970
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,630
Hey, I saw an interesting show last Tuesday night.

971
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,850
You saw some sort of show?

972
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,010
I haven't heard the rest of that show, so we better not, uh,

973
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,250
we better not go too much further into that.

974
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,370
It just gets a little bit too suspenseful.

975
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,530
You know, that was a...

976
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,050
a particularly suspenseful show.

977
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:02,690
And this...

978
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,230
this show that you're listening to, dear friends,

979
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:11,490
is, of course, the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

980
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:16,630
Uh, brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

981
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:21,470
And why, you know, there's so much free information

982
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,630
that you could qualify for by sending a simple postcard

983
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,230
to our mighty church.

984
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:32,150
I'm gonna give you that post office box to write to.

985
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,670
You just write to Bob, that's his name, Bob,

986
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:41,150
at post office box 140306.

987
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,230
Dallas, Texas 75214.

988
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,550
Why not?

989
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,570
What if you got to lose a 29-cent stamp and a little time?

990
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,550
And, friend, you'll be on the...

991
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,190
the, uh, Greyhound for Jerusalem.

992
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,370
Which is the song coming up next by Brother Cleve Duncan.

993
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,690
Once again, that's Bob at post office box 140306.

994
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:21,850
In beautiful downtown Dallas, Texas 75214.

995
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,250
Because that's just the kind of show this is.

996
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,530
The sound itself, it...

997
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,630
it has a stink to it.

998
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:31,690
It's...

999
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,910
It's...

1000
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,210
It's...

1001
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,210


1002
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,210


1003
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,210


1004
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,210


1005
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,490
It's...

1006
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,470
It's...

1007
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,750
It's...

1008
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:52,410
Is...

1009
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:52,410


1010
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:52,410


1011
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:52,410


1012
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,550
And if you don't think so?

1013
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,570
Why, don't you give me a thing?

1014
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:55,570


1015
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:55,650
Uh, do you think someone can live...

1016
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:57,450
Ordinary?

1017
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:57,670
The...

1018
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,670


1019
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:58,610
The back Moral about his original voice.

1020
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,110
So there's a little bit of that.

1021
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,090
You know, I'll put it in a audio album.

1022
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,850
Uh, drop it.

1054

Take the red arms back

1055
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,710
Oh, good morning.

1056
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,310
Guten Morgen.

1057
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,150
Morgen. Hey, I saw an interesting show last Tuesday night.

1058
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,490
You saw some sort of show?

1059
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:02,670
Some sort of show.

1060
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,370
Perhaps you've heard of it. Comic book confidential.

1061
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:09,870
Oh, yes. That's the one that starts with that Mavridis character spilling ink all over his groin.

1062
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,090
That strange character.

1063
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,550
Tut, tut, tut. Pish posh.

1064
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:17,070
I'm not supposed to do that. Oh, make mess of art.

1065
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:18,490
What do you think about that?

1066
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:23,790
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart, it's special effects. It's not real. It only happens in the movies. You see?

1067
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:28,970
What do we think about it? You just gotta get out of the apartment for a day so they can hear the damn thing.

1068
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:35,210
Yeah, I just have to explain how they did that trick. It's real simple.

1069
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,950
Explain it to me, because I sure don't get it.

1070
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,310
I beg your pardon?

1071
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:39,850
I said explain it to me.

1072
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,490
Explain it to me here, because I sure don't get it.

1073
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:50,850
Well, it's a simple thing which we have in the movies that we call a sheet of acetate which goes over the drawing and then the ink flows over that and the drawing is saved.

1074
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,130
Oh, thank goodness. Boy, that was sure scary.

1075
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:57,550
So...

1076
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,190
So?

1077
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,310
So...

1078
00:59:59,310 --> 00:59:59,430
So...

1079
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,810
So...

1080
00:59:59,810 --> 00:59:59,910
So...

1081
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:00,090
So...

1082
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:00,090


1083
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:00,090


1084
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:00,210
So...

1085
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:00,270
So...

1086
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:01,450
So...

1087
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:01,450


1088
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:01,790
So...

1089
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:01,790


1090
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:01,890
So...

1091
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:01,950
So...

1092
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:01,950


1093
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:02,070
So...

1094
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,070


1095
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,070


1096
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,070


1097
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,070


1098
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,070


1099
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,090
So...

1100
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:05,630
So...

1101
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,590
So...

1102
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:10,130
So...

1103
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,110
So...

1104
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:12,670
So...

1105
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:12,690
So...

1106
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,910
Now, that's some question that postal officials would be more capable of answering.

1107
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:21,530
You know, there's the uh, 1-way and then there's the 2-way.

1108
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:22,730
You know uh...

1109
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,830
What's he talking about? Look at you, spoiling around the room.

1110
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:28,830
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1111
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,370
Hello!

1112
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:29,390
Hello!

1113
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:29,390


1114
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,370
You stupid...

1115
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:34,590
This is Dr. Yoimba Squimby, calling from Tucson, Arizona.

1116
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,950
Oh, it's Dr. Yoimba Squimby. What happened to Dr. Jagranda Squimby?

1117
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:48,730
Oh, well, you know, he died in that tragic bus accident, along with the rest of the administration and faculty of Burns College.

1118
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,690
Well, what about Bug University?

1119
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,990
We've been interviewing graduates from Bug University all evening.

1120
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:55,770
Yeah?

1121
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,510
And they had a lot of stridulation and sheeping to say.

1122
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:05,590
Well, you know, if you spray bugs with soapy water, it changes the surface tension, and they die by osmosis.

1123
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,750
Yes, I know.

1124
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,590
No, but we were trying to avoid another ugly incident like that.

1125
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:14,530
Well, if you use a lens cleaner, then, of course, they die much more quickly in a much more painful way.

1126
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:18,410
Yeah, and they're cleaner and they have fewer scratches.

1127
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:25,050
Well, yeah, and they slide right off the infront we do, brouhaha, we say, quite easily.

1128
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,230
That's right.

1129
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,830
Yes, yes, indeed, yes, I quite agree.

1130
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:32,690
Well, you know, I am going to be visiting your city soon.

1131
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:33,630
That's right.

1132
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,730
In the month of August, named after Augustus.

1133
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,730
Augustus Caesar, the first of the Roman emperors.

1134
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,130
Oh, un visite du chateau, eh?

1135
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,970
Yeah, well, that would be nice.

1136
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,250
He's not staying with me, he's staying with Bob.

1137
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,310
I see.

1138
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:47,790
Well, of course I'm staying with Bob.

1139
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:49,390
Fermez la lundi en paix.

1140
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:53,610
You think someone as high up in the church as me would stay in a lowly flop house?

1141
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:54,870
Apparently not.

1142
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:59,030
Apparently you wouldn't stay because my place isn't good enough.

1143
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,990
No, you have to hobnob with Bob.

1144
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:05,790
Well, when you're in Bob's place, you get to look down over, you know, out of that flying saucer.

1145
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:06,530
Over the listener.

1146
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:07,950
Over the whole planet down there.

1147
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:08,390
Over the callers.

1148
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:12,590
And did you know that Bob has recently installed a hot tub, too?

1149
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,110
Yes, I know he has a hot tub.

1150
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,750
He's got a Swedish smorgasbord.

1151
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:16,950
He's got, uh...

1152
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:20,610
He's got Sven and Newt just whacking and smacking you there.

1153
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:27,130
Well, as you know, you know, I have serious medical difficulties that need constant attention,

1154
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:32,370
and I understand that Bob has a whole crew of attractive lovelies in abbreviated lab coats.

1155
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,450
Those are the swinging nurses, yes.

1156
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:35,610
Hot-buttered martini crumbs.

1157
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:36,730
That's right.

1158
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,550
Male and female, I should point out at this time.

1159
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,070
That's right.

1160
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:40,370
And neutrals.

1161
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:41,250
Drones.

1162
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,790
Yeah, and neutral drones.

1163
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:43,870
Yeah, I know about those.

1164
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,550
Although, three sexes?

1165
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,390
I know about that stuff.

1166
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,010
It doesn't seem like enough, does it?

1167
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,330
You know, I was married for 13 years.

1168
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,790
Where Hal comes from, there's an unlimited number of sexes.

1169
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,570
It says here, no.

1170
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,630
Who all is there on that show?

1171
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,550
Well, we've got customer service, we've got puzzling evidence, and we've got Dr. Hal.

1172
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,190
And, of course, now we've got you commencing away.

1173
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,390
Ah, well, it's nice to hear your voice puddling.

1174
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:06,770
Thank you.

1175
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,790
Thank you.

1176
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1177
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1178
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1179
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1180
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1181
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1182
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1183
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1184
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1185
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1186
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1187
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1188
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1189
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1190
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1191
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1192
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1193
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1194
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1195
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1196
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1197
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1198
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1199
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770


1200
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,770
