1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,480
So, you will be greedy.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,460
Now I'll tell you a story about a mouse who was greedy and came to a bad end.

The Strange Doctor Weird

4
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,580
The

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,120
Self-Genius Power of Swag

6
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:11,580
Joe Doakes was just a guy who liked to tinker around his barn.

7
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,680
Some people thought Joe was lazy.

8
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,920
Some even thought he was nuts.

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,040
But one day, he had an idea.

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,260
Bob?

11
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,060
Bob?

12
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,620
Exclusive, exclusive, easy, full, comfortable, custom, perfect, new.

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,280
Real hair.

14
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,580
I'll just step up.

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
I thought I was good.

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,440
I thought I was good.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,320
I was mental.

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,600
Bro-bo-bo-bo.

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,300
Very mental.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,040
A couple of ladies.

21
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,720
Guys.

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,040
Very mental.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,820
Mental.

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,580
Very mental.

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
You just get mostly left to you.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,480
You get a phone call and it sounds great.

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,940
You're mental.

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,040
Forget about that phone call, whether it happens or it doesn't happen.

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,080
You better be mental.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,160
Hello.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,760
Hello.

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,200
Hello.

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,440


34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm blessed to be mental all the time.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm blessed being mental.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,820
That's the way I see it.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,400
No matter what you say about me, I think I'm mental.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,740
That's what you gotta be, mental.

39
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,120
And if it ain't good enough for the person next to you, that's just unmental.

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,280
Very unmental.

41
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,540
Another word for unmental is unmental.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,120
Well, in fair space, we're trying to locate you.

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,540
You might dare be drop-ass.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,480
You know?

45
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:48,920
Mental.

46
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,620
Very mental.

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
Very mental.

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,220


49
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,380
Very mental.

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,560
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,240
Maybe that's all Bob is.

52
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll say hello later.

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,100
What?

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,320
God!

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,260
Okay, so here it is.

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,620
Now, this is what happens.

57
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,320
Again and again and again.

58
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,600
And when it does, when they probably don't.

59
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,440
So there you are.

60
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,380
Now, here's the problem.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,860
But hey, sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

62
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm on my way to heaven.

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
To heaven.

64
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,700
To heaven.

65
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:22,920
To heaven.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,360
To heaven.

67
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,420
Yodel my way to heaven, to the Father, Jesus Christ.

68
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,480
You know, I ain't a church-going person, but I swear that's going to be a thing of the past.

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,980
Um, let him be all right. I didn't hit him hard.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,480
He should still have one good one left in him.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:13,440
5, 2, 5, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 6, 9, 10.

72
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,580
Oh, may he be loved.

73
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh, may he be loved.

74
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,900
Oh, may he be loved.

75
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,460
Love?

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,020
Beloved, I wish above all things that it's mine.

77
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,560
Flush it down the toilet, because it's mine.

78
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,300
How long will you sit? But it's mine.

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,820
Sin, sin, it's mine.

80
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,900
Hatred, hatred.

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,640
Mine.

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,320
Bitterness, it's mine.

83
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,460
Covetousness, it's mine.

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,600
Bible says that it's mine.

85
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,420
This little heart pounding excitedly.

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,620
Let's begin.

87
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,540
According to the nursery rhyme, what term refers to a Roman Catholic?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,180
Uh, uh.

89
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,360
Yes, what letter found in 1937?

90
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,900
Uh, Old Golda Meir.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,320
That's right.

92
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:24,740
Yes.

93
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,600
Ooh, uh.

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:25,780
No.

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,000
Ooh, a cat.

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,460
Yes.

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,980
B-b-b-b-b-b-bob filed for bankruptcy in October 2001.

98
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,720
Ooh, uh, uh, ooh, uh, uh, uh, no.

99
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,740
Yes, uh, you got a bunch wrong.

100
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Ah, I f***ing bought.

101
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,360
Now let's see what you got around here we can tax.

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,980
Mmm, let's see.

103
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Hmm.

104

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:53,660


109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,400
Hmm.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,400


111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,400


112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,400


113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,400

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,440
Hmm.

117

118
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


119
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


120
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


122
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


123
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


124
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440

129
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


130
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,600
Hmm.

131
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,220
Hmm.

132
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,340
Hmm.

133
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:01,720


134
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,140


135
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:02,820


136
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:02,920


137
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,120


138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,120


139
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,120


140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,120


141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,120


142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,440
Hmm.

143
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,460


144
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,940
Hmm.

145
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,020


146
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,020


147

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,420
Hmm.

150
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,420


151
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,940
Hmm.

152
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,720
Hmm.

153
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Oh.

154
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:13,660
Oh.

155
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
Hmm.

1-11-7-9-3-5-13

157
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:39,700
My name is Coco, and the reason I do drugs is because I have Down syndrome.

158
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,700
Because having Down syndrome, I can't really tell what's right or wrong.

159
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,800
So I do drugs because I have Down syndrome, and I feel that I need to do drugs.

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,100
Spotted by PCP for Free America.

161
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,600
A nice lucky number.

162
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,100
Well, you better hope I don't.

163
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,820
You can't.

164
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,880
Oh, you can.

165
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,860
Right.

166
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,840
This man's drugs.

167
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,340
I know.

168
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah, well, watch it.

169
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,440
Whatever.

170
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,120
So he's trying drugs.

171
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,320
All right.

172
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,300
He's spending more time with his drugs.

173
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,780
Ah, yeah, don't mess with me.

174
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:21,780


175
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,400
And it works.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,860
Parents give their kids drugs at www.freedrug.org.

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
Sponsored by a partnership for Free America.

178

Nub.

179
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,340
Nub.

180
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,100
Nub.

181
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,520
This is my last committee hearing as chairman.

182
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,040
And I hate education.

183
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,120
And I hate New York.

184
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,760
I hate Salad.

185
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,460
I hate Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia and Colombia and every place else.

186
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,600
I hate younger and younger people.

187
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,640
And I hate families.

188
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,480
I hate kids in grade schools.

189
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,840
When you kill one, there's 10 or 20 or 50 waiting to take his place.

190
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,520
I hate society.

191
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,060
And I hate people like you.

192
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,080
But I have one question that nobody ever asks.

193
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
And that's this question.

194
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,300
What would happen?

195
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,260
What would happen?

196
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,980
I'd like for any of you to answer that.

197
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,120
I'd like to know what your goal is.

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,500
There are some things you just do.

199
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,940
Like smoking marijuana.

200
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,580
Because when you get high, it's your mind you're messing with.

201
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,720
So what?

202
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,340
My brother Jeff's gonna drop at the mall tonight.

203
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
The good stuff.

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,100
Sponsored by the Office of Drug America.

205
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,160
How's it going, dude?

206
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,800
Listen to the wind.

207
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,740
For Aika.

208
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,740
You'll be in the sky.

209
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm a machine.

210
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,720
God knows what the machine is supposed to do.

211
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,340
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

212
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,680
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

213
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,480
Step on into the chapel.

214
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,800
You're marrying men and women of character and touch.

215
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,300
Flowers and vegetables.

216
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,740
Each and every thing unto its own self.

217
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,480
A gift of love.

218
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,900
I implore you.

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
Hey, Houston, look up.

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,720
Out.

221
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,100
I think we got this.

222
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,260
Hub, hub, hub, hub, hub, hub, hub, hub, hub, hub, hub.

223
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,720
You have no alternative.

224
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,160
You know it.

225
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,240
You know it.

226
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,040
Everything will be all right.

227
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,140
You are in my hands.

228
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,020
I am here to protect you.

229
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,800
You have nowhere to go.

230
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,620
You have nowhere to go.

231
00:09:50,180 --> 00:10:12,140
ou met me at the end of this shit they say.

232
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,020
Don't I know anything from my life about you.

233
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,020


234
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,040
O mE taK.

235
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,480
You were miles away from me from rock cardio.

236
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,480


237
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,480


238
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,180
A qui revolverführίο?

239
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,720
Sorry.

240
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,600
Getting so ahora seguido.

241
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,720
Please come back.

242
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,380
You have nothing to be afraid of.

243
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,160
We are going back.

244
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,540
This is your last chance to return.

245
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
You have no where to go.

246
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,240
You cannot survive.

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,900
You cannot survive.

248
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,760
We only want to help you.

249
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,340
This is your last chance.

250
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,020
There can be other creatures in this alien environment.

251
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,180
Hunters.

252
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,660
Hunters.

253
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,160
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

254
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,360
They eat the floaters.

255
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,280
Both for their organic molecules and for their store of pure hydrogen.

256
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,580
But there can't be many hunters.

257
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,900
Because if they destroy all the floaters, they themselves will perish.

258
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,400
But have we neglected one of the most important items necessary for being effective for the kingdom?

259
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,780
I have come to an amazing and startling conclusion that this here great mass that we stand upon,

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,520
heaving and throttling below us like a mighty, mighty poultry,

261
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,660
is the only thing we can do to save the world.

262
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,920
This thing we call America, this great continental division between us,

263
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,540
cannot and must not be ripped further asunder.

264
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
I say to us,

265
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:05,400
Tramp, it is our manifested destiny to touch the stars and have our damned hands burned.

266
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,080
Ha, ha, ha.

267
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,000
What do you think, boys?

268
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's do it.

269
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,440
What do we do?

270
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,060
You ask that question now?

271
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,100
The Major no longer asks it.

272
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,440
You know the answer, Major.

273
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,440
Sure.

274
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
We'll circle around.

275
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,340
Then we'll crash.

276
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,800
No, no, no, no.

277
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
No, it'll be all right, my boy.

278
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,620
My words again.

279
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
Have peace.

280
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,060
Peace forever.

281
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,280
Prophecy is an easy thing.

282
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,120
For rarely is the prophet brought to judgment.

283
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,320
Tonight I bring you a false prophecy.

284
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,300
The place of our story is a great rocket speeding away from the moon.

285
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,800
Now, as you notice, some of these ships are made of cardboard.

286
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,240
If you've got the will, if you've got what made America great,

287
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,780
if you've got a heart as big as the sun and an ass as big as the moon,

288
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,100
you make it.

289
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,740
You'll storm on.

290
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,060
You'll go on through those stars like a laser through butter.

291
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,280
Yeah, man.

292
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,340
Yeah.

293
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
Come on.

294
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,200
Come on.

295
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,520
Don't worry about that plastic wraparound.

296
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
It's not real plastic.

297
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,080
No, that's a solar shield, man.

298
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,800
That'll protect you.

299
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,080
It's not plastic and those cigarette wrappers on the floor.

300
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,220
That's insulation device for when you're in deep space.

301
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,120
But you've got to believe.

302
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,800
You've got to believe.

303
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,780
You've got to believe, Earthman.

304
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,540
You've got to believe.

305
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,360
Deep space.

306
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,880
In the slash, slash, slash.

307
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,080
Yes, yes, yes.

308
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,680
I've always known.

309
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,460
Yes, I agree, man.

310
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,840
It really makes sense.

311
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,260
Yeah.

312
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,880
That's how we are, man.

313
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,460
It really makes sense.

314
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:00,940
Yeah.

315
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:01,800


316
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:01,920


317
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,260
Yeah.

318
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,200
Susie?

319
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,680
Forget it.

320
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
You better run along out if you want to have your invasion before dark.

321
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:16,880
It is later that you think.

322
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,080
Think.

323
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm sorry I couldn't ask you that.

324
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,740
What?

325
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:21,600


326
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,900
Wouldn't I?

327
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,740
Could you have 기 cirке.

328
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:26,720
Sorry.

330
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,240
My DTFA go DNA.

331
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,000
My powers come on a certain depth, someone may save yourank out.

332
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,920
Been a little

333
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,140
topsy tulsy.

334
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,680
I don't need it, I don't have time to worry.

335
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,820
I don't care who asked that question.

336
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:45,820


337
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,740
The things that's important to control her mind.

338
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:47,740


339
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,800
What was the issue?

340
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,940
Invasion?

341
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,880
Drill?

342
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,220
Zero hour?

343
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,960
There are a lot of kooks out there.

344
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:04,420
There are a lot of people that will use, you know, what the scripture says wrong.

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,180
They will interpret it in a way to benefit themselves.

346
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,000
And then I go and I pick the potato.

347
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,100
And then I cut the potato.

348
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,520
And I eat the potato.

349
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,800
And then I make another potato into a potato flute.

350
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,660
And I go up the mountain and I yell to greet the new day.

351
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,040
And then I yell to greet the end of the day.

352
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,420
That is my potato life.

353
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,220
I'm so full of happiness.

354
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,400
Hooked on something new.

355
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Life is such a tricky thing.

356
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,860
Doesn't anybody believe me?

357
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,760
Sometimes I feel like I do that every morning.

358
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,520
Push the wrong button.

359
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,800
Hit the wrong button and disconnect the command module from the lander.

360
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,800
That's a long time.

361
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,360
Right.

362
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,060
And your two buddies were in the lander.

363
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,620
Yeah.

364
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,120
Yeah.

365
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,180
Of course you are.

366
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,180
And I end up having to hose out the mess that used to be my buddies' space.

367
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,420
The only thing to be really good at the most part about going to the moon is that you didn't get a chance to spend as much time around the earth.

368
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,360
I was going to show you.

369
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,600
To me.

370
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,400
To talk.

371
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,440
And your son gets dead.

372
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,160
There's something wrong.

373
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,900
I wanna go home.

374
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,740
That's what they were saying.

375
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,740
I wanna go home.

376
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,160
They came down that last 15 minutes of flight.

377
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,540
I wanna go home.

378
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,780
Fifteen minutes from landing.

379
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,660
We set sail on this new sea.

380
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,560
Because there is new knowledge to be gained.

381
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,000
And this is my room.

382
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
And you're all here.

383
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,400
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever, ever again.

384
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,640
So what's your theory about the...

385
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,820
I think they slapped the taste right out of Chaz's mouth.

386
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,800
Don't you think it's highly distasteful to talk about that jam?

387
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,840
What got the shuttle?

388
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,840
I think it was Zeus with his mighty blue thunderbolt.

389
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,100
He's got some great thunderbolts this year.

390
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,220
Who's got blue thunderbolts besides Zeus?

391
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,340
I mean, it might be the Zeus Liberation Army,

392
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,360
which I guess is very fundamentalist in their beliefs.

393
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,280
They go back to Deer Zip.

394
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,780
I don't know. I've heard that Ra has green thunderbolts.

395
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,140
No, but you notice the thunderbolts that rolled off good old...

396
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,040
And Bob has great big red straps.

397
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,440
Great big bungee sticks for using on Chinese...

398
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,500
So I heard that NASA knew from the beginning of the flight

399
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,660
that that was going to happen, but didn't tell the astronauts

400
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,040
because they couldn't do anything about it.

401
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Oh, man. What a grim thought.

402
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,360
You know, I had...

403
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,260
And then they made up this whole thing that they're going to do this big,

404
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,760
you know, inquiry and all that to cover that all up.

405
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,460
Oh, actually, I had an even more...

406
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,240
More paranoid whole scenario unfold in my imagination.

407
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,160
In your underwear?

408
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,880
Shortly after I heard the thing.

409
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,840
It was like a movie.

410
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,960
It was just like an action movie.

411
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,140
Well, imagine if those guys were up there,

412
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,380
and they're, of course, they're always having to...

413
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,140
Just having a smoke after some copulonquoitus interruptus.

414
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,580
Just check it out.

415
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm listening. I'm listening.

416
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:30,820
All right.

417
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,400
And...

418
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,100
Okay, the astronauts have been instructed to dump this mysterious cargo into orbit.

419
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,980
One of them does some homework and discovers that it's a doomsday privacy-erasing device

420
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,340
to be put into orbit that could easily be used by the wrong hands

421
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,320
to enslave all humanity under fill-in-the-blank.

422
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,240
The astronauts confer and decide not to activate the evil device.

423
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,000
But one of the astronauts is, of course, secretly with them, the big them,

424
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,300
and he pulls out a death ray or something on the other astronauts

425
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,000
and makes a standoff.

426
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,540
Ah, stand back!

427
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm going to bring this baby down!

428
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,380
This one woman astronaut who he had knocked out earlier,

429
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,380
she comes to behind him.

430
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,240
I am waking up now.

431
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,140
And she's just in time to clobber him from behind.

432
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,180
And there's this dramatic fight aboard the shuttle

433
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,900
as it's coming in for a landing.

434
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,400
Wow.

435
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,400
Okay, now the good guys, the good astronauts,

436
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,140
defeat the bad agent astronaut

437
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,180
and have informed mission control,

438
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,980
we're coming in for a landing with big news

439
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,140
that will shake the world and shock everyone.

440
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,940
And that is when they, in Washington,

441
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,040
or Langley, or wherever,

442
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,880
ordered the secret button push

443
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,840
that makes the shuttle explode upon reentry

444
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,140
just as if a heat panel or something

445
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,560
had been damaged during takeoff.

446
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,640
And they even had fake footage of that standing by

447
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,780
just in case of that kind of emergency

448
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,000
and sudden cover-up.

449
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,080
And that makes me a real conspiracy theorist

450
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,160
and made-for-TV movie director.

451
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,580
You think as a movie director

452
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,620
they could come up with better prosthetics than fake feet?

453
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,540
Hey, who's on the line?

454
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:05,860
You know?

455
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,100
You man, Stank,

456
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,920
you've been working in the meth and phoenix.

457
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,480
I've been working in the amphetamine mines

458
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,640
way too long.

459
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,560
Look at his fingernails.

460
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,300
They're all, like,

461
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,700
Fu-manchu-ed and long

462
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,220
and have weird veins.

463
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,400
I knew how dangerous it was

464
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,340
when I went up there.

465
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,680
We all wanted to get off

466
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,000
and those American,

467
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
those brave Americans

468
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,480
got off Earth.

469
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,680
Frozen as frost.

470
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,100
Just a bunch of flaming monkeys

471
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,500
falling from the sky.

472
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,540
I can't see out the window.

473
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,500
They're all glazed open.

474
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,220
Matt, have you ever saw

475
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,600
flaming monkeys falling from the sky before?

476
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,460
Well, of course we've seen it numerous.

477
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,320
We saw it, like, 17 years ago.

478
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,980
Well, sure, back when the amphetamines

479
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,520
were good.

480
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,920
Reverend Strickland.

481
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,400
Strange.

482
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,880
He knows about flaming monkeys

483
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,920
and amphetamines.

484
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,820
This whole thing gives me

485
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,100
a great new idea

486
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,000
to start up a whole new cottage industry.

487
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,160
A new burial technique

488
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,400
for people with way too much money.

489
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,240
Cottage cheese.

490
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,160
Shoot their corpses up into orbit.

491
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,240
Cremation by re-entry.

492
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,520
Oh, I thought you were going to

493
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,940
turn them into a cheese.

494
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,880
If you can't afford it,

495
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,800
a hundred grand will descend

496
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,480
your head up and re-enter your head.

497
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,200
No, you don't even have to.

498
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,500
You just have to pump them up

499
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,140
a little bit.

500
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,260
You know, you don't even have

501
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,120
to get them that high.

502
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,100
And those could just come back down.

503
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,960
You could probably do it

504
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,120
with a military device.

505
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,640
Why not leave them

506
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,340
in the methamphetamine labs?

507
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,220
You just take their monkeys

508
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,100
and you throw their corpses

509
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,720
on the heap

510
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,200
with the rest of the rotting monkeys.

511
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,960
Why not re-amphetimate them?

512
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,840
You know what I mean?

513
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,480
Bring them back to life

514
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,260
with the amphetamines

515
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,920
we've created in our lab.

516
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,340
Admiral Timothy Leary, yeah.

517
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,880
Right.

518
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,800
Admiral Leary was honored

519
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,620
by that type of cremation.

520
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,540
But he couldn't ejaculate

521
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,400
at the wrong moment

522
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
and so he was incinerated

523
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,400
just the same.

524
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,480
Of course we believe in it.

525
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,060
You really believe we okay?

526
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,960
We've actually been in space.

527
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,860
It's dog.

528
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,720
We've never been in space.

529
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,880
Hey, really, I don't believe

530
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,380
we walked.

531
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
I don't believe we walked

532
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,580
on the moon.

533
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,640
I don't.

534
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,460
Nobody's ever really made it

535
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,880
past those warehouse walls

536
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,800
with Shell Beach painted on them.

537
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,240
We're going to go

538
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,460
back home now.

539
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,980
Bye.

540
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,780
Bye.

541
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,080
Bye.

542
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,700
Bye.

543
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,360
Bye.

544
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,200
Bye.

545
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,180
Bye.

546
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,380
Bye.

547
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,740
Bye.

548
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,360
Bye.

549
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,420
Bye.

550
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,620
Thank you.

551
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,760
Thank you.

552
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,060
Thank you.

553
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,920
Thank you.

554
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,320
Thank you.

555
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,140
Thank you.

556
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,820
Thank you.

557
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,280
Thank you.

558
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,500
Thank you.

559
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,240
Thank you.

560
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,380
Thank you.

561
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,540
Thank you.

562
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,400
Thank you.

563
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,400
Thank you.

564
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Thank you.

565
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,760
Thank you.

566
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,380
Thank you.

567
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,080
Thank you.

568
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,300
Thank you.

569
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:36,960
Thank you.

570
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,100
Thank you.

571
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,600
camera five you want to take down the shorts on the uh numerator over there looks like we've

572
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,580
only got a high profile until a midway shot looks like we need to go for a full shot of the

573
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,980
i don't believe me how do you fix this robot man

574
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,060
i don't believe it i never could the robot's head exploded dude

575
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,280
you know phil specter actually grazed the shot you know columbia as it was coming into our air

576
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,260
space as he was aiming at xena's double he was already confused by thinking he was shooting at

577
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:21,680
xena he shot her double but actually he fired five shots one went off the rim of the old canister

578
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,140
there next to the neck you know next so it was one of phil specter's philiac pool and ricocheting

579
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,080
bullets it might have been phil specter's ricocheting brought down the

580
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,880
think

581
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,580
think of it numerologically speaking phil specter has 11 as the numerological bedroom which comes

582
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,340
out to two okay let's just say all right that two is an interface between the yin and the yang as

583
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,920
we both know it's just circulating and everything okay so you've got the yin and yang you've got a

584
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,720
perfect balance and then he throws it out of balance and what have we got going on in space

585
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,000
we've got a curry party we've got people talking about golf and next time michael jackson admitting

586
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,780
to sleeping when the boys have to play it's a hit these are all hits but the space shuttle

587
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,380
was a hit michael jackson is having hits all over again his crappy albums are selling better than

588
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,260
ever okay here's a conspiracy theater did you hear that michael jackson and the reason for his weird

589
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:21,140
intolerance to sunlight and his facial diseases is that he was a former shuttle casualty so i've

590
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:27,220
heard that i thought he was just an evil that's from a canadian is an invitation michael jackson

591
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,600
an alien or just a severely damaged astronaut

592
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:40,480
somewhere up there in the land of pan never never land you know like waiting for captain hook i guess

593
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,040
to come out of the sky you know i'm i'm captain hook you're captain hook well i'm peter pan

594
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:56,380
come to me tinkerbell i am captain hook i am your father peter come to me come and sit upon my pegged

595
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,180
lap i will tell you the stories of seven leagues deep

596
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:13,060
that's right a modern pirate on a modern ship capable of taking down air force and army weapons

597
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,980
was that was that virtual too i mean was that so-called nano virtual or was that just like a

598
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,840
i don't know what you're talking about i'm not in here i'm talking about old blue eyes

599
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,940
you know talking about the lounge mood

600
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,760
you're proud of me i'm proud of you

601
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,500
i'm proud to be a ding-a-ling

602
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,960
i am i'm past that cigar and give me a martini

603
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,720
i'm proud to swing my ding-a-ling against your empty brain pad

604
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,020
such a big thing

605
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,680
hi i'm not a baby dangler

606
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,760
i'm not i'm not a baby dangler

607
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,880
you're not a baby dangler

608
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,320
i was just hanging out with my kids

609
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,120
he's not a baby dangling so you can take that two ways

610
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,500
you know that's very logical because he's known to expose himself to the elephant or whatever the name

611
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,760
if there is a god in the sky

612
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,540
he made everything beautiful how'd you guys get here

613
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,120
we came on the plane

614
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,060
we do not need people that are hung up this way

615
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,220
that is the exact same grammatical form obviously just reversed

616
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:30,600
but i have a real problem if it means one and only one obviously under 60. a person who is sober-minded

617
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,420
and if you can't handle that we do not need people that are hung up this way

618
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,060
you would get people more in tune with what may lie ahead

619
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:45,040
i couldn't tell you what city it was or what where everything started being somewhat civil

620
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,140
and pockets that are missing underneath civilization the upper floors of the high rises were just desolate

621
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,480
luster jumped bail two weeks ago halfway through his date rape

622
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,840
uh obviously he has friends all over the place

623
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,760
i think i think people everywhere are concerned

624
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,640
and determine that yet.

625
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,480
Here we go!

626
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,240
Look out!

627
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,020
The Grand Galope by Leonard Solomon,

628
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,640
also from that Orbitones Experimental Musical Instrument album.

629
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,000
Before that, a collage by Reverend Cobblestone,

630
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,280
who has been sending us stuff lately,

631
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,160
also under the name Solar Wimp.

632
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,980
And now, from Heart Ignition,

633
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,760
the very voice of the alien space god,

634
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,580
Jehovah Wimp!

635
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,020
I want to tell you about a super new form of death and destruction.

636
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,480
It is called good kid and bad genitals,

637
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,060
based on the focus of youthful retardation

638
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,440
in atomic structured forms of hell and a kind of melting heaven

639
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
that only I, J.H.V.H.1, can allow.

640
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,760
It all started when I shot, with my own two fingers,

641
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,080
a kind of magnetic ray, belching, if you will, into smoke,

642
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,340
covered clouds and metallic shavings

643
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,900
that send songs about diseases brought over the insignificant planet

644
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
known as Monkey Culture 90.

645
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:00,740
I was a child of the

646
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,480
Earth by the Elder Gods,

647
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,040
but Earth by the things that dwell there.

648
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,380
Oh, how I love the monkey wine,

649
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,460
a kind of char,

650
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,620
the native sorrow,

651
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,040
a merlot of Archer,

652
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,040
that I feed on.

653
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,840
It brings me such nourishment to know that they,

654
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,500
the lower moldy monkey funk,

655
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,020
that blankets the planet,

656
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,840
are suffering like the fatal yupp-yupp-iomastic stories of Poompit

657
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,220
and their neuter friends' tails.

658
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,400
Deal with it, you snoozing bastards,

659
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,800
you elder turkeys,

660
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,700
chungis,

661
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,280
that sleep like the little boom babies you are.

662
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,580
I am the Supreme God,

663
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:30,720
the Supreme King,

664
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,540
sign the land of El-Wichi's pie.

665
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,280
Idiots.

666
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,880
Now there is a guy on the West Coast named Philo...

667
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,560
Philo?

668
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,720
I never heard of him.

669
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,720
Some folks in Dallas think a lot of him.

670
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,240
Yeah?

671
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,200
Which folks?

672
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,380
The folks to bet.

673
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,660
And he's well known in California.

674
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,880
I think we could get a good piece of action on this one, Jim.

675
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,420
Hmm.

676
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,100
All right.

677
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,060
You set it up.

678
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,520
All right.

679
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,920
But what of Wolwo?

680
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,400
We forgot Wolwo.

681
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,980
In the great rush of progress of the 20th century,

682
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,000
all of the deities left by the roadside

683
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,460
have forgotten the Hells Asia all the way.

684
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,980
He had a Swedish affirmation, it's not to say.

685
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,820
The miracles of the Purim that had begun in thee

686
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,920
have been done by Sodom and Gomorrah.

687
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,340
They would have repented long ago in Cyclothane.

688
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:11,660
Epluap.

689
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,960
And the other stupidly named deities of the forgotten pantheon.

690
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,220
What is he talking about?

691
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,840
Oh, Saint Stupid.

692
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,780
He's talking about Saint Stupid.

693
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,340
Might as well be.

694
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,600
He's got to be talking about Saint Stupid.

695
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,540
Same difference.

696
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,600
He won pretty true saint.

697
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,060
That's right.

698
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
Four for two, four for three.

699
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,580
Six and a half dozen of the other.

700
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,320
Patron saint of civilizations and...

701
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,360
parking meters.

702
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,060
But you don't know that.

703
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,040
You're not Catholic, are you?

704
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,440
So it's all like church stuff?

705
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,420
It's all church stuff all night long.

706
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,160
That's right.

707
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,160
Another hour and a half.

708
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,860
Another hour and a half in your ear.

709
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,600
Church on one channel.

710
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,100
Pornography.

711
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,620
Hardcore porno on the other.

712
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,540
Or you could call in now and stop the show.

713
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,860
You could call in at the 1-0-VAL-4-8-4-4-2-5

714
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,420
and stop the show now.

715
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,180
That's literally true, isn't that?

716
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,720
That's the way he would have wanted it

717
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,220
if someone would have given him a chance.

718
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,300
Absolutely.

719
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,580
That's the choice.

720
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes.

721
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,420
Had they really thought about it and dialed.

722
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,740
The 1-0-VAL-4-8-4-4-2-5.

723
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,220
As many men...

724
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,480
Could call in now and stop this madness now.

725
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,280
That's right.

726
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,540
That's the way he would have wanted it

727
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,260
if he wouldn't have wanted it that other way.

728
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,900
Ladies can call free.

729
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,560
Tell us there was not in this horrible heat...

730
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,520
Wait, that's you.

731
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,680
What the heck is going on?

732
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,740
No, that was my mentor, Jimmy Swaggart.

733
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,720
I studied him.

734
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,840
Oh, they were animals and not human beings and...

735
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,120
He's talking about last week's...

736
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,840
Let's go eat some vegans for breakfast after this show.

737
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,900
I give you my word, I will smite this cancer.

738
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,840
Smite, smite, smite.

739
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,060
Smiting, some more smiting.

740
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,200
Must be a band thing.

741
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,500
Smite you.

742
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,680
No, Smite was the guitarist.

743
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,900
He's the lead guitar guy.

744
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,780
The United States Supreme Court...

745
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,380
Oh, I used to listen to the Smites.

746
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,180
He may be a human life, but...

747
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,680
Come up now.

748
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,300
Although he may have a heart and a brain...

749
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,940
What's his name?

750
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,540
He lacks courage.

751
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,360
Hicks.

752
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,800
But all he...

753
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,580
What do they have that he doesn't have?

754
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,380
They have medals of honor and valor.

755
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,160
We should not concern ourselves about him because he has no legal right.

756
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,940
Bob had no legal right.

757
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,060
Bob was not a man as we call men.

758
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,980
But let's leave things of this world behind.

759
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,660
But let's leave things of this world behind.

760
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,100
But let's leave things of this world behind.

761
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:36,920
We'll walk down the primrose path of Bob's gauntlet of torture.

762
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:36,920


763
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,080
What?

764
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,360
Gabrofine...

765
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,680
What?

766
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:39,680


767
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,000
I can't say gabrofine.

768
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,140
The Supreme Court said it better.

769
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,700
The Supreme Court said it...

770
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,420
Don't call me a gabrofine.

771
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stank.

772
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,480
Yes, these wonderful moments of the past can be yours today.

773
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,560
If you call in now.

774
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,080
If you call in now on the miracle of MP3.

775
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,640
Over 700.000.

776
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,400
No, 200.000 hours of subgenius broadcast.

777
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,440
On one cv.

778
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,660
On one cv.

779
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,780
More than you can listen to in an entire lifetime, and you'll be forced to.

780
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,620
Don't screw me.

781
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,160
Incredible.

782
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,600
7.5.

783
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,740
You'll be influenced by Donstown.

784
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,400
Dolly .

785
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,760
Donstown.

786
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,520
Donstown.

787
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,340
Where am I going?

788
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,140
Help me.

789
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,840
Why am I going to...

790
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,560
Did I win that cd?

791
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,300
Yeah.

792
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,860
Now listen to this song.

793
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,260
And it's hypno-theory.

794
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,820
Ironically enough, the Dobstown song is from Lee Murray.

795
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,200
That's right.

796
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,940
I thought it was Wilbur Harrison.

797
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,740
He knows that.

798
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,380
I mean, we must brainwash our children.

799
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,800
What are you guys on when you're doing that show, man?

800
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,300
Oh, yeah.

801
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,240
Come on, you can tell me.

802
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,760
I see you've done a toilet on your floor.

803
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,900
Hey, Song.

804
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,040
Song.

805
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,200
Caller.

806
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,880
My little son, Caller.

807
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,440
This song is dedicated to you and your trippy amp today.

808
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,840
Can you just fast forward the whole show?

809
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't want to get out of here.

810
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,940
I went to downtown already.

811
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,720
No, down.

812
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,580
Just, you know, go down.

813
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,520
Down.

814
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,520
Just go down.

815
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,340
That's not a show.

816
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,180
Oh.

817
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,240
But I did.

818
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,720
I did.

819
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,720


820
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,720


821
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,720


822
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,720


823
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,100
No, come on.

824
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,860
Just down.

825
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,160
Hey, how's it going?

826
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:32,440
Just go down.

827
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,200
And then say stereo.

828
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,680
I am a tape.

829
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,740
Fernando Mandela.

830
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,700
All those cutouts.

831
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,020
Reverend Isaac's dying in the studio.

832
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,900
You know, Slack mixes by you.

833
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,920
I've heard you in the forums.

834
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,900
And all else that has that power.

835
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,880
I know.

836
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,220
Which one? Oh, tiene menina!

837
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,880
You seem a little nervous, my friend

838
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,240
You are the strength of my soul!

839
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,180
You're selling me from beyond!

840
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,800
You'd better be ready

841
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,340
To speak your piece

842
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,720
You call me from beyond!

843
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
You disturb my rest of sleep

844
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,880
With your childish games

845
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,020
You don't know what you're playing with

846
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,920
Listen!

847
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,800
Listen, I give a little voice in your soul

848
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,300
This is your life

849
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,300
Look, we're not just another stupid army of elephants!

850
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,180
Listen to your music backwards in reverse

851
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,980
It's the joke they were putting on the show!

852
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,740
You're in the...

853
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,200
Heavy metal! Heavy metal! Heavy metal!

854
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,960
I'm on stage right now!

855
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,040
We're only in the hollow, cut!

856
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,080
The bottom is dry and loose!

857
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,620
Heavy, get it?

858
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,880
Cool!

859
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,880
You ran for me!

860
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,600
I used to be a nice guy just like you

861
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,260
And then I found

862
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,840
The truth is in the deep

863
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,860
You know I'm a soul which I will eat alive

864
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,900
I'll mix you up and spit in your face

865
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,500
But you're not my enemy!

866
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,960
You're not my enemy!

867
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,020
You're not my enemy!

868
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
You're not my enemy!

869
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,820
You ran for me!

870
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,880
You couldn't be ready to face the consequences

871
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,140
It's never too late to redeem yourself

872
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,180
One last chance

873
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,600
That's all you have

874
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,540
It's up to you

875
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
You ran for me!

876
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,300
You rang from Reverend Bill T. Miller.

877
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:05,040
And you can get a lot of free Reverend Bill T. Miller music from www.billtmiller.com.

878
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,660
Bill T. Miller dot com.

879
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,060
When girls go by, then I play high.

880
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,640
I thrill them with each note.

881
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,000
Ha!

882
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,060
Oh, how I get their goat.

883
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,820
I'm the fellow with the fiddle.

884
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,360
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.

885
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,660
I make a smile from every round.

886
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,180
And every time I start to play, I say the whole of Dorna Town begins to sway.

887
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,400
A votey, votey, votey, and a frat's hat's hair.

888
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,760
A rooty, tooty, tooty, and a razzmatazz.

889
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,140
When I play, though, the girls say, oh, and tremble like they're freezing.

890
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,200
I know that I'm the reason, for I'm the fellow with the fiddle.

891
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,320
When I play, they look at me like I'm the boy.

892
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,500
Just a little girl, she'd come in, and she'd see, she'd know it.

893
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,900
She said she can run all around.

894
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,980
And she'd want to ask her mother for a fiddle.

895
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,600
And she learned to sing for it.

896
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,040
She'd tell her mother, say, sing for your fiddle, and you can get it.

897
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,680
And she'd jump out in front of him and sing.

898
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,460
Give me a little fiddle.

899
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,380
No, Titty Mama Titty.

900
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,460
Titty Mama Titty.

901
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,760
Just gimme a little titty, please ma'am Just gimme a little titty, please ma'am

902
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,140
You're a

903
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:48,260
Titty on the hill, mama Just gimme a little titty, please ma'am

904
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,220
Thank you.

905
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,940
Thank you.

906
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:54,080
Like the smartest amoeba that ever existed and the most mindless man.

907
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,060
He was like big brother and little daddy at the same time.

908
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,260
You felt like love, hate, and one emotion at the same consternation.

909
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,040
Right, like the tallest midget and the shortest giant.

910
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,360
You knew both concepts at one time.

911
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,920
You'd see him, you'd know height and small at the same time.

912
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,640
You could feel it, you could smell it.

913
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,600
He was like the essence of everything.

914
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,260
Like the cleanest dirt.

915
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,120
Oh, they used to use that clean dirt?

916
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,000
Bob used to give off clean dirt that sprang flowers and little vegetables out.

917
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,140
He was like the driest water.

918
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,500
He was like Santa Ana winds blowing a big old polar bear.

919
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,540
Or trying not to.

920
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,180
He was like burning hot ice.

921
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,580
He was like that polar bear in a bad dance club.

922
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,880
He was like the furniture you can't believe in and yet you try.

923
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,720
He was the source.

924
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,040
He was the...

925
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,520
He was...

926
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,200
Bob!

927
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:47,800
Bob!

928
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:47,800


929
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:48,860
Bob!

930
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,680
Bob!

931
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,540
Bob!

932
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:50,960
Bob!

933
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,720
He's gonna be back.

934
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,840
I know he's gonna be back.

935
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,120
I know he's gonna be back.

936
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,220
He's gonna be back.

937
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,220
J.R. Bob Dobbs, if you're listening to me now.

938
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,360
I have faith!

939
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,640
He's gonna be back.

940
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,760
Faith in you, Bob!

941
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,700
He made the salmon sweat.

942
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,360
He made the eye cheese come out where it's not supposed to grow.

943
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,140
He made the Eskimo buy ice.

944
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,240
He made the ice for the sorcerer.

945
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,340
And he kissed each and every one of them with an Eskimo.

946
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,900
He sold hate to the Nazis.

947
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,060
He gave love.

948
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,840
He gave love wherever he could find a place to sit down.

949
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,280
He sold hypocrisy to the Baptists.

950
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,940
He sold retardation to the subgenius.

951
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,860
He sold water.

952
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:47,840
He sold...

953
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,240
He sold...

954
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,240


955
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,240


956
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,320
He sold water to old Saint Nick.

957
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,720
He sold a fluoroscope to his uncle.

958
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,780
And then he sold himself out of business.

959
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,320
But he still kept on being and seeing and being the source.

960
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,660
He had insurance, my friend.

961
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,780
Bob had insurance.

962
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,340
Did you?

963
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,600
Do you have Bob's insurance policy?

964
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,820
Bob, if your insurance policy, my friends,

965
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,140
and it's just one payment you make,

966
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,920
the premium lasts forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

967
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,160
It never comes back.

968
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,340
And if you, for any reason,

969
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,100
you should chance to die or drive into a car

970
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,720
or perhaps just fall asleep and not wake up sometimes,

971
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,580
that's your problem.

972
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,540
That's Bob's?

973
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,620
He's your insurance policy?

974
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,480
And he's what kills you both at the same time?

975
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,560
Bob resold your insurance policy

976
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,300
to a crooked bunch of weird scam artists at the Pentagon.

977
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,860
Because he loved you.

978
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,220
He had so much love for you.

979
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,100
Look, look, look at his leg.

980
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,540
He's loved.

981
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:47,900
He's loved.

982
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,240
He's loved.

983
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


984
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


985
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


986
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


987
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


988
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


989
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


990
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


991
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


992
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


993
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


994
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,240


995
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,600
He's loved.

996
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:48,900
He can't.

997
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,000
Bob loves you more than you love anything.

998
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,180
Oh, those chromosomes are so bleak.

999
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,340
But at the same time,

1000
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,400
if you could just pack one little bit of that essence.

1001
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,140
They're rock hard, the chromosomes are.

1002
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,800
You'd be rock hard like those chromosomes.

1003
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,680
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,940
I'm not a baby dangler.

1005
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm not a baby dangler.

1006
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,760
Bob's a baby dangler.

1007
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,360
He dangled you at the moment of your birth.

1008
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,100
And it's taken all this time.

1009
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:18,740
Are you going to wake up?

1010
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,460
Is he going to smack you?

1011
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,460
Are you going to wake up and start breathing and being alive?

1012
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,240
I'm a baby boom, boom, bang.

1013
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,460
Are you going to just be a reprobate?

1014
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,680
It should be on your DTO screen now.

1015
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,160
Reprobate.

1016
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,860
Pay close attention to the following transmission.

1017
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,660
Your eyes may become unfocused.

1018
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,940
You may feel heat around the back of your neck and shoulders.

1019
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,420
The forehead may become indented.

1020
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,480
Ooh, that feels good, Bob.

1021
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,180
Further down.

1022
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,020
A little further down.

1023
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:47,980
I'm phasing.

1024
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,780
I'm phasing now.

1025
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,200
I got a squishy.

1026
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,680
Wait a minute.

1027
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,940
Pipe down.

1028
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,280
Pipe down in there.

1029
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,220
Bob's trying to sleep.

1030
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,420
Hey, pipe down.

1031
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,620
Bob's trying to sleep.

1032
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,100
Relax.

1033
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,420
Let go.

1034
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,940
Oh, it's very, very easy.

1035
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,460
Here you go.

1036
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:17,980
Yeah.

1037
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,000


1038
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1039
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1040
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1041
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1042
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1043
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1044
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1045
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1046
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1047
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1048
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1049
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1050
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,240


1051
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:18,840
You talk to the leper first.

1052
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,180
You don't encourage the leper.

1053
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,140
You talk to the leper.

1054
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,420
It's hard for a leper to change its patches.

1055
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,660
You're in there.

1056
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,440
Bob's got some special glutes.

1057
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:35,440


1058
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,300
Bob's got some special glutes.

1059
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,000
You're in there.

1060
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,900
Bob's got some special glutes.

1061
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,880
You're in there.

1062
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,100
Hey.

1063
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,080
A little throttle today.

1064
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,920
APPLAUSE

1065
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,880
Looks scary enough.

1066
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,720
A good song is the same.

1067
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:13,100
Tell me a story.

1068
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,840
Tax assessor?

1069
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,520
Tax assessor?

1070
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,760
A little music there from Fellow with a Fiddle,

1071
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,900
and now more from Reverend Cobblestone's collage.

1072
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,640
The global war of, I think it's the one world order, the new world order, whatever you want to call it.

1073
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,800
The culture of death.

1074
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,020
The culture of death.

1075
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,600
You know, I guess I was vaguely weak, but until you said it flat out, it hasn't been in my consciousness.

1076
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,020
Isn't that special?

1077
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:38,180
Well, I think you learned here that there was a sense among all charities that the American values had some value.

1078
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,320
I'm not going to take that right.

1079
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,000
No, I'm not going to.

1080
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,080
Let's have a moment.

1081
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,060
A moment of silence for the little twinkle, twinkle little stars that burned up in the atmosphere.

1082
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,140
Yeah, that is kind of, you know.

1083
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,900
They got off.

1084
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,140
They got off.

1085
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,420
You know, I'm always so radical in my stances.

1086
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,920
I get all sheepy when I think of, what's your name, the Indian girl.

1087
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,040
Dave's got the hot, he's looking at the pictures.

1088
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,580
Well, I have, I have no necronomicon or whatever you call them.

1089
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,940
You know, I'm not a necrophiliac.

1090
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,960
Or affiliated with any of those.

1091
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
You're an asher.

1092
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,020
An asher.

1093
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,000
And I can try.

1094
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,860
I, eh, I like a try, don't I?

1095
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:15,860
Eh?

1096
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,380
Just add water and you're back to, all the basic ingredients, just make them up in your own mind the way you want them.

1097
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,520
A moment of silence is a kind of a heart.

1098
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,320
A little crack.

1099
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,320
When you have a day.

1100
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:29,700
Did you hear?

1101
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,400
A day.

1102
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,020
It's a moment of silence.

1103
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,880
God bless America.

1104
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,320
God bless the space program.

1105
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,880
And may we continue to shoot monkeys into space.

1106
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,040
In the name of science.

1107
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:44,820
Yes.

1108
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,060
Yes.

1109
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:51,480
It's the best way, it's a better reason for killing people than some you can come up with.

1110
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,220
Yeah.

1111
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,860
May we continue to hook small animals up to car batteries to see what happens.

1112
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,980
Plastics are the building blocks.

1113
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,280
That's a taxpayers expense.

1114
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,060
And also about the things.

1115
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,520
Work for me.

1116
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,480
After all, the shuttle program was funded by CIA drug money.

1117
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,280
I thought you were going to say CIA druggies, you know how good they are at fooling things.

1118
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,200
No, it's all funded by the CIA drug money.

1119
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,660
And labored smuggling.

1120
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,720
Why do you think they called the first shuttle Columbia?

1121
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,220
Can I ask you a secret question?

1122
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,300
Are you a bonesman?

1123
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,440
They don't want you touching the wreckage.

1124
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,320
They're afraid you'll find the CIA stash that was hidden in the cargo bag.

1125
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,120
Bales of cocaine falling all over Midwest.

1126
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:26,740
The aliens.

1127
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,640
Well, I think Chaz had it right on the nostril.

1128
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,260
No, it was actually Stang who had the wrong nostril, right?

1129
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,480
You claim.

1130
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,460
They discovered the dangerous satellite they were putting out in the nick of time.

1131
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,660
And we're about to land and explain what had happened.

1132
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,520
And they were silenced by them.

1133
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,180
Good night.

1134
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:42,900
Good night.

1135
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,980
Good night.

1136
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,660
Good night.

1137
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:44,800
That's right.

1138
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,300
Till next week, keep your hat on tight, you're back to the wind, you're sacking the saddle.

1139
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,880
See y'all.

1140
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,600
Give your sack to Princess Wayne.

1141
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,460
Become an astronaut.

1142
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,440
Achieve your dreams in the sky.

1143
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:04,400
Look to the blue as your nostrils inflame, you will realize...

1144
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,340
Now the party's over.

1145
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,540

1158

Good night.

1159

1160

1165

Whoa, whoa.

1166

No way.
