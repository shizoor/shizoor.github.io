The western man is at once mournful and menacing.
Why? Why this terror of the man?
It is not his appearance that stops our heart.
The opposite.
His invisibility.
It is possible to live in the same habitat for years and never encounter him.
He is elusive.
We know he is near, for we see his tracks.
We know he kills, for we see the remains.
We know he lives because we hear the howl.
The last peel so frightfully piercing is to go through your heart.
About 20 yards to my right.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast.
This time we take you to Washington for a special broadcast on the national emergency.
The radio, remember? Make it work.
The hour of slug.
So you did bust it.
Stations aren't strong enough in the daytime. Tonight it'll work.
Tonight it better.
Can't you smell it?
Then came a message from a distant star.
Earth needed lovers and they wanted to be ours.
Here they are.
On the Ministry.
leichter....
Historical.
Human.
Water me.
It's ferment change forms within nature.

Yes!
Oh, yes, dear friends.
That was the Exposed Foreheads, or I should say that was a band called Exposed Foreheads,
using the letter X at the beginning and the numeral 4.
And I'm looking forward to seeing them play at the devotional.
That's the Devo Convention, as it were, for the devotees this August.
And it's also, that particular song was a great one to kick off X Day.
X Day, and our guest, Dr. Howl and Owl.
Yes, I'm here in this special pre-X Day broadcast.
Yes, X Day is coming.
Dear fiends, this is your irritating horror.
I'm your host, Dr. Howl and Owl, to tell you about some of the wonder, the terror,
the nightmare, and the ecstasy of merging with the unfathomably unthinkable.
At X Day, the apex of all human life and activity, and the end point for a shaken and stirred
planet.
Now, this is the end point for a completely new chapter of X Day.
Yes, friends, X Day, never a duh moment.
X Day.
X Day.

X Day.
X Day.
X Day.
All those guys sit around without any pants on, drinking beer.
Is that what it's all about?
It doesn't sound that good to me.
I don't know.
There is that.
There is lots of that.
There is lots of standing around.
and the road yakking.
Naked?
And drinking beer?
Well, we call it sky-clad.
Clothing optional.
Unlike many national parks at this campground,
it is legal to feed the sky-clad seniors.
Yes.
Yes, they'll gobble up those treats
if you're of a mind
to cast them out of the car
with the windows almost completely rolled up, of course.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Friends, for those of you
who don't know what we're talking about,
and you probably already tuned out anyway,
X-Day is, well,
it's the prophesied end of human reality.
Yes.
You and we know it.
And we know it.
In our religion, the Church of the Subgenius,
our high E-popped J.R. Bob Dobbs,
bless his sweet...
name.
And pipe.
Predicted, or rather prophesied,
he was given to know, in fact,
by, sure, let's call them the gods,
that on the day of July 5th,
at 7 in the morning,
the world will be destroyed,
and only the worthy will be saved.
Lifted up onto, well,
flying saucers, you might say,
although that's a...
It will be destroyed, or so profound,
and it will be completely transformed,
that one cannot tell the difference
between that and complete immolation.
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
another strange...
It's a lonesome, lonesome time.
His lonely vigil.
For loneliest individuals.
Yes.
Is that what you said?
There are certain ones who occupy a realm outside
that straightened purview of the law,
who feel uncomfortable obeying all of society's
petitions.
I was having similar thoughts just earlier
about interspecial marriage and stuff like that,
and I was thinking,
if you were raised to feel like a dog,
or to feel like a cat,
shouldn't you use the same restroom facilities
as a dog or a cat?
Well, we will be out there at Wisteria.
Everybody uses the same basic facilities,
those blue...
Yes, humans and livestock
thunder into the receiving space.
This that means they don't know whatming kind of animals



Well, there are those living creatures
creatures pull them from theafood sauce,
and they go and get food.
Yes.
Are they trained in yoga?
K temperatures?
And they have high.
No?

No.
There will be a turtle.
Yes, one turtle to rule them all.
But on the other hand, there might be others.
It's a biological hotspot teeming with life forms of every description.
There's a mocking turtle sloop down by the old graveyard river there thing that empties into the bottom.
Well, we don't mock the turtle that's there.
No, and he does worse than mock people.
He snaps toes, doesn't he?
Well, he takes one subgenius a year.
He might leave a toe or two behind.
We let him take one of us so that he won't come and destroy all of us.
Although this particular year, I'm sure this will be 1998, and this time the world will end.
The real 1998.
Right, finally.
Finally.
And if it's...
Well, let's just not even go there.
It's a terrible thought to think that so many years have passed by just waiting and maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe nothing could happen.
Yes, to puny human lifespans, but in the long history of time, hardly a blip or squiggle.
Hardly.
Well, the fact that we've waited over 20 years now for 1990, well, almost 20 years for 1998 to happen,
it proves that Bob was just teaching us that we had to kiss our cats.
Yes.
Yes.
We don't know.
We don't even know what planet this is.
Stop trying to control time.
Yes.
Yeah, I was just thinking that same thing, too.
I was thinking that if that had gone that far along the lines of what Stan was just saying,
there's no way of knowing how many X days have really gone by.
That's right.
It could have happened 150 years in the past.
Right.
Well, that would be an unpleasant and unforeseen...
Yeah.
...eventuality.
Yeah, it seems like we would have heard about it.
That would demote us all to the status of some etiolated cargo cult,
meaninglessly enacting rituals whose actual use had long since passed.
Well, there's a lot of people who actually...
Lots of people describe us that way, Dr. Howell.
In fact, I believe my old friend Nenslow was berating me about that very thing, mocking me.
What's odd is that Nenslow has had such a violent antipathy,
to the church, that he now claims he never had anything to do with it.
His printed articles notwithstanding.
Goodness.
Yes, he doesn't wish to become the Donald Trump of the Church of the Subgenius,
denying what is provable from the known and extant records.
What a revisionist.
Well, in that way, he's kind of like the farting corpse in that movie that's just got going.
Oh, really?
Well, everyone knows corpses do that.
Well, what I'm saying...
What I'm saying is he ceased to function in the lineal world,
and now he's in a peripathetic world,
where only onions stink, or something like that.
You know, something poetic.
Actually, he's a great artist, and he's just off on his own path.
Yeah, I don't blame him a bit.
It's funny.
Just yesterday, he and I had an exchange on that thing called Facebook.
He was going, yeah, yeah, Bob stuff.
You just add Bob to anything current, and suddenly it's all bobbed up.
I remember that was easy.
I said, and I meant it,
that, dude, you're stuck in the 80s.
And he said, and he meant it,
no, you're stuck in the 80s.
And I said, why not both?
And then Reverend A.P.O. Stacey jumped in and said,
now, am I going to have to separate you two?
Yes, it's incredible.
What happens too often?
Well, men of large ego often come to grips with each other,
or come to blows.
Oh, I wouldn't know anything.
Anything about that.
No, of course.
Existing in a state of philosophical equanimity and sublime dispassion.
Don't mix me up with Bob.
I'm just a sacred scribe.
Ruling blandly and effectively over a large unruly group of yet unmolded postulants.
Ringmaster of the cat circus.
That's me.
Yes, and some meows perforce must not be ignored.
Now we're just...
We have to deal from time to time with the cat scratch fever of the Church of the Subgenius.
What's that called?
The screeching, the digging of divots of fur out of...
Cat scratch fever?
Nagliera amoeba, something like that.
Nagliera nefertiti, that's the brain-eating amoeba.
Not to be taken lightly.
Incidentally...
Incidentally, Dr. Howell, you know, an Ohioan died of that recently in West Virginia.
Uh-oh.
It's a bad way to die.
Yeah.
West Virginia's a lot...
Well, I think coming from an Ohioan being in West Virginia is a bad way to die.
Well, the reason I bring that up is we have this full immersion baptism.
West Virginia.
Normally.
Normally.
But I'm beginning to think, Dr. Howell, that when we're dunking those people, what we maybe
ought to do is just sprinkle them with...
With a little holy water, Chris.
But we're not...
You don't think we should swim in the pond anymore?
We can swim all we want, but you know, when you and I dunk them, when we...
Yes.
We shove their heads underwater, that's a little different because you can get water
up your nose, and that's the pathway that the brain-eating amoeba takes to his dinner.
Well, I notice we've dunked many boys and girls, and have they suffered from brain-eating
amoebas?
How would we know?
They're subgeniuses.
Right.
How the hell would we know?
If you actually have qualms about this, naturally we will modify the program.
We had people hold their nose last year.
Yeah.
And shut their eyes tight so as not to behold the horror of all encroaching doom.
Or the pantsless subgeniuses standing around them.
Yes, that's the really hard part to take.
Yeah, it's hard to take, boy.
I tell you...
Last time you guys were doing pictures out there and stuff.
Yes.
A lot of these people didn't even look like human beings anymore.
They look like something...
Well...
Well, we tend to give them the benefit of the doubt.
They may not be human, strictly speaking, if you want to be niggling about anatomical
measures and rules.
We're not pictures.
But you can't keep dunking and dunking and dunking them as if they were some sort of
magnificent donut.
It is a ceremony.
I know it's part of a ceremony.
It has symbolic value.
It's more like...
The incarnation of a witch or the...
You know, when they used to get a witch, they'd keep on dunking and dunking.
Yes, well, if they were witches and they were innocent, they would sink.
But all subgeniuses float.
Oh, much like some other things that float.
Like ivory soap.
Like ivory soap.
Pure.
So mild it's pure and...
Right.
Like my lofty thoughts floating so high above this gutter of a world.
Exactly.
And like an old egg in a bowl of cold...
Cold water.
Down, down it goes.
Oh, a fresh egg goes down.
I've been referred to as an old egg in a bowl of cold water.
Have any of you?
I'd like to...
No.
Well, I...
Well...
I mean, not an egg.
It's not going to be easy to take these private memories out and air dirty laundry in public.
But in a sense, we are all eggs in embryo.
To Bob.
Waiting to be developed as we enter the profoundly transformative phase of our new life on the morning of July 5th.
Or flipped over easy.
Then you'll see what we actually are like as we reveal ourselves suddenly.
Our new selves.
Their brains scrambled like a piece of cheese.
They made their way to the side of the roof.
Perhaps not in accordance with...
Ideas of aesthetic purity or sublimity of the present time.
But everything will be remade anew.
Anew?
Sublimity?
Sublimity.
Wise on sublimation.
The meaning of putting words is sort of hiding things.
Keeping things under your socks.
Just keep an eye on your gun, Sergeant.
Things are going to get different around here.
A little different, see?
Heaven smiles and faiths and empires gleam like wrecked...
...tracks of a dissolving dream.
That's what it'll be like, won't it?
Yes.
The scales will fall from our eyes and...
...we shall see the new world in all of its...
...incredible complexity...
...and...
...strange beauty.
Is it there already or are we creating it as we are?
Well, I think it's like, you know, if you had special glasses you might be able to see it.
But we no longer...
...retail those glasses after...
...a certain dispute which took place several...
...years ago.
Uh, it's, uh...
The John Carpenter, right?
Yeah, exactly.
We settled with, uh, Mr. Carpenter.
But we are ready to go through that aperture of change ourselves.
And we already feel drawn there by a strange gravity-like force pulling us at first weakly and then faster and farther toward that one ecstatic moment.
The commingling of communion.
With...
...who?
You!
I wouldn't be excluded.
Ew, gross!
Ew.
Ew!
Ew!
All compressed into one ball of atoms.
Do I have to get into a phone booth with those guys?
Ew!
You know, stinky and slobber and smelly and so forth.
Gonna make a phone call to a place far far from here.
If...
...they will accept the charges.
That would move the music perfectly well, I must say.
Well, so you're hearing music, huh? That's normal. Many hear voices also, but now we know the origin point of these things.
You know, that's part of what being a sub-genius is all about.
It's the baloners of it all, the debajo, the debajo.
A portion of the brain, similar to chopped luncheon meat, which lies underneath the upper system of the convoluted human brain.
You're saying we all have lunch meat underneath our brains?
No, we all meet for lunch in our brains at a special time.
I'm hungry.
Hungry for lunch.
For decent thoughts.
Yes, well, they will flow like a never-lapsing flood come X-Day.
Sandwiched between the knees of the individuals who are ruptured up.
Yes, if you have mustered the intellectual acumen to deal with this cosmic sandwich, let us imagine that we can.
I've got the mustard, Sergeant. I've got the mustard.
How we will laugh at our primitive ideologies.
We will laugh at the ideas of organization and order when we are freed from them ecstatically in one snapping moment, like the breaking of ice in a thaw.
Suddenly, our spirits, let free from the gross bonds of matter, shall leap forward and upward into their new forms, at the same time ecstatically commingling with our alien concubines.
Well, you sound, you talk pretty under St. Louis Hooley.
I'm just...
I'm just reeling off the usual subgenius palafre.
What?
And we've spent our entire professional careers selling this clabber.
Work for me.
Yes, and it is now payday. It's now almost X-Day.
And what sort of mustard have you mustered?
Yes, listener, listener, what have you mustered?
Even this could be a controversial subject, you realize.
Oh, everything's controversial now that everyone's addicted to controversy.
Well, remember, just recently, the Republicans had a ragegasm because Obama ordered Dijon mustard on his hot dog.
And they went on and on about his namby-pamby, sissy, elitist ways, and he wouldn't have good old American French's mustard.
They really made a big thing out of it.
So, since the subject...
The subject of mustard is now being offered, I simply thought it was appropriate to warn our listeners that we are about to embark on seas of controversy.
It was well put, and there's all the collateral damages right next to it.
Everything's in perfect order.
It makes sense to me.
And I can see President Obama needs to understand why he should have good old French's mustard instead of a French mustard.
Mm-hmm.
Well, curiously enough, French's mustard is not French.
Nor are French fries French, but named after Mr. French.
But, naturally, Dijon mustard is, well, obviously, French.
Would you like some Grey Poupon, your Grey Poupon?
On your fruit and fries, monsieur?
Hey, hey.
Oh-ho.
Oh-ho.
Oui, oui.
Do-do.
I will meet you on the field of honor.
You have insulted me.
Gravely.
The mayonnaise on the French fries.
Hold still while I pink your cheeks.
Yeah.
And take my glove into the bargain.
I'm not a teacher.
I'm going to be doing the cheek on the back of your head.
Reverend Stang will act as my second.
Le jour de gloire est arrivé.
Actually, that could never...
Yeah, the day of glory here.
In good hands.
Right, right.
It's happening.
The day of glory is happening.
Yep.
Ex-day le jour de gloire est arrivé.
Yeah.
You know, guys, I was actually just now looking at my...
The website that I put on here, subgenius.com,
and on the events, the ex-day page,
I've realized I really...
Now that it's about to happen tomorrow,
I need to go in and remove some of these promises.
Well, for once...
Some of them are simple.
There's a sort of a costume ball on Saturday,
and it always had a theme.
Yes.
The theme was going to be dead rock stars this time.
It was going to, but it's been changed.
Yeah, we decided to throw,
along with the schedule and everything else...
Is it a costumeless ball?
It's a themeless ball.
A themeless.
It's a name-your-own-theme, right?
Yeah, name-your-own-theme ball.
I'm sure there'll be some dead rock stars there.
Theme ball.
I was thinking about...
Theme ball.
I was thinking,
what would be the easiest...
What rock star do I look like?
And I was thinking,
well, Jim Morrison, if he didn't die,
but actually went away to Africa for all these years
and then died just yesterday.
I could pass for that.
Leonard Skintone.
I find that hard to follow.
I'm sorry.
We promised a 24-7 bad film grindhouse,
and that will still happen.
Oh, boy.
I can't wait.
But it'll be...
It'll be...
It'll be...
It'll be...
It'll be...





It'll be...
And it won't be 24-7.
Mine, specifically.
It'll be on stage
when there isn't a radio show happening live, right?
Yeah, for the two hours a day
that we're not doing future hours of slack there.
At any time in the focus group,
do you ever say,
brothers and sisters,
gather around me.
I've got a story to tell.
And then you pull down your pants.
And then we dance.
We do our folk dances,
our subgenius folk dances.
Who knows, who cares,
who wears the pairs of dead man's pants
that dance in the darkness of the sun.
Yes, we throw everything to the winds.
And look at Oscar,
standing in the middle.
He has the strongest legs of all of them.
He dances twice as quickly.
Ah, spin in a twirl.
And a little jump backwards.
And now he grabs both ladies with each foot.
He's hungry.
And now,
la bobochaska.
La bobochaska.
La bobochaska.
There's a few new things on the X-Day non-schedule here.
We've added a loudest yeti contest.
That's probably already viral.
We'll hear the cry of the bull ape,
usually evoked by Lord Greystoke
with one foot on his panting victim.
Krieger, bundelo!
A mass eating contest
with a scrapple toss,
a pancake orgy,
frop beating,
and time killing.
A lot of time killing.
A scrapple toss?
I didn't know you had Philly's Favorite there,
down there in Southern Ohio.
Oh, we've got all sorts of things down there.
There'll be sideshow marvels.
And sideshow.
The circus apocalypse,
Andrew the Impaled,
will be there.
They are on their way.
Andrew wrote me and said,
who do I have to talk to about stage time?
And I said,
no one.
Just start up.
There is no organization.
Only your own,
own instinct will
take care of you on stage.
But does that mean,
Reverend Stang,
as long as we are on this,
perhaps distressful subject,
that there is no stage manager
at any time?
That they are fighting with
boxing gloves and brass knuckles
for preeminence on the stage?
That's the show, man.
All right.
That's the whole idea.
It's going to be like organic.
I want to play.
My band's going to play now.
No, I thought my band,
my band was going to play now.
Life is to the fittest.
The win is the creation
of the creation of X Day 2016, man.
It's just that simple.
Spontaneous doctor band combustion.
There'll be a troll shoot.
All the subgenius concepts
that are banned elsewhere
will be squirting out
all over the place.
Excitement.
Oozing off the stage.
That's lovely.
That one guy will puke.
And pass out in the road again.
That's a promise that's easy to keep.
At least he won't relieve himself
inside the podium this time.
Not this time, I hope.
That podium is still here.
That's why I got Dr. Dark
to carry the podium this time.
The pulpit.
Wouldn't want it in the vehicle
with us as we approach the site.
It is motorized, though, isn't it?
Isn't the pulpit motorized?
There's some sort of equipment
in the back.
It's been stripped over the years
and rebuilt.
It's been rebuilt.
It's been rebuilt.








Some who couldn't understand
its intricate mechanism
harmed it with their
primitive attempts to repair it.
Well, it has...
The flagellants, I think,
was the main...
It still has wheels.
Yes.
It still has wheels
and it bends in the middle
at the rubber hinge
so that the preacher can lean
right into the face
of the congregation.
That was Mark Mothersbaugh's
idea, by the way.
And the sounding board.
But it has to be pushed around
by minions.
It no longer can be driven
by the preacher.
Just the merest touch
of the lash
gets those little bodies
scurrying to put it
where it belongs.
We shouldn't have taken it
to Burning Man.
No, that wrecks everything.
That desert destroys
all mechanisms and machines.
They are destructive out there.
They will do...
They will mess your machines
right to well.
It's the alkaline dust itself,
which is the equivalent of acid
only on the other side
of the chemical continuum.
The plioflor.
It gets in things.
It gets in.
Everything.
And I mean everything.
It will give you plioflip
if you try walking around on it.
Take away things when they do.
There will be human fights,
acubating, psychic surgery,
bobby roping,
private adult sex hurt seminars,
bonobo chimp goblin contests,
and oddly normal seeming people.
They're the worst.
And, uh, of course...
Yeah, but they're the...
But, uh,


but, uh, but, uh, but, uh, but, uh,
although it may seem highly scheduled,
it's not as if your helicopter parents
arranged the whole thing.
There's plenty of time
just for good old goofing off
and scratching and spitting
and setting and lying
and munching and wandering
and, you know, unscheduled.
Swimming in the old swimming hole
with old sequoias.
As long as apparently
you don't allow any molecule of water
to get in any of your orifices.
Um, yes, all those things
can and will be
will happen.
What is the name of the virus
against Zinicula or something?
Oh, it's the brain-eating amoeba.
Oh, no, that's another one.
So I should look that up
and get it right.
And there's also the
Zinicula virus?
Neferticula.
Zarticula?
Uh, Reverend Stang
will look it up on his device.
Yeah.
Then we will know the answer.
Don't look at Reverend Stang's device.
Don't look at it.
What will happen if we look at it?
I can't even find it.
You may be enthralled.
You may be entrapped.
You may be whisked away
to a place you don't want to go.
Well, no, I'm not so sure
that that's necessarily going to happen.
As long as we...
We'll just tow the line
and stay on the straight and narrow path.
And if we start to slide,
we'll give a little whistle.
Yeah, that's what we'll do.
Well, here at the, um...
The ask...
Here at the heavy crashing,
in the bushes of some rough beast.
That rough beast would be
the Naegleria fowleri.
There you go.
The Ask Dr. Stang show
has the answer.
Naegleria fowleri.
Remember this little fella.
It's a fowl.
And he's named after the demon
of the subgenus.
Is that actually a word written
or two written backwards?
It is a genus and species name.
Of what?
Of a little amoeba
that climbs into your amygdala
and takes a big bite, chiller.
This does exist.
This amoeba does exist.
I'm afraid it exists
in the pond.
The huge, depthless pond
that is the place
where the baptism also
is performed.
Except...
Except when, as the sign indicates,
it's bottom.
It's bottom.
I've seen those ladies too.
Mm-hmm.
Well, that tends to happen,
but no one has plumbed
the utter depths
of old Sequa's pond.
Well, you guys could dress up
in funny suits and everything
and film it and everything.
No, we have that covered, yeah.
And go down.
Oh, yeah, you're going to do
a few hours on that?
Well, however long it takes
for the, you know,
to provide coverage, as they call it.
Well, if it's bottomless,
I think it's going to take
a long time to get somewhere.
Well, we're not going down there.
That's where old Sequa lurks
at the bottom.
The campground used to be
a strip mine,
so there's tunnels and mines
that go so deep
that they break through
to ancient caverns
that are prehistoric.
And not only that,
isn't there some sort of race
of frog men or amphibian men?
Well...
According to that map,
the Loveland amphibious men...
Oh, that's right.
Well...
They are another Ohio group of cryptids.
Isn't it close to where
the big floods were in West Virginia?
Not that close.
There was some flooding in Marietta,
which is not too far away.
No, it actually isn't very far away,
but a river doesn't run through it.
The Ohio River is far away from it, then.
Now, there's rumors
about strange creatures
out in the woods.
But,
but,

some of them aren't rumors at all.
I mean, for instance,
the Candiru toad,
those are real.
You don't want to...
Yeah, those are a bad thing,
but you have to be careful.
It's like when you're snorkeling
or scuba diving.
You're in an alien world.
It's better that you respect
all the life forms that you see
and not just assume
they're there for your loutish amusement.
And then you'll be all right,
probably.
And some...
Probably.
We have probably...
We have.
Even to mention them
would create great difficulties
for us now,
since this subject
has become controversial
in the latter days.
Are there not 2,000-year-old
Indian mounds as well
in that same area?
Yes, they are.
They're most certainly are.
They're shaped like the giant turtle
and other things that were...
Now, those are the ones
that the people that live
at the Wisteria campground made.
Dave is talking about actual Indians.
The Serpent Mound is in that area.
The Serpent Mound is in that area
and other actual Indian mounds
are in that area of southern Ohio.
John Keel's old buddy Mothman
lives not far away,
just on the other side
of the West Virginia border.
There have been pilgrimages
made there during...
What about Athens, Ohio?
Isn't there some strange legend
associated with that place?
Well, that's where the...
The Ohio University is.
The wise philosophers
sit around in togas
and booger young students.
Yeah.
Athens.
That's where many of the baby chameleons
first went to school.
We didn't know each other then.
Their shed skins litter the ground.
Multicolored, though.
They're pretty.
Pretty. Very pretty.
Yeah.
Well, let's see.
What bands are we going to have at X Day?
Let's see.
Is Hypercube a band?
What about Reverend Angry Larry?
Is he going to be there?
Well, Reverend Angry Larry
is most...
He's the head of the bands.
Well, then...
Let's face it.
Then we've got it covered.
If he's going to be there...
Reverend Sex Mortis,
or Sinfaltibus Ex Mortis,
actually is his name.
His band, X Day,
and the Ex Mortis Experience,
they'll be there,
and they'll be bringing
the drum set.
That's always important.
The drumsticks,
the thighs,
the backs,
the wings.
My band,
Vulcan Jedi Mentat,
will be playing.
And, of course,
Pooh Water Towel.
Doctors for Wotan, per se,
won't be there this year
because Philo and Chaosmic
are moving.
Yes.
They're moving towards Wisteria,
but they're doing
a little too slowly.
But they'll...
They're moving all of their stuff.
...be spiritually present.
Yeah.
But that means I have to do
all of the Doctors for Wotan
lyrics myself.
Luckily...
With your nasal drip,
I can just...
Just imagine the problems
that's going to cause.
Oh, I got my nose flute.
In fact, I think I have it
with me right now.
That's quite all right,
staying.
No demonstration is necessary.
Get that thing out.
Get that nose flute.
I'm right here.
Oh, well, I suppose so.
I vote aye.
I mean, get ready.
All right.
This is going to be
a real snorter,
ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, there it is.
I do a really good job.
Okay, now we're going to hear
Reverend staying on the nose flute
playing splatted over it.
Which is eczema cantata
in G flat.
I've never heard a flatter G
in my life.
Sounds like A flat sharp.
Oh, that sounds like
a disturbed mind right there.
Those are the reflections.
Perhaps disturbed,
but one aflame
with musical inspiration.
One which can C sharp
and B natural.
I can play the silver flute,
but I've never mastered
the nose flute.
Oh, we're doctors.
Doctors for Bob.
Doctors for Bob
and everything real in my life.
Yes.
Doctors for Bob.
That darn pickup truck
done run over my wife.
Doctors for Bob.
Oh, boy.
I can see this whole crew
of the mental case
is all about to get ready
to do this thing.
They're doing it.







They do.
It's very, very strange.
I'm glad I come here
first year of 19 February.
I think it was my grandfather
actually said he's going
to settle in Boston.
And then he goes to Wisteria
for the South Genius X-Day.
Branches of Wisteria
circumscribe a golden grin.
Yes, we can satirize ourselves,
make fun of our own foibles
and cantrips.
Sacred cow!
They're making fun of us!
Our holy cows!
Sacred blue.
Well, now,
you know,
one man's
cattle
is another man's
joke.
It's not your ox
that is being grown.
He who the ox to wrath
hath moved
shall never be by woman loved.
Keep them bobbies rolling.
Rolling, rolling, rolling.
Hi!
Don't try to understand him.
Just watch.
Whooping, rolling, branding.
Soon they'll be buried
by Bob's side.
I'm stuck in that pond.
Get me out of here.
My phone's calculating.
Dr. Sinister will be waiting.
Be waiting at the end
of this ride.
Roll hide!
Roll hide!
Through rain and wind
and weather,
hell,
bent for leather.
Wishing my gal
was at my side.
Oh,
it's long enough.
At any moment now,
the gals
from out of sight
head them up.
Move them out.
And here's this day, lovely.
Our typical, famous,
lovely woman
from another world.
Jane?
Yes?
Jane?
So you're from
another world, eh?
Yes, yes.
You're from another world, eh, Jane?
Have,
are coming here
to visit the humans
on planet Earth
on its last morning?
Jane?
Uh-huh.
What?
Where's we?
We is here.
Where are we?
Where is we?
Where are we?
We are here.
We has spoken.
We are there.
We'll start it up again, all right?
I am the woman
from another world.
Jane says that she's here
because, Jane?
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
Oh, nobody would believe
that one, Dr. Stang.
I'm not paying attention.
Sorry.
Yes, remember.
I'm so excited about X-Day.
It's been predicted
for millennia
and is inscribed
in the Great Pyramid
along with the sarcophagus
of the crumbling mummies
of ancient Egypt.
In the navel of the universe.
It's also inscribed
on a cherry pie
that was made yesterday,
the traditional annual
X-Day,
title pie.
Already partially devoured
in a ceremony
that you wouldn't want
to be present at.
Yes, that pie
has partially gone down
the gullets
of deserving subgeniuses.
I wasn't one of them, man.
I like cherry pie.
Why didn't you tell me
about that?
You have to have
the strength of faith.
You've got to believe.
I believe,
but I don't know
what I believe in.
You see,
in ancient Egypt,
if you took the spiritual journey
in the solar boat
over the river of darkness
in which the evil crocodile god
lurked ready to snap up your soul,
you would be restored and reborn,
just as Isis raised Osiris
from the dead
after he was chopped up
in little tiny pieces.
Pieces?
Yes, it's all been done
over and over again,
but finally these crude legends
will reach an exquisite enactment,
all on seven o'clock,
although some say 7.05 a.m.
on July 5th,
in a year which only we know
is 1998.
Edgar Cayce said it would be 1998,
and Nostradamus said it would be July 5th.
How can we go wrong?
I mean, those guys knew their onions.
You're going to argue with the pros and cons.
What is consensus?
Two of the greatest seers of all time,
each with their own conditionary
and their own methods,
left by followers of Mr. Howell.
They could only do
what they were compelled to do
by their inner natures.
Predict.
What did you just say?
Do I have to bleep that?
Predictably.
Predictably.
Postdictably.
Do you need to redact that?
No one needs to redact a prediction here,
not even the dateline for dominance,
which is always shown the way,
like a lantern in a dark cavern.
What about the dateline for dominance?
Did it not predict all along
this jagged course of events
which will unavoidably end
in the great clandestine?
The climax.
A dumbass will run for president.
Boy, that's what I was just going to say.
Yeah, who could ever figure that out?
Did it mention Donald Trump?
Yeah, that's what I was thinking also.
Well, unenlightened scribes and authorities
thought it was some reference to Donald Duck,
but it turns out to be Donald Trump.
But that's the nature of prophecy.
It's not really able to be comprehended
until it finally happens
in such an obvious way.
Bob indicated that the alien space god Jehovah One
tended to mumble at times,
so sometimes the exact wording of prophecy
was a little unclear.
He was senile even then
when the Sons of Mourning sung,
and he hung the great stars in the heavens
and set the earth on its foundations
and bid the weltering waves
their oozy channel keep.
He was old even then,
and now he's absolutely old.
He's absolutely senile and a danger to the continuum.
Hence the subgenius war on God.
Yeah, there's some kind of a maybe facility
for old gods, you know, where he could go
and at least people would take care of him,
let him go to the bathroom once in a while.
I mean, just think of the poor guy losing his wits,
and he's just still trying to run the universe.
Eric von Donikens, Nursing Homes of the Gods.
Yes, they're all there.
Those aged deities,
a whole lot of trouble for their followers.
Some you've never heard of,
but they demand constant slavish attention.
Hey, we're gonna have a firework.
...assisted living...
Like Ugabalus, who was a god in ancient Poseidonus,
which Plato called Atlantis.
Yes, this three-horned, one-eyed god
who wore a double diadem.
Now, no one...
...remembers.
And fishes swim in front of his blind brow.
But he's gonna be there demanding a piece of the action
with all the rest.
They'll probably be in the pond
waiting for what's-his-name, the turtle.
I'm glad I won't have to supervise it.
Well, you may be recruited and have to do that.
Say, boys, in this time continuum,
we're about five minutes from end of show, and yet...
That, too, was predicted by the...
...the ancient Egyptians.
And yet in another...
...in yet a different time continuum,
the other stations will experience this
in a more chopped-up manner.
But here, in this time continuum in Cleveland,
we're going to stay in the station for the next two hours...
And on station...
...with the noble...
...for the Church of the Subgenius.
...Dr. Sinister, who normally would be playing terrible music...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
...for the next hour, but it's gonna be us...
Terrible dialogue and...
...and we're gonna be playing instead.
But...
And this happens as...
It's like cosmic time, like the eclipse that was supposed to come in 2017,
which would come if astronomy was allowed to be left alone by the Exists.
Like that, this has happened in a regular pattern
and will now happen again for the last time.
Well, what I'm trying to do is get you guys to say goodbye
for about ten minutes while I do my technical thing,
and Dr. Sinister does his technical thing.
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.
If you would like a free picture of me in the nude,
write to Aunt Bertha.
Dial a story.
Box 1, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Goodbye now.
Goodbye.
Okay, Dave, you're gonna call back in about ten minutes,
which will seem like an entire week...
...to the other...
...to our noble other station, such as...

...which is WREK Atlanta and WORT and so forth.
Thank you for taking the time to call back in ten minutes.
And I'm going to get out, as it were,
by playing a Rudy Schwartz cover of a Swinging Love Corpses song.
Yes, the Swinging Love Corpses' sweet song,
Pick a Booger,
performed by the great Rudy Schwartz Project, coming up.
Friends, this has been Andy.
We're live now on the hour of Slack number 1,576
from the Church of the Subgenius.
For more information, see subgenius.com.
And we'll be talking to you in a soon time, Dave, time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then I think I push play on something.

Like a poker
So you're driving in your car and you're looking at your neighbor
Minding nuggets from his nostril like he's savoring the labor
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on a string
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain
Pick a poker, pick a poker
Pick a poker, pick a poker
Pick a poker
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain

Picked a poker
Pick a poker
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain
Pumpin' out of Livia from deep inside his sinus
Slave to the master, he's a royal highness
The kids all wanna have a hint crustaceans
Cause the Pick-a-Booger Boogie is the new sensation
He holds it, he rolls it, he's checkin' it for hairs
He flicks it away, but he's lookin' debonair
A green one on his finger, he's been flickin' it for days
Pick-a-Booger Boogie, it's the new dance craze
Pick-a-Booger, Pick-a-Booger
Pick-a-Booger, Pick-a-Booger
Yes, Drift Dance like
Sending your sign-in
to Arizona

A ray of sunlight is made up of many atoms
