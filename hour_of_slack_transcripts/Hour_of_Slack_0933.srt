1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Why are we here and where are we going? What is the meaning of life?

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,900
Your life is empty, looking for a meaning to personal existence.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,960
Women, drinking, partying. I partied up a storm.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,700
All this drinking, partying, and getting old. Drugs might be the answer. Why don't we try that?

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,940
Sounds like fun to me. Let's go for it.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,240
I really got into drugs.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,940
Acid, man, the way to open your mind.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,020
I had drugs were expanding my mind.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,360
You gotta promise me you'll try the LSD.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:40,180
I had always told myself what a nice, loving, honest, trustworthy, Boy Scout kind of guy I was.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,460
For your free packet of 666.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,700
The Dow that can be understood is not the real Dow.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,580
Man, I'm hurting.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,120
Then I had nothing.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,040
Decided to kill myself.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,000
It's worthless.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,260
Something went off inside of me.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,200
You may not be here next week.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,780
There.

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,400
Take this.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,000
Bingo.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,720
That's it.

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,680
So I got down on my knees.

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,260
I got back down on my knees.

25
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,040
But when I get down on my knees, it was dope.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,020
I had to do it.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
And I did.

28
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,160
Come inside.

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,340
The only solution to life's mysteries is to have women, drinking, partying.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,740
Our lives.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,280
Life.

32
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,500
Drunk.

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,980
Drunk.

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,560
Drunk.

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,580
Drunk.

36
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,040
Drunk.

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,200
Drunk.

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,620
Drunk.

39
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


40
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


41
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,620


42
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,040
Mr. Calhoun.

43
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,280
He said that when you ate the man, do you mind if I ask?

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,020
You said that afterwards your hunger was different than you felt wanton.

45
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,340
Yes.

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,720
Did you feel at all physically changed?

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,220
Stronger?

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,960
I seem to remember.

49
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,180
Something like...

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,680
that certain virility. Why do you ask?

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,320
You know, you look good in that chair, Bob.

52
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,840
Brings out your presence. Makes you look important.

53
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,540
Hey, well, y'all. House tricks anyway.

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,920
Not that I'm doing all that bad. I mean,

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,760
I'm not gonna be living the sweet life like you, Bob, but

56
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm learning to deal with that. I can

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,300
deal with it, Bob.

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,400
Is the chair comfortable

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,180
enough, Bob?

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,540
Gotta tell ya, definitely you, Bob. It is

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,260
you and this chair connect, Bob.

62
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,060
You can lean back if you want.

63
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,160
I like the way it does that.

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,220
See? Do you like it too, Bob?

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,720
That'll be my wife, Bob. I gotta go

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,760
now, but good luck with the election. You're a winner,

67
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,180
right?

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,880
Right, Bob. You're a winner. Success written all over you.

69
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,340
Well, see you later, Bob.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,200
See you later, Bob.

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,120
It's raining, Bob. Hallelujah, it's raining, Bob.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Amen.

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,560
Amen.

74
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,700
Amen.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:57,980
Amen.

76
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,180


77
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,180


78
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,180


79
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,180


80
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,580
Amen.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Amen.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


88
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


89
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


93
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


94
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,680


95
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,220
It's raining, Bob.

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,020
It's rained, Bob.

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,360
God.

98
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:24,180
It's raining, Bob.

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,120
God.

100
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,180
Good luck.

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
What? What? What?

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
Where is he?

103
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,300
Where is he?

104
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,220
Where is he?

105
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Wake up.

106
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,640
Wake up.

107
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,280
Wake up.

108
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,180
He was licking me.

109
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,480
What?

110
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,840
He was licking?

111
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,020
No.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,940
He was licking me!

113
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,080
He was licking me!

114
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,720
A load of hemp and rum

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,920
and sailed to the west coast of deepest, darkest Africa

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,100
where a star man

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,960
eat the living brains out of the head of another man.

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,100
Gather round the radio, children,

119
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,820
and I'll tell you a story.

120
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,080
A story about cannibalism

121
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,420
and how I lost this dear old leg of mine.

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,540
I remember this one.

123
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,900
Now.

124
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,680
I remember this one.

125
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,860
You know what cannibalism is,

126
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,440
do you, children?

127
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,500
It's when a man eats another man

128
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,500
or parts of another man.

129
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,840
No.

130
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,300
Now, don't be afraid.

131
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,560
Come up close to the captain.

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,840
The dildo man won't let any harm come to him.

133
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,820
If you want to give us a call, the number up here is 216-N-S-S-3-5-Val-

134
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,480
Phone lines are wide open and we are just aching to hear from you.

135
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,860
Uh.

136
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,840
One thing that really got me lately in the news,

137
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,100
this guy in Germany

138
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,740
cannibalized a man,

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,300
murdered him and butchered him and ate him up.

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,360
And he was given a sentence of like five and a half years because it was manslaughter

141
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,160
because the guy asked to be killed.

142
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,940
So it was really not considered murder, just manslaughter.

143
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,020
They called it man's laughter.

144
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,800
They called it.

145
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,480
So we're going to go to the phones right now.

146
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,240
They're lighting up fast.

147
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,920
You better call them.

148
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,280
Call while you can.

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:25,900
Hello.

150
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,940
Oh, hey.

151
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,020
Hey.

152
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,340
This is Reverend Stang.

153
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:31,800
What's up?

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,620
That German cannibal dude?

155
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,160
Yeah.

156
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,480
I understand from stuff I've been downloading off the internet lately that that cannibalism

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,640
is like a cool trend among high school kids.

158
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, come on.

159
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,500
Now that, of course, like, you know, of course I get into it now.

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,780
You know, I've been into cannibalism for a while and now suddenly all the cool kids are

161
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,160
into it.

162
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,100
Well, that's what I, that's kind of the impression I got that it had been something that was

163
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,980
just a few kids here and there, like, you know, I don't know, Hollywood type rich kids,

164
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,940
real weird kids, intellectual kids were doing it.

165
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:16,160
And then, you know, somehow it suddenly become really trendy and, you know, obviously there's

166
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,340
a health problem because if you got just anybody chewing off parts of each other, they're going

167
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,460
to get infected and stuff.

168
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,860
That's right.

169
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,280
We're going to see what another panelist might have to say on this matter.

170
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,660
Going to the other line here.

171
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,440
You're on the air.

172
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,560
Hello?

173
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,340
Is that him?

174
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
I don't know.

175
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,380
I don't hear anybody.

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,820
I think I, I think I psychically can tell you what happened.

177
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,500
Oh yeah?

178
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:42,860
Yeah.

179
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,300
The person that was trying to call you bumped the wrong button, like some kind of a chimpanzee.

180
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,940
I didn't bump it like a chimpanzee.

181
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,840
It was more like a, you know, a chimpanzee.

182
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


183
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


184
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


185
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


186
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


187
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


188
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,840


189
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,520
It was more an emotion of a gibbon, viper, I mean, you know, when I was looking at chimpanzee,

190
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,820
orangutan or something.

191
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,500
I mean, nevermind.

192
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,140
Orangutan.

193
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,520
But cannibalism is, is indeed growing across the land.

194
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,600
And a recent study in Nevada, teenagers, 15% of teenagers under 19 were found to have consumed

195
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,700
human flesh in one form or another.

196
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,860
We've got to form a partnership for human flesh free America now.

197
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,580
Yeah.

198
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,060
There's something really has to be done.

199
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,520
I don't know.

200
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,280
Just keep saying no.

201
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,160
There's a lot of infrastructure that we need really to rid ourselves of either this problem

202
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,080
or the motors or the demotors or, you know, any possible other evacuations we might want

203
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,480
to get out.

204
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,340
Well, here's a, here's a potential solution that I have to the problem.

205
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Instead of this horrible problem of people cannibalizing their friends and neighbors

206
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,220
and you know, internet lovers like the guy in Germany did.

207
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,040
Well, it's the thing, it's all consensual.

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,540
So what, whose business is it?

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,920
Yeah, really.

210
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,360
We're all soiling green to each other if we want to be.

211
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,700
Right.

212
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,580
Well, I'm, I still say it's time to break out the glass tubes.

213
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,360
Yeah.

214
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
And start a human flesh farms.

215
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,840
We can grow an encephalic human bodies or, you know, farm raisin.

216
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,120
Don't.

217
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,180
Oh, we certainly, we could nano, we could nano grow human tissue without a soul.

218
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,620
Right.

219
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,400
Just for eating.

220
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,780
Soul.

221
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,120
Yeah.

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,460
But that takes the whole.

223
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,680
Tenderloins and so forth.

224
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,400
Drill out of it.

225
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,220
You know, things.

226
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,700
Color number three, you're on the air.

227
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,320
This is Dion.

228
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,240
Oh, it's Dion.

229
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,760
Good to hear from you, Dion.

230
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,760
What's your take on the cannibalism issue?

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,560
Did you, could you, could you be honest?

232
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,560


233
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,560


234
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,560


235
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,320
I think a raspberry.

236
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,080
Have you ever eaten a person, Dion?

237
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,640
I, I always wanted to.

238
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
He never did though, huh?

239
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,900
He never did, huh?

240
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,060
Yeah.

241
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,660
Never consummated the act.

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,640
But you know, there are support groups now too.

243
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,780
If you want to eat another human's flesh and you really can't find the right human to eat,

244
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,260
you can network and stuff.

245
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
And this, this is how it happened in Germany.

246
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,780
But we're talking about solving a problem, not about exaggerating it.

247
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,220
You know what I'm saying?

248
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,620
Uh.

249
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,900
What, could, could you eat a certain part of the body?

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,360
Oh yeah, you know, different parts are good for, uh.

251
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,500
Hey, why don't you call us up?

252
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,300
It's the SQ715.

253
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,000
Tell us your favorite body part to cook.

254
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,960
But keep it clean, folks.

255
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,300
We're not in safe harbor yet.

256
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,020
Hey, hey.

257
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,060
Color number four, you're on the air.

258
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,680
Hello, it's Hell Pope Huey.

259
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,400
How the hell are you?

260
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,740
Well, how the hell are you?

261
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,440
Oh, Hell Pope Huey is one of the earliest, most ancient living, still living subgenius

262
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,480
radio ministers.

263
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,980
He was the first person to play any subgenius tape on public airwaves.

264
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,360
And I'm older than me and crankier than anybody but Gigi Gordon, I swear to God.

265
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Well, we were discussing cannibalism, which has become popular among teenagers and especially,

266
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,620
you know, it started in Germany and now everybody's doing it.

267
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,860
And, uh, the question was what body part would you most want to cannibalize off of your friend

268
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,660
or whoever you were doing it, doing the cannibalizing with?

269
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,160
Well, now it's easy enough to say you'd like to try some thigh off some of the women, but

270
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,040
that's really a wash.

271
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,740
I think I'd like to try a foot off some of them like legume.

272
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,680
I mean, he's kind of old now, but you want to slow some of them down because they're

273
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,080
dangerous.

274
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,780
So I think I'd start with the foot washed, of course.

275
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,020
Well, but this would be a, you know, somebody who would be a friend that was sharing meat

276
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:07,880
with you, I guess, you know, so you wouldn't be, it's just like, what would be your favorite

277
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,640
part to eat?

278
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,060
Just, you know, discounting whether you had to kill the person in order to eat them.

279
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,360
Well, I think it would probably be the calf off of Andrew because he's a dynamite cook.

280
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,540
And he'd come up with a good sauce because if he was a good sport enough to let me eat

281
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,420
part of him, he'd probably make a great sauce for it.

282
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,820
Don't you think?

283
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,840
Well, we don't, we don't know this, who this Andrew is that you're speaking of, but I'm

284
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,680
sure that his calf would probably be the finest if it was kept in the right kind of pen for

285
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,040
long enough without being allowed to move.

286
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,280
His calf would probably fatten up and be worth a lot more.

287
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,260
The fatted calf?

288
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,760
Like, and if you put them in a cast.

289
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,540
Oh.

290
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,340
A person who, uh, you know, you're not going to be able to eat them.

291
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,340


292
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,520
Well, if you're planning to eat, if you could possibly arrange that with someone who'd been

293
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,820
in a full body cast, it would be like having veal.

294
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,840
Oh yeah.

295
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,680
Well, now we could marinate some testicles, but then we'd get into that big homo thing

296
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,620
and that would lead an awful lot of trouble, uh, hard to discuss.

297
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,920
What is it, Pops?

298
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,680
Commies?

299
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,740
Eskimos?

300
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,840
No, son.

301
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,160
Eskimos haven't been a threat in years.

302
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,240
But well, you know, Ted Jenkins' son Wendell, don't you?

303
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,760
Sure.

304
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,180
From your company, Picnics.

305
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,220
But gosh, he's a great older than me.

306
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,320
He's a great older than me.

307
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,040
He runs with a pretty fast crowd.

308
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,740
That's a crowd your mother and I don't want you trying to keep up with, Bobby.

309
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,920
You see, Wendell was experimenting with...

310
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,200
Drugs?

311
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,220
Cigarettes?

312
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,360
Alcohol?

313
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,140
I wish it was alcohol.

314
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
Or even masturbation.

315
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,600
Wendell was experimenting with cannibalism.

316
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,960
His father caught him in the garage, eating his sister.

317
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,160
Cannibalism?

318
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,000
Gosh, I'd heard some kids at school had been trying it, but they were the kids from bad

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,320
homes whose parents didn't work as hard as you or Mr. Jenkins.

320
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,320


321
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,760
I mean, Wendell Jenkins, a cannibal.

322
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,580
Well, son, cannibals can come in any shape or size.

323
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,040
Some cannibals can run very fast.

324
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,980
Others are good at math.

325
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,340
Take the car tonight, Bobby.

326
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,460
It will calm your mother.

327
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,780
As a father, you have to wonder if the simple act of warning your child makes him want to

328
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,260
experiment.

329
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,260
Maybe we shouldn't tell teens anything.

330
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,280
Maybe then they'd grow up happy.

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


332
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


333
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


334
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


335
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


336
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


337
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


338
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


339
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


340
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


341
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


342
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


343
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


344
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


345
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,320


346
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,940
And then they'd be happy and safe.

347
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,560
So, Bobby, how was your date with Becky Sue?

348
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,620
Oh, uh, it was fine.

349
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,140
Well, goodnight.

350
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,220
Any problems with the car?

351
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,300
Ran like a dream, Dad.

352
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,640
Well, goodnight.

353
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,980
Say, Bobby, you and Becky Sue didn't experiment with cannibalism, did you?

354
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,240
Gosh, no, Dad.

355
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,260
Well, goodnight.

356
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,200
Son, what happened to your ear?

357
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,620
Oh, I, uh, caught it on a barbed wire fence.

358
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,280
Well, goodnight.

359
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,300
I couldn't put my finger on it.

360
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,820
But something told me that Becky Sue Johnson was leading my Bobby into a dark world.

361
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,820
Wait, you're cutting into his butt.

362
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,400
Well, what kind of piece do you want?

363
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,720
Well, not butt.

364
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,060
Four fat sausages sitting in the pan.

365
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,540
One went and another went.

366
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,120
Remarkable boy.

367
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,420
I do admire your courage.

368
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,180
Oh!

369
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,320
I think I'll eat your heart.

370
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,200
It's not what you think.

371
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,000
I was having a nightmare.

372
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,780
I was having a nightmare.

373
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,160
Your mind screamed.

374
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,940
I awoke.

375
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,640
I was on top of him.

376
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,520
My lips were on his wound.

377
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,980
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

378
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,820
Please, sir, restrain me.

379
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,020
Restrain me, Colonel.

380
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,100
I can't be trusted, please.

381
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,400
I insist.

382
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,420
Oh, my God!

383
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,000
What?

384
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,060
It's a cannibal!

385
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,300
Stay back, cannibal!

386
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,220
She's alive!

387
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,180
She's alive!

388
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,280
She's alive!

389
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,740
She's alive!

390
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,260
Hey, guys.

391
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,680
You know what I want from Bob Dobbs?

392
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,440
What do you want from Bob Dobbs?

393
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:04,560
I want to be something nice and something really warm and something really, like, wet.

394
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,980
A baby excrement you could probably be.

395
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,940
Well, it's not that nice, but it's certainly warm and wet.

396
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,740
You know what I want?

397
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,640
I want to be a baby.

398
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,800
Oh!

399
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,560
That's a good one!

400
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,540
I like that.

401
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,540


402
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,540


403
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,540


404
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,540


405
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,540


406
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,540


407
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,680
It is appropriate.

408
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,260
We could rent you one of those fainting goats for the weekend.

409
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,540
They're really warm and friendly.

410
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,120
Yeah.

411
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,860
Yeah.

412
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,760
They pass out at least four times a minute, buddy, if you're into that, you know what I'm

413
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:31,920
saying?

414
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, sure.

415
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,460
Say, say, say, say, say ...

416
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,980
No, not all of them.

417
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,360
I don't think you should make fun of people who are differently sexed or, like, last

418
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,700
... differently abled emotionally.

419
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,380
Well, so far.

420
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,620
Well, darn, Dang, that'd be pretty cool.

421
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:46,620


422
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,500
It shut down the whole church.

423
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,260
I know.

424
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:48,940
I'm just kidding.

425
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,540
That's the problem.

426
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,820
You know, the minute you go, God, there's sure a lot of creeps and retards and weirdos.

427
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,940
And, you know, suddenly you look in the mirror and go, oh, yeah, there's another one.

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
I think they're fractured.

429
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,300
I think they have a dysfunctional view of life, many of these people.

430
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,580
They call in.

431
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,040
They complain about their sexuality.

432
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,060
They complain about the webbing between their feet.

433
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,980
Like, everybody has something wrong with it.

434
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,500
I mean, you know, not necessarily.

435
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,760
Well, something wrong with it, you know?

436
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,040
Well, I like my webbing.

437
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,300
It helps me to swim better.

438
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,220
Well.

439
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,340
You have to look on these things as pluses, you know.

440
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,640
Pretty soon you're going to be swimming around in a bowl of liquid helium, and it's still not going to make sense.

441
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,840
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with my webbing.

442
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,360
God just isn't finished with me yet.

443
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,360
Yep, I am as God made me when he was drunk.

444
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,040
When he was on glue and hollow.

445
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Jimson weed.

446
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,780
Mmm.

447
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,480
Well, you know, there's a little stang in all of us, but you just have to keep swatting at it like a leg-humping terrier.

448
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,920
Trying to find some balance.

449
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,640
God, how disrespectful.

450
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,660
Don't tell Pope Huey.

451
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,580
He's always just making fun of me.

452
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,880
I can't say much because my farts are piling up like cannonballs.

453
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,120
I don't know what the hell I ate.

454
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
I've been stanged by a bee.

455
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,040
And it hurt.

456
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,960
You know what I'm saying?

457
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,880
It hurted.

458
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,920
It hurts.

459
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,120
It hurts.

460
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,700
When stang stangs you, you're hurt, man.

461
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,600
He stang people in the heart sometimes.

462
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,980
That's a...

463
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,360
God, come on.

464
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,080
You know that's not always fine.

465
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,840
Oh, it's a liquid vapid.

466
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
That's part of the satire, man.

467
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,160
Like the mental illnesses and the, you know, lawsuits and everything.

468
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,820
That's all just part of Bob's commentary on society.

469
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,040
It's for a bunch of miscreants who have very little left to do in life.

470
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
Oh, but at least they have this.

471
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,840
That hurt.

472
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,800
At least there's this.

473
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,500
This show.

474
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,220
At least there's that much left to us.

475
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,900
After everything else was taken away.

476
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,320
Dr. Sinister's show.

477
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,900
We've lost it all.

478
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,520
We've officially lost it all, then.

479
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,480
And Uncle QE's pelt.

480
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:06,500
We call this show Liquid Toppings about cannibals and things that are actually happening in this country right now.

481
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
This is not some sort of a bandwagon for a progressive movement.

482
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,280
This is not.

483
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,480
This is not.

484
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,480


485
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,480


486
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,000
This is not some sly bag's cheek effect to get in a laboratory at night and do something weird to your fingernails.

487
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,560
This is an honest attempt to examine the social phenomenon that's going on right now.

488
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,640
Well, that doesn't mean you can't do the fingernails thing.

489
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,240
That's part of it, too.

490
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,520
But Lord loves ducks.

491
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,280
And that's why we have to at least consider why people are doing this stuff.

492
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,720
Well, duck is expensive.

493
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,580
People are cheap.

494
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,360
People are cheap.

495
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,420
People have never been cheaper.

496
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,480
They're everywhere.

497
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:42,700
They're everywhere.

498
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:52,460
Wasn't there some news story about somebody bought some pottery at the discount place Mark's here in Cleveland,

499
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,040
and it had parts of human bones inside?

500
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,160
I read that.

501
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,480
You?

502
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,620
Yeah, it's like a skull hidden inside the pottery at this discount place.

503
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,480
Which made me want to run down there and buy up all the Virgin Marys and crack them open

504
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,640
and see if there was, you know, bags of cocaine and diamonds.

505
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,940
Makes you look at your sugar bowl a whole new way, don't it?

506
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,500
The ones with desiccated human liver give you a mortality.

507
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,800
It is a very, very, very old art.

508
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:30,420
Well, we're joking about how human is cheap and Soylent Green is people and only a science fiction comedy movie and so forth.

509
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,620
But really, think about it.

510
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:39,200
What is the most plentiful creature, edible thing going to be 50 years from now?

511
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,020
The cows are all mad.

512
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,360
The long pig dinner.

513
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,960
Young Christians, they'll be food and they'll also be money.

514
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,400
They'll be exchanged for goods and services by those who know to use them as food.

515
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,240
Now, help, Hope Huey, the whole world is not Arkansas where you're calling from.

516
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,660
Yeah, really, we don't have the slaughterhouse system going like you guys do out there in the boonies.

517
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,680
We've got a thing where we have to lure the guy down into the basement, teach him about butterflies and frozen hearts,

518
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,180
and then we, you know, make hamburgers out of them and stuff.

519
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,060
But we can't.

520
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,360
There's a lot of codes and stuff around here, you know, if you're not wearing a hat.

521
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,620
The inspector's on us.

522
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,980
You mean you just don't drive around in a truck and have one of your buddies grab him by the neck as you turn a corner and then just cook him on a grill?

523
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,160
Oh, the old good humor wagon doesn't work anymore.

524
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,980
That's too much work.

525
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,320
This is Yankee territory, help, Hope Huey.

526
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah, you know, they do things real differently up here.

527
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,860
You know, their eye is, one good eye is...

528
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,360
Oh, they have their own special way.

529
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,040
It's better than down south.

530
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,500
Oh, yeah.

531
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,460
Oh, it's much more sophisticated.

532
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,440
When they say smoke them around here, somebody produces a joint or a cigarette.

533
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,420
They don't, you know...

534
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,360
They don't sit their neighbor on fire or...

535
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah, they look down on you Arkansas people while you're selling them water for a dollar a sip.

536
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,420
Well, I must admit, I can't argue with that.

537
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,520
I've got a neighbor who's got a little poodle, and I think their IQs are about the same.

538
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,220
So I can't argue with that too much.

539
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,240
Well, you can make mishmash out of them.

540
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,780
You know, a poodle with a neighbor together probably maybe go for it.

541
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,700
Oh, I was putting down Yankees.

542
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,280
We've got to get out of here.

543
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,720
We have to get away with some other people.

544
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,400
Look, I know you're afraid.

545
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,140
I'm afraid too.

546
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,280
Whoa.

547
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,640
Cool.

548
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,860
Still no sign of land.

549
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,720
How long is it?

550
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,660
33 days, sir.

551
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,600
33 days?

552
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,140
We can't go on much longer, sir.

553
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,360
We haven't eaten since the fifth day.

554
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,340
We've just got to keep hoping.

555
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,800
Someone may find us.

556
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,480
Now, if the search has been called off, then we're on our own to save our lives, and we've got to eat.

557
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,660
Listen, champs, there's still a chance.

558
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,460
I'm done for.

559
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,820
I've got a gammy leg, and I'm going fast.

560
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,160
I'll never get through, but some of you might.

561
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,100
So you'd better eat me.

562
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,000
It means we should eat today.

563
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,060
Eat yourself?

564
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,680
Yes, eat me.

565
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,140
You're talking about eating people.

566
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,180
Ugh.

567
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,440
With a gammy leg?

568
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,620
You didn't eat the leg, Thompson.

569
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,940
There's still plenty of good meat.

570
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,520
Look at that arm.

571
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,000
We're talking about eating meats, but we don't die.

572
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,140
If I had a wound that was rotten and needed to be washed out, wouldn't you do it, even though it's disgusting, because it needed to be done?

573
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah, I would, but I wouldn't eat you.

574
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,380
What do you mean?

575
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,060
I said, it's just that...

576
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,920
Why don't you want to eat me?

577
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
Look, I don't want to talk about this.

578
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,340
Neither do I, Gustavo, but we have to.

579
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,320
We're starving and we're trapped.

580
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,320
I'd rather eat Johnson, sir.

581
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,000
So would I, sir.

582
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,760
I see.

583
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,860
Well, now settle it.

584
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,840
Everyone's going to eat me.

585
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,520
Now, if the soul...

586
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,160
If there is a soul...

587
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,420
We'll leave the body when we die, and the body is just a carcass.

588
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

589
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,780
Miss you.

590
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,440
Oh, go ahead, please, but I won't...

591
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,340
Oh, nonsense, sir.

592
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,400
You're starving, tucking.

593
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,620
No, no, it's not that.

594
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,880
What's the matter with Johnson, sir?

595
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,340
Well, he's got kosher.

596
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,820
That depends how we kill him, sir.

597
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,360
We shouldn't murder innocents to live.

598
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,700
What about our innocence?

599
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,180
What's going to become of our innocence if we survive as cannibals?

600
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,040
Yes, that's true.

601
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,760
But to be perfectly frank, I like my meat a little more lean.

602
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,160
I'd rather...

603
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,620
I'd rather eat Hodges.

604
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,540
Oh, well, all right.

605
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
I still prefer Johnson.

606
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,340
We should all stop bickering and eat meat.

607
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,340
Are you ready to go out there and cut flesh from a human body and eat it?

608
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,460
I tell you what, those who want to can eat Johnson, and you, sir, can have my leg, and

609
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,420
we'll make him stop from the captain, and then we'll have Johnson cold for supper.

610
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,600
Oh, yes.

611
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,140
Good idea.

612
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,040
Excellent thinking.

613
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,180
I enjoyed that.

614
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,720
Let's do it again.

615
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,120
Actually, what I wanted to mention was it's meaningful that none of us has mentioned this

616
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,680
game.

617
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,960
Well, Dave and Princess, we and I just went out to a restaurant, and everywhere we went,

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,100
people said, oh, game must be over.

619
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh, how was...

620
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,080
It's just simply assumed that you were watching the Super Bowl.

621
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,180
Oh, yeah.

622
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,620
Now, on an elderly woman's...

623
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,180
In some genius land, they were asking questions like, Super Bowl, is that a meal at McDonald's?

624
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,380
What is that?

625
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,660
No, that's a really, really nice pipe for your frop.

626
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,180
Well, who won?

627
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,340
This incredible...

628
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,240
I didn't even know who was playing until yesterday.

629
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,320
Oh, yesterday?

630
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,400
And I am calling out Dr. Lance Underpants for spoiling it for me.

631
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,480
I thought I was going to go the whole year without finding out who was in the game, and

632
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,920
I came out on 669, and I did not expect to hear it, and I couldn't change the channel

633
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,680
before it came out.

634
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,380
Oh, man.

635
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,580
That's really disappointing.

636
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,880
WCSB is letting me down now.

637
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,240
Still haven't found out?

638
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,960
I did find out, unfortunately, who was in it, and I promptly went about trying to forget

639
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,100
it.

640
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,620
I asked my father this morning.

641
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,440
It was the Welsh Pomeranians, wasn't it?

642
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,400
Welsh Pomeranian?

643
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah.

644
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,880
Don't these teams really...

645
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,520
Aren't they supposed to stand for something?

646
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,020
Like, perhaps, you know, one team would all be eunuchs or something, and the other team

647
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,680
would all have...

648
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,600
I don't know.

649
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,920
You know, there's just really no meaning in sports anymore.

650
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,180
They get a lot of money, and they beat each other up, but...

651
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,300
Oh, but they get extra drugs now that turn them into super beings.

652
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,860
Well, how about a team that unfurls a red banner?

653
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,680
That part of the sport is how many drugs you can get away with without getting caught,

654
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,080
you know?

655
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,080


656
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,080


657
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,440
That's actually part of it.

658
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,300
Okay, the other team all has bad legs.

659
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,380
They're a little gimpy then, and they have to take steroids.

660
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,240
Right.

661
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,760
All right.

662
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,260
See, now that would make sense.

663
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,860
No, but part of the competition is how much can you get away with in terms of steroids

664
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,720
and all of that.

665
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,280
That's part of winning.

666
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,260
And how much can you get away with?

667
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,520
Rage.

668
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,020
I'm sorry.

669
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,220
That's sort of like the behind-the-scenes score among your fellow professionals.

670
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,800
Right.

671
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,060
Like, when these people all get arrested for public evacuation, where are they going to

672
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


673
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


674
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


675
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


676
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


677
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


678
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


679
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


680
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,060


681
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,600
take them?

682
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,860
They've already been there, you know, at least once or twice and stuff, so now they're talking

683
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,200
about making big camps, you know, turning the coliseums into places where there's more

684
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,920
than bread and circus.

685
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,620
There's a bunch of dead bodies laying around.

686
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,840
I can't really be interested in organized team sports until we have real rollerball with

687
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,460
spiked gloves and, you know, metal balls being shot out of a tube at 80 miles an hour and

688
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,760
some skulls being crushed because, you know, a mere broken pelvis just doesn't excite me

689
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,100
anymore.

690
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,720
I've done it all, seen it all, and I want real rollerball.

691
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,080
Football is for wusses.

692
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,500
Right.

693
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,560
If we're going to have capital punishment, let's combine it with sports.

694
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
That's a great idea.

695
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,220
Excellent idea.

696
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,740
Well, Running Man, you know, Stephen King, actually, I mean, that's been...

697
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:20,980
Oh, yeah.

698
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
They could make a discus.

699
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,780
...I saw for decades, but it's time.

700
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,960
The time has come.

701
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,660
Then we could solve the cannibalism problem, too, because the losers are grandly eaten

702
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,180
as heroes.

703
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,620
Well, you get both years, too, for all the side stuff.

704
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,240
Right.

705
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,880
Gladiator crap, you know, the ratings raising.

706
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,120
Nuggets.

707
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,960
Strips.

708
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,180
So forth.

709
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,600
You know.

710
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,460
Finger food.

711
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:42,780
Yeah.

712
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,100
Yeah.

713
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,120
It's reality TV.

714
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,140
It's a hit.

715
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,160
It's what all the kids in Seattle are into.

716
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,840
It's cool.

717
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,480
Good old Hitler's hand soap was made out of real hands.

718
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,100
I mean, you know, you can't go too far from the truth.

719
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,140
Everything is as clear as whatever it looks like a nose on your face.

720
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,680
So, I think we should proceed from there.

721
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,800
Turn your elderly neighbors into finger food.

722
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,020
Win valuable prizes.

723
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,260
Yeah.

724
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Mmm, tasty.

725
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,660
You're thinking wishfully.

726
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm thinking marketing, man.

727
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,600
I'm thinking like mega, mega push.

728
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm thinking like maybe four states at first.

729
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,120
Top, maybe pinpoint target states.

730
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,240
And move on into like shirts, vacuum cleaners, deodorants, the whole smear.

731
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,360
How do you make a deodorant out of an old lady who smells like a foot?

732
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,060
Well, you give it a flavor and you say it's all natural.

733
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,840
Oh.

734
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm a hamburger playing hockey.

735
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,960
You know you like it just as much as I do.

736
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:36,940
Mmm.

737
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,640
Chew it.

738
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


739
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


740
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


741
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


742
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


743
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


744
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


745
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


746
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


747
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


748
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


749
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


750
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


751
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,640


752
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,020
I'm a chicken.

753
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,380
Protein.

754
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,460
Well, we've been looking for someone with a crazy grudge and some kind of anatomical

755
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:43,800
knowledge.

756
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,780
De-certified doctors, med school dropouts, laid off mortuary workers.

757
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,920
From the precision of the cuts, yes, and his choice of souvenirs.

758
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,220
See, that's where we're off target.

759
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,960
He's not collecting body parts.

760
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,840
Then why keep them?

761
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,040
He's not keeping them.

762
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,860
He's eating them.

763
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,940
Now, listen, we were at Molly's parents for New Year's, and Molly's dad was showing my

764
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,140
son Josh how to carve a roasted chicken.

765
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,960
He said, the tenderest part of the chicken is the oysters here on either side of the

766
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,200
back.

767
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,760
I had never heard that expression before, oysters.

768
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,020
And suddenly I had a flash of the third victim, Darcy Taylor.

769
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,900
She was missing flesh from her back.

770
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,920
And then it hit me, liver, kidney, tongue, thymus, every single victim lost some body

771
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,960
part used in cooking.

772
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,920
People actually love chicken.

773
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,520
They're not going to live without a brain.

774
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,600
You can live without certain parts of the brain.

775
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,500
Oh, you can?

776
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,020
Yeah.

777
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,320
Actually, you guys, just today I talked to an old friend of mine from high school, who

778
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,660
last year was diagnosed all of a sudden with a brain tumor.

779
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,140
And he described to me what it felt to wake up with part of your brain scraped out after

780
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,840
the operation.

781
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,040
He had to learn how to walk all over again.

782
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,940
He said he'd look at his foot and tell it to move, and it wouldn't move.

783
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,980
So he had to learn how to walk all over again.

784
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,920
But now he's just fine again.

785
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,140
And he talks all normal on the phone.

786
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,640
But he's ready for the matrix.

787
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,420
He's ready for virtual reality because he's already got the socket prepared.

788
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,540
He's got a special plug, a hole ready to jack in.

789
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,540
Great.

790
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,920
It's kind of inspiring, actually, to talk to somebody who had part of their brain scraped.

791
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:35,920


792
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:35,920


793
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:35,920


794
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,520
I mean, you can develop a tumor, have it cut out, and he sounds just fine.

795
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,740
Or even a living brain is a great conversation piece.

796
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,240
Well, Dave here has only the one cell.

797
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,140
It's very big and heavy.

798
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,660
Well, not that big and heavy.

799
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,700
It's very dense.

800
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,300
It's dense.

801
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,680
And if he were to get a tumor on that, I mean, it would be the tumor.

802
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,200
Maybe that explains the big cell.

803
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,020
I think it is one macro cell.

804
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,720
I have a...

805
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,900
I think it is one macro cell.

806
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,220
I think it is one brain tumor for a brain.

807
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,600
But I managed to carry on most function.

808
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,080
That's what...

809
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,780
That says a lot about the sad situation that humanity finds itself in today.

810
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,600
I had to literally teach my catalyzer to keep me from going into a...

811
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,000
Hello?

812
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,020
Hello?

813
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,540
Yeah.

814
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,320
Sorry.

815
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,140
Caller number four.

816
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,440
Hello?

817
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,480
These guys, they forget their numbers.

818
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,340
Yeah, I can't...

819
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,380
I can't hear the ones...

820
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,700
The ones further down the line, I can't hear at all.

821
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:35,880
Yeah.

822
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,140
Where's the double salami and pastrami, number 35?

823
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,140
These people, they have no intricate, centric numbers.

824
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,900
Is it true the brain regenerates itself?

825
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,140
No.

826
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,920
Generally, no.

827
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,320
Is that true?

828
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,520
It could be made to, though.

829
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,440
Huh?

830
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,500
It could be made to regenerate itself under certain conditions, but under normal conditions,

831
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,080
no, it will not.

832
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,020
Well, let's say that part of the brain isn't cut out, but let's say it lost some cells.

833
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,920
Probably not.

834
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,880
I have another question.

835
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:05,880


836
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,020
It's a beer.

837
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,440
Call number four.

838
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,920
You're on the air.

839
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,420
Yeah.

840
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,200
What exactly is going on right now?

841
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,260
What the fuck exactly are you asking?

842
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,880
We're getting into a heavy philosophy.

843
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,080
We're talking about brains.

844
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,460
What do you mean by what exactly is happening?

845
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,140
I understand that you're talking about brains.

846
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,940
I mean, do you actually know people who have gone through lobotomies and brain scrapings

847
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,580
and stuff like that?

848
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,100
In our church, pretty much, that's how you get into the church.

849
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,680
Cancer surgery is no laughing matter.

850
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:35,880
We run it in the church.

851
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


852
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


853
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


854
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


855
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


856
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


857
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,880


858
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,740
You would not joke about that.

859
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,740
Oh, no, no.

860
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,900
I mean, I'm not calling you out or anything like that.

861
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,360
I just find it extremely interesting that you...

862
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,760
I mean, is this an actual topic or are you guys just seriously...

863
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,440
Well, say you were to call him out, what would you do?

864
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,920
Would you examine his skull once you had done so or would you guys begin to punch each other's

865
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,380
heads like perhaps a moose in heat?

866
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:57,940
I mean...

867
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,820
It would compare me to his phrenological bust for sure.

868
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,300
Yeah.

869
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,440
You're talking about...

870
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,820
Okay.

871
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,220
You're talking about...

872
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,680
I have the occipital lobes of a common...

873
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,260
Criminal.

874
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,020
Yeah.

875
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,060
I have...

876
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:14,100
When I had my third nostril opened, I felt kind of cheated.

877
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,260
I thought I was going to be less aware and I thought I wouldn't have my math anymore.

878
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,020
I thought I was going to have an easier life, but really, all I did was kind of flatten

879
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,480
my personality a little bit.

880
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,600
And gave you a third nostril?

881
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:27,740
Yeah.

882
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,720
I still wasn't...

883
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,740
Couldn't qualify for welfare or anything.

884
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,180
I was...

885
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,240
Might as well have kept my money.

886
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,660
I don't know.

887
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:44,680
I can remember I don't even have much time for myself and not to say I'm not...

888
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,560
I was...

889
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,620
But that's how it is.

890
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah.

891
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000


892
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000


893
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000


894
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000


895
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,460
And you don't have to say whatever...

896
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,820
Se claimant monte climbed...

897
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,300
He sat down right at five and he said, you know, I've done it.

898
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,620
He said, let's not...

899
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:52,640
What's wrong?

900
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:52,640


901
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:52,640


902
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,500
wifi intet counsels.

903
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,840
Yeah, and then he opened it and then he looked in the window and...

904
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,920
And...

905
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,520
It was, you know, it was, as you said, it was nothing, it was a very violent thing.

906
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:04,660


907
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:04,660


908
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:04,860
Here he goes.

909
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,660
A rock, a brick.

910
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,600
Well, still, you know, I've seen kids hurt themselves hitting them.

911
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,100
They'll take those little ball-peen hammers and they'll put a rock on their forehead.

912
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,840
They'll consult the chart and then hit themselves in the head just in these right spots.

913
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,800
They're supposed to get them high or make them see God and whatnot.

914
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,360
These kids can't even read.

915
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,660
Oh, God, they're covered with bruises and bloody.

916
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,620
It's just sick.

917
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,780
As far as I'm concerned, the cannibalism really was a healthier trend.

918
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,660
There's not much diagram.

919
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,460
It depends on who you're eating.

920
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,340
Well, that's the thing.

921
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,420
People were not practicing safe, whatever you call it, you know, diet.

922
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,640
Safe cuisine.

923
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,660
Is it safe to eat the abdul-al-bongana?

924
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,980
I do not recommend eating any part of the human brain.

925
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Abdul-al-bongana.

926
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,540
Or any brain, for that matter.

927
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,680
But, I mean, like, only under certain rituals.

928
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,520
It's not the sort of thing you can just cook up for dinner one night.

929
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:54,920
That's...

930
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,100
You can only do that on holidays.

931
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,180
The people who inspired the band Devo,

932
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,440
the whole reason the human race...

933
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,540
evolved was that we were originally brain-eating apes.

934
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,500
And as we slew our fellow apes and ate their brains,

935
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,720
that caused us to become more, quote, intelligent, unquote.

936
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,180
Yeah.

937
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,500
So that's why the original topping is always so much better than the first sundae.

938
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,480
We've come full circle all the way back to why people are cannibals.

939
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,300
It's in their genes.

940
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,060
It's in their sly pants.

941
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,760
It's in their...

942
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
Every waking moment, they can't get away from it.

943
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,660
But their ancestors were brain-eating apes.

944
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,100
Unless you believe...

945
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
What's his name?

946
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,840
Maharishi Terence McKenna.

947
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,060
He said that our ancestors were mushroom-eating apes

948
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,220
who would get their kind of vision enhanced.

949
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,700
You'd see a tiger hiding in the jungle better

950
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,580
if you were tripping on mushrooms

951
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,280
than if you were a normal non-mushroom-eating ape.

952
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,820
You'd see a lot of other things, too.

953
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,580
I think that's...

954
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,900
the product of a person who's eaten too many mushrooms.

955
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,260
Wonderful nourishment.

956
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,020
Real tasty.

957
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,600
Ten fat sausages.

958
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,940
I found your private rye cup, then.

959
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,080
All what was left of him.

960
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,720
You didn't finish.

961
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,620
Well, I can't blame you.

962
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,300
He was tough.

963
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,040
But then, uh...

964
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,780
a good soldier ought to be.

965
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,260
You know, not that long ago, I couldn't do that.

966
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,860
I could barely take a breath without coughing up a pint of blood.

967
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,580
Tuberculosis.

968
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,140
That, along with, uh...

969
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,280
fierce headaches.

970
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,620
Depression.

971
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,840
Suicidal ambition.

972
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,580
I was in pretty horrible shape.

973
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,100
I...

974
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,780
In fact...

975
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,840
I was on my way to a sanatorium to convalesce,

976
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,740
more likely to die.

977
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,860
When en route, this...

978
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,240
Indian scout

979
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,620
told me a curious story.

980
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,600
A man eats the flesh of another.

981
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
He steals his strength.

982
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,440
Yes.

983
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,400
He absorbs the other man's spirit.

984
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:27,700
And...

985
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,400
he's...

986
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,760
Well...

987
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,840
I just had to try.

988
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,280
Consequently, I ate the scout first.

989
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,240
And you know, he was absolutely right.

990
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,020
I grew...

991
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:42,960
stronger.

992
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,320
Later, through circumstance,

993
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,640
my wagon train grew lost in the Rockies.

994
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,740
I've heard this story before.

995
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,100
Hmm.

996
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,420
I ate five men in three months.

997
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,440
I was...

998
00:37:59,440 --> 00:37:59,940
Tuberculosis.

999
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,300
Vanished.

1000
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,520
As did the Black Thorns.

1001
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,040
I reached Denver that spring feeling...

1002
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,200
happy.

1003
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,920
And healthy.

1004
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,640
And virile.

1005
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,920
Did you eat her, too?

1006
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,140
Well, as a matter of fact...

1007
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,800
You're disgusting.

1008
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1009
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,420
Here I am,

1010
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,060
one year later,

1011
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,020
feeling more alive than ever before.

1012
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,780
And that's what surprises me about you, Boyd.

1013
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,900
You've tasted it.

1014
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,660
Felt its power.

1015
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,580
Yet you're resisting.

1016
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:42,820
Why?

1017
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,640
Because it's wrong.

1018
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,060
Ah!

1019
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,240
Morality.

1020
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,320
The last bastion of a coward.

1021
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,100
I'm sorry.

1022
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,360
I'm sorry.

1023
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,020
Did I offend you?

1024
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,980
I was gonna ask you guys something.

1025
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,640
Like, how long after, uh,

1026
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,420
a human's death did they...

1027
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,340
did their...

1028
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,480
did their soul get, uh,

1029
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,400
reincarnated?

1030
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:08,760
Psh.

1031
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
How long do you stay out of your body?

1032
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,180
Depends on how hungry Bob is.

1033
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,640
How long do you have to stay out?

1034
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,900
Until you're so confused

1035
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,120
you want to touch something

1036
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,960
should you go back.

1037
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,980
Well, no, and also how hungry Bob is.

1038
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,800
It's like how...

1039
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,940
you know, how...

1040
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,380
how soon are you expected

1041
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,760
at the dinner table?

1042
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,240
Yeah.

1043
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,860
When will you be sure?

1044
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,360
When does he need someone new

1045
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,860
to extract slack from?

1046
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,960
That's right.

1047
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,480
Bob's slack has to come from somewhere.

1048
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,820
The suffering of humanity

1049
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,380
is, of course, the greatest fuel

1050
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,780
that produces slack in others.

1051
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,800
It's also a great wing sauce, too,

1052
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,760
in our bottles.

1053
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:46,900
If you're eating six

1054
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,860
sadistic others.

1055
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,600
And so...

1056
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,920
that... yeah, and the wine sauce, too.

1057
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,300
Has anybody ever tried to eat Bob?

1058
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,960
How would you answer that?

1059
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
Well, I couldn't hear that, so...

1060
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,000
Has anyone ever attempted to eat Bob?

1061
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,040
Oh, boy.

1062
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,960
Well, Beth, what do you think the...

1063
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,380
Has anyone not?

1064
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
...communication ritual is all about?

1065
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,280
That's the...

1066
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,820
that's where we, you know,

1067
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,120
we join with Bob

1068
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,780
and we partake of his slack

1069
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,520
and of his smoke and his flesh.

1070
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,340
Do this in remembrance of...

1071
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,620
Wow.

1072
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,260
...and his hairs.

1073
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,060
I heard you guys had a problem

1074
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,080
in your church with a...

1075
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,200
with a soul reaver.

1076
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,660
A soul reaver?

1077
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,480
Yeah.

1078
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,060
Reverb or the reaper?

1079
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,840
No, reverb.

1080
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,480
The reaper?

1081
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:29,720
Soul reaver.

1082
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,040
Somebody who takes souls.

1083
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,100
You mean... oh, yeah.

1084
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,020
Yeah.

1085
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,980
You know, the soul suckers?

1086
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,340
Yeah.

1087
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,460
Did anybody ever try to suck his soul?

1088
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,580
Um, geez, I don't know if you could suck Bob's soul.

1089
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,540
It's so, uh, galvanized and...

1090
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,000
and completely...

1091
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,760
in...

1092
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,860
How'd anybody want to?

1093
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,820
Bob doesn't have a soul.

1094
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,760
He's made of souls.

1095
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
It's like the question of

1096
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,500
who was the first man to eat an oyster.

1097
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,640
Well, I think it would take a lot of, uh,

1098
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,940
you know, maybe some frat boys would...

1099
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:56,940


1100
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,320
get real drunk and do Bob's soul on a bet.

1101
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,480
That's the only way I could see that happening.

1102
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:01,940
Yeah.

1103
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,660
No way would a person in their right mind

1104
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,160
even... even take a hit off of his pipe.

1105
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,740
Yeah.

1106
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,320
That's brought a lot of people down.

1107
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,680
Those who would...

1108
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,180
Yeah, Bob, can I have a hit of that?

1109
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,980
Why, sure.

1110
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,260
Up all the way across the room.

1111
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
You're stuck in the madhouse.

1112
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,480
Yeah, you're down the bottom of Ward 4.

1113
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,960
And you know what?

1114
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,320
Why doesn't the guy ever call up and make himself, uh...

1115
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,860
know?

1116
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,400
On the phone, why doesn't he ever call up and say, uh...

1117
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,060
or make, like, a meeting on the phone or whatever?

1118
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,100
You mean arrange for his voice to actually be heard?

1119
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,660
Yeah.

1120
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,180
You mean you haven't heard him all this time?

1121
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,320
I haven't heard him on the phone.

1122
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,640
We've been talking to him. He's been here.

1123
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,420
Isn't that right, Bob?

1124
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:45,680
Right.

1125
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,380
See, didn't you hear him answer just there?

1126
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,380
No, I didn't hear him answer.

1127
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,080
Well, he was agreeing with himself or somebody.

1128
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,900
Oh, that's great. No shit, Bob.

1129
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,700
I mean, Bob, sorry.

1130
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,140
Rob.

1131
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,440
Yeah, you can't, uh...

1132
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,920
be too careful when you got Eurasian compliments from, uh...

1133
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,100
South Central...

1134
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,280
Where was that guy from again?

1135
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,640
Bob's right. Not everybody is tuned in.

1136
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,180
You can't save everyone.

1137
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,860
There's only so much slack to go around.

1138
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,620
What, Bob?

1139
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,400
Yeah, right.

1140
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,700
You can't even provide for them a relaxing good night's sleep on an orthopedic bed.

1141
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,960
You can't do anything for them except for shoot them and eat them.

1142
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,140
So you might as well give in to the reality that we're...

1143
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,460
mind-munching, brain-crunching...

1144
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,580
simians, and there will never be anything else.

1145
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,480
How about an Elastitch effort to take out other people?

1146
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,720
How about if somebody were to inject themselves with poison?

1147
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,680
Um...

1148
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,220
I think you have a serious problem.

1149
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,440
Listen, I can't... I can hardly hear this guy, but it kind of reminds me of the...

1150
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,580
You know, with the kid in Catholic school, it's always going,

1151
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,160
Hey, Fada, is there a rock so big...

1152
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,480
Can God make a rock so big he can't lift it?

1153
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,280
Yeah, yeah, right.

1154
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,720
Yes, God can make a rock so big he can't lift it.

1155
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:55,900
Okay.

1156
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,760
We have a more serious question here.

1157
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,160
Yeah.

1158
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,820
Can Bob make some frot so strong even he can't smoke it?

1159
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,320
They used to call it apologetics.

1160
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,880
Can Bob...

1161
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,700
Can Bob make a product so bad even he can't sell it?

1162
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,340
Can Bob see his own eyes?

1163
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,720
Can he... can he smell his own nose?

1164
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,160
Can he hear his own ears?

1165
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,620
Can he... can he... can he feel his own...

1166
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,180
Gosh, Dad, what is it with you and this cannibalism kick?

1167
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,940
Just because you find a dead body in my room,

1168
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,260
you think I'm a cannibal?

1169
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,400
Maybe I'm just a necrophile,

1170
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
or I'm studying early for medical school.

1171
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
You're right, son. I shouldn't jump too...

1172
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,660
Say, Bobby, where's your leg?

1173
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,820
I lost it during swim practice.

1174
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,700
Legs aren't cheap, son.

1175
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,620
You should learn to be more careful.

1176
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,960
School custodians should have found it by now, and...

1177
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,760
All right! I'm a cannibal! Happy?

1178
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,200
I don't know how it started. It just did!

1179
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,380
And now there's nothing I can do about it!

1180
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,920
You know, son, I may be an old man, but...

1181
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:54,920


1182
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:54,920


1183
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,660
I'm an old fuddy-duddy when it comes to...

1184
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,820
experimentation, as those liberal therapists refer to it.

1185
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,620
But your ear and your leg will never grow back.

1186
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,020
You've got to learn restraint.

1187
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,000
Right as usual, Dad.

1188
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,280
From now on, I promise to only eat lower life forms and some sea crustaceans.

1189
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,620
Good for you, son.

1190
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,820
And that's how cannibalism almost consumed my Bobby.

1191
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,300
I'm glad to say that he's ready to start his first year of college next fall,

1192
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,740
and his episodes of cannibalism have reduced drastically.

1193
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,320
Isn't that right, son?

1194
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,580
Sure, Dad.

1195
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,340
What are you cooking?

1196
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,460
It's, uh... stew.

1197
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,020
You need any help?

1198
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,200
No, no, though, uh...

1199
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,440
perhaps later you might...

1200
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,320
contribute.

1201
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,000
So you're gonna kill me?

1202
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,360
No!

1203
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,640
It's lonely being a cannibal.

1204
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,460
Tough making friends.

1205
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,540
Oh, I like you, Boyd.

1206
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,620
Let me, uh...

1207
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,820
I want to bring you into the fold.

1208
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,840
You gotta eat.

1209
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,180
And I wanted you to know

1210
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,600
We were true, that we were big enough

1211
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,340
As we quietly died in the snow

1212
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,460
A place we'll never leave

1213
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,180
A place we never wanna borrow

1214
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,140
A place we'll call the final resting place

1215
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,700
In pieces

1216
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,620
So began this winter of call when we got started

1217
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,160
So we end this winter, trace of us in spring

1218
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,840
And knowing all I get before the better

1219
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,300
If you just can't feel a fucking thing

1220
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,520
Fall asleep and die

1221
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,480
I wanted you to know

1222
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,000
We were true, that we were big enough

1223
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,740
As we quietly died in the snow

1224
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,860
A place we'll never leave

1225
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,760
A place we never wanna borrow

1226
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,480
A place we'll call the final resting place

1227
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,580

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,860
Uh, I like you, boyd

1249
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,000
you were thinking of

1250
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,500
as we quietly died in the snow

1251
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,680
A place we'll never leave

1252
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,120
A place we never wanna go

1253
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,800
A place we'll never find

1254
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,100
A resting place in pieces

00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:04,760
In pieces

1272
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,440
In pieces

1273
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,080
In pieces

1274
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,640
In pieces

1275
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:33,640


1276
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,380
In pieces

1277
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:46,440
In pieces

1278
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,880
In pieces

1279
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,440
In pieces

1280
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,340
Pills, pills, I want my pills

1281
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,440
I'll get your pills

1282
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:14,380
But you must take your milk

1283
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,420
No, no, no

1284
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:23,240
Pills! I want my pills! Don't use me the milk! Don't use me the milk!

1285
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:31,720
Milk! You need your milk! Your milk is good for you!

1286
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:42,600
You can have your pills as long as you drink all your milk like a good little man!

1287
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:52,140
No! The milk makes this strange! It makes everything go crazy! So I want my pills!

1288
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:58,140
Oh, come here! Come on, drink it!

1289
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:07,900
Drink it! There! That's not so bad now!

1290
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,280
Come on, you little...

1291
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,080
Fart!

1292
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,500
Fart!

1293
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,500
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

1294
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,200
Ha!

1295
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,680
Fart! Fart!

1296
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:32,900
Fart!

1297
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,560
Fart!

1298
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,720
Fart!

1299
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,420
Fart! Fart!

1300
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,840
Fart! Fart!

1301
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,300
Fart!

1302
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,620
Fart!

1303
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,800
Fart! Fart! Fart!

1304
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:58,520
Fart! Fart!

1305
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,220
Another piece by Trash there.

1306
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,640
Band Trash sent by Reverend Cardboard Box.

1307
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,080
Milk treatment with Bob.

1308
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,140
And now, Norrell Preff.

1309
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,680
Hey, all you rocket jockeys.

1310
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,800
I've got something new and sensational to tell you about today.

1311
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,680
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

1312
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,560
Hi, hi.

1313
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,580
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

1314
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,320
Hi, hi.

1315
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,040
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

1316
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,260
Every large American city has a threat of coming.

1317
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,000
It's an insidious thing, dangerous, and a little bit frightening.

1318
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,580
We feel that the threat is more than frightening.

1319
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,420
It's a menace.

1320
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,120
It must be stamped out.

1321
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,680
It gives you a queer feeling.

1322
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,820
You wonder who's going to be next and why.

1323
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,740
And you find yourself groping for this disease.

1324
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:57,360
Hi.

1325
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,360
Hi.

1326
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:58,500


1327
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:58,500


1328
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,360
Every large American city has a threat of coming.

1329
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,840
It gives you a queer feeling.

1330
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,780
And you find yourself groping for it.

1331
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,640
Some well-known Hollywood celebrity.

1332
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,660
It gives you a queer feeling.

1333
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,780
Every large American city has a threat of coming.

1334
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,000
And you find yourself groping for it.

1335
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,820
Blonde secretary.

1336
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,020
Blonde secretary.

1337
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,480
Knocking yourself out.

1338
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,400
Knocking yourself out.

1339
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,420
It gives you a queer feeling.

1340
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,080
Well?

1341
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,360
I am about to demonstrate that your theory is cocky.

1342
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,460
And you find yourself groping for this disease.

1343
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,580
Dr. Sinister is a sex god.

1344
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,660
No, I'm not.

1345
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,060
Oh my god, he's the first honest man.

1346
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,920
No, I'm not.

1347
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,740
Diogenes, hurry.

1348
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:46,300
I am the god of chastity and celibacy.

1349
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,040
And all that ridiculous stuff.

1350
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,120
Of course.

1351
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,200
Of course.

1352
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,520
Oh, I'm sure.

1353
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,140
That's by...

1354
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,840
That's voluntarily, right?

1355
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,120
That's by choice, I'm sure.

1356
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,260
As a matter of fact.

1357
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,380
Yes and no.

1358
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,000
But anyway, that's neither here nor there.

1359
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,400
You modern day kids.

1360
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,260
You'll do anything to be weird.

1361
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,360
You're just being different just for the sake of being different.

1362
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,600
You're going to take one more call here.

1363
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,780
They want to tear things down, but they don't have any plan for building things back up.

1364
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,040
Caller number three, you're on the air.

1365
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,260
Hello, caller.

1366
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,200
Well, we'll let you get back to your music.

1367
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,680
I'm sorry.

1368
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,060
All right.

1369
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,800
Well, thank you for calling.

1370
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,920
Thanks for calling.

1371
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:31,680
Bye.

1372
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,620
Hello.

1373
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,280
Show me.

1374
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,240
Oh, yeah.

1375
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,560
I just wanted to let you know this is probably the funniest thing I've heard on the radio

1376
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,240
in a long time.

1377
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,880
The funniest thing you've heard on the radio in a long time?

1378
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,080
Yeah.

1379
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,560
It's hilarious.

1380
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:43,680
Really?

1381
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:44,880
Thanks.

1382
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,840
Hey, you're totally welcome.

1383
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,480
Thank you.

1384
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,120
You should listen to this station more.

1385
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,520
You'll hear more stuff that's even better than mine.

1386
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,960
I do, but thanks.

1387
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:53,680
Thanks a lot.

1388
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,220
No problem.

1389
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,260
Brighten my night.

1390
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,220
It's my pleasure.

1391
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,080
Because that's what I'm all about.

1392
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,240
Dr. Sinister is here to brighten your night.

1393
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,000
You understand?

1394
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:08,660
And I'm not even going to cheat and use one of those UV black lights.

1395
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,540
I'm going to use actual visible light to light up your night.

1396
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:18,620
If you die first, I am definitely going to eat you.

1397
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,860
The question is...

1398
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,840
If I die, what are you going to do?

1399
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,540
Bon appétit.

1400
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,340
