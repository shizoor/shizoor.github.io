1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,520
Jesus Christ, what the hell is that?

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,180
I don't know.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,120
It's horrible, isn't it?

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,620
It's making me feel sick.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,380
It's disgusting.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,520
It is disgusting.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,260
Well, why don't you do something about it?

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,780
Why don't you get it out of here?

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,720
Isn't there any way you can get rid of it?

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,760
I'm not going to touch it.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,040
Oh, God.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,180
I'm not touching it.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,440
It's filthy.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,140
It stinks.

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,200
Well, we're going to have to smell it for the rest of the goddamn night if you don't get rid of it.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,680
It stinks.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,860
I'm not touching it.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,040
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,100
I'm not going to touch it.

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm not.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,360
It's filthy.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,640
It's disgusting.

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,400
Just get it out of here.

24
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,360
It's no big deal.

25
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,940
Jesus, just go on.

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,780
Get rid of it.

27
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,260
Where do you want me to put it?

28
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,760
I don't know.

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,180
I don't know.

30
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,460
What do you want me to do?

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,620
Well, just throw it outside.

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,400
I don't know.

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,960
I don't care.

34
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,360
Just put it out the door or something.

35
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,880
Just get rid of it.

36
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,480
Go on.

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,000
What are you waiting for?

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,420
I kind of like it.

39
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,200
What?

40
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,240
What?

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,940
Is it starting to grow on you or something?

42
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,660
God.

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,580
Yeah, I'm beginning to grow attached to it.

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,160
Once you get used to the smell, it's...

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,520
And you know what it is?

46
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,920
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack, dear friends.

47
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,900
Good to be back, ain't it?

48
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,860
I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage

49
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,300
called the blood of the exploited working class.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,380
But they've overcome.

51
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,320
They're shyness now.

52
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,780
They're calling me your highness.

53
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,580
And the world screams,

54
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,140
kiss me, son of God.

55
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,740
I destroy the bond of friendship and respect

56
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,600
between the only people left

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,800
who'd even look me in the eye.

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,100
Now I laugh and make a fortune

59
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,040
off the same ones that I tortured.

60
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,080
And the world screams,

61
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,680
kiss me, son of God.

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,460
I look like Jesus, so they say.

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,880
But Mr. Jesus is very far away.

64
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,140
Now you're the only one here

65
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,280
who can tell me if it's true

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,020
that you love me

67
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,100
and I love me.

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,260
I built a little empire

69
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,200
out of some crazy garbage

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,340
called the blood of the exploited working class.

71
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,680
But they've overcome.

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,560
They're shyness now.

73
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,040
They're calling me your highness.

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,080
And the world screams,

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
kiss me, son of God.

76
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,860
Yes, the world screams,

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,240
kiss me, son of God.

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,400
The world screams,

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,400


80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,400


81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,400


82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,400


83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,400


84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,740
How lovely dear friends.

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,700

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,180
interesting mail here at the hour of slack the subgenius foundation always gets mountains of

132
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,580
mail from our other enterprises but the hour of slack is always the best mail that we get we get

133
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,820
all the fast-fast mail that we have thanks to all the people that need to send them mail

134
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:53,940
from the world we've gotten two hauled some mail today from we have two of myjam store shoppers

135
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,160
we even have saloon shines we actually sent them a在台里 episodes of Brussels and they they were

136
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,400
coming out to thearlos especially because i've bought some very collectible series i think there

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,560
were quite a few here and there other than that you know the two gossip sites what kind

138
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,220
the way, they said they thought the show had improved due to our playing more universal

139
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,040
subgenius material and less, quote, Dallas parochialism, unquote. Yet we got another

140
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,280
letter, nay, two whole homemade magazines or church spinoff fanzines, whining somewhat

141
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:29,220
shrilly about how this show doesn't play enough material on or by local Dallas subgeni,

142
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,660
specifically, of course, the publishers of this self-same magazine, which I'll go into

143
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:45,440
in a minute. But then we also got this well-written letter. Hold on a second. I didn't even have

144
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,500
my material. Had to dig around in the show bag there to get this. Yes, this letter from

145
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:02,080
the desks of expert women. Give us a man and we'll scare him to death, they say. And

146
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I'm not sure if

147
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,380
that's a good idea. I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

148
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,580
This particular expert woman says, as an expert woman, I feel I must comment on the October

149
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,660
1st alleged live broadcast. I was there with a fellow expert woman to experience that famous

150
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,040
subgenius ambiance and was severely disappointed. Is this the way you guys always party? Looked

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,120
like a bunch of ritualistic male bonding crap to me. Well, no, that wasn't really the way

152
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,940
we always do anything. We'd never done that before and it wasn't really our choice. The

153
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,640
station told me there was this benefit of having a subgenius on the show. I said, well,

154
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:33,760
maybe you should do this show if you're going to be happy with what you've done, not if

155
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:33,760


156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:33,780
you're going to do this show, especially if it isn't positive. So I did say, well, this

157
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,320
is going to be a great benefit to this club and I'd have to do the show from there, remote

158
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,820
broadcast. And we were happy to try to help out the station in any way possible. So here

159
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,860
we were, having to do an entertaining show primarily for the home listeners but in a

160
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,020
chaotic atmosphere where we could barely hear each other talk. We had a crowd of people

161
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,460
standing around watching us, mostly also unable to hear us. And on top of that, there were

162
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,280
serious technical problems the whole first half hour. So the home audience couldn't hear

163
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,560
hear much either. But it was a noble experiment and did have a few high points, which were

164
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,360
fortunately caught by my home portable recorder. So we weren't partying, really. We were doing

165
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,980
a show that happened to be supposed to sound like we were partying. Now, as to the ritualistic

166
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,440
male bonding, we'd really been doing that all weekend, and you'd better be darn glad

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,360
that we indulge in ritualistic male bonding, because that's exactly what keeps us among

168
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:40,100
the last of the real men around. And in fact, it's indeed what makes our male-female bonding

169
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:48,280
all the more meaningful and oozeful on stage or off, as many will attest. Maybe you didn't

170
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,700
hear us loudly and publicly bemoaning the fact that the whole audience we could see

171
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,420
was composed of what looked like male-female bonding.

172
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,440
Well, we were all male science fiction fans. In fact, we were begging for a glimpse of

173
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,260
female brain power or flesh. And there was a brief moment when a brilliantly inventive,

174
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,780
wild and coincidentally gorgeous lady acquaintance of Sterno's, mine and Snavely, handed us $22

175
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,800
to burn. And oh, if only she and her companion had stuck around and shoved their ways up

176
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,600
to the mic, we'd have been ecstatic. But by the time the cash was burnt, they'd disappeared,

177
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,400
I suspect, to pen this very line.

178
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,980
You know, we decided to keep it short and get more detail in the next episode.

179
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:32,440
But, I have to wait another week to get any slack whatsoever, and that always makes me

180
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,960
cranky. I must admit-oh, no, wait. It says, My friend and I came to hear the word of Bob,

181
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,900
but instead had to listen to Bob Dylan whinny about whatever he's into. I'm not sure what

182
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,560
she means by that, because I didn't see Bob Dylan there. Maybe she means that metaphorically.

183
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,180
It might have been interesting to hear what was being broadcast, but the young Republican,

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,760
skinheads surrounding your table looked like their disease was contagious.

185
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,740
Well, like I say, we weren't doing a subgenius revival. We couldn't in the middle of a blues

186
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,320
jam, see, and not under those technical limitations. That's why Will back at the

187
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,500
station kept cutting the tape. Ideally, we'd have been on stage with somebody else engineering all

188
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,420
the radio gizmos, but even then it probably would have been just as frustrating to the radio audience.

189
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,360
But the thing about young Republican skinheads around our table, well,

190
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,720
you know, I mean, how do you imagine we felt? But the church doesn't exactly have a dress code,

191
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,920
on the other hand, and you shouldn't be judging books by their covers so quickly,

192
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,160
because in many cases our audience are indeed despicable, mal-aligned normals that think they're

193
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,620
cool subgeniuses. But on the other hand, haircuts bespeak nothing. I mean, after all, just among,

194
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,160
for instance,

195
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,960
the old old-timers there, Sterno and I have fairly long hair, but G. Gordon Gordon, Onan

196
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,760
Canabite, Snavely Eklund, all are very well-groomed. And nor does age matter, because, you know,

197
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,140
Onan's 22 and Guy's 49. Sterno and I are in the middle, and Snavely is Bob's age.

198
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,680
And as far as the Republican part goes, well, I mean, some of my best friends are old Republicans.

199
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,580
I understand what you're saying, though. I mean, but what you really mean isn't young

200
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,400
Republicans.

201
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:29,800
Not Republicans, necessarily. Often, yeah. But what you mean is pinks. Pinks. Plain and simple.

202
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,520
And of course, the worst part of any subgenius live show is the gushy, nerdy, adolescent

203
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,480
adulation. And although that is embarrassing, it doesn't necessarily bespeak a permanent

204
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,160
Bobbyhood, but possibly rather mere youthful ignorance, you know, of how small the big-time

205
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,400
room is.

206
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,840
And I think that's what it really is, and most of us were almost guilty of that at one time.

207
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,940
She continues here,

208
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:07,120
I must admit I'd also hope to see what true subgenie are like, and as I am still trying to save up

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,740
enough dollars to become a subgenius minister and fight the insidious poison-tentacled beast

210
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,220
that is the conspiracy, I just hope that the next event you invite the public to is worthy of my

211
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,080
attention, because if it ain't, I may be upset.

212
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,180
I have hopes of learning subgenius techniques for punctuation, expectoration, and graven

213
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,200
image-tumping.

214
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,540
Don't disappoint me again!

215
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,140
Sorry to make this so brief, but I have to go and pretend to be a normal employee for

216
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:43,660
a while, spleenishly yours, Pope Anagram, or Gannarama, in Dallas, Texas. Well, uh,

217
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,260
sorry babe, like I say, you know, we wish you'd, uh, had just kind of pushed those wimps

218
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,400
aside, pushed us aside, believe me, it's been done by the females of the church before,

219
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:05,740
and, uh, you know, grab the mic. Do it. That's what we're there for. It's to take it back

220
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,800
away from you, actually, once you start. But, anyway, on to the Stanghate Church. Yeah, we

221
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,580
got this magazine and a letter from the Ideology of Madness boys in Arlington, and I'll give

222
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,120
their address later. But the letter here, I'll...

223
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,700
I'll read it.

224
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,100
The war is on, Stangh. Sorry if it must come to this, but Ideology of Madness magazine

225
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,420
has become the galaxy's first official Stanghian hate zine. This is just the beginning. In

226
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,940
issue 10, we begin our giant double-sized assault on your invisible conspiracy. It's

227
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,860
over, Stangh. We're taking over. And we're gonna expose you for what you really are.

228
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,920
Used up.

229
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,020
Well, used up, gah, you know, I mean, it's

230
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,420
true I do often feel sorta used, but being used up, that sounds kinda funny coming from

231
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,740
somebody when their whole format, jargon, language, and philosophy that they're using

232
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,540
to even make that statement comes largely not from them but from the materials provided

233
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:13,900
to them, theym, by Dr. Philodrummond and myself and the rest of us at some point in the past.

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,840
As for theirs being the galaxy's first Stanghate zine, I'm afraid it's... it's not even Dallas

235
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,940
is first. In fact, I can think of several much, much more highly qualified producers

236
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:35,140
of Stanghate literature dating back many years. The infamous Bob Black being the foremost

237
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,840
that comes to mind, bless his poor heart. I mean, heck, Sterno and Guy are better at

238
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,380
it than anybody, and that's where they're so highly placed in Dobbs' hierarchy. But,

239
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,420
uh, anyway, let me read this from Ideology of Madness.

240
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,940
Friends, I hope that this is of interest to the average listener, at least in some

241
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,260
sort of, you know, as you try to dredge context about the Church from this, and just what

242
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,340
we have to go through. That's sort of the reason I go ahead and do this. Okay, from

243
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,620
this little magazine here, Stanghate Church, a real quaint phrase these days is, I'm sick

244
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,500
and tired of being sick and tired. I guess that's what makes me the most ill and weary

245
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,000
or foley.

246
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,080
that just won't stop bitching and moaning.

247
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,780
Within the subgenius foundation's hierarchy

248
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,520
is a whiner among whiners.

249
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,040
His name is Reverend Ivan Stang,

250
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,580
the church's sacred scribe.

251
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,200
This man has so much power within foundation

252
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,420
that he actually owns the trademark

253
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,840
on our high EPOP's face.

254
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,140
Meaning the face of Bob Dobbs, dear friends,

255
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,620
and it's true.

256
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,160
There is a chain of command, they say.

257
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
Stang is right up there in the top three.

258
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,320
He is actually one of the founding fathers

259
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,860
of our faith in Bob, or FIB.

260
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,840
He is the host of Hour of Slack, blah, blah, blah.

261
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,300
Stang continuously puts down the local subs,

262
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,400
dismissing them as bobbies.

263
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,000
I didn't know it was that continuous, actually.

264
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,300
He often moans about how the only good revivals

265
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,860
can be found out of state.

266
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,740
Well, Reverend Pastor Buck Naked

267
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,920
hosted a devival last year at Dallas

268
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,140
as a member of the church.

269
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,820
He was a member of the church's bar of soap.

270
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,740
But you wouldn't know about that one, would you, Stang?

271
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,920
Well, yes, I would, actually.

272
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,520
No, Buck, and you don't get along well on stage,

273
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,980
so the two of you don't frequent the same pulpits.

274
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,400
Well, um...

275
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Actually, Buck Naked is one of the most honest,

276
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,700
generous, abnormal yetis in the world,

277
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,160
at least to me and everybody else.

278
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,980
But our styles clash.

279
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,120
Now, all subgenius preachers have different styles,

280
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,520
and while some complement each other,

281
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,480
some do clash.

282
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,520
And, like, Buck goes great with Janer, say,

283
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
but not with me.

284
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,760
And big deal.

285
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,560
I mean, at any rate,

286
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,880
he and I have been through unbelievable hardships together

287
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,260
involving people like this,

288
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,200
and I think we understand each other.

289
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,080
But, uh, to continue, they say here,

290
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,620
but that's okay, Ivan.

291
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,020
You go ahead and put that down also.

292
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,800
Yes, I did.

293
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,100
You weren't there,

294
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
so you can't be expected to understand

295
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,100
any of the good, wholesome family conversations,

296
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,700
or any of the kind of weirdness that happened

297
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,380
that hot summer evening.

298
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,040
That's kinda old news, actually.

299
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,880
And hey, let's put your listeners down, too.

300
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,920
They're...

301
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,120
They're just a bunch of slack vampires

302
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,980
trying to slurp up some of your abnormality.

303
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,200
And while you're at it,

304
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,060
we're just a couple of pink boys

305
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,160
putting out a rant scene that pales

306
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,780
in comparison to your mighty,

307
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,760
mythical, stark fist of removal.

308
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,800
Well, you said it, pal, not me.

309
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,640
Just go ahead and discount us,

310
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,820
along with everybody else.

311
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,040
After all, you're not really a subgenius,

312
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,100
unless you're from Arkansas,

313
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,940
or some other faraway place.

314
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,120
Frankly, I'm tired of it, they say here.

315
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,360
Stang has every opportunity to make

316
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,880
Dallas-Fort Worth a paradise for the mutant.

317
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,860
The time has come for local subgeniuses

318
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,300
to rise up and join together

319
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,920
in sharing their Bob-given oddities.

320
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,800
Stang could do a show comprising rants

321
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,080
from local abnormals.

322
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,600
It could be a pre-taped show

323
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,120
that he could play on one of those many occasions

324
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,400
that he goes out of town.

325
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,500
He could delegate the responsibility

326
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,920
to his faithful sidekick,

327
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,880
the Will of Dobbs,

328
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,400
and give that oozing cis-tune a rest.

329
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Which I think Will played twice

330
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,680
in the last two years.

331
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Actually, Will's not a faithful sidekick,

332
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,280
Will's a good buddy.

333
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,380
He's also paid, so there.

334
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,780
Stang could broadcast over the airwaves

335
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,820
a request for someone to head up

336
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,340
a North Texas devival and any other needs

337
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,140
the person heading it up might need.

338
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,020
I.e. a place to have it people willing to do

339
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,140
publicity work, etc.

340
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,660
But has he done this?

341
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,160
No!

342
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,300
Well, actually, yes.

343
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,860
It's much easier for him to just blow everybody

344
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,080
in Texas off as a bunch of bobbies.

345
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,300
Well, we here at the Yggdrasil Press

346
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,360
are striving to make a difference.

347
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,540
We are attempting to host the second

348
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,400
North Texas subgenius conclave and devival.

349
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,040
If you would like to help and or know of a place

350
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,220
where we could hold this party for Bob,

351
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,620
write me care of the P.O. box,

352
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,920
which I will give in a second.

353
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,620
And while you're at it, send Stang some hate mail

354
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,820
at his box or give him a call Sundays right now

355
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,480
at 214-823-7490.

356
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,540
Which you can do.

357
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,980
Please do that right now.

358
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,780
Break your chains.

359
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,940
Demand your rights.

360
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,020
It's all or nothing.

361
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,120
Signed, Don.

362
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,160
Praise Don!

363
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
Well, that's another subject.

364
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,220
And the P.O. box here is those witty guys.

365
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
Box 111423.

366
00:22:52,060 --> 00:23:00,080
Once again, that's box 111423, Arlington, Texas, 76007.

367
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,160
Yeah, well, you know, friends, honestly,

368
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,760
I can't remember if I've ever met these guys or not.

369
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,720
But to tell the truth, I just eat up this Stang hate stuff.

370
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,620
I mean, I really love it.

371
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,640
I feed on it.

372
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,740
There's no greater compliment, really.

373
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,580
It makes you feel like you're well on your way to finally making a buck.

374
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,460
Now, the kindest thing I could do here would be to say,

375
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,340
no comment.

376
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,820
It would be much kinder.

377
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,820
But you listeners, the rest of you listeners,

378
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,520
don't want to hear kindness.

379
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,560
I know, you want to hear vindictiveness and obnoxicity.

380
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,280
You want to hear slack at the expense of somebody else.

381
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,320
So, I will answer these accusations against King Stang, the great Saitang.

382
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,020
And to begin with, as far as excluding Dallas subgeniuses from the show,

383
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,940
a short list of local mutants whose works or bodies have appeared on Hour of Slack include,

384
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,800
of course, Willa Dobbs, Buck Naked, Buddy West,

385
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,340
the wonderful bands Lost Souls Incorporated and The Walk-Ins,

386
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,820
and Buck's bands and other buddies.

387
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,040
There they go.

388
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,620
You can see them rising away in the background.

389
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Ann McKinney, Jay Cotton, Dealey Lama, Pope S. Cecilia,

390
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,460
Reverend Shimon, Zeyfaud Rokitansky,

391
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,660
Homer Henderson, Tommy Lopez, John Hagenbrenner,

392
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,960
Philo Drummond, Kenneth Huey, Reverend Bob.

393
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,060
Well, actually, we have never had Reverend Bob, but we ought to, you know.

394
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,240
I should have thought of that a long time ago.

395
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,260
It would be a great show and probably set things straight as to the difference

396
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,500
between the Reverend Bob that performs in clubs,

397
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,740
and the Bob Dobbs who maintains the economic balance of the universe.

398
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,080
So we ought to do that.

399
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,340
Anyway, okay, so those are the people you hear on the show,

400
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,620
but then there's the people you don't hear on the show.

401
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,260
And often it's just because they never bother to send so much as an audition tape

402
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,860
and think they've got the God-given right to supplant whatever fantastic material

403
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,020
I happen to have ready to play just by showing up at the locked door of K-N-O-N.

404
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,900
As some wannabe subgeniuses, we get their tapes and stuff,

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,860
but they're just plain bad.

406
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,840
But bad by whose standards, you may ask?

407
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,980
Well, mine, dear friend, since Dobbs can't be bothered with mundane matters like that.

408
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,280
So you ask, how can I get to contribute publicly to this vortex of creativity

409
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,600
that is the seemingly impregnable subgenius hierarchy?

410
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,480
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

411
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,200
Well, now, friends, take the Dallas subgeniuses whose material we broadcast or publish.

412
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,920
Now, some I've known for years, some I've never met.

413
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,140
Doesn't really make any difference whether they're from Texas or not.

414
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,280
The church existed long before the hour of Slack show on tapes and books,

415
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,020
and from the beginning it was always a national disorganization, not a local one.

416
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,360
I mean, we've got enough problems trying to keep up with a hundred other countries and states.

417
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:18,100
But what the Dallas hierarchy, you might say, have in common is that they have some degree of sense and maturity.

418
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,300
Not too much, of course.

419
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,900
They figure out what's going on before they shoot their mouse off, for instance,

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,500
and most of all, most of all, they give good slack.

421
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:35,380
Their rants or music or collages are clever, poignant, biting, and funny.

422
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,220
And original.

423
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,340
Not too tehe-teh.

424
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,420
They're the church of the inside joke.

425
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,400
And they don't come off like frustrated sci-fi or computer nerds,

426
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,080
even if they're into sci-fi or computers,

427
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,780
and they don't suck up to Stang,

428
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,240
nor imbue him with imaginary powers to turn North Texas into a mutant paradise.

429
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,880
In fact, they don't even call me Stang in person.

430
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,460
They realize that Bob is the real boss,

431
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,980
and he helps those, dear friends, who helps themselves and put their good where it does the most.

432
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,800
And for those people, dear friends, we are grateful.

433
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh, so grateful.

434
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,140
Now, if you out there are offended by our all-inclusive put-downs of listeners in general,

435
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,480
then you must be insecure about something.

436
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,460
Because I think most listeners understand the put-downs and the spirit in which they're intended.

437
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,300
The great tradition of obnoxious use of radio.

438
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,960
It- well, that's why most people enjoy it.

439
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,100
They realize that there are those who are the buts,

440
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,820
and there are those who are the tellers of the joke.

441
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,400
And some of the buts are those who are trying to tell the joke the loudest.

442
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,220
Not just here, but everywhere.

443
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Not knowing that the punchline actually came somewhere near the beginning.

444
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,700
But it doesn't all add up, does it?

445
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,900
Until you get to the end, which doesn't sound like a punchline,

446
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,420
and then you think back,

447
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:13,940
and then you get the joke which we know to be all too horribly true.

448
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,720
Elitist? You bet.

449
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,560
Now, some call it quality control.

450
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,220
Not letting you on the show doesn't mean that I'm hogging the airwaves.

451
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,700
It means the airwaves are already hogged,

452
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,940
and we gotta use what we consider to be good,

453
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,280
and which honors Bob's sweet name.

454
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,820
Or at least...

455
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,600
you know, something like that.

456
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,760
Because Bob started a church, friends,

457
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,900
and not a comic book or a gaming club or whatever.

458
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,380
And because he did that means that we can't tell somebody

459
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,700
they can't do a stupid show or booklet on their own,

460
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,400
unless they make money off it,

461
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,000
in which case it becomes a legal question.

462
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,160
Then we don't care how bad it is as long as we get a cut.

463
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,200
But being a church,

464
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,300
most shows we do aren't really done expecting much money,

465
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,740
aside from the occasional fundraiser for K-N-O-N.

466
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,440
At least not the parties.

467
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,800
Rantings, anyway.

468
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,080
So, no matter how corny or embarrassing

469
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,700
your particular watered-down or over-amped,

470
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,420
shallow presentations of Bob's teachings may be,

471
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,800
neither Bob or us are gonna do anything but make fun of you.

472
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,420
And your problem's gonna be that we're better at it.

473
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,680
Not necessarily because we're older, which is often the case,

474
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,200
but simply because we've had more

475
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,980
experience.

476
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,100
I mean, my kids at the ages of ten and eight

477
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,940
have been in it longer than so many of these

478
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,500
pablum-pukin-pew-packin' papas

479
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,300
that wanna think they can produce a wonderful subgenius revival

480
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,960
as long as they end up on the stage

481
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,020
bleating their generally not very good sermons

482
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,740
to an uncomprehending and rather embarrassed audience.

483
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,800
And what it comes down to is there's a big difference

484
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,880
between bold surrealism and bad surrealism,

485
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,760
and some people don't even know what either one of those are,

486
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,180
and they think the whole thing is light comedy.

487
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,700
Or else it's rather vindictive and narrow-minded,

488
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,020
bitter ranting against a conspiracy

489
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,980
which they're seeing through blinders

490
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,820
and limiting to, say, Republicans.

491
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,380
Whereas the con is, nay nay,

492
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,720
just as well embedded in the anarchists, say,

493
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,740
but simply not as powerful,

494
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,380
just because the anarchists haven't had a chance to screw up

495
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,720
in quite as big a manner.

496
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,040
So friends, it is us versus them,

497
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,300
and most people seem to have an opinion

498
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,120
as to whether they're us or them.

499
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,340
Some, unfortunately, who hate the church

500
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,740
and think they're not subgeniuses, in fact are.

501
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,320
They just haven't had quite the right background

502
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,040
to pick up on what our particular style is really saying.

503
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,100
Others are certain that they are true subgeniuses,

504
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,740
but in fact are merely case studies of advanced Bobbyism

505
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
that we allow to continue simply

506
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,020
because they do occasionally buy products

507
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,460
that fill Dobbs' ever-growing and yet depleting

508
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,080
black hole of a coffer.

509
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,780
The black hole that is the divine wallet

510
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,940
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

511
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,500
Eventually, friends, all, all will go into that great wallet

512
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,200
and nothing will come out again.

513
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,140
Ah, yes.

514
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,740
The harvest.

515
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,600
And what it all boils down to is

516
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,020
they're basically asking,

517
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,140
why don't I get more attention, Reverend Stang?

518
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,880
And it's because you didn't catch our attention, see?

519
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,000
Sorry. Try again.

520
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,920
Schisms are, of course, Bob ordained,

521
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,400
and for some reason some people fixate on

522
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,020
this Stang demon rather than the real source,

523
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,160
old Bob or young Bob.

524
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,960
Hey, Bob's as old as the mountains

525
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,780
and as young as the streams.

526
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,660
And his church has not, is not,

527
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,740
nor has it ever been an amateur publishing co-op

528
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,080
whereby we all swear to take turns

529
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,760
printing each other's crap no matter how bad it is.

530
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,700
We're not communists, I'm afraid,

531
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,880
but rather a compendium of the best of Bob.

532
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
And by whose standards again?

533
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,000
By mine.

534
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,660
Sure, they say there's, there's freedom of the press

535
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,600
for whoever owns a printing press.

536
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,780
Well, we don't own a printing press,

537
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,500
and yet we've had about as great a degree of freedom

538
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,320
as one could reasonably ask on this planet,

539
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,700
in this particular benighted millennium.

540
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,740
And we get death threats, sure, but nobody kills us.

541
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,780
So nobody here or anywhere else is stopping you

542
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,860
from putting together your own press.

543
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,240
You can put together your own fantastic subgenius magazine

544
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,420
or show.

545
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,420
Only because, you know,

546
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,600
if it's not really as fantastic as you think it is,

547
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,380
it's not going to be seen by as many people

548
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,700
nor make any money anyway.

549
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,740
And if it does make money

550
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,220
and we still don't think it's fantastic,

551
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,780
why, then we have a legal ability to shut you down.

552
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,820
You can always start a church of Bill,

553
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,140
but that's already been done.

554
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,020
Praise Bill.

555
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,580
Just because you sent in 20 bucks

556
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,100
doesn't entitle you to walk in on any production

557
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,940
that has the name subgenius on it.

558
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,940
It does entitle you to four issues of the stark fist

559
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,600
which you have not gotten

560
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,900
and which is what you should be angry about,

561
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,980
rather than these side issues

562
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,620
of getting your material out where everybody can see it.

563
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,440
You can do that the same way we did,

564
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,480
with a little more elbow grease than you might have suspected.

565
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,120
So I don't invite you on.

566
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,340
What are you going to do about it?

567
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,280
Boycott the show?

568
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,040
It's not like we have advertisers or ratings to worry about.

569
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,180
And showing up here at the station

570
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,860
expecting to be given a microphone,

571
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,200
as some have done,

572
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,000
well, that's an admirable gall,

573
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,140
but it's deplorable manners, dear friends.

574
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,280
So there.

575
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,700
Let there be slack for the deserving.

576
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,200
Back to the music.

577
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
Here's a purdy one.

578
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,020
For the music.

579
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,020


580
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,280
From the son of Mr. Peppermint

581
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,940
and the butthole surfers.

582
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,900
It's a lovely tune.

583
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,160
Called Sweat Love.

584
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,000
And along with my difficult music é

585
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,240
If you see your mom this weekend, would you be sure and tell her...

586
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,020
Satan!

587
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,760
Satan!

588
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Satan!

589
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,560
Satan!

590
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
Satan!

591
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,540
Satan!

592
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,800
Satan!

593
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
Satan!

594
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,720
Satan!

595
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,840
Satan!

596
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,420
Satan!

597
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,820
We smell not this.

598
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,460
We smell pop.

599
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,620
This Sunday, stay tuned right after Tapeworm Baseball for...

600
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,820
Abbott and Costello meet the Antichrist.

601
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,740
But Abbott is the Animus.

602
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,520
Lou Costello is the Anima.

603
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:28,840
Spring.

604
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,500
And Byington is the Magna Mater.

605
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,720
And John Ireland is the Beast.

606
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,620
In Abbott and Costello meet the Antichrist.

607
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,200
Jack!

608
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,040
Jack!

609
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,380
Jack!

610
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,140
Jack!

611
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,000
Jack!

612
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,580
Jack!

613
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,120
Jack!

614
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,000
Jack!

615
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,460
Jack!

616
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:44,860
Jack!

617
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,020
Jack!

618
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,540
Jack!

619
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,600
Jack!

620
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:45,840
Jack!

621
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:45,900


622
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,120


623
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,120


624
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,120


625
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,120


626
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,120


627
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,880
What is it now, Costello?

628
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,300
Look at that throne.

629
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,120
Which throne?

630
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,440
That throne, the Holy of Holies.

631
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
You mean the seat of the throne of Jerusalem?

632
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,100
I mean the throne of Jehovah.

633
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,080
I saw him sitting there.

634
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,900
What's the big deal?

635
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,780
There's nobody there.

636
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,140
Will you stop fooling around?

637
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,660
Shut up and pass me the Kabbalah.

638
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,200
Jack! I saw him there.

639
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:09,560
Who?

640
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,080
David Rockefeller.

641
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,200
But if I see you hitting the Holy Sacrament one more time...

642
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,240
See our two G.I. jerks say nuts to the Nazis like this.

643
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,540
Now Homer, listen to me.

644
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,740
It's simple.

645
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,080
The forces of dark and the forces of light.

646
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,080


647
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,900
Will fight for the last time.

648
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,840
You mean like Joe Louis?

649
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,380
No, no, Homer.

650
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:32,980
The apocalypse.

651
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,580
Oh, yeah, apocalypse.

652
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
Oh, I like that Jamaican music.

653
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,100
Oh, no.

654
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,540
Don't you understand?

655
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,740
It's Armageddon.

656
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,880
Armageddon what?

657
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,360
No, not Eurogeddon.

658
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,060
Armageddon.

659
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,180
I don't understand.

660
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,040
You tell me there's a final fight between dark and light, but it's not a title battle.

661
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,500
That's right.

662
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,740
You tell me it's apocalypse, but it's not Jamaican gong music.

663
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,160
That's right.

664
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,060
You tell me it's Armageddon, but the only thing I know is I'm getting killed.

665
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,160
I'm tired of trying to figure out this book of revelations.

666
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,540
See Lou go gaga over curvaceous Hillary Brooke, but bite off more hosts than he can chew when

667
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,260
he winds up up to his stripes in hot holy water.

668
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,540
Homer, it's kind of hot in here.

669
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,920
How about if we step outside to the veranda?

670
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,180
It's okay by me, lady.

671
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,600
Why, you adorable little thing.

672
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,060
You're shy, aren't you?

673
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,460
Ah, shucks, yes, ma'am.

674
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,360
Call me Hillary.

675
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,740
Oh, shy Hillary, are you?

676
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,280
Well, if you're ever lonely, Homer, you can give me a call.

677
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,560
You won't regret it.

678
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,260
You're a nice lady.

679
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,000
What's your number?

680
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,480
Here, it's 666-6666.

681
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,240
666-6666.

682
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,700
That's right.

683
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,720
666-6666.

684
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,620
666-6666.

685
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,280
666-6666.

686
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,460

666-6666.

688
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,640
666-6666.

689
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,160
Yeah, Ab and Gustello meet the Antichrist this Sunday right after tapeworm baseball.

690
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,020
On KNON 89.3 FM, that was Hubert Goetz.

691
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,760
Curlin' on the devil, curlin' on the lame

692
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,380
You must be curlin' on the devil

693
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,600
O child, it must be a shame

694
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,200
You must be curlin' on the devil

695
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,040
Curlin' on the lame

696
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,700
You must be curlin' on the devil, right

697
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,180
It's time to take that

698
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,480
away from the valley

699
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,720
It's time to realize

727
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,520
Do androids dream of electric sheep?

728
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,520
Electronic media creates reality.

729
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,520
Electronic media creates your mind.

730
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,140
Do androids dream of electronic sheep?

731
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,840
This is Angel.

732
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,760
We are the Android Sisters.

733
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,840
Last night I watched the nightly news.

734
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,840
Last night I watched the nightly news.

735
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,580
Do you watch the nightly news?

736
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,120
Do you watch it faithfully?

737
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,340
Night after night after night.

738
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,180
I watch it. I watch it.

739
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,740
We watch the nightly news.

740
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,740
Nightly news.

741
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,660
But last night was different.

742
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,300
Something happened.

743
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,560
As I watched, I suddenly saw that

744
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,020
my hands had become little hooves.

745
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,520
My feet were little hooves.

746
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,980
My nose was long.

747
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,420
My nostrils were big.

748
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,480
I had two.

749
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,740
Furry ears.

750
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,980
I was covered with wool.

751
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,980
When I opened my mouth, out came

752
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:08,900
and the anchorman was saying,

753
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,240
blah, blah.

754
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,920
And I replied,

755
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:20,400
and the anchor woman was saying,

756
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,100
blah, blah.

757
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,460
And I replied,

758
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,940
bah, bah.

759
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,240
Then I remembered.

760
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,960
Then I remembered.

761
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,220
Electronic media creates reality.

762
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,020
Electronic media creates your mind.

763
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,440
Do you watch the nightly news?

764
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,780
Do you watch it faithfully?

765
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,160
Night after night after.

766
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,100
When they go blah, blah, blah.

767
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,340
Do you go?

768
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,100
Bah, bah, bah.

769
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,820
And you have the nerve to ask us,

770
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,760
do androids dream of electronic sheep?

771
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,860
And so we reply, yes.

772
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,860
We dream of electronic sheep.

773
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,500
We dream of you.

774
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,880
Hey, what happened to little babies like Dermal had?

775
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,040
There's a little baby Dermal was in there last night.

776
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,840
What happened to that?

777
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,020
What happened to him?

778
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,820
What?

779
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,620
Did Dermal mommy eat the baby?

780
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,020
Oh!

781
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,880
Hey, why can't we do that?

782
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,340
Why can't we eat our baby?

783
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,620
Why can't we eat the baby?

784
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,660
You always say we eat too much.

785
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,840
You always say we respect too much.

786
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,620
We eat too much of food.

787
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,500
I'm sick of eating the stupid chicken.

788
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,120
We have chicken every night of the week because it's cheap.

789
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,720
Why can't we eat the baby because the baby was free?

790
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,100
The Dermals ate the babies.

791
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,560
Why can't we eat ours?

792
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,380
Why can't we eat ours?

793
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,900
Why can't we eat ours?

794
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,440
Why can't we eat ours?

795
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,240
Why can't we eat ours?

796
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,560
Why not?

797
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,140
Come on, I'm sick of chicken.

798
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,520
Let's have something different.

799
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,160
Oh, the baby doesn't cry all the time.

800
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,540
It stinks.

801
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,280
The baby smells like she wears pants all the time.

802
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,420
The bathroom smells like we're stupid diapers.

803
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,980
Why can't we just eat her and get rid of her?

804
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,180
My Dermals did it.

805
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,520
Why can't we eat our food?

806
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,520


807
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,520


808
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,520


809
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,220
All she does is wake you up in the middle of the night.

810
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,160
All you do is complain about how much it costs to feed an extra mouth.

811
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,020
Well, if we eat her, we won't have to.

812
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,520
Come on.

813
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,040
Come on.

814
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,160
Come on.

815
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,580
Come on.

816
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:49,580


817
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:49,580


818
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:49,580


819
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:49,580


820
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,520
Let's eat the baby!

821
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,200
.

822
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,200


823
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,320
Oh, what a lovely, lovely...

824
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,360
Would you like to sit on the bottom of a tree?

825
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,980
What?

826
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,560
Alright.

827
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,880
Hover hover to you.

828
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:22,500
Yeah.

829
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:32,900
Well friends, what you just heard there was Happy Flowers doing Let's Eat the Baby.

830
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,660
I think Happy Flowers is going to be one of my new favorite bands. I've never heard of them.

831
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:44,520
There's several others on this tape that we'll get to next time, including my favorite I Want to Watch cartoons.

832
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,520
Funny thing is we got a letter from England just Saturday saying,

833
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,740
Have you ever heard of Happy Flowers? And just that very day we had.

834
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:02,800
The first one there after Abbott and Costello meet the Antichrist was Diamanda Gala.

835
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:10,520
You must be certain of the devil. And in between, Android Sisters and Electric Sheep.

836
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,060
And you're listening, dear friends.

837
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:24,440
To the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack for free information about the Church of the Subgenius,

838
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,640
the mysterious oriental religion.

839
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,140
Please write the following post office box for free information.

840
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,720
If you dare. That is,

841
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,160
Abhab Sultan Bab

842
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:49,440
at Box 140306

843
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:57,340
in exotic Dallas, Texas 75214

844
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:06,940
Once again, Box 140, Sahib, Dallas, Texas 75214.

845
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,020
Ah, the beautiful dancing maidens.

846
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,580
And you are listening to...

847
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:23,960
Money means security. No money means terror.

848
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,400
Oh, oh.

849
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,060
This is Angel. This is Angel.

850
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,260
We are the Android Sisters.

851
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,660
Today's topic is money.

852
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,620
Money is important. Everyone needs money.

853
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,840
Have you been deprived of money?

854
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,160
Do you suffer from money withdrawal?

855
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,160
Do you need a money fix?

856
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,540
Is your money fix not big enough?

857
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,700
What if you lost your job?

858
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,880
The job you can't stand?

859
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,560
The job a machine could do.

860
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,560
Then do it better.

861
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,100
What if you lost that?

862
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,040
Then what?

863
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,040
Uh-oh.

864
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,660
No money means terror.

865
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,300
Oh, oh.

866
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,200
Are you happy?

867
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,040
Do you wonder why you are not happy?

868
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,040
Do you live in a constant state of fear?

869
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,660
Have they made you into a money junkie?

870
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,200
Do you hate your job?

871
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,020
Do you have a job to hate?

872
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,420
Are you looking for a job?

873
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,520

security. No money means terror. Oh, oh.

894
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:54,940
The pyramids were in construction. The Pharaoh flowed with satisfaction. But then two hills

895
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:01,140
of men surprised. His empire fell before his eyes. A hundred thousand busy slaves down

896
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,960
their toes and stood in space.

897
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:21,940

902
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,920
calf had been uprooted. The Pharaoh's men were in the middle of the night. The Pharaoh's

903
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,980
men were still in the middle of the night. And old folks sitting around the fire were

904
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:06,800
talking voices from the sky. Babies sailing down the Nile. The recipe for locust pie. A

01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,940
hundred thousand frogs per mile, we'd always ask them to describe.

914
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,520
