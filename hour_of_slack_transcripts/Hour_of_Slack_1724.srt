1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,720
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,380
No, no you're not alright.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,780
You're exhausted.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,100
That thing around your neck!

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,100
I could help a bit.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,340
I could carry it for a while.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:16,740
No.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,520
I could carry it for a while.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,420
Are you propositioning me?

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,580
Share the load.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,740
Share the load.

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,460
The load.

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,560
The load.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,320
Get away!

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,420
Can I get a praise bar?

16
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,160
Yeah!

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,840
Praise bar!

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,400
Some power on the slack.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,160
Ah, yes.

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,860
Dear friends, we're back to X-Day for this show.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,760
And we've also got a new song by El Queso,

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,080
who is heard in the background.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,860
And yes, yes, yes, friends.

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,340
And X-Day, the great celebration at Brushwood,

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,100
in far rural, mysterious, western New York State,

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,740
where the subgeniuses go to await the saucers

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,180
prophesied by their great slack master,

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,300
J.R. Bob Dobson.

29
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,960
J.R. Bob Dobson.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
J.R. Bob Dobson.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,000
J.R. Bob Dobson.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,800
J.R. Bob Dobson.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:28,800


34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:28,800


35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:28,800


36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:28,800


37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:28,840
J.R. Bob Dobson.

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,560
J.R. Bob Dobson.

39
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,560
J.R. Bob Dobson.

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,220
J.R. Bob Dobson.

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,060
J.R. Bob Dobson.

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,100
J.R. Bob Dobson.

43
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,940
J.R. Bob Dobson.

44
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,600
J.R. Bob Dobson.

45
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:44,980
J.R. Bob Dobson.

46
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,580
J.R. Bob Dobson.

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,940
J.R. Bob Dobson.

48
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,940
And now friends, the title music from the video,

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,400
Dobson Deliasticies.

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,900
I gotta have some swag.

51
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,840
Before we go, I'd like to thank you for watching.

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,980
I'm your host, J.R. Bob Dobson.

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,440
And I'll see you next time.

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,660
Bye.

55
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,780
Bye.

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,000
Bye.

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:24,780


58
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,220
Bye.

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,000
Bye.

60
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,300


61
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,300


62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,640


63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,640


64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,640


65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,500
Bye.

66
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,960
Bye.

67
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,060
Bye.

68
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
Bye.

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
Bye.

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,820
Bye.

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


72
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


73
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


74
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


75
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


76
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:58,820


77
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,480
Just part of the folks.

78
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,460
Now let's make a call.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Your mind is not my mind.

80
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
Don't forget that.

81
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,040
My mind is not your mind.

82
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,200
They should have 24-7 Love Genius Radio.

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,780
They should.

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,240
I would volunteer to be one of the DJs on that show, on that station.

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
Let's all get my radio broadcasting.

86
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,320
And you would just listen to 24 hours of this show?

87
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,280
Oh, yeah.

88
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,860
No, 24 minutes.

89
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh, 24 minutes.

90
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Oh, 24 hours.

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,880
24 hours, seven days a week.

92
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,460
24 planets.

93
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
That would be tough.

94
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,680
I'd have to have some time off.

95
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,860
24 rings of smoke around the head of the caller.

96
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,780
Okay, we could call this caller.

97
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,040
And this caller would serve as part of the great radio team.

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,800
The fantastic 24-hour.

99
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,940
And they're watching the show.

100
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,740
24 hours a day.

101
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,980
Oh, the great team of Buzzing Evidence.

102
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,260
Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Howell.

103
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,800
24-7 on KPFA in sub-Berkeley.

104
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,940
What about this new song you ask about Prairie Squid, you say?

105
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,420
By the El Queso All-Stars?

106
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,600
You're my angel in a bucket, my darling in a pail.

107
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,420
And I'm writing you this letter from the lonesome county jail.

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,300
They say that I'm a little too old to be a man.

109
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,300


110
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,440
But it's all natural to love you the way that I did.

111
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,040
They call it a crime to spend all my time six inches deep in a prairie squid.

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,320
So I send you this reminder of a heart that beats for two.

113
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,240
And I hope you're doing all right in the refrigerator.

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,300
You've got plenty of time.

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,640
I've got room in the bucket.

116
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,220
So I'm guessing that you'll be okay.

117
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,880
Cause when I get out and back into you, I'm hoping you'll still feel the same way.

118
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,300
Hoping that you'll feel the same way.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,940
My darling, this letter is sealed with my tears.

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,940
But it's Bob.

121
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,080
Bob is my witness.

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,960
I swear I'll return to your many loving arms.

123
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,960
Angel in a bucket.

124
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,020
I want you.

125
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,660
Angel in a bucket.

126
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,760
I need you.

127
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,940
Angel in a bucket.

128
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,060
I can't live without you, baby.

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,420
Angel in a bucket.

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,260
Angel in a bucket.

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,820
Kind of kick a little something past you for the G's and make a few friends as I breathe.

132
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,440
You know it's two in the morning and the party's still jumping.

133
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,840
Because my old lady ain't home.

134
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,560
The bitch is in the living room and getting it on.

135
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,580
And they ain't leaving until six in the morning.

136
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,880
What you want to do?

137
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,840
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.

138
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,920
So turn out the lights.

139
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Shut the doors.

140
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,480
But we don't love them whores.

141
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,140
G Gordon Gordon dear friends at 7X Day.

142
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,820
Before that, the El Queso All Stars.

143
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,800
This is God's Got Talent.

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,800


145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,800


146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,800


147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,800


148
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,800
He's got the friends but he needs a location.

149
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,700
He's got a local but he needs the supplies.

150
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,840
But friends have supplies so they all get together.

151
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,720
Now everybody's welcome at the party tonight.

152
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,260
It's time to redefine the new school group.

153
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,460
Or two-tone suits hanging by the door.

154
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,860
Super orgy portal party.

155
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,100
Super orgy portal party.

156
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,140
Super orgy portal party.

157
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,540
Super orgy portal party.

158
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,520
Super orgy portal party.

159
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,860
Super orgy portal party.

160
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:29,860


161
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,120
You know I actually went to one of those Bob Dobbs devivals.

162
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,900
Yeah there was one last night. It was a great time.

163
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,140
I shouldn't have said devivals.

164
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,680
One of the X Days but...

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,620
Oh, X Day. Wow, yeah.

166
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,820
After the original X Day, like everything before it was a drill

167
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,200
and everything after it was like

168
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
the second year was double X Day,

169
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
and then there was triple X Day.

170
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,100
Yeah, well here's the thing. We don't know what year 1998 will really be

171
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,280
because the conspiracy calendar is messed up.

172
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,620
Right.

173
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,900
So, you know, any day could...

174
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,580
tomorrow and you may die, that's just saying

175
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:58,940
that

176
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,700
the world may well end tomorrow for all we know.

177
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,580
You don't know. I'm fairly confident

178
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,640
because the story that I heard

179
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,020
at approximately

180
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,420
7.05 on X-Day

181
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,640
was that Bob Dobbs, when he

182
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,620
received the secret message from the X's,

183
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,500
he

184
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,220
wrote it on a bar napkin,

185
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,720
but the actual date

186
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,740
is if you turn 1998 upside down,

187
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
it's 8,661.

188
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,400
So that's the actual year

189
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,560
they're going to come, so we're still

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,920
supposed to go to Starwood.

191
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,520
The latest theory I heard was

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,880
5,000 years from now, about

193
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,680
The latest theory I heard was

194
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,300
2017

195
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,340
because of

196
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,540
Because Ivan Stank thinks he's going to live that long?

197
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,940
No, because 1984 came

198
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,120
19 years too late.

199
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,640
When the president started saying,

200
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,920
war is peace, last year, we knew

201
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,740
that means it must really be 1984.

202
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,860
Radio Synesthesia

203
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,440
on

204
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,780
on WCSB in Cleveland

205
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,460
with Dr. Sinister.

206
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Before that, the super orgy

207
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,840
porno party thing is by

208
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,580
the Planet Smashers.

209
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
But now,

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Little Theodore

211
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,220
live at X-Day.

212
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,740
And now, the ultimate song about

213
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,960
pink life.

214
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
Pink Life

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,220
Get up out of bed

216
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,420
Sour on my head

217
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,780
Drinking down a cup

218
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,000
Trying to wake up

219
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Driving off for town

220
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,340
Feeling like a clown

221
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,760
Some guy's in my lane

222
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,720
Heard a bullet through his window pane

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,420
Heard a bullet through his window pane

224
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,900
Heard a bullet through his window pane

225
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,200
Pull into the lot

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,120
Heard a bullet through his door pane

227
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,120


228
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,120


229
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,260
Got my favorite spot

230
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,680
Boy, you're such a Glass~"

231
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Greeting everyone

232
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,540
Individual death

233
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,440
Trying to act

234
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,800
Dumb

235
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,060
You can't

236
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,900
I don't belong here

237
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,080
But then of course the question is then where?

238
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,300
I'm plagued by one great doubt

239
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,460
It's become what my life's all about

240
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
If I had done that

241
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,500
I wouldn't have to do this

242
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,640
If I had done that

243
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,500
I wouldn't have to do this

244
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,340
If I had done that

245
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,060
Friends, I wish we had the rest of that song.

246
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,600
Little Theodore, live at X-Day.

247
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,600
You can get more about that at littletheodore.com

248
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,340
And now back to Puzzling Evidence with Dr. Howell and Philo.

249
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,980
A debriefing after 7X Day.

250
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's see, what else happened that was exceptional

251
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,620
and really amazing?

252
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, there was the auction, of course.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,240
The auction for subgenius youth outreach.

254
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,160
That is correct.

255
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,980
And Hal and I were the subgenius youth outreach recipients.

256
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,060
Senior division, of course.

257
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,860
Yes, our cabin was for youthful types like Sir Guy Dua,

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
who was also in our cabin.

259
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,800
One of the three snorers of distinction.

260
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,780
I found out later they put us all together for a specific reason.

261
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,120
The Snorewood Factor.

262
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,040
That's right, the Snorewood Factor.

263
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,120
They had this wooden snore device, snore capturing device below the chamber.

264
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,180
This is one of my favorite movies.

265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,380
Come on, you guys, be quiet.

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,260
I want you to watch this.

267
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,620
Okay, all right.

268
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,740
Hal fell asleep again.

269
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,680
This is the part where Ivan Stang takes over the world.

270
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,020
A thousand experiments.

271
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,500
A thousand failures.

272
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,520
And then, at last, the great, wonderful day.

273
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,940
Stang.

274
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,920
It's just the great, wonderful day.

275
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
The last little mixture of drugs.

276
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,160
But why?

277
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,180
Why do it?

278
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Stang.

279
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,800
Just a scientific experiment at first.

280
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,020
That's all.

281
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,360
To do something no other men in the world have done.

282
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,260
But there's more to it than that.

283
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,140
I know now.

284
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,080
It came to me suddenly.

285
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,000
The drugs I took seemed to be the only thing I could do.

286
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They seemed to light up my brain.

287
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,980
Suddenly I realized the power I held.

288
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,460
The power to rule.

289
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
To make the world grovel at my feet.

290
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,340
We'll soon put the world right now.

291
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
We'll begin with the reign of terror.

292
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,380
A few murders here and there.

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,580
Murders of great men.

294
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
Murders of little men.

295
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,720
Just to show we make no distinction.

296
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,300
We might even wreck a train or two.

297
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,740
Just these fingers.

298
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,980
Around the eyes of the criminal.

299
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


300
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


301
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


302
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


303
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


304
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


305
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


306
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


307
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


308
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


309
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


310
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


311
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


312
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980


313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,020
the signalman's throat. That's all. So where's my frop, Stang? Stang, where's my frop, man?

314
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:32,440
You want that award again, don't you? The Hey Stang Award. Hey Stang. Hey Stang. See

315
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:39,780
my butt plug, Stang? I snore all night and I'm like this in the day. Hal can actually

316
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,800
snore before he goes to sleep. It's like as he's beginning to enter his sleep cycle,

317
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,920
the snoring begins. But the second or third night, I was able to obtain some ear things.

318
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,920
Some ear muffs, all right. Ear plugs. Give a plug for those muffs. I couldn't even hear

319
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,040
the fan. I couldn't hear anything. I could just hear my breathing. The fans, he refers

320
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,640
to, were specifically imported by Philo, not to cool the room down, but just to make

321
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:09,760
noise.

322
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,700
A white noise that would ideally muffle all the snoring into one rattling roar.

323
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,780
We had three fans that blew a vortex that was enough to just...

324
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,900
It often blew the frop smoke away to silence the shrill beeping of the fire alarm, which

325
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,420
would be set off by the clouds of punching frop smoke.

326
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:38,000
We had one fan whose only job was to blow the smoke past the fire alarm before it would

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
set the fire alarm off.

328
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,500
But it did also provide a secondary purpose, and that was to keep the wind blowing across

329
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,260
my...

330
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,480
Ow.

331
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,120
Ow.

332
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:52,720
That hurt.

333
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh, don't snap it like that. That's not going to do anybody any good.

334
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:05,380
So we had three fans positioned that blew a vortex, about a 30 to 40 mile an hour circular

335
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,180
wind inside our snoring chamber.

336
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,820
Okay, I got it.

337
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh, there we go.

338
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,040
Sorry.

339
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,200
What?

340
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
Oh, there she goes.

341
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,120
This is Lady Time going by.

342
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,020
Trying to remember what show she's listening to.

343
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,660
You have a drug problem.

344
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,340
I lost my drugs twice today.

345
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Twice today.

346
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,160
If it were not for the power of Bob and the love of subgenii, I would be fropless.

347
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,800
I lost my frop.

348
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,520
Twice.

349
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,980
And why?

350
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,520
And why?

351
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,280
Drugs.

352
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,420
Because the frop took your mind.

353
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,680
No, it wasn't a frop.

354
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,960
It was a false drug.

355
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,160
It was the false marijuana.

356
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
This stuff here.

357
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,760
It's not frop.

358
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,160
That's why it took my mind.

359
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,400
It's false drugs.

360
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,200
You don't want to smoke it.

361
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,300
It made me throw my sunglasses in the fire.

362
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,500
It made you lose your other false drugs.

363
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,000
It made me lose my real false drugs twice.

364
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,800
Not once, but twice.

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,940
Fool me once, shit on you.

366
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,340
Fool me twice, fuck you.

367
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,900
My mind is not my mind.

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,320
I never personally been to the big party.

369
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,360
But I suppose that if I did, I'd have a good time.

370
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,240
Lots of folks I see doing it regularly.

371
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,060
And they tell me that it feels just fine.

372
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,380
Time to redefine the new school group.

373
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,520
Or two-tone suits scattered on the floor.

374
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,200
Super orgy porno party.

375
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,740
Super orgy porno party.

376
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:39,760
Super orgy porno party.

377
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,240
Super orgy porno party.

378
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,540
Super orgy porno party.

379
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,400
I no longer wish to preach to the choir.

380
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,140
If I'm going to be reduced to preaching about things that we are well aware of,

381
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,240
then I am going to be preaching to others besides you illustrious folk.

382
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,780
I'm going to have to go out there into the world, make a goddamn fool of myself,

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,540
and preach the word of Bob, aren't I?

384
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,580
Well...

385
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,220
If that's what it requires, then that is what it requires.

386
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,140
But I will admit this.

387
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,680
I won't go gently into that good night.

388
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,620
I will, however, fly high and happy aboard the pleasure saucers

389
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,780
on that fateful day, whenever it may be.

390
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,980
And I've heard that it might not be this year.

391
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,140
I'm hoping it will be.

392
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
But it might not.

393
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
But whenever it is, even if it's just myself,

394
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,080
it could be two other people, it could be three other people,

395
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,180
it could be four other people,

396
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,060
it could be four thousand other people who board the pleasure saucers with me.

397
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,780
I will board those saucers.

398
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,720
And I will do it with the knowledge that my consciousness is clean,

399
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,860
that I have slacked off to the fullest of my ability and comprehension,

400
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,960
and that I have lusted and hated in an entirely satisfying way.

401
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
Ladies and gentlemen, I may be young,

402
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,600
but I have never seen something so slack-producing in all my born days.

403
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,040
I can only hope that I have many, many born days to celebrate the slack further,

404
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,940
and I can hope that you, too, celebrate your slack until the very day you die

405
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,560
and shut up like hell.

406
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,120
So, go out there, stay, watch the bands, whatever, enjoy the purient interest,

407
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,460
get drunk, smoke the frob, I don't care, I don't mind.

408
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,940
Just know that on that fateful day, 7 a.m., July 5th,

409
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,760
you will be saved.

410
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,780
A huge thanks to American

411
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:55,780


412
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,480
Hey people ofициall,

413
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,060
who are Maned right now

414
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,140
Thank you or Number,

415
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,260
I will stay with you.

416
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,880
Shout out to

417
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:34,520
And now, for your edification, your bewonderment, your bafflement, your, finally, your slack.

418
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:43,700
I proudly, in the name of J. R. Bob Dobbs, present to you, little Theodore and a babooshtay!

419
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,880
Not always sure what the point is, but we press on anyway.

420
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,780
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.

421
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,700
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.

422
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,500
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.

423
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,500


424
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,500


425
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,560
Ugly girl, who thinks that's the way to be?

426
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:07,900
Ha!

427
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,600
I want an ugly girl, I'll make you jealous if you just wait and see.

428
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,800
Ugly girl, must be lonely, an ugly girl would love you only.

429
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,460
Ugly girl, may not look any harder now, but ugly girls have got just as many parts.

430
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,900
I want an ugly girl, not there, not the paper thing.

431
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,760
I want an ugly girl, bring me back to a love in a frame.

432
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,680
I want an ugly girl, make you proud if you didn't see.

433
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,700
I want an ugly girl, sure I'm all over the place.

434
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,940
Ugly girl, deserve happiness too.

435
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,560
An ugly girl would think the world of you.

436
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,800
Ugly girl, maybe easy.

437
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,280
But ugly girl, don't have me.

438
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,400
I want an ugly girl, who can tell you all about pain.

439
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,220
I want an ugly girl, who's the devil.

440
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,580
I want an ugly girl, who looks like a profane.

441
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,380
I want an ugly girl, take her out and start to do it.

442
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,540
Now I thought I'd sing something pretty and refined about something special.

443
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,120
Oh.

444
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,960
It must have been cold there in my freezer.

445
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,560
With never a microwave heating you up.

446
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,440
You aspire to be a quick dinner on my plate

447
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,320
But were content to wait until the time came up

448
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,380
So when I came home one night hungry

449
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,320
There you were waiting for me

450
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,240
That beautiful cheese was running down your side

451
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,420
Those wonderful beef jalapenos A and B

452
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,180
Did you ever think that I'd be hungry?

453
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,180


454
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,460
Did you ever know you're my burrito?

455
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:11,140
I ate your leg last week, yeah

456
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,560
And though you passed right on through me

457
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,120
They are still the wind between my cheeks

458
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,860
Did you ever know you're my burrito?

459
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,580
I ate your leg last week, yeah

460
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,880
And though you passed right on through me

461
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,060
They are still the wind

462
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,360
Yeah

463
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,920
I ate your leg last week, yeah

464
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:57,920


465
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,120
They are still the wind between my cheeks

466
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,140
One more time everybody, now!

467
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,920
Did you ever know you're my burrito?

468
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:17,360
I ate your leg last week, yeah

469
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,620
And though you passed right on through me

470
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,240
They are still the wind between my cheeks

471
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,360
One more time everybody, now!

472
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,420
You're still the wind between my cheeks

473
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,240
Oh, the wind between my cheeks

474
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh, fly, fly, escape into the sky

475
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,040
Offending all that you passed by

476
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,240
Thank you, thank you

477
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,160
Thank Rosarita for you though

478
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,360
Thank Rosarita for you though

479
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,440
The wind between my cheeks

480
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,000
This is by George Meredith, Lucifer in Starlight.

481
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:23,040
One starred night, Prince Lucifer arose, tired of his dark dominions,

482
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,560
swung the fiend above the rolling ball in cloud parts green,

483
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,880
where sinners hugged their specter of repose.

484
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,780
Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.

485
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,860
Now upon his westward wing he leans, now his huge bulk o'er Africa's sands careens,

486
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,820
now the black shadows shadowed Arctic snows.

487
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,660
Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars with memories of the old revolt from awe,

488
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,320
he reached a middle height, and at the stars,

489
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,040
which are the brain of heaven, he looked and sank.

490
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,160
Around the ancient track marched rank on rank the army of unalterable law.

491
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,140
Ah yes, Dr. Powell at Ex Day, dear friends.

492
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,820
Before that, Babushka, and before that, little Theodore, said,

493
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,160
by the way, they have a live at,

494
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,920
double Ex Day album out from their Ex Day performance in 1999.

495
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,780
You might check out little Theodore.com.

496
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,540
And before that, the amino acids themselves live at 7 Ex Day.

497
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,660
See the amino acids.com.

498
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,260
And before that, the youngest subgenius,

499
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,680
a ranter and winner of the Bobby Award for that this year,

500
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,860
Reverend Alex Thompson.

501
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,940
And now,

502
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,060
from WREK in Atlanta,

503
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,600
the Bob Slacktime Funhouse Show,

504
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,980
lymph node institute,

505
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,060
Doc Ellis.

506
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,940
Good evening, you tinsenny.

507
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,340
This is a blive Doc Ellis of the lymph node institute.

508
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,300
Tonight, I would like to talk to another audience besides you,

509
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,300
the cells of this great beast.

510
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,060
That is our church, our rock, and our deceiver.

511
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:36,140
I would like to address that scruffy guy laying on the floor of that strange room.

512
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,320
And you, the skinny girl in the back seat who can't remember where the car is headed.

513
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,600
You, my captive audience.

514
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,560
Your proximity to this broadcast is no accident.

515
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,460
Bob's is a strange and frightening bedotted countenance,

516
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,300
which comes unto you, like unto the angry bum in the alleyway.

517
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,300


518
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,520
Though he may befoul you and rob you in unexpected ways,

519
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,260
you also gain from his violation.

520
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,360
For Bob is the center of a giant reciprocal force.

521
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,860
And though he befouls and robs,

522
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,640
he also blanches and misplaces,

523
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,540
so creating as he destroys,

524
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,220
and obeying the first law of thermodynamics,

525
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,160
which states that energy can only be converted from one state to another,

526
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,280
but cannot be converted.

527
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,280


528
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,900
And so, Bob's is a very lucky man,

529
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,100
and we're with the whole briny-claws scuttling bit.

530
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,620
Elliot, the question Bob has for you tonight is,

531
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,280
how would you like to bust one of those claws of yours open,

532
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,020
and taste your own succulent meat?

533
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,260
Because whether you know it or not,

534
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,100
you have been living on borrowed time,

535
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,280
and you have been living on borrowed time,

536
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,280


537
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,240
since July of 1998.

538
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,900
And this brief foray of yours to the happy side of the luck plane

539
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,180
is both a warning and an inducement.

540
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,840
The church of the subgenius,

541
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,360
no less than Bob Spear,

542
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,200
lanced to the core of this world,

543
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,340
is the only religion that just wants to befoul and rob you.

544
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,640
Your brain, life, soul, etc. are yours to keep,

545
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,460
or at least hold onto for as long as you can.

546
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,360
The other religions are imperfect imitations,

547
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,160
or precursors, depending on how you look at it.

548
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,920
But, however you look at it,

549
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,160
this is the only church that works for you.

550
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,320
While we're on the subject, to be honest for once,

551
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,220
I too was deeply wounded when July 5th, 1998 rolled around,

552
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,100
and I was denied the spectacle of my unsaved friends and loved ones

553
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,800
tortured by the indignity of the surreal death of my own personal design.

554
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,120
Yeah, I had big plans,

555
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,240
and Bob just pissed them away.

556
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,380
But, we're well past that now.

557
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:18,880
Right past that into the frozen, shrieking, steel death trap.

558
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,940
Okay.

559
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:30,820
Well, I know I see people, and they ask me,

560
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,780
how did the Institute fall into the sway with the church?

561
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,520
Well, it was almost inevitable.

562
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,860
When you deal in incalculable margins as we do,

563
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,460
naturally, when it came time to select the trans-intuitive meme conveyance device,

564
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,500
we chose the one with the nice, pointy smile.

565
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,700
That, and it does attract a somewhat higher quality sample of the gene pool.

566
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,640
Of course, as in a usual population, about half the samples are fruitless,

567
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,860
but for some reason, far more vocal about it.

568
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,940
The apathy and ennui that supernatural protection can lead to,

569
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:18,620
for some, is that last layer of jade that forces their heads to sink into their torsos.

570
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,820
However, and listen closely,

571
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,020
because this is how we make our money.

572
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,380
The other half, instead of being merely acceptable,

573
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,460
as in the population at large,

574
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,380
is extra ordinary.

575
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,100
And I tell ya, the thing I love about the subgenius mind,

576
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,500
almost without exception,

577
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,620
is that the extra ordinary ones think that they are purposeless,

578
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,180
and the fruitless ones think that they are extra ordinary.

579
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,700
We've been working on that squirt package almost from the beginning.

580
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,200
But, more than just an easy access to an unquantifiable demographic,

581
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,460
the church, quite frankly, is the most powerful opiate at our disposal.

582
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,240
And of course, the triple your money back guarantee.

583
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,160
Because everything has a price.

584
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,000
So pay up if you won't wake up,

585
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,480
and get your soma that sweet, sweet slack while you still can.

586
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't have to tell you what this church does

587
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,480
for the mutant population at large.

588
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,660
The jolly factors have not stopped rising

589
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,580
since Bob was first shot in the 80s.

590
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,060
These jolly factors, of course, cannot rise forever,

591
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,560
but try to enjoy the flow,

592
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,260
and fatten up your nintle ives.

593
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,900
For, perhaps, leaner days,

594
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,960
when the inevitable ebb sucks you dry.

595
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,060
So, take it for granted,

596
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,000
but also enjoy the decadence

597
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,580
of your easy dismissal.

598
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,460
The dismissal of plenty.

599
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,880
An infinite regress of self-referential onanism.

600
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,800
And then, in the rapidly approaching

601
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,140
global American Christian theocracy,

602
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,440
you will finally have an opportunity

603
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,220
to appreciate all the associative spice

604
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,980
that the church has added to your collective stew.

605
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,720
Yes, when the big squeeze comes,

606
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,480
a good laugh, or how about a sincere smile,

607
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,140
will be at a premium.

608
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,800
And when all of those chemicals

609
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,380
you pour into your gullet are cut off,

610
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
you will find that your memory

611
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,260
is a lot better than you think.

612
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,100
That's the good news.

613
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,780
As for the bad news,

614
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,140
well, let me put it this way.

615
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,380
As you try to slip away in your cell,

616
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,880
away from the stench and pathetic,

617
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,840
vacant murmurs of those

618
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,920
not so well connected as you,

619
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,920
beneath the incessant squall

620
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,160
of monotone Bible passages,

621
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,760
echoing off of concrete and steel,

622
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,740
day and night,

623
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,640
well, at about that moment,

624
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,800
you, weary traveler,

625
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,840
will have some place to go.

626
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,440
That funny thing Stang said that time,

627
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,140
that comic panel etched on your eyelids,

628
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,000
that distant twinkle of a Rudy Schwartz ditty.

629
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,940
Whatever it is,

630
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,700
it is one last place they cannot touch.

631
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,060
It won't save your life,

632
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,800
or ultimately your sanity,

633
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,140
but it might save your soul,

634
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,880
which will then return to the quagmire

635
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,060
from whence it issued,

636
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,660
pure and potent,

637
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,600
to reinfect the fibers of the core.

638
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,660
So, when the whole operation goes belly up

639
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,520
and the books are burning in the street

640
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,280
and the wickers are swinging from the street lamps,

641
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,860
you will be that lucky one,

642
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,720
whistling your way to your martyrdom,

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,780
that will unnerve them and their kind forever.

644
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,660
Or at least until they wipe out

645
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,260
the first 90% or so of the mutant population,

646
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,140
then they will undoubtedly lose their zeal,

647
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,140
and the 10% that remains can begin

648
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,820
infection of the meat side

649
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,060
with their latent yeti gene,

650
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,660
just like they did about 600 years ago.

651
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,560
The time to have your head up is now.

652
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,800
The time of fire and glass

653
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,140
will be the time to duck, silly goose.

654
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,200
So, when those durable and self-replicating thought viruses

655
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,080
envelop your fevered brain,

656
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,420
try to remember to break off a little something

657
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,020
for that man, Bob.

658
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,040
This is for real.

659
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,560
Not like that.

660
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,060
Okay, I got some.

661
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,120
You, scamp, you brought out your Biohazard Onrab.

662
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,260
And no, because that ionizer seems to be

663
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,260


664
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,400
Whatever,

665
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,040
but at least my four thousand fingers

666
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,040


667
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,300
Thank you.

668
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,740
Thank you.

669
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay, flop it in the back.

670
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,680
Wow, this guy.

671
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,560
Somebody cried.

672
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,240
Somebody died.

673
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,000
Somebody died.

674
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,500
Die.

675
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,980
Someone was born.

676
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Die.

677
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,760
I got to die.

678
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,040
Yeah.

679
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,960
I got to die.

680
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,440
Hello.

681
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,960
I got to die.

682
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,380
We are all past.

683
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,420
We rise and rise again.

684
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,780
It is our mission.

685
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,780
It is our mission.

686
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:16,780


687
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,480
We are the earth.

688
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,320
Yet you still ask.

689
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,720
We are not.

690
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,320
Save the universe.

691
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,700
We are gone.

692
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,220
Save the universe.

693
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,540
We are gone.

694
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,000
Save the universe.

695
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,860
This time.

696
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,480
This time.

697
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,280
Save the universe.

698
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,520
We are free.

699
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,520


700
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,520


701
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,840
We are free.

702
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,440
Save the universe.

703
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,500
3IT wish lives on 1 Hindustans

704
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:06,500


705
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:12,220
3IT wish lives on everyone

706
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,220


707
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,880
What is home?

708
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:12,880


709
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:12,880


710
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,800
3IT is taking the long way.

711
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:16,800


712
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,040
3IT is letting the universe go.

713
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,040


714
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,880

715
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:48,860

721
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,160
Acid Corpse at X Day.

722
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,780
My friends, the Swingin' Love Corpse is mixed with the amino acids

723
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,600
and Carter LeBlanc in an unholy mess.

724
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,960
And then, of course, we got to stock up on the subgenius special meals they had.

725
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,800
They were MRE meals.

726
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,060
It was a good show until you guys were doing that.

727
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,380
The subgenius MREs will be...

728
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,500
They'll stay fresh to the year 2005.

729
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,440
Wow.

730
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,860
Did it storm there at all?

731
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,640
Yes, it did.

732
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,340
Rain.

733
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,860
Thunder crashed.

734
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,940
Lightning flashed.

735
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,900
And rain came down in torrents.

736
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,460
While we all sat inside the Eaton Hall and watched the Stang videos

737
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,780
projected on the giant screen.

738
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,380
Let's go back in time.

739
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,540
Hey, did you have a nap that day, Hal, in the rain?

740
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:43,900
Huh?

741
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,220
I had a nap in the rain.

742
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,080
I don't know.

743
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,940
Maybe I did.

744
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,120
That was so good.

745
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:53,020
Is that the one where Sister What's-Her-Name came in and pelted us with flowers in the morning?

746
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,760
What day was that?

747
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,900
They all blur into one...

748
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,740
They did blur together because we would sleep in the day and stay awake at night.

749
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,860
I'd be awake all night, that's for sure.

750
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,800
But unlike the awful C-rations of World War II, you'll look forward to these subgenius meals.

751
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,700
Start with your appetizer, like peanut butter on a cracker.

752
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,700
I never had any meals.

753
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,920
Mix your powdered beverage.

754
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,640
Cocoa.

755
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,000
Coffee.

756
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,820
Apple cider.

757
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,820
All the things that are calling the show continues.

758
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,640
It's leaking.

759
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,820
Move on to your entree.

760
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,000
No, no, don't be shrieking either.

761
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,520
Yes, sir.

762
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,720
Starburst some tacos.

763
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,060
Just listen to these old guys talk.

764
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,520
Or another do-basedy treat.

765
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,040
Yes, they said that Bob stood for boring old bastards.

766
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,600
They like to go on and on and on in the middle of the night.

767
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,000
Jeez.

768
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,480
Like what they have to say is important.

769
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,980
That was a really good one.

770
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,980
B-O-B.

771
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,840
Boring old bastards.

772
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,440
24 hours a day.

773
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,820
See, now that's what's been going on.

774
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,620
For many years.

775
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,460
That you don't realize.

776
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,560
This show is going on 24 hours a day.

777
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,280
It's just, these are the only two hours you get.

778
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,880
Plus, they give you the new Israeli surplus gas mask.

779
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,680
I get the other 22 hours.

780
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,760
Those are really the best.

781
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,000
No more where you have to endure the stench of the outhouse.

782
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:12,060
You can wear this subgenius Israeli surplus gas mask for all your stinky jobs.

783
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,460
That's what the Israeli subgeniuses have been working on?

784
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:15,840
Yes.

785
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,860
Yes, they've got a special brand new Israeli subgenius surplus gas mask.

786
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,180
Is it non-mess and waterproof?

787
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,160
It relieves you of those stinky, stinky gases.

788
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,840
Well, what if the stinky gases overflow in the water?

789
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,340
Hey, not to worry.

790
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,700
It's all rubber with plexiglass eyes.

791
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,600
Oh, that's cool.

792
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,300
G. Gordon Gordon has requested the song,

793
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,780
You Guys Really Fucking Suck.

794
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,280
We know that one.

795
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:47,940
We do know.

796
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,200
We practiced that one yesterday.

797
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,320
Sort of a bossa nova.

798
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,320
Sort of a bossa nova.

799
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,740
You guys really suck.

800
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:15,220
You guys really suck.

801
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,360
You really suck.

802
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,820
You guys really suck.

803
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,160
You really suck.

804
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,220
You guys really suck a lot.

805
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,000
We think you're stupid.

806
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,240
We think you're dumb.

807
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,300
You really suck! You guys really suck a lot!

808
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,340
You really suck! You really suck! You guys really suck a lot!

809
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Suddenly someone appears at the turnstile who grows to gigantical size.

810
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,680
Frenchies like it, Belgians, Dutchies, Germans, Krautsies, Austrians.

811
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,460
You're talking about next day?

812
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,140
Crotation marks.

813
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,280
Well, there were some Britishers who came all the way to X-Day.

814
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,840
British pantalons like it.

815
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah, we had Pope Phil Monty there.

816
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,720
True.

817
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,480
And his Gore-Tex bibs.

818
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,500
Also, Sister Televangela.

819
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,040
Was there.

820
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,460
Who?

821
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,360
What?

822
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,700
Just many subgenius celebrities.

823
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,420
She was hotter than a $2 pistol and just as affordable.

824
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:12,700
Damn.

825
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,640
And she wanted to...

826
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,220
Damn.

827
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,500
She didn't like to leave her car, so she did everything from inside her car.

828
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:18,980
Thank you, ma'am.

829
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,200
Thank you, my am.

830
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,360
Bam, bam.

831
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,780
That's who the ma'am was.

832
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,140
I liked her a little.

833
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:31,960
When she was in the subgenius, she would auction, put her vote in at the auction with a little beep of her car horn as she sat in her car.

834
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,740
She just didn't like to get out of her car.

835
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,600
Well, she didn't like to get out of her car, so she just pulled her car up close to the...

836
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,560
And all her crap was in the car.

837
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,540
All of her food.

838
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,240
Thank you.

839
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:42,680
Her sleeping bag.

840
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,480
All of her stuff.

841
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:51,180
Except when she got out of the car to jump on Fyla's bed and punch a hole in the floor with the bed leg.

842
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,720
Yeah.

843
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,260
It descended through the cabin.

844
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,820
Well, she is a rather robust woman.

845
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,760
A robust specimen, yes.

846
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,920
Oh, we're doing a show now, sir.

847
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,460
Geez.

848
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,580
We're trying to...

849
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,300
It's a bottomless...

850
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,460
It is.

851
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,000
It is.

852
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,840
It's a bottomless show.

853
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,860
So she did.

854
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,560
She spent some time on my bed.

855
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,720
She never stops.

856
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,720
She spent some time on my bed.

857
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,560
Well, it's your duty to inculcate the younger generation's subgenius principles.

858
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,900
Stereo?

859
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:27,880
Cheerio?

860
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,020
And so I'm...

861
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,740
She asked me that all-important question.

862
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,400
Why do retail stores charge up to 160% more for the same thing?

863
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,560
What did you tell the young lass?

864
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,840
She just keeps selling it over and over.

865
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,140
Well, I said it's because it's their job.

866
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,660
And you know what?

867
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,780
That just rolled off her back like water on a duck's back.

868
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,100
I'll bet it would.

869
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,320
I gotta go to that place that only charges 68%.

870
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,960
Listen to more show.

871
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,760
I wanna be Bob.

872
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,920
Get in the file all the time.

873
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,940
I wanna be Bob.

874
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,380
Big everything is a smile.

875
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,700
I wanna be Jesus.

876
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,840
He always looks so sad.

877
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,420
Don't wanna be Jesus.

878
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,640
He must have an awful dad.

879
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,520
I wanna be Bob.

880
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,740
Tell everyone about slack.

881
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,020
I wanna be Bob.

882
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,840
But I'm just not the big kid by slack.

883
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,920
I wanna be Jesus.

884
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,080
I wanna be no slave.

885
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,640
Don't wanna be Jesus.

886
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,120
He should have stayed in his place.

887
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,880
I wanna be Bob.

888
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,160
Everything is so clear.

889
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,540
I wanna be Bob.

890
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,760
He should have been ready to see.

891
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,440
I wanna be Jesus.

892
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,480
I wanna carry no cross.

893
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,000
Don't wanna be Jesus.

894
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,460
Don't wanna speak for no boss.

895
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,380
I wanna be Bob.

896
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,860
Never have to work a day.

897
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,140
I wanna be Bob.

898
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,380
All eternity's a play.

899
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,880
I wanna be Jesus.

900
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,980
Always trying to figure things out.

901
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,980
I wanna be Bob.

902
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,440
Don't wanna be Jesus.

903
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,500
Who needs all them fucking cosmic doubts.

904
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,480
I wanna be Bob.

905
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,180
Yeah, I wanna be Bob.

906
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,140
I wanna be Bob.

907
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,080
I'd even like it if he told me.

908
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:25,840
Ha ha ha.

909
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,380
Woo hoo.

910
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,180
Robert looks deliciously beautiful, isn't he?

911
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:58,320
Yeah, I can't help along with Alexander the Geants shit.

912
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,880
Uh, I worked for a while with captain cau.

913
00:48:59,880 --> 00:48:59,880


914
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,660
Hm, yeah.

915
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,220
No matter what my area is, Boob.

916
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:04,600
Beep boop.

917
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,880
Oh my god, you can definitely hear все pueblo 여�rut.

918
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,220
No matter what your class Wrestle Dynamics is,

919
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,040
I'm sure you can say,

920
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:10,220
you'd been waiting around for all

921
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,400
those things that made violence in the live stream.

922
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:11,900
and a book.

923
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:18,780
Well, this has been a pretty organized anarchy, hasn't it?

924
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,760
Friends, that's disgusting.

925
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,180
How come...

926
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,800
Well, no, I don't want to ask.

927
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:29,840
I remember one time Sterno, Pope Sterno, stood up here in X-Stage Life in 1998,

928
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,540
the conspiracies 1998, and said,

929
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,220
Why aren't you people out there in the field fucking?

930
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,620
Why aren't you all in one giant group?

931
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,500
This is disgusting.

932
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,060
Somebody said, Why aren't you?

933
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:48,560
Friends, you know, sometimes we have to get real.

934
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,040
But I don't want to.

935
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,100
Fuck that shit.

936
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,080
Fuck that shit.

937
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,120
I was actually looking to see if there was anything really pithy.

938
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,920
Oh, yeah, there is actually something really pithy on here.

939
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,200
I have something important to say about...

940
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,940
It's about magic and prayer and faith.

941
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:14,220
Friends, you know, most of us are not especially superstitious.

942
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,620
We've grown out of those silly old superstitions.

943
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:23,240
We just believe in J.R. Bob Dobbs and the arrival of the exes on July 5th, 1998,

944
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,980
whenever that happens to come.

945
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,840
We don't believe in the silly religions, you know,

946
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,580
their silly evolution and creation crap.

947
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,340
We know we came from the Yetis test tubes.

948
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,620
Stupidly freed the humans and interbred with them like fucking idiots.

949
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,220
And now look, we're not doing what Sterno said.

950
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,540
And even he wasn't either.

951
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,060
But there is, there actually is magic.

952
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,660
Real live magic, I believe.

953
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,640
There is miracles happen.

954
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,860
Now, I don't mean the miracle of being on acid and looking at a piece of dirt and going, Wow.

955
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,400
Wow.

956
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,200
That's a miracle too.

957
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,380
I'm not putting it down.

958
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,540
I could go into this.

959
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,920
I have this whole rant about enlightenment, which I will spare you.

960
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,380
It's probably still on all binary slack from the last defival.

961
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,080
But there is magic and there is incredible, wonderful magic.

962
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:29,520
And the magic is that so many people can believe such bullshit.

963
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,320
That in itself is so, such beautiful magic.

964
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,320


965
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,320


966
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:43,140
The fact that they can believe is more important, is more weird to me than what they believe.

967
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:50,840
I studied kooks and crackpots just as I'm doing right now at this very moment.

968
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,420
And, and it's, it's not, every one of them has some slightly different variation on their own.

969
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,860
That weird science fiction we call religion.

970
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,240
But, but the, there is.

971
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,520
There is the miracle of their belief.

972
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,780
And which can overpower sickness.

973
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,720
It really can.

974
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:15,880
And can kill an ox at ten miles away from jealousy.

975
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,920
If you are truly an attuned over man.

976
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,520
My friends, there is hope.

977
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,860
There is hope.

978
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,520
You could eventually become that over man.

979
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,660
As soon as those aliens get here and do all of our work for us.

980
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,080
That we have elected to take the easy way out.

981
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,140
Concentrated Guru Pea.

982
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,340
This is dried Guru Pea that we burn.

983
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,200
We burn this Guru Pea and it oxidizes into our mucous membranes.

984
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,540
And we imbibe the, the wisdom of the gurus through this.

985
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,360
Is that what makes your nostril hairs grow?

986
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,060
Yeah.

987
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,060
So good.

988
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,640
So good.

989
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,140
So good.

990
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

991
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,420
My boss is going to kill me!

992
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,220
You know, I always missed out on that stuff.

993
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,620
I'm always repairing something or changing film when all the fun stuff happens.

994
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,240
Well, you were conveniently away from the first aid area.

995
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,460
I'm always out of film when Bob shows up.

996
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,160
Well, if I had more help, then I could be there when those saucers didn't...

997
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,240
Yeah, you had plenty of exasperated help.

998
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,040
There are people throwing flingings in your arms.

999
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,040
Screaming, where is Stan when we need him now?

1000
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,480
You're throwing away amputated arms and legs trying to figure out what to do next.

1001
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,100
Calling, you know, involving local community people.

1002
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,500
And yet, while we're under state of orange alert.

1003
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,120
It was pretty weird.

1004
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,720
Weird indeed, my friends.

1005
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,320
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1006
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,860
And on the Radio Siniseesia show with Dr. Sinister.

1007
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:31,480
Before that, Super Orgy porno party is by the Planet Smashers.

1008
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,540
And now...

1009
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,720
From 7X Day at Brushwood, a Pope-esque lily.

1010
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,400
So, after all that, are you guys up for a little song?

1011
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,580
Yeah!

1012
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,040
Okay, this one, actually I'm going to need a little help from you guys.

1013
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,320
But don't worry, this is pretty easy.

1014
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:54,140
All I need you to do is to sing along, not during the chorus, but during the main part.

1015
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,780
I'll cue you.

1016
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,160
Ba dum Bob, ba dum Bob.

1017
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,400
Ba dum Bob.

1018
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,600
Ba dum Bob.

1019
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,780
Ba dum Bob.

1020
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,980
You guys, keep on going.

1021
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,400
Ba dum Bob.

1022
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,400
Ba dum Bob.

1023
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,380
The times, they are changing.

1024
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,420
And things are getting grim.

1025
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,380
Oh Bob.

1026
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,080
The X's are a-missing.

1027
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,900
And our odds are getting slim.

1028
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,780
Ba dum Bob.

1029
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,380
Sure, I could give up and let the world know.

1030
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:31,380


1031
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:31,380


1032
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,940
Let my hopes go flat.

1033
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,660
I really got to ask you though.

1034
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,060
Mmmmm, where's the slack in that?

1035
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,060
Bob, ba dum Bob.

1036
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,140
Ba dum Bob.

1037
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,920
Ba dum Bob.

1038
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,900
The pinks have us outnumbered.

1039
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,280
The conspiracy has won.

1040
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,060
Nuh uh, uh huh.

1041
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,440
We're in a losing battle.

1042
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,380
Before the fight's begun.

1043
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,400
No fun.

1044
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,720
Well I could get suicidal and make my brains go splat.

1045
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,220
I really got to ask you though.

1046
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,720
Mmmmm, where's the slack in that?

1047
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,540
Ba dum Bob.

1048
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,760
Ba dum Bob.

1049
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,640
Ba dum Bob.

1050
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,040
No matter the temptation, I don't care what they think.

1051
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,160
I'd rather be subgenious than wind up pink.

1052
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,360
Cause Bob's a genius.

1053
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,460
Bob's so gives me gumption.

1054
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,420
And Connie flips my crown.

1055
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,660
And I'm not about to let them bastards get me down.

1056
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,380
Da dum dum dum.

1057
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,160
I don't need to fight no battles.

1058
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,060
Or weigh down with chagrin.

1059
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,160
No way, no how.

1060
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,540
As long as I have with me.

1061
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,380
Bob's everlasting grin.

1062
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,800
And sure, I hate the normals.

1063
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,420
I got that all down pat.

1064
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,520
But I'm not exactly looking for normal combat.

1065
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,060
And I'm sick of preaching and chewing the fat.

1066
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,860
I really got to tell you though.

1067
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,560
Mmmmm, slack is where it's at.

1068
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,420
Ba dum Bob.

1069
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,560
That's it?

1070
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,220
Woo!

1071
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,500
Thank you everyone!

1072
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,980
Urdu.

1073
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,820
When they retranslate the Urdu back to English,

1074
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,240
it just leaves something out and it looks so funny.

1075
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,940
Then we also viewed director Stang's new film,

1076
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,220
Dobbs of Deliastisies.

1077
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,520
And, uh...

1078
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,880
Which I have a copy of, ready for the next subgenius.

1079
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,620
And when that tricycle quad comes out to you,

1080
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,440
you know what it'll have.

1081
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,700
And Bug Porn is also showing.

1082
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,300
Bug Porn, which is sort of a remake of the

1083
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,900
Reproduction Cycle movie, and an excellent, excellent,

1084
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
funny, funny movie.

1085
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,840
And excellent taste, too.

1086
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,140
See, now we should have a subgenius film festival

1087
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,080
where everything shown would be subgenius.

1088
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,940
Right, right.

1089
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,200
Instead of nothing that we show being subgenius,

1090
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,380
everything we show will be subgenius.

1091
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,720
And it continues to rain.

1092
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,300
So I have my screen ready, my projector,

1093
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,920
my...everything's ready.

1094
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,820
Where are we gonna do this subgenius film festival?

1095
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:20,240
Tomorrow night?

1096
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,780
Tomorrow night?

1097
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,860
Well, where though?

1098
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,200
At Ginger's house.

1099
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,940
At your house?

1100
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,720
They have a backyard.

1101
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,380
You can always see the neighbors peeking through

1102
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,020
the fence at your favorite stuff.

1103
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,560
Jim neighbors and others peering over the fence

1104
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,960
can disconcert you.

1105
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,020
Golly!

1106
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,820
You're trying to do something and these geeks

1107
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,480
are gawking over the fence at you.

1108
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,660
And laughing in an unseemly way.

1109
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,320
Gawking and leering and frottering, frittering away.

1110
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,740
It's because as X Day gets closer and closer,

1111
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,040
people don't worry about the social normies

1112
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,800
that they've caught.

1113
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,500
Oops, there, see?

1114
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,080
But we got past X Day once again.

1115
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,400
And there goes Mr. Hamilton,

1116
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,860
and there goes Mr. Burr,

1117
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,360
fires back.

1118
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
You're getting further away.

1119
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,620
So we're safe for at least another year.

1120
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,520
I guess so.

1121
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,040
We have to go back in time now, folks.

1122
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,780
It's 420 all over again.

1123
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,480
That background music, friends,

1124
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,020
that I've been using is from a band called

1125
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,640
Felonious Bosch.

1126
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,900
And you can get more information about them

1127
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,360
from www.fnbosch.com.

1128
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,520
B-O-S-C-H.

1129
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,900
F-N-B-O-S-C-H.com.

1130
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,600
Felonious Bosch.

1131
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,060
Great.

1132
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,740
You'll be hearing more about them.

1133
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,680
And friends, we're at the subgenius

1134
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,640
radio ministry hour of Slack.

1135
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,340
Let me give you a post office box.

1136
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:44,240
This time, let's use P.O. Box 807,

1137
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:52,460
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1138
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,700
That's Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1139
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,500
Short!

1140
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,820
Or always check out subgenius.com.

1141
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,900
Share the load.

1142
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:12,340
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

1143
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,900
My mind is not my mind.

1144
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,400
One look at them will tell you more

1145
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,860
than a thousand words of mine.

1146
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,980
Come on you poor ass singers and your big dick slings

1147
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,640
We're going downtown to the Cox's

1148
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:35,080
A second fight, the beginning of a broad daylight

1149
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,100
We don't need no goddamn taxi

1150
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,640
We're gonna jim and pose in a rocket jet

1151
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,140
And take off all their racks

1152
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,180
We're gonna build these old pads

1153
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,340
Tomorrow night at the Ron Cox's

1154
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,610
We're gonna rock the news ball

1155
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:55,810
My mind is not my mind

1156
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,130
My mind is not my mind
