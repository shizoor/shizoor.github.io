00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,240
The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:32,220
The Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,520
Here's something that you should know

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,240
Tune us in on the radio, now

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,840
We got charisma, we got style

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,480
Well, people will make you feel better for a while

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,160
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,420
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Family doctors say you're just fine

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,560
But you feel so down all the time

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,220
Well, people will make you feel better for a while

12
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,220


13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,220
Well, people, you don't have to worry

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,460
The drop is a lie

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
Send your money in on the double

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,700
Don't worry, it's deductible

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,340
Well, people, you can forget your sins

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,920
Forget your troubles

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,060
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,540
If you're feeling lonely and confused

22
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,960
And you don't know

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
What you're to do

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,060
And there's no candle left to burn

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,760
And you don't know which way to turn

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,360
We can help you out

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,300
Music plays

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,880
Music plays

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Music plays

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,640
Music plays

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,840
Music plays

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,400
Music plays

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,400


34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,400


35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,400


36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,560
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Sunny morning and you're feeling low

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,200
You hurt all over and you're moving so well

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,940
People, here's something that you should know

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,760
Tune us in on the radio dice

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,140
We got charisma

43
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,340
...but we got style

44
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,880
People will make you feel bitter for a while

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,960
Put your hands, put your hands on the radios

46
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:47,120
To be continued...

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,820
To be continued...

48
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,260
To be continued...

49
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,340
I thought that was Dave

50
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,020
when I heard her

51
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,740
first word that...

52
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,800
No one knows I'm gone.

53
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,480
Yeah.

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,220
It does.

55
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,760
After X-Day,

56
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,340
no one knows you're gone.

57
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,200
Too many Marlboros.

58
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,000
That guy sounded like that

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,120
when he was in his early 20s.

60
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,880
He probably sounded like that

61
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,560
when he was 12.

62
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,900
No, seriously.

63
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,740
Tom Waits was doing this when...

64
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,200
I mean, he sounded like

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,740
an old cigarette-ravaged bar guy

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,580
when he was...

67
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,300
Right.

68
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,460
When he was too young to be one.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,140
He was just faking it.

70
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,520
But he fakes it great.

71
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,260
Oh, he was part of that

72
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,160
old Greenwich Village,

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,560
you know,

74
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,060
hip daddy-o crowd.

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,460
Beatniks, man.

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:53,960
Beat.

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Yeah, except that he was

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,900
too young for it.

79
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,660
Right.

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,260
He's just carrying on

81
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,780
the tradition,

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,680
you might say.

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,060
Right.

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Oh, yes.

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,700
Tom Waits for no one.

86
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,140
Yeah.

87
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,080
Yeah.

88
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh, paper for me.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,780
ictions.

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,040
No.

91
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,700
He

92
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,380
No.

93
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,380


94
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,660
He was your

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,760
homosexual

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,000
The temperatures

97
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,320
You know, into other

98
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,140
Ali's Clean Home to learn

99
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,400
dat

100
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,100
Sniper Club. Don't talk about Sniper Club.

101
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,580
Right.

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,100
Anyone who talks about Sniper Club gets sniped.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,340
The faces in the night looking into the anti-mirror of jazz.

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,400
There is no Sniper Club.

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
Insistent instinct.

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,600
Get with the end times, man.

107
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,260
Oh, man, hey, I have a whole theory about this stuff.

108
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,060
And it might even go right into the Taliban thing.

109
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,640
You know, everyone thinks that it was the Al-Qaeda who flew the things in the planes.

110
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,900
All right.

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,160
Anthrax.

112
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,220
Snipers.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,840
You know, all kinds of internal stuff like that going on.

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,560
I think the South is rising again.

115
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,140
I think it's the Confederacy.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
I thought you were going to say our own government.

117
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,260
It's not the Al-Qaeda.

118
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,320
The sleeping giant has arisen.

119
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,220
It's not the Taliban.

120
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,540
It's the Confederacy.

121
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm completely convinced of it.

122
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,120
They're slagging back, though.

123
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
They know not to say anything.

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,440
Hey, I got my bumper sticker that says forget hell.

125
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,460
Because we all want to forget hell.

126
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,000
Slavery is coming back.

127
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,940
We want to go to a more sure, better place.

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,380
I think it's the Confederacy.

129
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm convinced.

130
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,820
Now we'll have delicious bilingual slavery.

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,200
We won't have to worry about slaving other pack of woods like ourselves.

132
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,180
Well, I really think it's because...

133
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,900
Everything, including trees, can be enslaved.

134
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,980
Northerners are just kind of pissed off that, A, Southerners got to do all the walking on the moon.

135
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,660
What the hell are you talking about?

136
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,000
B, Southerners went to the movies.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,360
What the hell are you talking about?

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,100
And all the NASCAR races.

139
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,420
Southerners get to be president.

140
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm not very jealous of that one.

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,740
And C, Southerners get to be the president over and over and over again.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think you were just thinking about professional wrestling as my next jam.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
You got to look at the big picture of things.

144
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,940
I believe it's the Confederacy.

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,820
I'm convinced of it.

146
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,760
Well, it is a Confederacy of dunches called the U.S. Black Covert Optional Government.

147
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,180
They flew a plane into Cleveland Harbor last week and nobody even knew about it.

148
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,540
Is that how you did that?

149
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,100
And the whole terrorist event was missed.

150
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,040
We were in a code yellow.

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,400
Why did they do that?

152
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,400
Not a code blue.

153
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,400
Huh?

154
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,780
Just ask me.

155
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
You need to know anything.

156
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,600
I mean, you know, got the insider information on everything.

157
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,420
Three weeks ago on Tuesday, a group of men in black arrived at your house.

158
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,540
Yeah, he's connected to his own synapses.

159
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,840
Dave's got his little radio.

160
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,580
Interconnected.

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,380
Ham radio.

162
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,820
Well, he'll be the next one that they have running around doing dog crimes.

163
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,140
And then that's what they do.

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:25,420
If you listen to what's going on, you know, who's doing that sniper thing, that gun control people, people that want gun control.

165
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,520
There's a gun control nut running around killing people.

166
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,420
It'll make it'll make guns look bad.

167
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,160
See, they make it look like guns.

168
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,780
Kill people.

169
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,140
Guns don't kill people.

170
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,400
Gun control nuts.

171
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,180
Rufus and Carlo Thomas kill people.

172
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,080
Snipers in the woods.

173
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,740
Kill people.

174
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,820
Bullets kill people.

175
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,520
Guns don't kill people.

176
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:44,800
Bullets kill people.

177
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:44,800


178
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:44,920
Bullets kill people.

179
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,640
It's the impact of the bullet.

180
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,360
Well, you got to admit, this cat is a, you know, he's a hot shot.

181
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,140
Whoever he is, I think they're probably, they got to be looking at military backgrounds and stuff like that.

182
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,100
Well, it might be five Al Qaeda terrorists or three Tim McVeigh's.

183
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,020
No, I think it's a nut job.

184
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Yeah, I think it's a nut job.

185
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,700
I think he used to be in the military.

186
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,660
No doubt about that.

187
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,840
Did you know a lot of...

188
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,560
I think it's invisible hand guy or anthrax.

189
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,720
It's just the caliber of the gun he's using is an M6.

190
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,160
It's an M16.

191
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,260
So, he's using a caliber he's familiar with.

192
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,960
Hey, man, that hot guitar player that was out there at Brushwood on your birthday?

193
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Weirdly enough, yeah.

194
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,380
That guy was bragged about his AK-47.

195
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,160
Really?

196
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,540
I know everybody brags about their AK-47.

197
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:36,460
One of the things he said, what he mentioned outside of his mouth was, and also still believed that civilization will fall, fall apart.

198
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,520
See, the survivalist still exists to date.

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,960
Well, he is a real survivalist, no doubt about it.

200
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,720
Well, you know.

201
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,600
You got your...

202
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,600
What's his name?

203
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,260
He's got some other survivalist he's going to want.

204
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,140
An AK-47.

205
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,980
A Kalashnikov assault rifle is quite a deadly and delicate asset to any group.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,500
But he had some hot chops on the guitar, though, man.

207
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,580
That dude could play.

208
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,220
Yes, indeed, he could.

209
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,780
Yes, indeed.

210
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,400
I want to start a survivalist band with him playing guitar.

211
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,920
The other survivalists can't take that away from him.

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,240
You could travel around from outposts like The Postman in that movie.

213
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,840
Yeah, that'd be cool.

214
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,340
You could jam out.

215
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
We could do shows out in Wyoming.

216
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,700
You could get women with bear skins on them and stuff like that.

217
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,600
that and drink weird

218
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
homemade drinks. So do you think a year from now it's going to be like the Postman

219
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,620
or Omega Man or

220
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,420
or like Mad Max or

221
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,940
Thunderbird. The Stand or

222
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,180
Mad Max, that far.

223
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,620
That would be great, man.

224
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
I have to get

225
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,420
working on my van. I got to get it all

226
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,380
beefed up and put like steel grating

227
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,080
over the side windows. Yeah, man.

228
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,640
Natural born killers.

229
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,500
But I got that van. I could put a big

230
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,460
turret right on top. That would be

231
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,480
great. That big black van

232
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
and a big turret machine gun strapped right

233
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,220
on top. Automatic.

234
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,160
That's your investment.

235
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,340
An investment for

236
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,360
life. Your life and your

237
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,880
survival.

238
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,320
Who'll be fighting who, though? You'll be

239
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,260
fighting your neighbor over the latest

240
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,100
roach. Confederacy. Craft steak.

241
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,520
Yeah. Union versus the Confederacy.

242
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,460
Yeah. And we'll also have an east-west

243
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,540
division that like around St. Louis

244
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,620
It wasn't that long ago.

245
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,740
Look at these Middle Eastern

246
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,360
things. They can hold these grudges for

247
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,260
thousands of years.

248
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,340
These Central Europeans, they got some grudges

249
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,700
that go back thousands of years.

250
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Jesus didn't do that. Yeah, Jesus did.

251
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,220
But nobody's got a memory like

252
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,200
a Smith's.

253
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,660
But the Southerners,

254
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,120
it's only been a hundred years, a little bit

255
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,240
more than a hundred years.

256
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,760
They getting ready, man.

257
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,420
They getting ready. I'm telling you.

258
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
The Bush family was Tories and they were

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,960
Confederate sympathizers during the war.

260
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,060
Don't have anything to do with Viagra, I think.

261
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,820
Viagra? Yeah.

262
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,000
But the Bush family were

263
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,040
Tories during the Revolutionary War

264
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,380
and they were sympathizers of the Antichrist

265
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,920
during, I mean, Confederacy

266
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
during the several, the

267
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,140
Dwarves, several Dwarves which we

268
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,180
had. And some of them expanded like

269
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,660
pustules and got bigger and popped.

270
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,240
And that was the reason. It was also

271
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,020
the banks and Lincoln. See, Southerners just

272
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,220
going to sail a barge right

273
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,340
up the Mississippi River.

274
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,940
Right up to the northern big cities.

275
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,720
Right up the Ohio River. Right. Park.

276
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,700
They're going to park a barge right by that

277
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,640
nuclear plant that's right down the Ohio

278
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,620
River. See, now all the Confederate guys

279
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,040
And a bunch of bales of marijuana.

280
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,080
That's actually what I

281
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,720
understand. The cash crop of the

282
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,580
South is now Redbud.

283
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,080
Mississippi Redbud.

284
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,740
So far it's just marijuana. But one of

285
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,620
these days. It'll be bootleg Leonard

286
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,760
Skinner tapes. Yeah.

287
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,600
It's a whole bunch of rebel soldiers

288
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,960
come jumping out from under them bales of hemp.

289
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,620
Well, that was a plot. Take over

290
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,540
New York Harbor.

291
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,560
The New South versus the New

292
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:13,920
North.

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,520
Remember that one?

294
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
Yeah.

295
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,480
I have a sawed.

296
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,520
Nice

297
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,520


298
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,520


299
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,520


300
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,520


301
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,520


302
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,520


303
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
$5

304
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,680


305
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,680


306
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,340
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,980
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:13,900
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,280
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,780
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,040
Everything will be alright.

322
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Thank you.

323
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:43,460
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,120
Little Bottles of Booze

325
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,200
Barlight Beauty

326
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,520
That's Barlight Beauty

327
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,200
The dawn of man

328
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,580
Here we are at the dawn of man

329
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,000
Very soon we will be at the dusk of man

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,480
Yeah, I was going to say the dawn of man was seven and a half million years ago

331
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,680
Now this is more like the twilight of the aughts

332
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:41,840
Yeah

333
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,080
The autumn of mankind

334
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,800
Yes

335
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,520
But back at the dawn of man

336
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,420
That's a much more romantic time

337
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,340
It's not fun to look at the twilight of man

338
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,500
Yeah, if only we were back in the old days

339
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,640
When we could die of tuberculosis or an infected finger

340
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,260
Yeah

341
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,300
Or water poisoning

342
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,040
All waitresses were buxom and got your coffee fast

343
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,680
Yeah

344
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,740
Now wait a minute

345
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,340
I guess you're not going that far back in time

346
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,540
You're talking about the 50s?

347
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,440
Automobiles

348
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,740
No, I liked it back when you

349
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,920
If an automobile was coming down the opposite way of a horse

350
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,200
The automobile owner would by law

351
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,860
Have to dismantle the automobile

352
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,120
And hide it in the bushes

353
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,420
So that the horse could pass

354
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,960
Oh yeah?

355
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,960
And you also send up a rocket every 10 miles

356
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,920
And then wait for any traffic to pass your way

357
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,440
Boy, those were the days

358
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,660
To distance itself from it

359
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:53,940
Well, those were the horses, yeah

360
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,700
Boy, that sure beats traffic jams

361
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,100
Yeah

362
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,260
Man

363
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,320
Uh...

364
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,700
If only...

365
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,520
Back in the day

366
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,900
Back in the good old days

367
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,880
When you couldn't let the fire go out, because

368
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,400
Well, you just couldn't let the fire go out

369
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,280
You didn't know how to make another one

370
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,680
Think of it that way

371
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:13,680


372
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,340
bipeds, the ones with slightly less hair and bigger heads.

373
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,700
And then there was the dawn of religion itself.

374
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,180
What was it, the first blind caveman?

375
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,940
Yeah, the first nearsighted caveman who couldn't go out.

376
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,800
He wasn't as good with a bow and arrow spear as those beady-eyed hunters.

377
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:43,340
So he would stay back home, carving arrowheads and occasionally making up wonderful little

378
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:50,820
stories about how if they brought him just the right sort of virgins and services and

379
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:58,180
foods, then he would see that old Og's wife was cured of that cold she'd mysteriously

380
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,720
contracted.

381
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,680
And sure enough, after four or five days, after his mystic passes and special herbal

382
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,200
ointments, the cold would magically go away.

383
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,860
And if it didn't, well, the bear god was angry.

384
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,980
So you better bring the priest more food.

385
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,560
Yep, the nearsighted caveman.

386
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:29,460
But see, when the beady-eyed cavemen were gone, the nearsighted caveman could bird dog

387
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,340
the females, don't you see?

388
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:42,680
The nearsighted caveman, father of religion, and a number of other little nearsighted bastards.

389
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,300
Little nearsighted bastards.

390
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,920
Yeah, you notice that nearsighted bastards have taken over large portions of the world.

391
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,840
Sneaky.

392
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,660
Lazy eyes.

393
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,380
Yeah, they can see the fine print, see.

394
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,300
They may not see the big picture, but they can see the fine print.

395
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,500
We'll see.

396
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
Who's the richest man in the world?

397
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,600
The lunatic is on the grass, kids.

398
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,240
The guy with 20-20 vision, is that the richest man in America?

399
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,620
The lunatic is on the grass.

400
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:29,380
Or that nearsighted, shifty-eyed nerd.

401
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,400
The geek shall inherit the earth.

402
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,660
That was the lesson of the Devo Convention.

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,680
Mahala.

404
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,980
Mahala.

405
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,600
Mahala.

406
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,020
Mahala.

407
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,020


408
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,240
Mahala.

409
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:42,820


410
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:42,820


411
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:42,820


412
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:42,820


413
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,500
Mahala.

414
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,880
Mahala.

415
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,440
Mahala.

416
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,720
Mahala.

417
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,280
Mahala.

418
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,180
Mahala.

419
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,620
Mahala.

420
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,880
Mahala.

421
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Mahala.

422
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,420
Mahala.

423
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,160
Oh, yes.

424
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,660
I remember those days.

425
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,740
You know, I've been sucking my thumb on the platform, I think, for about 13 years now.

426
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,980
And this is the first time anybody's ever called attention to it.

427
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,220
As if it didn't exist.

428
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,980
You know, I've been doing this weekly, you know, for the last 25 Thursdays.

429
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,400
And you guys...

430
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,120
Parenthetically would be even more accurate.

431
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,520
Parenthetically, I would say.

432
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:52,820
Yeah.

433
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,460
More as an aside.

434
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,540
Weekly.

435
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,080
Sickly.

436
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,440
Much like that Spanish muscle you're sporting below your box of shorts.

437
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,040
Yeah, when do we get paid?

438
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,740
Yeah, when do we get paid, Stan?

439
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,180
Well, we were going to call Ed.

440
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,080
Ed of...

441
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,960
Or St. St.

442
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,560
Stupid of St. Stupids Day in San Francisco.

443
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,460
Can we call his cell phone up and put him on the air?

444
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:18,800
I can, yeah.

445
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,260
Is it St. Stupids Day, though?

446
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,220
Come up and see if...

447
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,820
Because he would know about the conspiracy that is ruining America.

448
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,300
And tomorrow.

449
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,200
Praise Bob.

450
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,440
Praise him indeed.

451
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,440
And look at the Bob blob.

452
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
That was creative.

453
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,280
He has praised his day.

454
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,040
That was not St. Stupid.

455
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,900
I think that was like Pope Stupid or Bishop.

456
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,460
Bishop Stupid or Reverend Stupid.

457
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,760
That was St. Wank.

458
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,820
That was St. Wank from calling from Norway.

459
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,660
San Francisco Mime Troupe has been in town.

460
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,020
And they have got to be the crappiest Mime Troupe in the world.

461
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,540
Because they don't...

462
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,180
Oh, and they can't make phone calls at all.

463
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
They talk like Fireside Theater or something.

464
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,840
During their mimes?

465
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,360
Yeah, throughout their whole mime show.

466
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,780
They talk.

467
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,960
Check this out.

468
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,620
I'm behind a big white glass window.

469
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,780
They do a comedy show.

470
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,380
It's like a play.

471
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,460
It's like going to see a play.

472
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,840
And yet, you go expecting, oh, Mime Troupe.

473
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm going to see this all stupid, boring, trite, pretentious guys in black suits with cute makeup.

474
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Guys in black suits.

475
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,660
You don't get any of that.

476
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,000
None.

477
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,760
What would a wizened, gnarled old saint like Bob Dobbs think of men in black suits?

478
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,980
Trying to put in a call.

479
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,400
Uh-oh, the alarm is ringing.

480
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,900
Trooping around like mimes.

481
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,400
You know, just before I left, I heard on the news there was some kind of a plague.

482
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,640
A plague?

483
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,300
A plague?

484
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,680
That looks like a seven to me.

485
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,600
So we're on plague?

486
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,020
Are we on time?

487
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,140
Or are we on actually wrong?

488
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,480
Are we on grizzly muzzled guitar mustache time?

489
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,600
Yeah, I think that's a seven or a question mark.

490
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
It is a question mark.

491
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,720
The spirits are foaming tonight.

492
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,440
You know, this is a very, very strange time of the year.

493
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,080
It's devil's night.

494
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,960
It's the time of the great vortex also.

495
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,580
A lot of the ancient sages and sadhus have mentioned this in their writings and also in their blitherings.

496
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,120
That when the moon comes out.

497
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,600
Okay, go ahead.

498
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,820
And the sun comes out.

499
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:10,820


500
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:10,820


501
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:10,820


502
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,360
And the sun goes down on the night of all hollows being.

503
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,380
Oh, great.

504
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,940
We'll strap the structure in our heads.

505
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,080
There's a robot answering the phone.

506
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,940
And live in a...

507
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,980
I'm giving...

508
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
Ah, perfect.

509
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,660
Yes, there.

510
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,680
At last.

511
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,020
Finally, I've done it.

512
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,700
Proof.

513
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,420
Actual proof of the existence of God.

514
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,800
Now, how's that going to help us, Pinkerton?

515
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:40,480
Because, Dr. A, thanks to this energy grid, I actually have God trapped right here in this small metal box.

516
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Hey, yeah.

517
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,020
Now, that is a useful invention.

518
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,560
I wonder how much the Pope would pay to get us to turn this thing off.

519
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,080
Yeah.

520
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,700
You're catching on now, Dr. A.

521
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,480
You gotta see my new invention.

522
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,880
Filbert, be careful now.

523
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,400
It's really great.

524
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,480
Don't trip on any of those wires.

525
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,860
Good.

526
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,260
Yes.

527
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,020
Go around the table.

528
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,480
But, Dr. Pinkerton, I have to show you my new invention, the Elvissator.

529
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,940
Hey, get the hell out of here, Filbert.

530
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,300
We're trying to destroy the world's religions over here.

531
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,020
That sounds like a very naughty thing to do.

532
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,880
But look at what I've invented here.

533
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,460
Dr. Pinkerton, hold the Elvissator helmet while I look at it.

534
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:10,460


535
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,360
I'll look for a place to plug it in.

536
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,500
Filbert, I have no time for these monkey shines.

537
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,840
Let me just go ahead and unplug this and plug in the Elvissator.

538
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,680
That's gonna be great.

539
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,320
Filbert, don't unplug it.

540
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,780
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,200
Barga nargal.

542
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,580
Filbert, I think you really did it this time.

543
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,380
Oh, no.

544
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,440
You don't suppose that's...

545
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,020
Oh, God.

546
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:36,960
Quick.

547
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,820
I've got to hide somewhere.

548
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,940
I know.

549
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,440
Don't you dare.

550
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,440


551
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,440


552
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,440


553
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,440


554
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,200
Dr. Pinkerton, put on the Elvissator on your head and I'll simply turn on a switch.

555
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,940
Elvissator activated.

556
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,040
Oh, my God.

557
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,220
What are you doing?

558
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,880
What are you doing?

559
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,560
Well, thank you, Filbert.

560
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,820
Well, thank you very much.

561
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,720
You're welcome, Mr. Elvis Pinkerton.

562
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,080
Where am I?

563
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Dr. Pinkerton?

564
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,260
Far from grace.

565
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,660
Pinkerton.

566
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,900
Yo, Filbert.

567
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,820
There's somebody knocking at the door.

568
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,660
What's up with Pinkerton?

569
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,200
He's Elvis.

570
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,080
Oh, to hell with it.

571
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,300
Just go ahead and let him in.

572
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,460
Pardon me, kind sirs.

573
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,980
What the hell?

574
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,880
I'm selling bibles.

575
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,440
Oh, my God.

576
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:18,420
Perhaps if your old Bible is worn out, you would care to purchase a new one?

577
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,280
What?

578
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,120
Selling the word of God?

579
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
Well, that would be morally wrong.

580
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,480
Morally?

581
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,340
Wrong.

582
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,840
Morally?

583
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,820
Wrong.

584
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,420
From Consortium of Genius at Consortiumofgenius.com.

585
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,420
And now, Jeremiah Clark's Trumpet Volcano.

586
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,720
Volcano, voluntary, is played by the English.

587
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:55,960
Well, this, this, it's, it's, of, of, um, and, and, um, um, um, um, um, but, but, um, they,

588
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,420
um, are, uh, which, um, uh, uh, um, discussed.

589
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,820
What were those, of, of, of, uh, and, of, of, is it?

590
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:18,360
Um, duh, due to the thereof banent of, and, and, and, and, and, it's, an, of, uh, uh, ohm,

591
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:26,320
so, uh, and, and, so, it, it's, uh, it's, uh, uh, of, uh, and, and, uh, uh, uh, to, uh,

592
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,100
of, like, fish, just air.

593
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:38,960
So, I, I sent to, uh, so, so sent, so, that, that, uh, so, uh, it was, uh, and, and, mm,

594
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,460
mm, mm, mm.

595
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,680
Well, so, but then, somebody, so, so there.

596
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,880
English chicken, chicken, chicken, English chicken.

597
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,920
They touched his hand with a hot stove until he cried.

598
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,360
He didn't want to be a bad boy.

599
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,480
You know what a stove is for?

600
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,940
It's for cooking food and not little things.

601
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,380
Oh, a stove is good for training little antichrists.

602
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,600
That's what it's good for.

603
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,920
That's why he was doing it.

604
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,580
You train, you train, you do that to enough little boys sooner or later, you get an, an,

605
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,520
an antichrist.

606
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,140
That's what a hot point's made for, is making an antichrist.

607
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,760
I've been working on a Christ-antichrist warp drive.

608
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,240
How does that work, friend?

609
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,620
It's just on pure spiritual power.

610
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,400
Pure spiritual power.

611
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,140
The conflict between Christ and the antichrist.

612
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,740
The yin, the yang.

613
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:38,920
The three yin.

614
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,200
The yin.

615
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,380
The friction between the Christ and antichrist drives the Christ-antichrist motive.

616
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,860
Two forces in there.

617
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,540
It's one of a series along with the matter-doesn't-matter warp drive.

618
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,780
Yeah, yeah, now you're talking out of your butt again.

619
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
You said it like you did.

620
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,560
This is the channel of Colorado Radio.

621
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,420
Tonight at 9, catch one of the eldest of Leonard Bernstein's children.

622
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,060
She's about to roll in the same place, pointing to medieval Spain as her example.

623
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,820
Tonight.

626
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,160
This is the R.org.

627
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,260
Tomorrow, the Farm Bill.

628
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,080
Who does it help?

629
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,920
Who does it help?

630
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,820
Who does it help?

631
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,480
Who does it help?

632
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:42,480


633
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,460
And should we support this nation?

634
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,000
Today we're talking about changes underway to restructure it and its practices.

635
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,940
Our guest is Vern Severek, semester of Vern Boren, direct dean, chair of the University

636
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,000
of Cavanaugh.

637
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,640
Cavanaugh.

638
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,180
Cavanaugh.

639
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,640
Cavanaugh.

640
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,220
I think.

641
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,260
He's also a Ralph.

642
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:57,560
And I.

643
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:57,900
Both.

644
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,240
Both.

645
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,040
Whatever your name is, we welcome you.

646
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,480
Okay.

647
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,140
How have California's involvement in manipulating the TUDES towards the development of the

648
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,140


649
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,880
center, towards Trinity Rhone?

650
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,280
That means, uh, not summer day in the middle of the night.

651
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,500
Uh.

652
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,360
Talk about it.

653
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,760
Today's men and women who reached their sixties have found they're not people.

654
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,320
And, uh, one experiences transmission.

655
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,620
And they, uh, as a so too.

656
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,500
You know, on the grid.

657
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,820
uh, helpments.

658
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,160
And how long, uh,

659
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,880
did these be in that out?

660
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,180
It's, uh,

661
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,400
I think, thank you. And he spoke to us from his

662
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,660
home in British Canabia.

663
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,400
We're talking this hour to prevent the two-faced

664
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,320
Californians from the discussion section

665
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,340
than just to talk after a short break from

666
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:51,940
NPR News.

667
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,960
Hi, I'm Trouble to Kendall.

668
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,660
Kendall, um, 13.14.9.

669
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,840
Kendall, uh, this.

670
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,880
Kendall, I'm sorry.

671
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,040
Um, but,

672
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm mostly cloudy

673
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,660
today from isolated showers

674
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,920
in the mountains. Five, closer to

675
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,620
eight and six.

676
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,100
By Fernanda Nande

677
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,880
Limor.

678
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,880
Oh, man, 920. Oh, five years

679
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,180
ago.

680
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,540
The briar patch is an illusion.

681
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,380
The briar patch

682
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,840
and the rabbit. Five years ago,

683
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
Dr. Winky rode that last ride.

684
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,160
Five years ago today?

685
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,080
Old Dr. Winky.

686
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,540
Riding off into the sunset.

687
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,720
Well, what would he be saying and what is he saying

688
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
right now? I think he's just picking the fiddle.

689
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,760
He doesn't speak

690
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,220
in language, though. Well,

691
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,820
he gets a choice. It's like the little

692
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,360
the little slid-eyed

693
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,800
white boy down in Tennessee

694
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,900
in Deliverance, that little kid with the

695
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,880
banjo. The mongoloid square laddie?

696
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,580
The mongoloid with that little fish dip.

697
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,140
The eyes.

698
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,880
He's simple, but he can speak the language of

699
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
God on that thing.

700
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,920
That's what they speak in heaven.

701
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,300
It's beautiful music.

702
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I did call him an idiot savant, and I knew

703
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,660
he was an idiot, but I didn't know he was a French guy, too.

704
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,520
That's kind of strange, you know, when they

705
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,400
mix him up like that. I get confused.

706
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,860
Like a French retarded guy?

707
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,460
That would be hard to, you know, understand.

708
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,680
Is that so? That was a

709
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,980
French imported

710
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,460
retarded idiot savant

711
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,760
banjo picker? Well, I thought savant.

712
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,840
was his last name. I don't know. He wasn't even a

713
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,420
real hootenanny in the

714
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,780
Appalachian? He must

715
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,660
have been. That was too real.

716
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,640
Savant, I understand. Idiot. That was way

717
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,260
too real. Idiot is savant.

718
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,880
He could play the banjo with his feet, too,

719
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
which was another, I guess, one of the

720
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,440
gifts that you get when you're named savant.

721
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,840
Relatives of

722
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,220
the lepetomanes, I believe.

723
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,940
The lepetomane

724
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,840
family. The lepetomanes were the first

725
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,520
of flatulators, weren't they? I mean, it was

726
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,620
a sideshow geek who actually

727
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,640
Oh, he was no sideshow

728
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,180
geek. He was the toast of Paris.

729
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,540
He made more money.

730
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,420
Bigger than elephant man. He was

731
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,500
the Hendrix of his day, sort of.

732
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,440
Yeah, well, he made

733
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,320
the colors grow.

734
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,400
He set fire to his instrument

735
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,460
at the end. Made it sound like a

736
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,420
war was going on. He was the first to do that

737
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,500
and Alfred Jari was the first to do

738
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,380
the walking commentary on it. The lepetomane will

739
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,820
now do the Star Spangled Banner.

740
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,740
Complete with bombs and

741
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,480
explosions. I'm the Hendrix of my living,

742
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,480
room. I'm the Hendrix of

743
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,840
my bathroom, toilet area,

744
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,500
sometimes shower.

745
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,460
So, could he play the

746
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,080
Marseillaise with his delicate booper?

747
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,200
I've

748
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,320
heard that he'd actually with a rousing

749
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,400
note. He'd hook a

750
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,880
hose up to his nether

751
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,740
lung, shall we call it,

752
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
and attach

753
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,140
a delicate flap in his

754
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
tuxedo, which would go to a

755
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,940
flute. The hose would go to a flute.

756
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,220
He could play the flute.

757
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,380
He could inhale

758
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,820
and exhale through his rectal

759
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,980
lung. Oh, like double

760
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,460
breathing. So many classical artists try

761
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,420
so many years to get the double breathing, you know,

762
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,360
like while they're snorting in through their nostrils and

763
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,480
blowing out of their lips. And he had this

764
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
down there. Well, he had it

765
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,420
down there. He had flippers, too?

766
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,420
Yeah, you have to use the flippers to kind of

767
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,600
scoop up the air.

768
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,800
I didn't know lepetomane was an amphibian.

769
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
It's not like it is here.

770
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
The air isn't like this. You have to

771
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
like, you know, scoop it up and shove some in your

772
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,360
face. Dense, highly charged,

773
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,300
and extremely magnetic.

774
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,280
We were talking about parrots at the turn

775
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
of the century. Oh, Christ, I thought we were talking

776
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,120
about parrots.

777
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,000
Parrots?

778
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,280
You were talking about lepetomane, the world's

779
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,540
greatest flagellating parrot.

780
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,240
I thought we were talking about

781
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,400
ectoplasm.

782
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,020
It just shows, you know, like...

783
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,340
And if we do it in L.A., we have to do it a third

784
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,300
spring down there in that same hall

785
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,420
we did years ago.

786
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,640
The Alexandria.

787
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,060
Where there was oral sex

788
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,900
by Mexican transvestites being given

789
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,620
to their clients in our cars

790
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,720
as the show went on upstairs

791
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,840
across the hall.

792
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,440
There were midgets there.

793
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,380
Yes, there were very small people

794
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,080
performing strange acts

795
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,760
in a wedding that had to be almost as

796
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,420
strange as the subgenius gathering itself.

797
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,620
Well, people thought it was our show,

798
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,860
actually. They wandered into the wrong

799
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,940
hall and thought they were in the

800
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,700
right one, folks.

801
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,240
This is marvelous conceptualization.

802
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,380
And look at the flagellation.

803
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,440
This midget wedding.

804
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,640
It looks almost real.

805
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,300
Oh!

806
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,700
We walked down the street to go get

807
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,280
sandwiches at sunset.

808
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,320
I was really enjoying being in L.A.

809
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,340
And just then a beer bottle whizzed

810
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,640
past my head and there were raucous

811
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,500
people on the floors above where we

812
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,120
were in the building where we had

813
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,860
our party, our subgenius gathering.

814
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,060
And they were hurling beer bottles

815
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,120
at people and then ducking back in

816
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,360
the windows and laughing like

817
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,900
maniacal Lee Harvey Oswald.

818
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,500
Here's an interesting scene.

819
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,780
Neo spa video of smoked

820
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:05,780


821
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,500
The rendering was very

822
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,940
beautiful, but I was probably

823
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:13,420
so averraged and then they

824
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,400
they back out.

825
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,440
And it was, it wasn't

826
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,100
as long as I was surprised,

827
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,720
at all.

828
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,600
I didn't know what they were doing.

829
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:23,860
I'm so famous, you know, in New York.

830
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:23,860


831
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:23,860


832
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,000
I couldn't do it with lång

833
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,000


834
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,000


835
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,720
Our marketing media, which,

836
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,380


837
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,400
movies is happening.

838
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,920
until it broke.

839
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,960
And I saved the pipe.

840
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,220
I still actually have the pipe,

841
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,400
but the face was left in bad shape.

842
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,260
It apparently was carried back upstairs

843
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,460
about 4 a.m.

844
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,660
And by whom?

845
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,440
A week later,

846
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,520
when a subgenius band came to a tour

847
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,380
and played that same hall a week later,

848
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,060
they said the bobhead was still there

849
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,780
in the stairway.

850
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,400
More reason that there'd be

851
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,780
bad feeling against us.

852
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,360
Now, we left a huge immobile prop

853
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,700
jamming in their stairwell.

854
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,860
No, it was taken out of the stairwell,

855
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,800
so it no longer blocked the fire escape.

856
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,000
But it was just staring at you

857
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,360
as you came up on the second floor.

858
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,500
From puzzling evidence.

859
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,900
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet.

860
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,780
No kidding.

861
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,500
This background music is the amino acids.

862
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,960
And now, more cut-ups from the moor.

863
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,580
You have 21 new messages

864
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,120
and 3 old messages.

865
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:29,700
What?

866
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,360
6, 10, 8, and...

867
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,440
Hey, Bob.

868
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,760
Uh, yeah.

869
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,240
Okay.

870
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,560
Hi.

871
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,420
Bob.

872
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,180
Are you okay?

873
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,360
Are you okay?

874
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,840
Yeah.

875
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,500
Hey, Bob.

876
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,760
Hey, Bob.

877
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,060
Hey, Bob.

878
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,920
Hi, Bob.

879
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,520
Hi, Bob.

880
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,860
Hi, Bob.

881
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,760
Hi, Bob.

882
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,300
Hi, Bob.

883
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,300


884
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,640
Uh, uh,

885
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,300
she's cold and tears.

886
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,600
I guess you heard her feelings.

887
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,000
You know, we can't do that.

888
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:09,540
I mean,

889
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,060
Um, I think she's intimidated by you,

890
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,040
which is just fine.

891
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,480
Bye.

892
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,040
Hey, Bob.

893
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,400
Hey, Bob.

894
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,360
End of messages.

895
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,020
Philip K. Dick had some pithy thing that just,

896
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,840
you know,

897
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


898
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


899
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


900
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


901
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


902
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


903
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


904
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:29,840


905
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,280
uh, the...

906
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,520
Damn pink.

907
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,360
He was the first...

908
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,600
I got my eyes.

909
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,040
I can't...

910
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,000
I flashed.

911
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,380
I lost it, you know.

912
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,360
He was the first true madman of our...

913
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,060
of our generation, Philip K. Dick.

914
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,760
Well, he's America's most beloved, mentally ill science fiction writer.

915
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,600
I love him.

916
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,680
I love him.

917
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:44,960
Yeah, yeah.

918
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,380
He deserves his belovedness.

919
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:46,960
Yeah.

920
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,660
And he is quite mad, though.

921
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,660
Isn't he in his elder years?

922
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,640
Or is he still, uh...

923
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,980
I thought he was a root of Vegas now.

924
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,540
He was buried.

925
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,080
You want to know something real sad?

926
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,940
Well, sure.

927
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,280
We mailed him a subgenius pamphlet the week before he died.

928
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,560
And you killed him.

929
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,100
And, well, I don't know.

930
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:11,100
The guy who drew the comic book P-Dog was the last person next to his ex-wife to see

931
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,480
him alive.

932
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,220
Oh, he was next to his ex-wife.

933
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,160
He had received a subgenius pamphlet.

934
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,280
He'd received a visit from a subgenius.

935
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,920
The subgenius left.

936
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,380
The ex-wife arrived.

937
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,580
And Phil Dick left in, you know, well, in the ambulance.

938
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,260
Well, that's like all those, you know, weirdos walking around.

939
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:29,260


940
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,600
Walking up to Kerouac's house in the rain, you know, asking for autographs or saying

941
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,000
they want to be, uh, something.

942
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,460
I know.

943
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,780
That was Tennessee Williams.

944
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,280
I thought that was Hunter Thompson.

945
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,140
Okay, yeah, right.

946
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,680
Hunter Thompson.

947
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,780
I get Tennessee Williams and Hunter Thompson confused.

948
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,780
I thought they were both dead.

949
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,480
I thought they were both the same person.

950
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,260
I thought they were that...

951
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,980
ESO's Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

952
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,620
A.S.

953
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,780
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Chas, Princess Wiardo, and your surely, Reverend Ivan Sook.

954
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,700
Are情報不要 turnaround

955
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,280
We need backup streo

956
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,940
MosERFUNid

957
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,140
Just access our website topsof97.,

958
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:10,200
U-O,

959
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,240


960
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:27,860
U-O, BOка ALE Skierina, Кто город это безопасно,

961
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,720
Through this life, we were destined to make it right.

962
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,220
It's predetermined, and this is our fate.

963
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,300
We're singing this song so you can relate.

964
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,620
We are going to save the universe.

965
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,120
We are going to save the universe.

966
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,780
We are going to save the universe.

967
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:20,920
We are going to save the universe.

968
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,600
It's obvious, yet useless.

969
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,160
We are going to save the universe.

970
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,840
We are going to save the universe.

971
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,620
We are going to save the universe.

972
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,920
This life.

973
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,240
We are going to save the universe.

974
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,660
We are going to save the universe.

975
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,200
Or get uptight.

976
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,920
Because the end is near.

977
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,540
We can't fail.

978
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,920
So we don't decide.

979
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,640
We're in control.

980
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,620
And we are more than a band.

981
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,540
We are going to save the universe.

982
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,200
We are going to save the universe.

983
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,100
We are going to save the universe.

984
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,360
This time.

985
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:37,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

986
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,080
Oh, come on.

987
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,920
We're running out of air.

988
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,880
There's still just a little room on the dance floor.

989
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,420
So, the chef.

990
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,400
The Swiggin' Love Corpses Live.

991
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,800
There were a lot of bubbles at all those events.

992
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,760
What was up with the bubbles?

993
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,980
What does that mean?

994
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,400
When people run around?

995
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,340
You know, like, wave like they want to be six again or something like that.

996
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,860
Look what I've discovered.

997
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,320
I'm sorry.

998
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,260
It was just a bitter thought.

999
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,300
You know, I just thought of all these people, like, having kid fun, like, when they're, like, 42 and stuff.

1000
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,940
So, what's your problem with that?

1001
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,880
Just like Byron, man.

1002
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,120
You're just like Byron.

1003
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,900
That old fart.

1004
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,900
Who's Byron?

1005
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,980
Lord Byron?

1006
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:41,620
Shelly?

1007
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:42,780
Teacher Milton.

1008
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,200
I know.

1009
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,100
Those are the...

1010
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,120
He's the guy that says we're just all just...

1011
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,600
We're not weird enough.

1012
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,540
X Day is just a frat party.

1013
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,260
We just do the normal things that normal, ordinary primates do.

1014
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,760
Yeah, spring break in the woods.

1015
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,920
Oh, you just can't take a little sideways criticism from another fellow.

1016
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,100
No, we actually...

1017
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:10,880
The question is, if the denizens of X Day aren't weird, what is weird?

1018
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,400
If people who...

1019
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,740
Yeah, really, I mean, you know, just remind them of that.

1020
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,080
Stop taking it so serious.

1021
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,240
You're like saying, okay, right.

1022
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,080
You know, hey, yeah, sure, not weird enough.

1023
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,280
Well, you know, the obvious example is, well, what about...

1024
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:21,400
Make your own weird.

1025
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,020
What about Popes Lilith?

1026
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,400
Popes...

1027
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,160
That's pretty weird.

1028
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,340
Changing your sex.

1029
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,120
Oh, old hat, you know.

1030
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,700
Yeah, really, I guess that is true.

1031
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,080
Truck and roll job, big deal.

1032
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,440
Yeah, I guess it's not really much of a competitive sport, you know.

1033
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,940
So what is weird, Dave?

1034
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,600
Would weird nowadays, would weird...

1035
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:47,040
For you, I guess a weird thing would be to put on a suit and a tie and go to college and become a lawyer and...

1036
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,380
The weirdest thing of all would actually see them damn vessels come down and rescue us.

1037
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,200
I'm sorry for crying out loud.

1038
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,860
I'm losing a little face, Dan, you know.

1039
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,200
It's about time.

1040
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,420
Well, I think it was about time five years ago.

1041
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,880
Well, maybe Bob's trying to tell you something, Dave.

1042
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,840
Maybe there's a little message for you in there.

1043
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,900
Like it's all a sub-clitoral reality or something?

1044
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,900
No, it's like, maybe you just screwed up royally, man.

1045
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,720
Maybe you screwed up like Hogan's goat.

1046
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,260
You know what Hogan's goat did.

1047
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,100
I don't know, but they said I looked like Commander...

1048
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,040
Clink one time.

1049
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,040
You know what I mean?

1050
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,080
Not the fat guy.

1051
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,840
I know nothing.

1052
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,160
I know nothing.

1053
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,340
No, that was the fat guy.

1054
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,680
Clink was the guy who always stuck a monocle in his eye.

1055
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,480
I know nothing.

1056
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,240
He'd storm out and go,

1057
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:37,460
Hogan, your goat has got me in more trouble with the likes of Marshall Kandaki.

1058
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,880
Funny Nazis.

1059
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,700
Funny Nazis on the news.

1060
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,680
Funny Nazis on the kids' Saturday morning shows.

1061
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,440
Funny Nazis.

1062
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,600
Funny Afghan troops lighting up...

1063
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,200
Where's DJ?

1064
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,900
They shut off firecrackers.

1065
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,200
We thought it was enemy fire.

1066
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,180
I am a superhuman.

1067
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,120
Stronger than any man.

1068
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,780
Driven the world with total dedication.

1069
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,940
Cause I'm a superhuman.

1070
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,200
I am a superhuman.

1071
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,940
I am a superhuman.

1072
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,200
Your fate's in the palm of my hand.

1073
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,480
Your fate's in the palm of my hand.

1074
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:23,480


1075
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,920
Come up to me if there's a sticky situation.

1076
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,020
Cause I'm a superhuman.

1077
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,560
Superhuman.

1078
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,480
I am a superhuman.

1079
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,440
I am a superhuman.

1080
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,340
I am a superhuman.

1081
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,640
I am a superhuman.

1082
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,520
Stronger than every man.

1083
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,220
Stronger than the world with total dedication.

1084
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,260
Look to me for your inspiration.

1085
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,880
Superhuman, I am.

1086
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,920
Superhuman, I am.

1087
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,740
Superhuman, I am.

1088
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,720
Superhuman!

1089
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,380
See the future now.

1090
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:11,960
Sing it to the future now.

1091
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,940
Everything you could do.

1092
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,220
In the movie, right?

1093
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:18,220


1094
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,060
I know that what you do is wonderful.

1095
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:18,960
kov

1096
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,840
Save your future

1097
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,780
Save your future

1098
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,080
Save your future now

1099
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,260
That was Neutra, the band.

1100
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,140
Neutra.

1101
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,600
What? Huh? What?

1102
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,520
I'm sorry.

1103
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,240
Oh, yeah.

1104
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,040
We're just trying to make out what kind of growth that guy's been through.

1105
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,220
Sorry.

1106
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,140
Where are you from?

1107
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,320
Anyway, that song, Superhuman, was by Neutra.

1108
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,560
He played A.

1109
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,960
A misbegotten lawyer in, what was the name of that film?

1110
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,140
Brian's Judge.

1111
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,180
Brian's Judge.

1112
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,200
No, Primes.

1113
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,180
Primes Judge.

1114
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,340
And it was on to the cookie commercials for Lady Dunn.

1115
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,740
Pull the handle.

1116
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,580
Down she goes.

1117
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,120
I am so sorry.

1118
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,580
I am so sorry that this whole area has been blockaded.

1119
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,660
It's really none of my fault.

1120
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,600
Of course it's not your fault.

1121
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,680
The quarantine is everywhere now.

1122
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,780
No, I know.

1123
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,320
It's just...

1124
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:21,600
It's tragic.

1125
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,740
Don't try and kick the rubber gloves on, ma'am, please.

1126
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,500
Just get to the middle of the bus.

1127
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,520
I know.

1128
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,020
I'll do the best I can.

1129
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,780
Oh, you're throwing it all over the seat.

1130
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,120
You're going to have to leave now.

1131
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,060
I'll do that, can't I?

1132
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,640
Okay.

1133
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,820
Do you want to play with us?

1134
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:35,420
Okay.

1135
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,540
Say hello to my new friend.

1136
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,660
Okay.

1137
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,340
Do you want to play with us?

1138
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,080
Okay.

1139
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,500
Okay.

1140
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,600
Do you like that?

1141
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:48,920
Huh?

1142
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,360
Do you want more?

1143
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:50,760
Do you want more?

1144
00:54:51,320 --> 00:55:10,960
Do you want more?

1145
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,700
And more and more sounds.

1146
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,340
We've been hearing more from Mr. Sister.

1147
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,640
The great Mr.

1148
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,980
Sick Mr. Sister.

1149
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,820
and the sick as hell

1150
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,100
for the Nellie Murr.

1151
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,140
You're listening to

1152
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,740
the Subgenius Radio Ministry

1153
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,520
Hour of Slap Praise.

1154
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,640
We created a race of robots.

1155
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:31,900
Bob.

1156
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,040
Their function

1157
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,900
is to patrol the planets

1158
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,540
in spaceships like this one

1159
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,080
and preserve the peace.

1160
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,440
And you can reach

1161
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,580
Bob and the Church of the Subgenius

1162
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,720
at, uh, got that pencil ready, friends?

1163
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,480
Just write to

1164
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,720

Austin, Texas

1167

1168
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,760
And always find us at

1169
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,460

1170
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,460
We'll see you next time.

1171
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,960
I went to drown

1172
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,040
in the ground

1173
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,780
Reverend, sir.

1174
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,360
I mean, Mr. Reverend

1175
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,760
plush poopoo man yourself.

1176
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,400
Could you please take care

1177
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,940
of your, uh, frozen woman here?

1178
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,500
She have taken

1179
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
too much of the gut juice.

1180
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,540
Never too much.

1181
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,660
Never too much.

1182
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,420
Too much of the gut juice.

1183
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,060
It's everywhere, friends.

1184
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,520
Too much is all.

1185
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,060
Different kinds of juice.

1186
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,920
It's in your fingernails.

1187
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,380
It's in your diaphragm.

1188
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,240
Shame on me.

1189
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,680
It's always better than shame on you.

1190
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,100
It's in the Isle of Langerhans

1191
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,500
where Creeks and Brooks

1192
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,700
babble together.

1193
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,240
Babble, babble,

1194
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,360
book and booboo.

1195
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,360
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1196
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,420
Till next week.

1197
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,920
Keep your hat on tight.

1198
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,260
Be back to the wind

1199
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,080
and your sack in the saddle.

1200
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,220
They took my car.

1201
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,400
Give me back

1202
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,000
the princess.

1203
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:20,760
I'm sorry.

1204
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,960
I don't want to see you again.

1205
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,440
Catch me later.

1206
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,520
No.

1207
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,380
believe me.

1208
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,080
They took my car.

1209
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,080


1210
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,200
Randy's hit me,

1211
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,860
I'll call you back,

1212
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,320
and I don't have to worry anymore.

1213
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:13,580
Debbie,

1214
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,780
not to on it.

1215
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,400
Pleaserael.

1216
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:16,780
That's the ход of reason,

1217
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,360
Free Barrios! Free Swara! Free Barrios!
