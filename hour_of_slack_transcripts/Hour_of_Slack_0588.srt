00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:29,860
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slash.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,100
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

3
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:50,000
The subgenius Hour of Slash that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

4
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,240
Time is running out, children.

5
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,720
I would hate to be you.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,320
And be at the X-Day drill and not be a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
Disbelievers or especially those who will believe anything.

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,900
And when we say mutants, we're not talking about just mutants.

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,940
I'm talking about the monsters, sports of nature that are the subgenius.

10
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,200
They don't always look like it.

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
Sometimes they look almost normal.

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
They could pass.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,260
They could be asperhuman.

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,780
But, oh, inside is the monster.

15
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,400
And often did we not pity the monster in those movies?

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,440
But, no, Bob's going to take care of everything.

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Now, some people have gotten the idea that the Church of the Subgenius is a Texas death cult.

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,660
And we're trying to do our best, dear friends, to live up to that very notion.

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,580
And what you were just listening to were, well, those were broad...

20
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,120
That was a...

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:07,780
Tape of a videotape of somebody's little boomboxes out in the woods broadcasting WBOB radio at the X-Day drill.

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,040
And WBOB radio was a tape of a tape of a tape made at that same campground five or six years before.

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:27,740
And so, friends, with me, you and both of us are going to go back into the X-Day drill, the subgenius campout.

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,860
And preparation for the end of the world, which we have every year out in rural New York.

25
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,200
And, yes, we're going to go back.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:52,560
Despite the chilly nights and the wet grass and despite the spastic colon, we must, must go back to Brushwood and the end of the world drill, the X-Day drill.

27
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,540
Friends, I have to describe the scene a little bit before we go back into these tapes.

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,720
The X-Day drill.

29
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:57,720


30
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:57,720


31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:05,640
Next day drills are held at a campground called Brushwood, a really nice campground out in

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,100
rural New York.

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,620
And if you take your shirt off there and bang on drums all night, why no one shall gainsay

34
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,380
you even if you're a girl.

35
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,760
Because Brushwood is often used by the pagans, friends of that area, Northern Ohio, Pennsylvania,

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,660
New York area.

37
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,780
And you know some subgeniuses look down on the pagans.

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,820
But as rival religious nuts and kooks go, I've always found them pretty tolerant of

39
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,460
their fellow religious nuts.

40
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,580
Plus, friends, there's another thing.

41
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,280
There has been a pattern of subgenius males luring pagan females away from their pagan

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,020
boyfriends.

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,740
Now, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

44
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm just saying that subgenius women generally don't have to do that because they're still

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,020
most, I hate to admit it, but they're mostly still outnumbered by subgenius men.

47
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,020
Friends as you know, Bob needs women.

48
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,440
But let us, now that you know that this is all happening at a campground, a rainy but

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,780
yet sunny campground.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,740
Friends.

51
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:32,360
Let us, let us go drifting back to lovely Brushwood and the Ex Day Drill where we will

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,280
listen to the lovely lilting music of the doctor bands.

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,220
The subgenius doctor bands.

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,860
Or Wotan bands as we call them.

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,000
Bands that form right then and there from the audience.

56
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,160
In fact, the only rule in a doctor band event is that you can't be in the audience.

57
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,340
You have to play an instrument.

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
But you can't be in the audience.

59
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,140
You can't play an instrument that you know how to play.

60
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,600
Which is why what you're hearing in the background is not subgenius doctor music.

61
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,880
However, this here is.

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,100
Let's listen to this lovely rendition of the old classic Row, Row, Row Your Boat as done

63
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,140
by the Thursday Night Wotan Band.

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,060
Thank you.

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
mostly

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,120
Kind of psychedelic, ain't it, friends?

67
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,540
I don't know about you, I actually love this kind of hideous mix.

68
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,060
To tell the truth, it sounds better on tape than it did when we were actually there.

69
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,660
That is a strange feature of Wotan music.

70
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,140
But we're a very democratic church, as you know.

71
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:47,760
Self-geniuses, please turn your radios to 91.9 FM as WBOB is now on the air.

72
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,720
Anyone wishing to be a DJ?

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,500
Should head over to...

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,480
Where is that?

75
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,420
The radio booth on top of the hill.

76
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,580
By the little hut.

77
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,780
The little hut.

78
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,460
White van.

79
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,760
Hear me.

80
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
I won't go down there, they probably can't even hear you.

81
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,200
91.9.

82
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,520
91.9 WBOB, please turn your stations.

83
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,760
That would be a DJ.

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Head on over, man, you're on.

85
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,900
That's Shaq.

86
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,920
Head on over to the studio.

87
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,680
Come on, follow me.

88
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,400
DJ Soso Dada.

89
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,460
Oh, I have to get my cage out of the car.

90
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,160
DJ Soso Dada will be on for the next hour or so, bringing you your favorite self-genius hits.

91
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
Oh, Freebird.

92
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,300
Oh, please, no Freebird.

93
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,480
But please, make yourself at peace at my home.

94
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,860
Please, be peaceful at my home.

95
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
Oh, please, ignore the King Cobra.

96
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,380
Oh, it bit you?

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,180
Oh, pay no never mind.

98
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,420
But please, be at peace at my home.

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,240
Oh, here comes my lovely wife.

100
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,840
No, she is not a Hindu.

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,160
The dot on her head is a cyst.

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,700
But please, be at peace at my home.

103
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,300
No, I am not wearing a turban.

104
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,380
I am just having a bad hair day.

105
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,280
But please, be at peace at my home.

106
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,520
Oh, please, be at peace at my home.

107
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,680
Would you like to see my hatma hatma?

108
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,900
But just be at peace at my home.

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,800
Would you like to see me do the dance of Shiva?

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,680
No!

111
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,740
But please, be at peace at my home.

112
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,720
Sigh.

113
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,400
Scientology.

114
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,280
It's good for John Travolta.

115
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,920
It's good for me.

116
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:02,920
Thank you.

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Get along, get along, get along, get along.

118
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,700
Little prairie squid.

119
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,220
Get along, get along, get along, get along.

120
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,020
Little prairie squid.

121
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,160
Well, I don't know how you got there.

122
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,900
Or how you got all that hair.

123
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,400
You bring me such good luck.

124
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,880
While you slurp and you start to suck.

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Get along, get along, get along, get along.

126
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,420
Little prairie squid.

127
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,580
Get along, get along, get along, get along.

128
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,760
Little prairie squid.

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,240
You're so sweet and you're so shiny.

130
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,020
As you slip and tentacle up my herni.

131
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,160
I like how you speak.

132
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,660
And you bait down on my beak.

133
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,840
Get along, get along, get along.

134
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,240
Little prairie squid.

135
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,880
Get along, get along, get along.

136
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,380
Little prairie squid.

137
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,680
I thought you were my own friend.

138
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,420
Until the very end.

139
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,820
You said I was a fool.

140
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,380
When I forgot my to beak and to.

141
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,780
Get along, get along, get along, get along.

142
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,860
Little prairie squid.

143
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,080
Get along, get along, get along.

144
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,800
Little prairie squid.

145
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,700
Get along, get along, get along.

146
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:22,720


147
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,640
Thank you.

148
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,680
Yes, dear friends, Jehovah Hates Fred.

149
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,920
A great subgenius band out of Chicago.

150
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,380
Have a lot of rats in my ears.

151
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,700
Howdy.

152
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,300
I'm Reverend Groovy G.

153
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,840
I just made a new record.

154
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:39,840


155
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:39,840


156
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:39,840


157
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:39,840


158
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,120
I just wanted to make one quick announcement.

159
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,600
Last year at this time I stood before this crowd

160
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,820
and I declared a schism in the Church of the Subgenius.

161
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,960
I, having become quite impressed with the power

162
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,240
and the awesome hatred of Reverend Lagoum,

163
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,280
decided that he was the man I wanted to follow,

164
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,880
not the evangelicals in Dallas.

165
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,060
So I created the Eastern Orthodox Church of the Subgenius,

166
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,100
declared Reverend Lagoum to be my patriarch,

167
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,260
and split from the Church and formed the military branch

168
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,840
of that schism, Lagoum's Legioneers,

169
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,700
with the stated purpose to kill as many humans as possible.

170
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,420
Now last night I stood before you with my new schism,

171
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,460
the Confederate Subgenius Axis.

172
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,920
And having declared the existence of the CSA,

173
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,600
I've had quite a few people come up to me today and say,

174
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Reverend G., what happened to the Eastern Orthodox Church

175
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,220
of the Subgenius?

176
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Never fear.

177
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,840
The Eastern Orthodox Church of the Subgenius,

178
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,880
the Eastern Orthodox Church is still in existence.

179
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,660
Lagoum's Legioneers continue to drill and practice,

180
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,240
and we are prepared for X Day.

181
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,740
However, like any good church, we have our charity,

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,860
a charity that we ask people to contribute to.

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,120
And this year, in the final year before X Day,

184
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
our charity is bullets for Dr. Lagoum.

185
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:04,980
Yes.

186
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,860
We are trying to stockpile

187
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,080
Yeah!

188
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,640
a munitions dump to put the Pentagon to shame.

189
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,400
Reverend Lagoum needs ammunition.

190
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,100
And he's the man to know what to do with it.

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,400
So tonight, right here, one year before X Day,

192
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I want to start this campaign rolling

193
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
and ask any of you folks out there in the audience tonight

194
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,260
who just happen to have a few spare bullets

195
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,340
or shotgun shells in your pocket

196
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,960
to come on up here tonight and donate them

197
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,980
to the Bullets for Dr. Lagoum.

198
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,060
Is there anyone who just happens to be carrying

199
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,520
a little ammunition around with them tonight that could come?

200
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,680
Yes, there we are, the first brother.

201
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,880
Thank you, thank you, brother.

202
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,060
Yes, and what do you have for Dr. Lagoum tonight?

203
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,920
Here is the first batch of mass casualties for the church

204
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,420
from the Office of Serious Bullshit

205
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,380
of the Subgenius League of Ass-Kickers.

206
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,660
They hold a complete box of .22s,

207
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,460
carefully placed, single-shot, multiple fatalities.

208
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,320
Right on!

209
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,960
Yes!

210
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,620
The campaign is going, folks.

211
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,540
Is there anyone else here tonight

212
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,560
who just happens to have a few bullets

213
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
jingling in their pocket?

214
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,280
Right here.

215
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,540
Right here, right here.

216
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,680
We have another man with a box of...

217
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,060
What do we have here tonight?

218
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,280
We have five-shot shells,

219
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,460
pure D buckshot,

220
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,580
12-gauge, double-aught buck.

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,880
Can you believe it?

222
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,300
Yes!

223
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,640
And he may be from Dallas,

224
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,660
but we still love you, Lagoum.

225
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,320
Nothing.

226
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,640
All right, all right.

227
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,480
Any other bullets in the audience tonight

228
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
for Dr. Lagoum?

229
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,740
Okay, well, it's not too late,

230
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,020
early tomorrow morning to,

231
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,160
or even late tonight,

232
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,480
to drive in the Sherman,

233
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,000
bust into the local gun shop,

234
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
clean them out,

235
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,180
and bring all the weapons and munitions

236
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,100
right back here.

237
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,700
Now, barring that,

238
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,240
if you are too inebriated

239
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,780
to carry out that plan tonight,

240
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,260
then what I would ask each and every one of you

241
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,700
is to go home,

242
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,660
start buying ammunition,

243
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
stashing it away,

244
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,020
and next year,

245
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,720
haul that shit here to Brushwood

246
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,440
so that we're well prepared

247
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,760
to start the mayhem

248
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
that the Xs are gonna kick off here.

249
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,140
Thanks a lot for listening to me babble.

250
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm Reverend Groovy G

251
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,780
of the Eastern Orthodox Church of the Subgenius,

252
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,880
and I'd like Reverend Lagoum here,

253
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,700
our patriarch,

254
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,020
to come forward

255
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,560
and receive these bullets tonight.

256
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,760
Praise Reverend Lagoum!

257
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,300
Praise Reverend Lagoum!

258
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,260
Praise Reverend Lagoum!

259
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,860
Thank you, Reverend Groovy.

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Thank you, contributors.

261
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,240
Thank you, Reverend Lagoum.

262
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll put these to real good use.

263
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,660
You're an inspiration to us all.

264
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm touched.

265
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm touched.

266
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,480
But I'm not touched as hard

267
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,740
as the recipients of these

268
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,240
lead pellets are gonna be.

269
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,340
Oh, 22 cartridges.

270
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,180
There's 550 of them in a box.

271
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,620
That's one per pink.

272
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,040
You know,

273
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,040
for those of you who are interested in guns,

274
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,260
I'd suggest the Ruger Mark IV.

275
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,180
It's a .22 caliber pistol,

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,000
semi-automatic 10-round clip.

277
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,360
It can be fitted with a Walmart lawnmower muffler,

278
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,980
and it reduces the sound

279
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,440
to about the same as a BB gun.

280
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Hey, this is what they used on Bobby Kennedy.

281
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,900
That's right.

282
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,560
But remember,

283
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,340
get up close from behind.

284
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,880
It's not very sportsmanlike,

285
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,600
but hey, fuck it.

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,360
Dead pink's a dead pink, brothers and sisters.

287
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah!

288
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,360
They're not quite as pink

289
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,240
after the blood runs out.

290
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,860
Yeah!

291
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,760
Sheesh!

292
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,480
Put it out!

293
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,220
There you go.

294
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,820
On your way.

295
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,400
On your way.

296
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,340
Oh, so can you see

297
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,900
By the paint's burning bright

298
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,040
What so proudly they screamed

299
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,320
As the blood flowed free

300
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,200
How they died for cover

301
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,380
As the lasers did fire

302
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,400
How they scattered

303
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,700
And I wish you could come up

304
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,540
with the rest of the lines,

305
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,480
but I'm coming up with the top of my head,

306
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,820
so I'm going to do the last two.

307
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah!

308
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,420
Yeah!

309
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,240
Raise the, raise the.

310
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,440
Very well done.

311
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,020
Thank you.

312
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,020


313
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,020


314
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,480
And if all the bobbies

315
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,380
cut off all their hair,

316
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,220
he don't care.

317
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,120
I don't mind.

318
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,340
That's right, children.

319
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,180
It was a long time ago

320
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,400
when I first met J.R. Bob Dobbs.

321
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,020
I don't mind.

322
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


323
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,320
I heard, first heard the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

324
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,060
I saw those grinning dots

325
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,980
on the chest of Reverend Stevie Hambone

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,960
in Austin, Texas,

327
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,040
the day after the very first

328
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,480
subgenius world revival

329
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,540
held in Dallas.

330
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,060
And friends, I want to tell you,

331
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,420
at that time in my life,

332
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,680
I thought I had it all.

333
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,980
But I had nothing.

334
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I had nothing.

335
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,640
You know why?

336
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,080
Because I didn't have that man Bob.

337
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,880
What's his name?

338
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,060
Bob!

339
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,020
Bob!

340
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,200
Once I got together with Bob,

341
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,400
it was a whole other story, children.

342
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,000
That's right.

343
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,220
My life changed forever.

344
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,520
I knew what the slack

345
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,480
had been given to me.

346
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,600
So I turned my life over to Bob.

347
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,880
Bob, Bob, would you?

348
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,620
Yeah, I spent a little time

349
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,680
with Negi along the way.

350
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,960
There's no doubt about that.

351
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,080
But it was Bob.

352
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,260
Bob.

353
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,580
Oh, Bob.

354
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, yeah.

355
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,180
That's right.

356
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:25,940
Bob.

357
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:26,900
Bob.

358
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,840
Bob.

359
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,280
Bob.

360
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,800
Oh, my God!

361
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,260


362
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,060
Oh, look over there.

363
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,060


364
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,420
Maybe we should talk to him.

365
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,520
Maybe not in a bar,

366
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,500
maybe not just in a club.

367
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,600
So, no.

368
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:53,700


369
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:53,740
Why blue لителヤpine

370
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:53,740


371
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:53,740


372
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:53,740


373
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:53,900
But I mean,

374
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:54,780
if you look at me,

375
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,120
I want to catch aア

376
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,700
I'll just have a car

377
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,120
Them boys look like .

378
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,560
This is not a drill next time around.

379
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,080
This is the real thing.

380
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,920
And we're going to have it big.

381
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,140
And we're going to have it scary.

382
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,100
And we're going to have it Bob's way.

383
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah!

384
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,980
Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.

385
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:17,980
You're getting ahead of right here.

386
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,980
Yes, we are.

387
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,280
We're doing the same time.

388
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,040
Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.

389
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,980
Allow me to introduce myself.

390
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,640
I am the Yeti Harmies, fuckers.

391
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,840
I wear 36 inch heels, and I paint my nails

392
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,200
with the blood of the fucking lamb.

393
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,800
I gave Tula her first beauty lesson,

394
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,940
and I showed Wendy Carlos how to play my horn.

395
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,120
I put the moan in the hormone.

396
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,260
Bitch, don't dare fuck with me.

397
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,280
P-Dawg and I took turns on top, and I

398
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,780
made him slurp up the mess.

399
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,620
For I am the sex goddess bitch.

400
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,540
Bitch, stud from the 10th bar, though.

401
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
Just try to keep up with me.

402
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,020
My meat sword is its own.

403
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,240
She scabbard real close to home, baby.

404
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm man enough to be God.

405
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,020
And you know that she is a cunt.

406
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,900
I fart with charm, motherfuckers.

407
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,100
I burn my bra and the damn breast forms with it.

408
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,960
My knockers knock loudly.

409
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
And I got a little bit of a problem.

410
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,600


411
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,740
I'm a throbbing member that dismembers.

412
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,180
Wotan turned into a prairie squid to rape me.

413
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,080
His mistake.

414
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,900
I wear lead lined lingerie under my see-through kimono.

415
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,440
I sang Cthulhu from the Mariana Trench using my fishnets,

416
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,840
and I didn't take them off first.

417
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,960
My sex chromosome is XXX.

418
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,640
Woo!

419
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,600
I threw in a bitch.

420
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
I'm a couple of Y's for variety.

421
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,220
I get PMS for laughs.

422
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,360
It feels good getting that bitchy.

423
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,720
It makes my balls itch.

424
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,000
I scoop some magma from my clit hood,

425
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,360
and I feed it to the archangels.

426
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,120
They can't make a jock strap big enough, strong enough,

427
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,880
or pretty enough for my holy scepter.

428
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,160
You best believe it, baby.

429
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,860
Woo-hoo!

430
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,580
I took the infrared woman of the subgenius to bed, and made her.

431
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,580


432
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,580


433
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,580


434
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,580


435
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,580


436
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,580


437
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:33,740
I don't use electrolysis to remove my facial hair.

438
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,920
I use kerosene and a matchstick.

439
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,720
Woo!

440
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,600
I had a threesome with the Dobbses.

441
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,800
Connie took care of the upper half, and Bob Hoover the lower half.

442
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,140
Hey, you can't get feedback.

443
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
Nicky is my gaff.

444
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,560
He tucks in my balls with tender loving care.

445
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,420
I just needed that.

446
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,580
I'm a man.

447
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,580


448
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,980
Talk shows my ass.

449
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,680
I'm fucking syndicated.

450
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,480
Woo!

451
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,000
Woo!

452
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,160
I'm crazier than Dr. Frankenfurter,

453
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,700
and I'm funnier than Pat Riley, and I taste better than both of them,

454
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,980
even with mustard.

455
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,760
Woo!

456
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,060
I'm a lewd spectacle of wanton depravity.

457
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,040
I am a vision of macho femininity.

458
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
Unics get hard over me.

459
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:22,580
Woo!

460
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,560
They mistook me for a man.

461
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:24,560


462
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:30,680
virgin in Guadalupe and I will man up on them for my neither bits. Drag queens

463
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,940
pray to me. They beg me not to kill them. The feminists ban me for being too

464
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,220
ladylike and the men's movement is afraid I'll make them all look like

465
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:49,060
wimps. I tear plants asunder without chipping a nail. Who stained their skin

466
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,400
with my lipstick? Who put a leash on this hee bitch? I dare you to figure me out.

467
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:05,880
My genitals are modular. They snap out with a snap. Hot damn I am the yin-yang

468
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,220
made flesh and knocking at your door baby. I say fuck hormone pills. I drink

469
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,360
raw piss straight from pregnant mares for my estrogen.

470
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,820
And I spit

471
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:26,040
the dross in the devil's eye. I am the reason why Jesus has long hair and wears

472
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,940
robes and I cheer in his head to make my panties.

473
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,020
I entered Milton Berle in a wet t-shirt contest and walked away with the prizemoney.

474
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,160
I did burlesque with guar. We stripped past the skin sugar.

475
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,740
I stuffed tomatoes and

476
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,040
pregnancy with sugar.

477
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:58,220
pass my labia and churn salsa out of my pissos. When they ask me what's my sex, I scream in their

478
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:07,500
crusty faces, I am all sex asshole. I am the enviable dykes, the dick that sucks my thighs as I

479
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:17,400
God unto itself. When I masturbate, people mistake me for Kali and Shiva bumpin' ugly. My soprano

480
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:26,640
pierces the ears of dogs and my bathos shake skyscrapers in San Francisco. I get my perfume from the

481
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:35,040
musk lands of a wolverine while it's alive and clawin'. I told P.T. Barnum I'd never be in his freak show

482
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,880
and he gave me a cool million out of relief. Treat me like a lady or just fuckin' kill me, pink boy.

483
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,080
I'll be dancing with Nunu light years from the earth.

484
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Whenever the conspiracy gets its genderfuck, they'll never even touch the hem of my skirt.

485
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,600
Now move from that mirror before I rant again.

486
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,880
Alright!

487
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:06,460
The spirit of Dobbs compels you! The spirit of Dobbs compels you! The spirit of Dobbs compels you!

488
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,420
The spirit of Dobbs compels you! They were trying to burn High Weirdness by Mail, that old outdated book

489
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,700
around the X-Day Drill bonfire. Friends, that was, um,

490
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:25,220
what we just heard was, uh, Popeth, uh, Popes Lilith von Fraumench, kind of a hard name to pronounce,

491
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:34,120
Popes Lilith von Fraumench of, uh, Seattle, now of Seattle, used to be of Dallas, um, used to, well,

492
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:43,280
and, uh, with the brag of the cross-dressing subgenius of my, I'll put that out on the internet radio uncensored

493
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,980
with all the foul words in there, uh, the naughty words.

494
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,380
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

495
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,380
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

496
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,580
What?

497
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,440
Well, there's someone who's burning a watch there, I believe.

498
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,600
Destroy time, Pope Fred says.

499
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:37,240
It's cathartic. It's cathartic to burn the things of the conspiracy and its cathartic

500
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:45,220
to spit on a living Jesus who's being crucified. Uh, it's especially cathartic if you, if,

501
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,380
if you know him personally, and, uh, know him personally, like, you know, the, the,

502
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,380


503
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,380


504
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:54,120
and work with him closely. He was a real good sport, the Lord was, about being crucified at

505
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,440
the X Day Drill. He was one of the, he was really the, one of the main organizers. You might say

506
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:07,780
the main organizer and the main emcee, the Lord was, but yet they mocked him and spit upon him.

507
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,580
Let's see if there's some recordings over on the other side of this of that.

508
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:22,240
Yeah, Jesus has just been brought up, nailed up on the cross, and the crowd is singing to him.

509
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,960
It's sad and yet inspiring.

510
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,900
They were singing the songs from Jesus Christ Superstar.

511
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,860
Yeah,

512
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,020
Yeah,

513
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,600
Son of God.

514
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,460
Yeah.

515
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,340
Anybody know any good Jesus jokes?

516
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,980
There's got to be one or two of them.

517
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,240
Look at that one right there.

518
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,560
Yeah.

519
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,700
He was joking on the cross.

520
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,560
All right, here we go.

521
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,060
They put me up for the night.

522
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,660
There's a Jesus joke over there.

523
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,020
What's this?

524
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,280
What did Jesus say when he took the nails out of his hand?

525
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,520
All right, a prostitute is about to be stoned in Town Square.

526
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,820
Oh, wow.

527
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,780
I could use a kickball.

528
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,700
Let he, let you who is without sin cast the first stone.

529
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,100
A woman throws a rock at the whore, and Jesus says, damn it, Mom.

530
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,920
Oh, God.

531
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,280
Jesus is up there calling for Jesus jokes.

532
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,040
Blood, blood was running out of his hands and his feet.

533
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,320
It was real blood, too.

534
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,500
I mean, this guy was...

535
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,780
Anytime.

536
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,800
It was fun, Jesus.

537
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,460
Yeah.

538
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,720
Yeah.

539
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Good for you.

540
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,340
You thought I was going to have another stuffed bob up there, didn't you?

541
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,420
I was hoping so.

542
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,320
No, Jesus, it's a good thing you won that wrestling match today.

543
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,660
Oh, my God.

544
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,540
Kiss me, Frank.

545
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,880
At least you won't go out a loser.

546
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,300
You're the carpenter.

547
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,640
You're the guy waiting to get in on it.

548
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,200
Don't you have a claw hammer?

549
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,280
You're an idol fan.

550
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,280
I thought it was Karen Carpenter that had anorexia.

551
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,440
That's all muscle, man.

552
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm a love machine.

553
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,660
I'm a love machine.

554
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


555
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


556
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


557
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


558
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


559
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


560
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


561
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


562
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


563
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


564
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


565
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


566
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,660


567
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,160
How many nine inches you got in those nails right there?

568
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,920
And videotaped him.

569
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,180
Well, when does that band start playing?

570
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,480
This is getting old, man. How long does it take to die?

571
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,160
I don't know. I'm just saying.

572
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,160
Sure. Okay, it's okay.

573
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:49,260
And, friends, we continue with the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ at the Ex Day Drill.

574
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,500
Not you too, Matt.

575
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,940
In 1997.

576
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,120
Oh, yeah, rub it into the bloody wound.

577
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,160
I don't know him. I never knew him. No.

578
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,820
No?

579
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,000
No, I deny him. I did not know this man, no.

580
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,300
I never put out a quarter.

581
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,740
Me neither.

582
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,060
No, no. We never.

583
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,880
The tarn feathers are coming next.

584
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,900
Other than that, Mrs. Mary, how did you enjoy the passion play?

585
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,300
Again, I say, forgive them, Bob.

586
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,040
They know not what they do.

587
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,120
Oh, I'm afraid they know exactly what they do, Lord.

588
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,320
And now the end is near.

589
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,940
And so I face the final curtain.

590
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,460
And so I face the final curtain.

591
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,260
Oh, oh, oh.

592
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,440
Hey, hey, hey.

593
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,740
Jesus ringtone.

594
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,740
Jesus ringtone.

595
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,280
If you love the 25-cent pies to throw at Jesus,

596
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,740
you'll love the buck for an empty beer bottle to throw at him.

597
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,500
Yeah!

598
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,360
Now, just remember, Jesus got nailed.

599
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,580
This is a good thing.

600
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,040
But choose your words carefully because there is another side to this cross.

601
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,680
There's always room for one more.

602
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:03,680


603
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,960
This is really sickening.

604
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,940
I mean, what are we doing?

605
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,860
What have you done?

606
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,200
What are we doing, Jeremy?

607
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,820
Oh, that's right.

608
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,180
I forgot.

609
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,380
Who's going to be the one putting all this on the website?

610
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,500
Your mother can see you now.

611
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,220
This is what Rome was like in the last days.

612
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,220
Hey, there's another pie.

613
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,500
Friends, you have to wonder what we're doing.

614
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,420
Yes, it was her idea, Lord.

615
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,240
If the Baptists are right, we're in big trouble.

616
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,180
We're in real, real deep, deep trouble.

617
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,520
Oh, Bob.

618
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,380
Into your head.

619
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,380
Into your pipe to be smoked.

620
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,040
What about your slack?

621
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,040
Can I keep your money?

622
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,520
Oh, no.

623
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,240
We played too rough with our Jesus.

624
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,480
I think it's dead.

625
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,440
We need a new Jesus.

626
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,620
We broke it.

627
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,460
It's broken.

628
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,480
Can we have another one?

629
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
Bring out the second Jesus.

630
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,600
We broke our Jesus.

631
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,760
Can we have another Jesus?

632
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,940
Ever since I was a little kid.

633
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,280
I hope he doesn't get blood on my hibachi.

634
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,440
How does it feel, then?

635
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,640
Good God, man.

636
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,380
He's really fucking dead.

637
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,000
What did you put in there?

638
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,400
Like you.

639
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,220
Wait a minute.

640
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,640
Wait a minute.

641
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,000
This has gone too far, man.

642
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,120
Wait a minute.

643
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,280
That's the way he was dead.

644
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,660
Come with us.

645
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,060
We'll explain it to you.

646
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,000
Come with us.

647
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,160
Hey, this isn't a joke.

648
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,580
Take him away from me.

649
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm not going to let you go.

650
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:31,600


651
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:31,600


652
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,820
Look at that.

653
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,720
Bob, I want to know what the deal is with this thing.

654
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,000
Huh?

655
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,640
Hey.

656
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,720
Hey, wait a minute.

657
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,500
What do you mean?

658
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,320
Bob.

659
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,000
Bob.

660
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,060
I'm telling you.

661
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,360
Listen.

662
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,920
Hey.

663
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,780
Hey, call somebody.

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,400
Help.

665
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:46,960
Help.

666
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,780
Help.

667
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,720
Help.

668
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,820
Help.

669
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,600
Help.

670
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,240
Help.

671
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,260


672
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,000


673
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,380
Help.

674
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,220
Help.

675
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,520
Help.

676
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,180
Help.

677
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,020
Help.

678
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,120
Help.

679
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,960
Help.

680
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,540
Help.

681
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


682
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


683
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


684
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


685
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


686
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


687
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


688
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


689
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


690
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,540


691
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,720
Somebody help him.

692
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,040
Hey.

693
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,320


694
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,040
Help.

695
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,180


696
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,180


697
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,240


698
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:17,560


699
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:17,560


700
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,600


701
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:17,640


702
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:17,640


703
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,200
Now I can't believe it if any of these guys leaves this city.

704
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,880
They remain to be the best.

705
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:19,880


706
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,200
Nobody for us.

707
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,020
They're tearing down the fences.

708
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,440
We've had three births, two abortions, five murders.

709
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,300
It's a city.

710
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,400
Dr. LeGum.

711
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I just wanted to tell you all a little tale.

712
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,180
I was down a couple of months ago in Atlanta doing the Atlanta revival back in May.

713
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:47,200
And as I was coming back on the airplane, I was sitting next to this guy, and he had a wedding ring on.

714
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,720
But he didn't have it on his ring finger.

715
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,060
He had it on the other hand on the middle finger.

716
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,480
And I was like, well, that's pretty fucking weird.

717
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:02,460
Because he seemed like a respectable enough guy, not one to make any weird, outrageous, non-pink fashion statements.

718
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,960
Nice business suit.

719
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,500
I'm sitting there staring at that ring, and I'm wondering, what in the hell is this guy wearing this ring for?

720
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,400
And it shouldn't bug me, but I'm sitting on this goddamn runway, and the plane's not going anywhere.

721
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,120
And there's not too much to think about except for the seat in front.

722
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,660
And when the hell are you going to take off?

723
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,400
And this guy's ring, it just kept bugging me.

724
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,200
It just kept bugging me.

725
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,720
And after the plane took off, we're flying along.

726
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,320
It's like a four-hour flight, and I'm sitting there, and I'm still wondering, what the hell is up with this ring?

727
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,860
And finally I said to him, I said, man, I've been sitting here.

728
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,960
I don't usually do this, but I've got to ask you a personal question with that.

729
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,920
He said, well, go ahead.

730
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,900
And I said to him, why are you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?

731
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,380
And he said to me, well, it's because I married the wrong woman.

732
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,580
And I thought, you know, I know a lot of people like that who married the wrong woman.

733
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,820
And if you think about it, it kind of applies to religion.

734
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,640
There are a lot of folks out there who just married the wrong woman.

735
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,620
They married Jesus.

736
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,740
And let me tell you, Jesus could be a real bitch.

737
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,220
He never stops bleeding.

738
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,700
He's always suffering.

739
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,180
He's always talking about, you know, what's going on.

740
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,180


741
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,180


742
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,040
You know, how much he gave up for everybody, you know.

743
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,320
But let me tell you, I don't see too many wedding rings in the audience,

744
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,580
but I know that a lot of you have made a good choice.

745
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,840
You've married the right woman.

746
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,260
You've married J.R. Bob Dobbs.

747
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs is that woman.

748
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,720
Oh, yeah.

749
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,500
So you all married the right woman.

750
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,660
You know.

751
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,400
Religion is kind of like that.

752
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,060
But in a lot of ways, it's like getting a blowjob in a dark room.

753
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,360
Because you don't know whether you should enjoy it or not.

754
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:06,700
Because you can fantasize that it's that, you know, beautiful woman that you saw in the magazine, you know,

755
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,380
and who you can fantasize is doing it.

756
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,980
You can fantasize that it's JonBenet.

757
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:17,080
But you really don't know whether or not it's being done by some 5,000-year-old,

758
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,380
800-pound, string-warded, toothless god from some forgotten civilization.

759
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,860
Or even worse, you know, a lot of people sit in the dark enjoying it, thinking that it's Jesus.

760
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,200
Oh, yeah.

761
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,780
Look how much slack Jesus is bringing me.

762
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,960
Oh, yeah.

763
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,620
Yeah, until he bites it off, until they find out that this Jesus needed a de-beaking tool like a damn squid.

764
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,280
But brothers and sisters,

765
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:54,140
tonight, when you feel that warm mouth and close your genitals, you can rest assured that it's J.R. Bob Dobbs.

766
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,780
Oh!

767
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,620
Oh!

768
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,040
Sick needles in my belly, tick samples of my skin.

769
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't care so long as I can live with Saucerman.

770
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,560
I don't care if you're some kind of fiend without a face.

771
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,060
So come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

772
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,940
So take me off to space.

773
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,780
Take me off to space.

774
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,000
Come on down, you Saucerman.

775
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,680
And take me off to space.

776
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,380
Take me off to space.

777
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,300
Take me off to space.

778
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,500
Come on down, you Saucerman.

779
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,100
And take me off to space.

780
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,020
Cattle mutilators, let me join your crew.

781
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,820
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

782
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,240
Woo!

783
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,600
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

784
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,760
So come on down, you Saucerman.

785
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,340
And take me off to space.

786
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,180
Oh, take me off to space.

787
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,060
Take me off to space.

788
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,980
Come on down, you Saucerman.

789
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,940
And take me off to space.

790
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,780
Take me off to space.

791
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,680
Take me off to space.

792
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,900
Come on down, you Saucerman.

793
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,480
And take me off to space.

794
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,380
Come on, you robots with your little nipper claws.

795
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,180
Pale and bug-eyed aliens with wide and clammy paws.

796
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,920
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace.

797
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,040
So come on down, you Saucerman.

798
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,680
Take me off to space.

799
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,540
Oh, take me off to space.

800
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,460
Take me off to space.

801
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:15,940
Yeah!

802
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,740
Come on down, you Saucerman.

803
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,300
And take me off to space.

804
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
Take me off to space.

805
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,020
Take me off to space.

806
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,340
Come on down, you Saucerman.

807
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,020
And take me off to space.

808
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,720
No!

809
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:30,900
Please.

810
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,900
Before I talk about something very special and dear to my heart,

811
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,520
I'm going to talk about something else very special and dear to my heart.

812
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,380
Bah!

813
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,000
Because she has the biggest heart of all the subgeniuses.

814
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,880
Well, biggest something.

815
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,860
Biggest hair, maybe.

816
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,060
Biggest, well, never mind.

817
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,340
Ladies and gentlemen, Susie the Floozy.

818
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:56,960
Woo!

819
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,620
Oh, howdy-do, Seekers.

820
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,780
Yes, I'm Reverend Susie the Floozy, the hardest-looking woman in show business tonight.

821
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,120
And I'm here to ensnare you with my TNA.

822
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,640
And then kill you with my DNA.

823
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,540
Woo!

824
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,000
And I'd just like to say a few words about this sweet little church of ours.

825
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,220
Well, it still is our church.

826
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:32,100
Because in just a few short months, everybody's going to be clamoring to join up before it's too late.

827
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,340
There's going to be a sign and lights over the Subgenius Foundation headquarters saying,

828
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,480
Over one billion swerved.

829
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,960
And the numbers will be climbing faster than Stephen Hawking.

830
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,380
And count.

831
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,720
Oh, but of course, not all of these Bobby-come-latelys are going to make it on board the pleasure saucers.

832
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,780
Well, their souls will, encased in capsules for our leisurely consumption.

833
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,640
Ah, yes, we are the lucky ones here.

834
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:11,460
Oh, for we stand the best chance of getting really set up and styled, dear friends.

835
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,460
In fact, right now, we're downright smug about it, aren't we?

836
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,940
Maybe a little bit too complacent?

837
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,660
Think about this, though.

838
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,580
What if X Day doesn't happen?

839
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,320
No!

840
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,760
No!

841
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,420
Impossible!

842
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,820
Have you considered what your life would be like without the Church of the Subgenius?

843
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,440
No!

844
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,140
No!

845
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,200
What would your sex life be like without the Church of the Subgenius?

846
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:44,540
No!

847
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,140
No!

848
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:55,780
What if you existed in a world where it wasn't alright to exist with two genes short of a double helix?

849
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,580
No!

850
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,460
What if you never heard the gut-blowing divine word of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his timeless message of slack?

851
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,180
No!

852
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,540
No!

853
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,000
No!

854
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:18,740
What if X Day never happens and there is no end to this blighted, pathetic existence on cat-box earth?

855
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:19,740
No!

856
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,320
What if there is no Bob?

857
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:26,580
No!

858
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:28,700
No!

859
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,280
No!

860
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:29,620
No!

861
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:29,940
No!

862
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,740
No!

863
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:30,820


864
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,200
No!

865
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:33,600


866
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,560
No!

867
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:34,880
No!

868
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:34,880


869
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,440
No!

870
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:35,680


871
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,180
No!

872
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,780
No!

873
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,580
No!

874
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:38,640


875
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:38,640


876
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,160
No!

877
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,200
No!

878
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,340
No!

879
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:39,580
No!

880
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,120
No!

881
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,380
No!

882
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,380


883
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,380


884
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,380


885
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,380


886
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,380


887
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,620
No!

888
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:50,860
No!

889
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,460
No!

890
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:52,780
No!

891
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,240
No!

892
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,020
and there will be an X day.

893
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,280
And you do have a sex life.

894
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,520
Well, two out of three ain't bad.

895
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,260
But enough about you.

896
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,200
I know the way to go.

897
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,020
And if you're so inclined,

898
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,860
you can hang draft on me when we're bugging out of this bird.

899
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,160
Because thanks to Bob,

900
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,060
I'm laughing all the way to the sperm bank.

901
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,460
Oh, and life is nothing but an outre body experience.

902
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,920
Because with Bob, you'll believe a con man can fly.

903
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,400
Because next day, next X day,

904
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,080
you'll be piloting the mother saucer like Chuck Yeager,

905
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,520
swooping down to scoop us up

906
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,720
and deliver us from the tormenting agonies

907
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,460
of being alive on cat box earth.

908
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,440
Oh.

909
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:53,800
Oh.

910
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,040
Oh.

911
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,980
And until then,

912
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the road to slack is smoothed by the oil slick

913
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,780
of the divine load of Bob.

914
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,160
And if you don't believe me, seekers,

915
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,420
take my advice and walk a mile in my shit.

916
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,900
And you'll see.

917
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,720
You'll see then why Connie crossed the tracks

918
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,160
to get to the wrong side.

919
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,240
Praise Bob!

920
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,560
Praise Bob!

921
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,520
Oh!

922
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,460
Praise Bob!

923
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,380
Bless her!

924
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,580
The cal' little T.

925
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:30,740
here.

926
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,680
She delivered some prep traveling.

927
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,140
You're unfazed.

928
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,300
Thank God days are the same again!

929
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,220
Loved life.

930
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,220
preacher bill you could back me up with some cool samples it might make it might

931
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:07,360
make it kind of exciting okay DK is gonna be up next okay all right I'm not

932
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,780
a preacher I'm not gonna preach to you and I'm not gonna get anything but I'm

933
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,140
gonna talk about something I know about very close and dear to my heart money

934
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,880
there are some people who believe that the church the subgenius is run out of a

935
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,300
skyscraper and then there's other people who believe that it's a couple

936
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,140
loan nuts in a motorhome somewhere the truth is it's neither it's somewhere in

937
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:39,860
between we live we eat three meals a day I have an apartment an 84 GMC we have a

938
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,740
truck that broke down three times on the way here but we live that is all we do

939
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:51,340
we work for the church the reason that we're poor is because we're fighting the

940
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,860
conspiracy the conspiracy is

941
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:53,860


942
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:00,080
set up to screw us the conspiracy is set up to screw you everything you do try

943
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:06,340
and do and think is governed by the conspiracy I also find that the hardest

944
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,180
thing for people to do subgenius is is send us money and I understand that

945
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:16,020
because you send money you feel like an idiot you put three bucks in an envelope

946
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:23,260
don't ask for anything throw and change already yeah you do feel stupid I can

947
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,740
understand that but if each person here by the way we got 150 people doubled

948
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:36,660
last year's total if each of you put a dollar in an envelope each week tied one

949
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,880
dollar that'd be 150 dollars a week that is a lot to us it takes to put out

950
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,380
everyone's everybody

951
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,220
I'll give a bit another five I didn't expect you guys to get money like I'm saying but I'm getting

952
00:46:53,860 --> 00:47:03,180
paid that's beautiful it's beautiful the uh wow the point of the story is that

953
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:12,440
the point of story is everyone asks where's my stark fist where's my stark fist it takes two

954
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:20,320
thousand dollars to put out a 16 page measly star fits two thousand dollars and again Jesus

955
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,660
this is great I gotta rant more often

956
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:30,720
the more I love the story is don't feel like an idiot to give a dollar a week some people there's

957
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,900
only one person one person who gives us two dollars each week Nikki can attest to this

958
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:46,580
Steve Pollock it's his name not Pollock Pollack two dollars every week here is my two dollar

959
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:53,600
donation beautiful there's only one way that we can beat the

960
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,760
conspiracy the conspiracy wants to hold you back the conspiracy wants to hold us back we're doing

961
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,620
we're doing we're doing what we love what we want to do and the only way I see it be the conspiracy

962
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:14,100
is to see me wearing Armani suits and to see Reverend staying try to do the

963
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,460
drill in the limbo with a with a pipe smoking midget at the door

964
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:19,900
yeah

965
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:20,940
yeah

966
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,560
yeah

967
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:21,820
yeah

968
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,800
yeah

969
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:31,520
we have proven that we can beat the conspiracy that we don't need to play by their rules to win

970
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,920
the game I guess it did turn into a rant didn't it I'm sorry I got carried away thank you thank you

971
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,740
and uh praise the Lord dear friends uh now it's time to recap where are we on the x-day drill I

972
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,320
wanted to do uh three shows devoted to the the drill and what if we not covered

973
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,140
not yet covered the Last Supper

974
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:05,440
our P-Kitties rant or there's a lot more Bill Miller stuff to go there's so

975
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:14,340
much group Reverend groovy G's uh uh subgenius Confederacy rant and not to mention the uh all

976
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:23,280
nude baptism and the uh and the the hot oil wrestling matches it's endless I suppose it's

977
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,060
trying to grab you some best ofs.

978
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,400
But you know what we haven't touched on yet is the final day, Sunday.

979
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,380
In 1998, X Day, July 5th, will fall on a Sunday.

980
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:45,660
And that's why at the drills we always do the 7 a.m. ritual on Sunday.

981
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,260
And it was a good one, a good one this time.

982
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,720
I want to start bringing you bits and pieces of it, I guess, tonight.

983
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,280
And we'll continue with the rest of it later.

984
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,140
For the time being, friends, for those of you who've heard this show for the very first time,

985
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:10,780
this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, the voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

986
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,540
Well, one of a hell of a lot of voices, actually.

987
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,820
But I'm the lucky guy that it all comes in.

988
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,720
I have to deal with it.

989
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,680

1006
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,100
It's true.

1007
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Strange, but true.

1008
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,740
Anyway, friends, let's...

1009
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:25,160
Let's delve deep down back into 7 o'clock in the morning, Sunday,

1010
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,480
about two weeks ago, July 5th,

1011
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,340
our preparation for the last moments of life on Earth.

1012
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,240
Thank you.

1013
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Oh, don't forget tomorrow, 7 a.m.

1014
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,080
Yes.

1015
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,780
Is the morning service.

1016
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,720
And this is why we have the extra...

1017
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,900
I've told you time and time again, 12 people made it last time.

1018
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:58,620
We hope enough people learn from that time how to act tonight in order to get up on 7 a.m.

1019
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,720
That's why we have the drills.

1020
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,500
So the amateurs learn to be professionals.

1021
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,920
We meet here for Reverend Ivanstang to give 7 o'clock early mass.

1022
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,000
Five hours and 45 minutes.

1023
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,320
In five hours and 45 minutes.

1024
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,920
All I can do...

1025
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,000
Hey!

1026
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,220
Five hours and 45 minutes.

1027
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:18,340
Good.

1028
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,160
30 seconds to fake X-Day.

1029
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,800
When we hit the exact zero mark,

1030
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,860
that's when you stick the warhead in your mouth

1031
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,920
and trust us that we didn't inject some sort of little extra candy into it.

1032
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,320
It is time to...

1033
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,200
It was, after all.

1034
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,820
It's like a little vacuum seal wrapping.

1035
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,860
It is time to de-seal the pill.

1036
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,080
It is time to break the vacuum seal.

1037
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:43,680
It's been ruptured.

1038
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,260
All right.

1039
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,140
Five.

1040
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,420
Break the seal.

1041
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,820
Four.

1042
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,580
Three.

1043
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,160
Two.

1044
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,480
One.

1045
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,720
Blank the seal in your mouth.

1046
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,360
X-Day!

1047
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,880
X-Day!

1048
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,740
52 seconds.

1049
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:11,920
52 seconds and the sour translation will go meanwhile.

1050
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,200
One more time.

1051
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,420
Just to let him know we're still here.

1052
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,120
X-Day.

1053
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,560
X-Day.

1054
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:17,560


1055
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,200
X-Day.

1056
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:18,460
X-Day.

1057
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:18,520
X-Day.

1058
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1059
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1060
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1061
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1062
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1063
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1064
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1065
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1066
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1067
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1068
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1069
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1070
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,520


1071
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,460
It is good for Max.

1072
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,240
It's time, children.

1073
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,580
Come on, children.

1074
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,800
Line up.

1075
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,180
Take the Kool-Aid.

1076
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,220
Please, please, in orderly fashion.

1077
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,760
Leave your container at the door.

1078
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,800
Place the veil over your head.

1079
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,560
Please, please, in orderly fashion.

1080
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,740
Okay.

1081
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,780
Don't break the line down.

1082
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,660
Don't break the line down.

1083
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,800
We're going home.

1084
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,840
Perfect Kool-Aid.

1085
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,480
Have your drink.

1086
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,760
Go and lie down.

1087
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,120
Place the Kool-Aid.

1088
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:53,520
Put your camera.

1089
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,880
Wow.

1090
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Engineer's office.

1091
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,700
Consume the Kool-Aid.

1092
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,740
Is that a Kool-Aid?

1093
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:06,240
Do not be alarmed by the bitter sweet aftertaste.

1094
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,720
For maximum effect, place the Kool-Aid underneath your tongue.

1095
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,560
Drink your Kool-Aid and lie down.

1096
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,520
What did he do?

1097
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,220
It was strawberry.

1098
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,980
Do not be alarmed if you feel the sudden urge to go into convulsions.

1099
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,340
This is only the high density of sugar content.

1100
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,220
And remember, whenever they say, it's not about the money.

1101
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,880
It's about the money.

1102
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,260
Speaking of Jesus.

1103
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,700
The story of reality.

1104
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:44,640
Speaking of Jesus, in the greatest tradition of Jesus, he is once again a no-show.

1105
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,560
Isn't that just like a movie?

1106
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,060
But he will be back.

1107
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,380
Have faith.

1108
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,300
He will be back.

1109
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,140
And then everything will be okay.

1110
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:02,120
You know, there's something about giving this money at the very last minute that just kind of bothers me.

1111
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,960
I mean, when you know the money's not going to be worth anything, to give it up then is not a sacrifice.

1112
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,080
You've got one year left to give that money up.

1113
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,100
And you better not wait until the very last day.

1114
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,920
I mean, come on.

1115
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,480
We want to see some of that money come forward.

1116
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:17,540


1117
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,060
Before July 5, 1998.

1118
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,640
Well, now we can tell these people to do all kinds of things.

1119
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,380
We can say, well, obey us and question authority.

1120
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,300
We can say, give Bob tons and tons of money.

1121
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,000
We can say, kill a human being every day.

1122
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,500
Or spray paint Bob heads every day.

1123
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,400
Everybody give Bob on TV.

1124
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,760
But to tell them the honest truth.

1125
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,400
I mean, really, why dress it up?

1126
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,540
Are not the exes going to do all of this?

1127
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,040
Why do you have to do all of that for us in 365 days?

1128
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:58,880
The only thing you have to do is stay alive for another 365 days.

1129
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,120
That's the only thing that you really have to do.

1130
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,960
Thinking and handling.

1131
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,080
Sometimes I want to kill them or me.

1132
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,960
But by God, I've only got to sweat through 365 more of them.

1133
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,500
And that's it.

1134
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Then it's up to them.

1135
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,280
They'll take care of killing the pig.

1136
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,740
Everybody change of plans.

1137
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,180
Oh, fuck.

1138
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,680
Oh, fuck.

1139
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:31,360
Oh, dear friends, I should cut in and explain that I was sitting there saying that nice, well-meant statement

1140
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,500
when Dr. Leigh Hume walked up to me and said, change of plans.

1141
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,900
Pointed a gun at my stomach and fired it off.

1142
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,640
And I guess it was blank.

1143
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:49,140
I fell down, though, because that's what you do when somebody points a gun at you and fires.

1144
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,260
So I fell down and it went on from there.

1145
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,480
Fear not, children.

1146
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,580
That's just more room on the sausage.

1147
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,160
I always want to take a hand.

1148
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,200
Anybody else who wants to have a shot at the Reverend, that's only $5.

1149
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,640
$5.

1150
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,220
$5.

1151
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,060
Thank you, Christ.

1152
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,100
You're a pimp.

1153
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,240
A pimp for Bob.

1154
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,920
A quack in the blanket.

1155
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,360
We need more of this, brothers and children of the faith.

1156
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,880
We need more queers for Bob.

1157
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:40,900
Yeah.

1158
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,160
Hey, wait a minute.

1159
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,520
I'm sick and tired of all these people saying, he ain't alive.

1160
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,460
I'm not queer.

1161
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,820
That broke the news for Bob.

1162
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:57,660
When Bob tells you to bend over, your response should be how much.

1163
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,080
Not when, not where, just say how much.

1164
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,320
When he says grab that rail, you say, yes, sir, I will.

1165
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,520
There should be no hesitation in your voice.

1166
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,940
This is more than about sex.

1167
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,880
This is about eternal love for your God.

1168
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,760
Would you not be willing to take it in the ass for Bob?

1169
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,140
Brothers and sisters, I want to hear an amen.

1170
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,460
Amen.

1171
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,440
Amen.

1172
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,220
Amen.

1173
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:24,560


1174
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,880
Not only are you going to take it where Bob wants to put it, but you're going to enjoy

1175
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,460
it.

1176
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,400
Whether you like it or not.

1177
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,520
Amen.

1178
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,080
Don't remind us.

1179
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,200
Amen.

1180
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,020
Amen.

1181
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,920
And if Bob wants to do it repeatedly, you just make sure that you do it.

1182
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:40,920


1183
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,940
You look like you're enjoying it when you do it on.

1184
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,040
It repays each time.

1185
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,420
If he wants to use a little grease, that's fine.

1186
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,060
If he doesn't want to use grease, hey, you do the spitting.

1187
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,380
Well, I think maybe we can resurrect Reverend Stang and try real hard.

1188
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,560
Everybody got a big car trunk?

1189
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,320
It's a miracle.

1190
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:04,340
It's a miracle.

1191
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,300
It's a miracle.

1192
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,240
It's a miracle.

1193
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:09,920
It's a miracle.

1194
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,380
It's a miracle.

1195
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,480
It's a miracle.

1196
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:11,720


1197
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1198
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1199
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1200
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1201
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1202
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,820


1203
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,120
He was really dead.

1204
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,180
He always falls asleep when the gun shops start flying.

1205
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,980
And the gentleman told me he always spitts.

1206
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:27,220
I hope I reacted fast enough he didn't tell me anything about that little stun ahead of

1207
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,440
time.

1208
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,240
No, surprises.

1209
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,740
I suppose there might be some surprises.

1210
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:39,620
Surprises?

1211
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,200
indeed, dear friends.

1212
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,620
I think coconut and a splendid roller.
