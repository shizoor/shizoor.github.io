00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,080

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,820

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,120
🎵 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 🎵

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,580
🎵 La, la, la, hour of slack 🎵

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,600
Ah, you see, you see, my ears didn't work, huh,

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,460
because this fuse had blown and these wires had broken and so forth,

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,540
but I was able to reach into my little tool kit here

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,320
and find not only the tools and the special attachments

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,380
that I needed to get my hearing going again,

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,000
but also...

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,340
Ah, he's reading from a damn script.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,300
The news!

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,560
No, it was...

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,340
I read the news.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,940
I went to the trouble of actually looking at the news

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,280
before I came in to do the show,

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,260
and they have discovered the largest known prime number.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,500
Yes, the largest known prime number has been discovered

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,060
over a godzillion.

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,140
It's so large that it took 211,000 computers

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,160
working together on the internet.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,000
This one kid in Wisconsin or someplace

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,700
happened to be the one.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm a computer that got the answer.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,680
That took so long to calculate

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
since the last prime number.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,980
A number 6.3 million digits long

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,900
that would take 1,500 pages to write out.

32
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,280
That's a big number.

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,180
That is a big, big number.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,200
That's the largest primal number,

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,600
and it is the number of inches,

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,980
of the primal member,

37
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,480
of the primal EPOPed J.R. Bob Dobbs in length.

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,920
That is the size of his love for you,

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,800
dear listener.

40
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,360
Ah, yes.

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
Yes, yes, yes.

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,260
The lonesome cowboy Dave is singing

43
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,220
in the background this love song

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,120
to the listener.

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm singing.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, that's not Dave.

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,480
That's a record.

48
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,100
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
It sounded, it sounded,

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
look, poor Dave's ears are broken now.

51
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,480
Why, maybe it's something contagious.

52
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,560
Maybe it's something that just listening to this show.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,740
A virus of pinkness.

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,780
Friends, we just came back weeks ago, actually,

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
from numerous devivals.

56
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,660
The Detroit,

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,160
or the Detroit Vivital, I like to call it,

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,300
was a fantastic success

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,420
with man, the Christ punchers,

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,860
the amino acids, and the jollies.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,600
It was most jolly,

62
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,500
and we had the Beachland Ballroom show

63
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,040
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,860
and lonesome cowboy Dave

65
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,100
with backup babe singers,

66
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,220
Princess Wee and Reverend Cinzia,

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,760
and also numerous wonderful,

68
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,840
new ranters, and some, in some cases,

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,200
not exactly so new.

70
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,960
The young Reverend Pisces delivered a great rant

71
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,700
about Connie, and the dynamic Reverend Carter LeBlanc

72
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,760
did a wonderful 15 minute stretch,

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,580
and we'll be hearing lots of live devival show tonight,

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,760
and plus little bits and pieces of Norrell Preff.

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,380
And now, a man.

76
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,980
A man.

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm obese.

78
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,800
Why are there fu**ing manners?

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,380
B οι bη'r Dassis already ate at 70.

80
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,380


81
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,860
it's best to be늦rody

82
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,380
God, we don't waste yarn on that.

83
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,380


84
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,900
Come-on girls,

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:13,900


86
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:24,040
and maybe the bla-la-la-la.

87
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,080
What the fuck am I supposed to be? If I'm not supposed to be what I am.

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,780
What the fuck am I supposed to do? If I'm not supposed to do what I do.

89
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,840
What the fuck am I supposed to say? If I'm not supposed to say what I say.

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,780
What the fuck am I supposed to fuck? If I'm not supposed to fuck what I fuck.

91
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,200
And the only booze on Sunday is the blood of Christ.

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
Goddamn the Christians.

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,380
Goddamn the Christians.

94
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
Goddamn the Christians.

95
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,620
Goddamn the Christians.

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Goddamn the Christians.

97
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,240
Man.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,540
Friends, we saw man at the Detroit Devival.

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,900
He's from Detroit.

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,860
And I hope that he gets really rich and famous.

101
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,460
He acts like he really doesn't want to.

102
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,740
And he's great.

103
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,220
We'll be hearing a lot more man on this show.

104
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,420
Friends, I should jump in here and mention that if you want to hear this show

105
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,260
without all of the facts and talk.

106
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,940
Without, in other words, with all of the cuss words still intact,

107
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:23,460
you can download the show from our website, www.subgenius.com,

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
in high-quality stereo MP3 or in low-quality mono MP3.

109
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,100
But in either case, the cuss words are all still there.

110
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,680
So you can hear all the facts.

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,540
If you care.

112
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,240
Care to do so.

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,780
Thank you.

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,940
I need to speak to you about a few things tonight.

115
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,840
I know the evening is winding down.

116
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
Those of you who care are drunk.

117
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,620
Those of you who don't are probably drunk, too.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,560
But I have just a few points I want to touch on.

119
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,000
Because right now we are dwelling in what seems to me to be

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,420
the hour of strong delusions.

121
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
It's a time of delirium.

122
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,640
A time of denial.

123
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,900
It's a time of blindness and self-deception.

124
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,260
It's a time where a lie is being told to all of the people, all of the time.

125
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,240
And it starts when you're young.

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,140
You know?

127
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,140
You try to do things the way you're told.

128
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,200
You try to follow the rules, maybe.

129
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,340
Just to figure out what the hell is going on.

130
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,980
You know?

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,460
Just to...

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,640
Just to try to make sense of what all the grown-ups are telling you.

133
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,560
But the more you try to comprehend what those grown-ups are telling you,

134
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,220
the more you start to see the contradictions.

135
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,240
The more frustrating it gets.

136
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
Because you start to realize that all of these people are lying.

137
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,860
And they're not just lying to you.

138
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,080
They're lying to themselves all the time.

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,740
And it starts to make you angry.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,540
You know?

141
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,900
You start to get frustrated.

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,580
You start to realize...

143
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,620
Because what's within you, that's it.

144
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,100
It's not just empowering of you to criticize.

145
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,740
It's empowering and self-deception.

146
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,360
McC pole.

147
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,920
Being the voice of the wild and the proud.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,740
All this suffering.

149
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,820
To give you a chance toeducate yourself, to help increase your sense of shame,

150
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:39,060
and to try to open up what's inside your head and the knowledge of what your engineering may look like.

151
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,640
It's not.

152
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:39,880


153
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,780
throw a brick through a bank window or maybe you try to kick this shit out of a yuppie or maybe you

154
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,500
try to throw some pipe bombs and some mailboxes out in the midwest but that's no good either

155
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,700
because they've been waiting for that they've been telling each other for years that you're

156
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,920
just the sort of person that's bound to do that sort of thing eventually that's why they keep

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,380
files on you is because they want to see it coming before you do and they know how to handle violence

158
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:19,220
they understand violence they have ways of dealing with violence because your violence can only be

159
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,920
retail and them they've got the corner on the wholesale market so maybe you try to play the

160
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,280
game you go the other direction you get a decent job you get married you open a bank account you

161
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,900
approve your credit rating you vote you buy a house you buy a house you buy a house you buy a

162
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,720
buy a house, you go back to college,

163
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,420
you maybe even work somewhere peaceful

164
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,760
like a community college library.

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,660
Maybe you even get to start your own business

166
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,920
or maybe you get to get paid to do something you like

167
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,480
like play music or write creatively

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,540
or maybe you get involved with a cause

169
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,500
that you believe in like environmentalism

170
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,520
or drug legalization or the peace movement

171
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,420
but eventually one of two things is going to happen to you.

172
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
You're either going to stop feeling

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,700
or you're not going to stop feeling.

174
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,080
And you know, when you stop feeling,

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,640
well, you got to do something, you know,

176
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,780
something that'll provoke a reaction.

177
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,800
You know, maybe you try psychedelic drugs,

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,340
maybe you try pornography,

179
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,300
maybe you try new age religions,

180
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,880
maybe you try paganism, comic books,

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,120
art, philosophy, food, casual sex, whatever.

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
Or maybe you're from the other school.

183
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,020
Maybe you still feel too much.

184
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,540
Maybe you need to numb yourself

185
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,920
so you try drugs, pornography, new age religions,

186
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,760
paganism, comic books, art, philosophy, food, casual sex,

187
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,360
whatever, what is it that you want all along?

188
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,780
You want one thing.

189
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,000
You want slack.

190
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,340
Where's your slack at tonight?

191
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,420
Because my...

192
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,380
Mine's right here

193
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,200
And you may not have slack right now

194
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,040
But you better know that you need slack tonight

195
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
The subgenius

196
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,220
We all know the subgenius

197
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,900
Must have slack

198
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
But it's the eternal paradox

199
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
Because you can't get slack

200
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,580
Just by slacking off

201
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,740
Any goddamn pink boy

202
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,780
With a semi-functional brainstem

203
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,360
Can sit on the couch

204
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,320
Like a lump of dog shit

205
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,080
If you're gonna make the effort

206
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,860
To pull the wool over your own eyes

207
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,640
For the sake of all those little subgenius children

208
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,760
That are trying to figure out

209
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,960
Why adults lie all the time

210
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,240
Be honest with yourself about it

211
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm gonna say that again

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,360
I mumble sometimes

213
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,440
I wanna make this clear

214
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,420
If you're gonna lie to yourself

215
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,680
At least

216
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,620
Be honest with yourself about it

217
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,520
Because if you're okay

218
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,220
With where you're at

219
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,000
With who you are

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,960
With what you're doing

221
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,500
At least take the time

222
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,940
To tell yourself

223
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,720
The things you tell yourself

224
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,680
To make yourself believe

225
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,300
At least

226
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,020
Have the balls to say

227
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,040
Give me false slack

228
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,340
Or kill me

229
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,820
Come on, say it

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,080
Give me false slack

231
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,860
Or kill me

232
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,440
Who's gonna say that?

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,860
Come on

234
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,920
You know, people are like

235
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh, whatever

236
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,660
Come on, say it

237
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,420
You gotta admit

238
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,060
False slack

239
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,180
It's better than no slack

240
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,900
Or all

241
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,440
Bullshit

242
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,220
False slack

243
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,340
Is no slack

244
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,400
At all

245
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
Slack

246
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,680
Slack is like the square root of negative one

247
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,000
And false slack is zero

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,920
No amount of false slack

249
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,280
Added to or multiplied by

250
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,660
Any other amount of false slack

251
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,860
Can ever equal anything but

252
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,480
Nothing

253
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,380
Nothing at all

254
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,140
You will never get enough

255
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,220
False slack

256
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,160
And that's what we're after, right?

257
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,360
We're after too much

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,300
And you can't get enough false slack

259
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,980
Much less too much

260
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,760
A friend of mine used to say

261
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,860
Nothing exceeds like excess

262
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, you know, it's hard to know

263
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,060
When you've got enough

264
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,640
But you can do it

265
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,300
You can usually tell

266
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,540
When you've got too much

267
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,720
There's enough ambiguity

268
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,600
In the world today

269
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,940
And too much

270
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,800
Is not an ambiguous concept

271
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,040
We all know what too much is

272
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,540
And I bet you a lot of people here would

273
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,040
Just to be safe like

274
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,680
Just a little bit more

275
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,020
Just to be sure

276
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,760
Because, I mean

277
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,120
Slack

278
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,580
Too much

279
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,320
Too much

280
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,640
Too much

281
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,640


282
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,640


283
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,220
It's not when the vending machine

284
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,020
Gives you an extra bag of M&M's

285
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,000
That might be more than you deserve

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,420
But that's not too much

287
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,320
Too much is when the things that life gives you

288
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
Are so real

289
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,480
They're so overwhelming

290
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,800
So rich

291
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,040
So full

292
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,980
So amazing

293
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,200
And rewarding

294
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
And funny as shit

295
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,640
And maybe it knocks you down

296
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,620
Or maybe it wakes you up

297
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,380
Maybe it blows your fucking mind

298
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,520
But maybe

299
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Maybe you even get to experience

300
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,840
Something so intense

301
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,220
And so startling

302
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,040
That it suddenly makes you see through

303
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,100
All that other bullshit

304
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,360
And get one good look

305
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
At the face of your true desire

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,180
And that is a pretty clear sign

307
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,960
That you're not dealing with

308
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
False slack anymore

309
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,520
And that's what I'm here to talk about

310
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,560
What is your true desire?

311
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,980
What do you want

312
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,660
To the exclusion of all else?

313
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,100
If you're tired

314
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,720
Of getting by

315
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,800
With your weekly pat on the back

316
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Your nine lives tuna casserole

317
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,960
You're gonna need a bigger piece

318
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,420
Of wool

319
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,820
To pull over your own eyes

320
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,080
Once you decide

321
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,940
That you want that big ol'

322
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,600
Juicy chunk of raw unadulterated

323
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,280
Slack

324
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,880
Once you know you want it

325
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,960
Well they're gonna have to kill you

326
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,920
To stop you

327
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,600
Right?

328
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,480
Just give me slack

329
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
Or kill me

330
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,860
And nobody here's gonna get killed

331
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,660
Over some piece of crap they bought at a mall, right?

332
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,540
We're all smarter than that

333
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,800
We're subgeniuses

334
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,840
But we're not stupid

335
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,080
It's like collecting coins

336
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,180
Or antiques

337
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,540
Or comic books

338
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Or old ceramic instruments

339
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:00,600
Or some kind of

340
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


341
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


342
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


343
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


344
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


346
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


347
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


348
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


349
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


350
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


351
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


352
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,600


353
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,100
Slater's

354
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,020
From the power lines

355
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,580
These things are only worth

356
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,160
What you're willing to pay for them

357
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,060
And you're selling yourself short

358
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,680
If the things that matter to you

359
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,740
Are things that you can pay for

360
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,980
Bob Dobbs

361
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,440
Bob Dobbs makes a million dollars

362
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,540
Every time he fucks up

363
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
I fuck up every day

364
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,120
Where's my million dollars?

365
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,580
Hell, if I could get one dollar

366
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,440
One dollar

367
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,060
For every time I fucked up

368
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,580
I'd have something, wouldn't I?

369
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,140
Come on

370
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,580
You can do that

371
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,460
Stupid people make money all the time

372
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,280
It's not that hard

373
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,460
What's your excuse?

374
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,660
Reverend, Reverend, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, dear friends

375
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,200
And now, man

376
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm gonna make you pay for this

377
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,020
Are you late again?

378
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,660
Get back to work

379
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,100
I want that on my desk right now

380
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,640
Have you been drinking?

381
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,300
Give me those figures

382
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,780
Read the memo

383
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,100
Get back to your cubicles

384
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,220
This will affect your performance review

385
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,420
And you think you deserve a raise?

386
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,440
You're fired!

387
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
We wanted someone

388
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
Who's intelligent

389
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,400
Highly motivated

390
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,360
Creative

391
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,900
Yet flaccid and gullible

392
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,300
I share my profits

393
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,640
Pay your rent

394
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
Feed your kids

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,980
Put the fat on your ass

396
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,480
And the gas in your car

397
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,400
And you think you deserve a raise?

398
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,500
You're fired!

399
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,140
And you think you deserve a raise?

400
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,020
You're fired!

401
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,720
Fired!

402
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,540
And he feels so fine in his brand new red suit

403
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,340
He's ready to take his sleigh out for a ride now

404
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,000
He's ready to join the new Iraqi army

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,020
But he's going to be interrogating those elves

406
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,660
And dropping them off at high altitudes

407
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,540
If they don't give him the correct coordinates

408
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,400
Is that Kevin?

409
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,400


410
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,400


411
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,400


412
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,820
What kind of guy?

413
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,220
You don't give them cream corn either

414
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,120
He's Lambo

415
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,060
Baby, where'd you get those coordinates?

416
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,240
I'll never tell

417
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,960
Hey, I think it looks like 15 south, 2 west

418
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,640
Wow

419
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,740
Yeah

420
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,840
That's a number, man

421
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,020
My compass is going wild!

422
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,700
Man, look at mine's pointing all the way due north

423
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
The magnetic poles have shifted

424
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Your compass is in control, young man

425
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,120
We can't

426
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
The poles have changed

427
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,120
Yes

428
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,220
What was once right is wrong

429
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,880
And what was once good is now evil and vice versa

430
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,740
What was once frozen is now laid to waste

431
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,480
What was once helium is now toothpaste

432
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,600
Once that was...

433
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,220
Oh, never mind

434
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm sorry

435
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,540
Wait a minute

436
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,920
Can you get some helium?

437
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,200
Oh yeah, I've got the scores on helium

438
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,560
That stuff that you rub on your teeth?

439
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,160
No, you don't necessarily have to rub it on your teeth

440
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,840
You just like open up the bottom of the balloon

441
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,920
And you just run your nostril

442
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,860
And you very gently puff on it

443
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,440
And...and...and...and...and...

444
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,940
And then what happens?

445
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm at a loss for words now

446
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,540
I know that something inside your head explodes

447
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,420
And has to be replaced there

448
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,400
That doesn't really sound like fun

449
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,680
It's not fun

450
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,700
It's part of a learning experience we all have to go through

451
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,660
Starting with you

452
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,880
Don't they give you some kind of medication for that?

453
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,340
And isn't the medication actually pretty fun?

454
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,280
Well, it's much worse though than the actual helium nostrils

455
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,920
Like for days and days afterwards

456
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,820
You can't defecate, you can't fornicate

457
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,540
And you can't spatulate, you can't...

458
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,580
Oh, give me a break Dave

459
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,000
You can't do any of those things

460
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,320
Yeah, but...

461
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,060
At the time anyway

462
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,780
Yeah, but see any words that end with eight can't be done

463
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,220
What's the difference?

464
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,580
You can't confiscate, you can't masturbate

465
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,960
You can't do any of those words that end with the letter eight

466
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,180
Or it's a number, I think

467
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,820
Oh, there's not much left to be confused about anymore, is there?

468
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, Dave, you should count your blessings

469
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,220
That you're not afflicted with that right this minute

470
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,540
I'm counting my hairs

471
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,160
And I'm also counting concepts

472
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,460
That I'm throwing out the window for New Year's

473
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,500
A concept, a sentence

474
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,780
That is the goal

475
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,520
Oh, damn, I just blew it

476
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,820
Hey, look at your lips

477
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,020
They're all frozen

478
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,380
Somebody... what?

479
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,800
Now, when we talk about the exes

480
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,840
The men from Planet X

481
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,600
We're not talking about them little UFO

482
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,920
Piddly shits, you know

483
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,140
We're not talking about these little guys

484
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,380
Who crash saucers in Roswell

485
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,100
The masters will come back and...

486
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,360
And save us

487
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,400
What the hell is wrong?

488
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,020
Now, see, the devil

489
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,920
The devil gets into the equipment

490
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,220
This is nothing but a simple...

491
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,180
It's not a fault!

492
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,140
Wait a minute

493
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,300
Shit!

494
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,580
God damn it!

495
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,720
And now, it could sit down

496
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,200
Friends, before we jump to conclusions

497
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,540
Remember, I am a subgenius

498
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,980
Fuck Bill Gates!

499
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,640
Now, really?

500
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,440
Now, what did Bill Gates ever do to you

501
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,140
To deserve such a wonderful activity as fucking you?

502
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
He gave you a dollar of slack!

503
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,720
Actually, you know

504
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,080
You know the weird thing is

505
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,740
I sometimes wonder about Bill Gates

506
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,540
I sometimes go

507
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,360
What if that guy was somebody who sent me a buck

508
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,860
In 1981

509
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,240
And I didn't, like, address it right

510
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,520
And it didn't get to him

511
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,920
And he was a subgenius

512
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,820
He could have been saved

513
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,840
But!

514
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,680
That one little chance thing didn't happen

515
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,920
Because maybe I dropped the ball

516
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,280
Maybe the postman dropped the ball

517
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,820
Maybe he never even sent in that dollar

518
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,160
Maybe he ripped us off and stole it

519
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,280
Maybe that's where his fortune began

520
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,360
We just don't know

521
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,800
You can't know who is a pink

522
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,600
And who is a subgenius

523
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,380
Only Bob knows that!

524
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,800
So don't you go spiting your fellow bipeds

525
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,400
Thinking that somehow they...

526
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,100
I actually heard a person say to me

527
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:24,840
It's...

528
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,380
It's...

529
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,540
He said

530
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,860
And he was a good liberal

531
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,660
He said

532
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,700
Well, you know the thing about conservatives is

533
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,440
They're just not quite as human as we are

534
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
And I thought to myself

535
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,580
Well, my God

536
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,960
I guess the end justifies the means

537
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,680
I guess...

538
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,380
I guess it's alright if...

539
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,520
I guess one side of the conspiracy is better than the other side of the conspiracy

540
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,240
Jesus!

541
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,920
Well, I don't want to get into that, friends

542
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,080
Fuck them if they don't know

543
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,280
They can't take a joke, friends

544
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,800
Yeah!

545
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,300
The thing is though

546
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,980
I mean, those exes, those men from Planet X

547
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,300
They're...

548
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,500
To them

549
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,980
The difference between George Bush and Al Gore is

550
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,780
They just don't see that they're just all a bunch of monkeys to them

551
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,340
In fact, it's like roaches

552
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,300
It's like looking at a bunch of roaches

553
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,100
When the exes get here

554
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,820
They're gonna look around and go

555
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,180
Well, hell, we thought there was somebody gonna be here

556
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,500
But there's nobody here but bugs

557
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,600
Just insects

558
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,440
Shit!

559
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,500
Oh, well, I guess...

560
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,560
I guess us space men, us exes

561
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,720
We'll just take this water

562
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,080
These icebergs

563
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,420
We'll just skim these oceans off this useless ball of rock

564
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,060
Maybe suck off some of the magma

565
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,040
The mineral-rich magma

566
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,700
Oh, yes

567
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,920
And the gold!

568
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,300
And the diamonds!

569
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:45,680
Yes!

570
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,540
And the rubies

571
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,440
And the emeralds

572
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,780
And Princess Wee

573
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,420
And Bob!

574
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,340
The Bob, if they have one

575
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,180
And then they'll...

576
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,740
Then they'll notice that one little pipe-smoking roach down there

577
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,960
Oh, it's you, Bob!

578
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,860
We thought you were just one of those useless fighting roaches down there

579
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,480
Not Bob!

580
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,400
What?

581
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,600
What's that you say, Bob?

582
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,380
You want us to leave the oceans?

583
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,140
And the magma?

584
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,780
What?

585
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,120
Bob, you want us to leave the diamonds, too?

586
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,860
Well, what the hell are you gonna give us in return, Mr. J.R. Bob-Dog?

587
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,660
Your soul!

588
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,300
Soul!

589
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,640
You're gonna give us some souls!

590
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,100
Well, okay then, soul!

591
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,260
It's a deal!

592
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:39,860
Because souls are the one commodity of true value to the exes and us subgeniuses

593
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:39,960
Why?

594
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Because souls are made of time!

595
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,020
And time is the only thing worth a shit!

596
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,520
Time, sales, and souls!

597
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,060
The whole idea is to milk as much slack as you can get from the limited pathetic,

598
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,160


599
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,160


600
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,480
pathetic time that you have!

601
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,560
And friends, it could be really pathetically limited if you've decided to kill yourself!

602
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,640
And that might be a good idea, but I suggest you wait until X day!

603
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,500
That is the one message of this stinking, ridiculous, little, pathetic church!

604
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,100
If nothing else sinks in, don't kill yourself until X day!

605
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,460
Sure, it's miserable, life is fucked, you're in chronic pain, go ahead and plan to kill

606
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,840
yourself!

607
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,460
But!

608
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,740
But!

609
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,140


610
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,140


611
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,120
What's the hurry?

612
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,860
Bob's gonna do it anyway for you!

613
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,120
Let him do it!

614
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,280
Why hurry the process along?

615
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,860
Well, because you're miserable, yeah right!

616
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,240
But!

617
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,740
Just wait until X day!

618
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,580
X day's when?

619
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
July 5th!

620
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,740
Surely this year, we ain't gonna let the Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses out kook us!

621
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,780
Huh!

622
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,880
Eh!

623
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you this!

624
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm sorry!

625
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm so sorry!

626
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,440


627
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:51,480


628
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:51,720


629
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm so sorry!

630
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,060
I'm so sorry!

631
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,080
I'm so sorry!

632
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,460
I'm so sorry!

633
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,460


634
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,460


635
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,460


636
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,460


637
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,460


638
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,460


639
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:22,440
So like I said, you could beat all you интересing things off these kids out that

640
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


641
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


642
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


643
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


644
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


645
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


646
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,120
Thank you.

647
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:52,920
Thank you.

648
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,520
Thank you.

649
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,620
Thank you.

650
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,940
Thank you.

651
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,520
Thank you.

652
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,700
Thank you.

653
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,460
Thank you.

654
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,560
Thank you.

655
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:22,580
Thank you.

656
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,300
Thank you.

657
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,120
See, listen, he's gargling in German

658
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,040
He's a secret spy for the Oriental Police

659
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
It's not one of ours

660
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,980
And those of you who are not prepared or aware

661
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,940
Must take the golden vow now

662
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,620
You will fight for something holy

663
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,520
Whatever that might be

664
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,400
Well, I can't agree with Reverend Stang

665
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
That the world is a monster club

666
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
guitar solo

667
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,240
Baby

668
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,200
I thought I saw a vampire

669
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,900
Looking through my window last night

670
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,400
Yeah

671
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,620
Crazy

672
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,540
I thought I saw a werewolf

673
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,120
Drinking from my toilet last night

674
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,860
Baby

675
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,460
I know I'm medicated

676
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,020
But I know things are gonna be alright

677
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,740
Crazy

678
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,240
I called 911

679
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,160
Had some cereal and I cried

680
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,580
This world is a monster club

681
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,560
And you must beware

682
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,160
Woo!

683
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,980
There's plenty of crazy things

684
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,900
Terror and love are scared

685
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:08,580
guitar solo

686
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,240
Hey, wrong monster

687
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,600
Baby

688
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,920
I thought I saw a mummy

689
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,720
Crawling on my tummy and inside

690
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,680
You're crazy

691
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,380
You're crazy

692
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,740
I thought I saw a werewolf

693
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,100
And it might be in my head

694
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,780
But baby

695
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,580
I don't wanna wind up dead

696
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,000
Baby

697
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,820
I swear I saw the werewolf

698
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,340
Drinking from my toilet last night

699
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,020
Crazy

700
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,860
I know I saw a baby

701
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,440
Hold my hand

702
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm gonna be alright

703
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,880
This world is a monster club

704
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,720
And you must beware

705
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,540
Woo!

706
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,380
There's plenty of crazy things

707
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,260
Meaningful things, terror and block this internet

708
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,800
I thought I saw a window

709
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,480
Staring through my window last night

710
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,520
Crazy

711
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,160
I thought I saw an empire

712
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,040
Drinking from my toilet last night

713
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,560
Baby

714
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,220
I know I'm medicated

715
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,940
I'll come back one morning and feel alright

716
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,640
Crazy

717
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,800
I know I might seem crazy

718
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,840
I'm not

719
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,960
This world's a monster

720
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,120
Take a look around

721
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,980
Woo!

722
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,420
There's prison men in high places

723
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,520
Dark horses on the ground, yeah

724
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,460
Baby

725
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,780
Crazy

726
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,040
I'm not crazy, I'm completely sane

727
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,060
Crazy

728
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,860
The things I see on my TV are not in my brain

729
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,100
But coming from long distances at high frequency

730
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,260
Crazy

731
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,400
I, I can't take anything I can't take at the time

732
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,900
Crazy

733
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,260
I need my cynox and my cylox

734
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,480
I need my anaprox and baby

735
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,380
Ho ho ho ho

736
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,900
Yeah, whoa

737
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,900
You crazy

738
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,640
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

739
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,460
And now

740
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,440
What is this, March?

741
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,180
It is March, yes

742
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,860
This is coming up on the Ides

743
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,200
This would be the Ides

744
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,540
Wow

745
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,480
Wow, indeed

746
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,940
Well, just past the Ides

747
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,160
Hey, it's the Ides of March

748
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,780
It is

749
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,100
Yo

750
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,660
How could that have relevance to war?

751
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,340
Well, let's see

752
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,120
They stabbed Caesar in the back

753
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,900
That was the Senate

754
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,460
They did?

755
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,780
After banning partial birth abortions

756
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,080
Right

757
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,600
Then Colin Powell coerced the Senate to

758
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,020
Spank him on public TV

759
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,540
And then Rome fell

760
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,800
Because of all the sodomy that ensued

761
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,260
And there was war when that happened

762
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Rome fell, Rumsfeld

763
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,780
That's right, Rumsfeld

764
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,660
And then there was the Dark Ages

765
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,500
Where basically it was just sodomy all the time

766
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,660
So tonight we're going to be discussing sodomy

767
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,840
And all it

768
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,720
Oh, no, tonight we're talking about war

769
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,540
What's it good for?

770
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,740
Sodomy in the trenches

771
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,280
So anyway

772
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,360
The Ides of March

773
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,060
And these topsy-turvy times

774
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,320
Compel me to ramble about something

775
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,740
I've been reluctant to mention

776
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,920
For fear of

777
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,700
Well, a jinx

778
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,540
I speak, of course, of the curse of Tecumseh

779
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,040
You see, President Harrison

780
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,960
Elected in 1840

781
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,100
Like many of our early presidents

782
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,020
Was a big Indian killer

783
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,320
Which, long story short

784
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,940
Led to a curse

785
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,020
Being placed upon him by Tecumseh

786
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,620
President Harrison

787
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,700
Was the first president to die in office

788
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,520
Contracting pneumonia

789
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,900
Secondary to the Indian curse

790
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,260
A fluke took a step towards becoming a trend

791
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,800
With Abraham Lincoln

792
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,020
Who was elected in 1860

793
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,000
And then re-elected in 1864

794
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,720
But not for long

795
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,520
A Catholic cabal struck him down

796
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,320
On April 14th of 1865

797
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,600
In 1880

798
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,740
It officially became a trend

799
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,220
When General James Garfield

800
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,380
Won the presidency

801
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,940
By a scant 10,000 votes

802
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
He proceeded to piss off

803
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,380
Big business and the New York political machine

804
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,680
And, less than four months into his term

805
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,020
On July 2nd

806
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,060
1881

807
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,780
He was shot by an angry lawyer

808
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,560
Charles Giteau

809
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,420
He died on September 19th

810
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,880
After months of tasty torture

811
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
At the hands of quacks

812
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,500
Which may have been some sort of Masonic ritual

813
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,420
It basically just gets spooky in 1900

814
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,980
When President William McKinley

815
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,900
Is re-elected to his second term

816
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,160
He was standing in a receiving line

817
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,860
At the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition

818
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,000
When an anarchist with an eye on the world

819
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,040
And unpronounceable name

820
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,720
That, on first inspection

821
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Looks like some kind of joke

822
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,640
Leon Sholgaz, possibly

823
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,420
C-Z-O-L-G-O-S-Z

824
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,000
Shot him twice in the chest

825
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,580
You know, for anarchy

826
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,980
President McKinley had the decency to linger

827
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,660
For a mere eight days

828
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,920
And died on September 14th, 1901

829
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,000
And died on September 14th, 1901

830
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


831
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


832
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


833
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


834
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000


835
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,480
Again, medical incompetence played its role

836
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,580
Giving him a touch of the gangrene

837
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,700
Before he died

838
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,900
Mr. Sholgaz's trial started a week later

839
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,020
And lasted a day

840
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,160
He was executed less than two months after the act

841
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,820
Like a good hashishun

842
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,000
He signed a confession

843
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,520
And was unapologetic

844
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,300
By now, you may be noticing

845
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,520
That all the presidents elected in a zero year

846
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,140
Eventually died in office

847
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,940
And this trend continued in 1920

848
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,160
With Warren Harding

849
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,680
Who was perhaps the worst president ever

850
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,220
The Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency

851
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,640
Indicates that he was bitten by a vampire

852
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,160
Planted by Al Capone

853
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,560
Officially, the return to normalcy candidate

854
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,980
Embattled by multiple scandals

855
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,880
Fled to Alaska

856
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
And died of food poisoning

857
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
On August 2nd, 1923

858
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,340
His wife died the next year

859
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,040
On November 21st, 1924

860
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,360
FDR, like Lincoln

861
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,560
Survived his zero year presidency

862
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,360
But finally stroked out on April 12th, 1945

863
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,700
In his fourth term as president

864
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,460
In 1960, JFK was elected

865
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,540
And we all know who killed him

866
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,780
On November 21st, 1963

867
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,920
Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980

868
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,360
And after just a few months in office

869
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,320
Was shot by a son of George Bush's friend

870
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,260
He died and was replaced by a CIA robot

871
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,040
On March 30th, 1981

872
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,140
Which brings us to the next episode of the show

873
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,460
The much contested 2000 election

874
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Wasn't that exciting?

875
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,740
Who knew what was at stake?

876
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,880
A virtual free pass?

877
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,000
Of course the superstitious will insist

878
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,720
That the Reagan bot broke the curse

879
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,140
But time will tell

880
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,600
Time will tell

881
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:36,060
life is easy

882
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,580
Time will show

883
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,460
That tomorrow is beginning

884
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:38,780
For disasters will result

885
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:50,020
Direct or باط нашей войете

886
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,160
TheJennings, ==30–30 years after the actor's death as a minoró

887
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,120
B Radion Two Rushes tzussi

888
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,580
Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, but Brutus says he was ambitious,

889
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,800
and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome. Did this in Caesar

890
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,700
seem ambitious? When but the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of

891
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:12,400
sterner stuff, yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. What cause withholds

892
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,420
you then to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their

893
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,640
reason. Bear with me, my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause till it come

894
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,880
back to me. But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he here,

895
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,880
and none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds

896
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,640
to mutely enrage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, who, you all know, are honorable

897
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,380
men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you.

898
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,200
The Tecumseh's Curse Lecture

899
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,360
And then a reading from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

900
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,380
You can get your foreign affairs information the same way I do,

901
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:14,860
from rappers. Yes, the Beastie Boys with their first track in years, In a World Gone Mad.

902
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,200
We love America, but that's no reason to get hysterica. They're laying on the syrup.

903
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,540
We ain't waffles, we ain't having it. In a world gone mad, it's time to be right.

904
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,380
So much violence, safe and smart. We're going on all day and night.

905
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,660
Too tired to fight, we're going violent, bro.

906
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,840
Now how many people must get killed?

907
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,040
Oil families, pockets to get filled.

908
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,520
How many oil families get killed?

909
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,920
Not a damn one, so what's the deal?

910
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,160
Ah, that's better.

911
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
Phew. Well, you look different now, though.

912
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,000
It's like having a vice.

913
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,200
Now it looks like your head has actually been slightly protruded in a vice, just enough

914
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,320
to give you a painful headache.

915
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,360
Are those headphones? I thought that was a sea clam.

916
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,580
I thought those were growing out of the side of your neck.

917
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:11,700
It is.

918
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,140
Good lord, the things we don't see when we don't open our eyes to the world.

919
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:15,560
It's my new girlfriend, the sea clam.

920
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,180
I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you.

921
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,680
Sea clam what?

922
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,440
I had one a couple of years ago, but it just sort of started smelling really bad after

923
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,320
a while. It stopped coming out of its little clam shell.

924
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:27,840
Oh.

925
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,440
Well, you probably had it out of the water too much. That's why you need to stick with

926
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,760
the land stuff.

927
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,360
Well, they're kind of like high maintenance girlfriends.

928
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,500
Really, you have to wash them three or four times a day.

929
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,600
You've got to keep a tub of salt water.

930
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,320
Prairie squids lick themselves. Well, they don't lick. They don't have to.

931
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,840
Well, they don't have to.

932
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,600
They clean themselves.

933
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,220
They use that beak.

934
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,060
Yeah, and you don't have to sweet talk them or anything. You just have to tickle them

935
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,740
a bit and de-beak them, of course.

936
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,400
Yeah, well, of course, you have to de-beak them after they do the dirty work, but beforehand.

937
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,140
No, no. Yeah, you go ahead and do it afterwards, Dave.

938
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,440
Have you ever had one clamped onto your neck going for your jugular vein? Just trying to

939
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,280
suck the top of the tumors out of your skull?

940
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:09,640
No.

941
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,060
You've never had that?

942
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,340
No.

943
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,320
Prairie squid trying to spot?

944
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,580
You have never had a prairie squid go for your neck? Oh, man.

945
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,020
No.

946
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,140
You are missing all the sport and fun.

947
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,640
I thought you were ... I knew you were a secret follower of Christ. I could tell.

948
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,460
You are always talking that ... Jesus, you are a secret follower of the ...

949
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,780
Everything's different.

950
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,820
We just do it different in Texas.

951
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,780
The pale Nazarene, aren't you? You really are. You don't know what real fun is, man.

952
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,100
That's like Satanoplus, baby. That'll make you ...

953
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,380
How do you know? How can you stand in judgment of somebody until you don't know what fun

954
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:43,380


955
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:43,520
is?

956
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,440
I'm just saying, you don't know what a Lucifer high is until you've had one of those things.

957
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,920
Take that little beak and stick it right in there in the tender meat part and start ripping

958
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,080
your flesh apart.

959
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,640
Dave, you make me feel so normal.

960
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,940
I don't make you feel ... I make you feel like you are missing things. You are. You

961
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,600
should expand your horizons or at least try and open your left eye once in a while. I

962
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,520
know it's very painful and the pus and everything, but just wash ...

963
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,260
I feel like ... I love having conversations with you because in the end, I walk away feeling

964
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,080
like the sanest man who ever lived.

965
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,980
See, that's more cardboard delusion, they call that right there.

966
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:19,360
Maybe.

967
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,120
Oh, I talked to old so and so and now I feel better because he's way whacked out.

968
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,340
Stang, you're more whacked out than all of us.

969
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,260
Yeah, how elitist.

970
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:26,580
How elitist?

971
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,300
I mean, it's not a joke or anything.

972
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,360
That sounds elitist to me, man.

973
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:30,920
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,800
Bourgeois.

975
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,040
Right, right. You want one person to be in charge of being the weird person that is out

976
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:36,860
there?

977
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,120
How bourgeois.

978
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,460
Yeah, how bourgeois, man.

979
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,240
I'm actually here to talk to you about something.

980
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,240


981
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,300
I'm here to warn you.

982
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,440
I'm here to warn you of what is coming.

983
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,860
Some of us here know what is coming.

984
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,760
Oh, did you see that coming?

985
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,080
That's nothing compared to what is coming.

986
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,420
You think that was fucked up.

987
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,100
Wait till the fucking you're gonna get from Connie.

988
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,720
Yeah!

989
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:05,860
Yeah!

990
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,460
Fuck your mother!

991
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,580
Connie!

992
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,140
Connie has come to some of us, Connie-ites.

993
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,600
And what you have to understand is that the Connie that you boys have been learning about

994
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,880
is not the true Connie.

995
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,540
You got to come with me!

996
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,900
Connie's the kind of chick who may have been the band whore, okay?

997
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,300
Connie is the woman who will come up to you even though you haven't got laid since, say,

998
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,200
1991.

999
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,740
Connie will fuck you.

1000
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:45,980
Connie likes fucking losers like your asses.

1001
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:58,720
Connie likes fucking your bobby, wimpy, non-slack-havin' bastard motherfuckers.

1002
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,800
Connie likes doing this because Connie gets power from this.

1003
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,360
And that's what you bobbies just don't understand.

1004
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,640
Because every time you look at that Connie-ite walking across the field at X-Day or at one of these

1005
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,620
Devivals and you're sitting there looking at it and going,

1006
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,420
Man, she's got a nice ass.

1007
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,960
Man, she has got a nice set of tits.

1008
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,280
And you go home after the Devival or after X-Day and you're sitting there in your bed all alone.

1009
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,580
And I know you're doing it.

1010
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,520
You're sitting there and you haven't gotten laid in a couple of months, maybe six months, maybe a couple of years.

1011
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,340
And you sit there and think about that blonde brunette redhead.

1012
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,320
And that beautiful Connie-ite you saw.

1013
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,460
And you pull out your penis and start pulling the pud.

1014
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,200
You know what?

1015
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:55,420
While you're jacking off thinking about that Connie-ite, you're giving Connie even more power.

1016
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:06,960
Because every time you sit there and gawk at a Connie-ite or jack off about a Connie-ite.

1017
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Or maybe.

1018
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,440
If you are the truly luckiest son of a bitch.

1019
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,100
And you actually get to fuck a Connie-ite.

1020
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,420
You are giving Connie more power.

1021
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,760
And as you give Connie more and more power.

1022
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,780
It sort of tilts the balance.

1023
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,840
So I want to say to you.

1024
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,480
Go ahead.

1025
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,840
Look at my ass.

1026
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,560
Go ahead and admire this nice set of natural non-silicone tits that I possess.

1027
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,420
Yes baby.

1028
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,820
Go ahead and look at all the Connie-ites.

1029
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,340
Go ahead and stare.

1030
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:03,940
Because every single time you look at a Connie-ite.

1031
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,320
Bob loses a little bit of his time.

1032
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,080
Bob loses a little bit more slack.

1033
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,860
And Connie gains more and more power.

1034
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,840
So boys keep it up.

1035
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,240
Keep bringing your friends to the church.

1036
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,460
And tell them about the free sex that we always brag about.

1037
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,300
Just keep getting your little hard-ons following around Connie-ites at X-Day.

1038
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,420
Hang around the pool and watch for the Connie-ites to get naked.

1039
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,020
Go ahead.

1040
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,920
Keep it up.

1041
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Because what you don't understand is.

1042
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,500
And what staying over here doesn't understand.

1043
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,060
And what all the rest of you boys don't seem to quite comprehend.

1044
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,960
Is that the balance of power is changing, fellas.

1045
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,860
And those Wiccans thought that the goddess power was something.

1046
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,100
Just wait until Connie gets a hold of the reins.

1047
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,540
Thank you.

1048
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,740
.

1049
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,980
From Yeti fuck-meat, babies.

1050
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:16,860
A great rant by Reverend Pisces and now Noel Preff.

1051
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,340
I'm going to blow your fucking head off.

1052
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,320
You have the authority.

1053
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,160
Three ways to die.

1054
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,900
I choose the firing squad

1055
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,360
can you do that

1056
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,800
I'm going to blow your fucking head off

1057
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,040
you have the authority

1058
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,240
tell me what you know the word

1059
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,660
let it go

1060
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,520
there's some kind of

1061
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,600
secret secret police from hell or something

1062
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,360
holy bloody pretense

1063
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,520
there may be a history of mental disorders

1064
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,580
there may be a history of mental disorders

1065
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:17,760
they programmed them here

1066
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,540
that's an invasion of privacy girly

1067
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,300
yes sir

1068
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,560
they programmed them here

1069
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,980
what

1070
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,340
Best invasion of privacy, girly.

1071
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,120
Yes, sir.

1072
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,380
They programmed them here.

1073
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,240
Best invasion of privacy, girly.

1074
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,960
Yes, sir.

1075
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,220
They programmed them here.

1076
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,340
You know what I think?

1077
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,620
I think you're all paranoid.

1078
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,160
Are we in any danger?

1079
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,880
Your Honor, it was within my utmost sincerity.

1080
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm going to crack.

1081
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,180
Your Honor, it was within my utmost sincerity.

1082
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,380
I'm going to crack.

1083
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:22,940
I'm going to crack.

1084
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,960
You made it.

1085
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,260
You made it.

1086
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:32,920
You made it.

1087
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:33,520
You made it.

1088
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,300
You made it.

1089
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,060
You made it.

1090
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,080
You made it.

1091
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,480
You made it.

1092
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,600
You made it.

1093
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,480
You made it.

1094
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,460
You made it.

1095
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:45,800
You made it.

1096
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,820
You made it.

1097
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,880
You made it.

1098
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,320
You made it.

1099
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,480
You made it.

1100
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,220
You made it.

1101
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,220
The one guy.

1102
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:08,420
The one guy.

1103
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:52,400
The one guy.

1104
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:10,300
The one guy.

1105
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,500
That's box 181418.

1106
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,580
