I'm trying to make believe I'm you, oh, trying to think
Just a stranger on the outside looking in
People say that life is fun, but I don't know why
As far as I can tell, life sucks
Life sucks, life sucks, life sucks
Within the last 12 hours, we have received a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation
that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomenon.
Bob?
I'm sick and tired of the rats
But you don't wait
I'm sick and tired of the rats
I'm sick and tired of the rats
I'm sick and tired of the rats

She said,
cutting her own legs off,
what was to be the foment of a startling trend among the so-called punk detail.
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.
Enjoy life like Bob.
Get the head,
not be afraid.
I'm not here to harm you.
I know you want to destroy me,
but listen,
please listen.
I only want to help you.
I've chosen you.
Well,
I'm sure that's very flattering,
but I must get on with my work now.
They don't love you,
Bob.
They don't love you like I do.
Dear friends,
you may call 823-711-8233.

For a complete explanation of the Church of the Subgenius in under two minutes.
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.
It's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents.
And then cruise the streets with bloody feet.
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.
It's not just the anesthesiologist for knee-deep.
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car hood.
It's not just that the old ways were best.
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a b-
who thinks workers are property.
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature
without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in mid-South.
It's not just the
It's not just the doorway to doom.
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.
No, dear.
Dear friends, there is more to it all than that.
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there,
if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.
Not off.
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.
In his back pocket.
Just you try it.
Thanks to...
G Gordon Gordon for that one, and this is Reverend Cleve Duncan.
Well, there once was a man
There once was a man
The world's greatest salesman
A salesman
And he had to pass the pain
To get the shackles from my feet
I am a man, he's gone
A martyr for the cause of this world
No one
No one
No one

















No one
Mer najow
No one
No one
Nowhere left
Noanted
Nowhere left

Since
No one
Ever listened
There ain't much
Come on
The never-�데-cha beforehand
The ever-lasting

He called you
The ever-lasting
With the power of God
My bard
Your cukuz
He can save us from the men in black
We're just a shot from his mighty sack
If only he could make it back
From the land of the dead
But until that happy day
We can only drink and say
Father, follow
And it's coming again
I know he can make it
Without him we can't take it
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the whims
Until the day that he comes back
It'll be a world without sack
Father, follow
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
And it's coming again
So, ordinary folks
We're just a shot form
From his mighty sack
And it's coming again

We're just a shot from his mighty sack
happiness, or guilt.
I don't know.
We now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years,
were actually only acting happy.
But living that lie just compounded their misery.
And millions of people do this to themselves
because they think God is as ignorant, intolerant, and insecure as they are.
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.
Hiding their real feelings, living a lie,
deliberately short-circuiting their instincts,
pretending.
That's what they do.
They're pretending, friends.
Now, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending,
but, you know, in a way, they pretend much, much worse than we do.
So, when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk,
remember that at least I'm being honest.
If I'm beat, worn out,
I don't take speed like Tammy Baker to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.
I act like I feel.
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as...
as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.
He doesn't need to forgive me because I didn't do anything evil.
I screwed up.
And Bob, Bob loves me for that.
It's the power to fail, friends.
It's the power that the subgenius popes have,
and these rival popes can't ever have.
And the irony, friends, the irony.
It's like with the pledge drives.
The hour of slack listeners are 50% paid up right now,
or probably more by now.
But yet, now those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged.
They pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith.
And only 10%, at best,
in some cases 6%, bothered to fulfill the commitment.
Because in Christianity, pretending and promising is good enough.
And that's what faith means, friends.
It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter what.
Because you're going to pretend everything's okay.
Oh, it's God's will.
So therefore, you don't have to do anything about it.
Leave it to God, dear friends.
Grace through faith, not works.
Jesus said, be like children.
And, you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without keeping her fake eyelashes,
her bat-winged sunglasses.
Fake eyelashes on.
I read that in the paper today.
That's how you keep your husband.
Wear makeup to bed.
Pretending, friends.
Yeah, they're like children, all right.
But they're like 7th grade children.
Cruel, gossiping liars and bullies
that roam in cliques and packs looking for weak, unsuspecting minority victims.
Oh, they have faith, all right.
Faith that any nasty thing they do didn't count
if God forgave it in their head.
And if you're having the kind of fun they can't experience,
then you must.
That must be.
That must be sin.
Because in their eyes, friends, slack is the ultimate sin.
The devil hates slack, too.
And when you look at the basic beliefs and behavior
of a lot of these fundamentalist Christians,
they have a lot in common with the devil, friends.
A whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus.
Now, subgenius is rationalized, too,
but our rationalization is so absurd
that it allows us, the slack, to remember that it's just a rationalization
and there's still work to do.
Praise Bob.
Oh, God.
Here's this Tammy Baker interview.
Yes, she rarely goes to bed without her makeup,
swears by her false eyelashes,
and wears different wigs for her husband, Jim.
And that still wasn't good enough, was it?
No, Jessica Hahn, she didn't have to change wigs every night.
Jim very seldom seen me without makeup
and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes.
Yeah, I think natural-born eyelashes are kind of...
kind of good, too.
They keep the water out of your eyes.
The sweat.
If you're inhuman enough to sweat, unlike Miss Tammy.
Um, oh, God.
Well, I've got more of that rant to go on,
but in the meantime, until then.
And let me tell you, friends,
it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.
It's not just the truncated attention spans of the conspiracy glorps.
Scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like models posing on cue.
It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the hell-spawned image consultants.
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, man.
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest.
It's not just the talentless pinks hooked into a groove devoid of style.
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.
It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.
It's not just the frothy mouths.
It's not just the reactionaries.
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.
It's not just the empty youth culture borrowing from the ABC computerized format of possible personas.
It's that and a whole lot more.
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.
Let's join us now, shall we?
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.
Thank you.
Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.
The Japanese...
Don't you wish you were with us?
Well, send in your money and maybe someday you can.
No, really, we're a fun crowd.
You'd like us to move in next door to you.
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eyes.
A smile or a leer on our lips.
But otherwise, we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale.
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man.
Ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring.
How about it, America? Get in step.
Well, let's try now, huh?
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be...
What's going on? I feel so sneaky!
Disobedient to parents. A subgenius.
Steals. A subgenius.
Lies. A subgenius.
Hater of God. A subgenius.
Whisperer. A subgenius.
Whoremonger. A subgenius.
Envious. A subgenius.
Pride. A subgenius.
A backbiter. A subgenius.
A deceitful person. A subgenius.
A hypocrite. A subgenius.
Unmerciful. A subplenius.
A false accuser. A subpenius.
Come here, you little subgenius.
Well, I guess that about wraps it up. That's your typical subgenius.
And, um...
Monk, I don't need Dobbs. There's nothing wrong with me. I'll make it my way.
Oh, good. Good.
I must have been insane. What can I say? I'm lost without Dobbs.
Good for you.
Without Bob, I'm guilty. Guilty!
Two side sheets.
Be not deceived. Dobbs is not mocked, though whosoever a man soeth.
Him also shall he reach.
Who is my shepherd? I shall not want.
That's right, dear friends.
That's right.
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.
This is Jester Jackson of the Rainbow Coalition.
It concerns me that the American people have been lied to.
Lied to about the secret war in Central America.
Lied to about your support for racist South Africa.
Our government should be funding cities and housing the homeless, not supporting fascism and waging illegal wars.
Join me in a march on Saturday, April 25th in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
Help forge a new direction for the American people.
Help bring about justice and peace in Central America and Southern Africa.
March in a big way and in big numbers on April 25th.
I hate that old conspiracy as much as it needs me.
But me and Bob will get them.
Just you wait and see.
For as long as they have run things, they have turned them into...
Bob?
The time has come to get them back.
Here's how I look at it.
That conspiracy is nasty.
And they take us for their patsies.
But we know that they are just a bunch of queers.
And when we defeat them, we will kill them and we'll eat them.
And then we'll go and get ourselves some beers.
Now Bob has come to fight them.
That's how we know we'll win.
And we know to serve them is our only sin.
We won't have long to wait now.
The end is coming soon.
We'll march happy toward the future.
Cause we did what we must do.
Underwater vacations.
Bob will rule all the nations.
We'll be farming vegetation out on Mars.
Cause we killed them and we ate them.
Said boy we sure did hate them.
And then we made the rounds of all the bars.
Thank you Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.
Great stuff.
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?
We never make fun of religion.
You must understand we're making money off religion but not fun off religion.
No. No. No. No fun.
We hope to erase the slack area in this part of the country.
And hopefully we'll...
Yes, sir.
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks or do you...
Mr. Wilsey, isn't it a fact really that you've invented this whole thing,
that you've thought up all these little gimmicks,
and you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people by getting money out of them?
People who believe in you and your silly preachings?
No it isn't, Joe.
The Illuminati will be unmasked.
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that.
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it,
the guys that drive up and down the streets selling ice cream, all of that will be exposed.
That's what America needs.
They have their brains washed.
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear and all that sickness and perversion
and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell.
...radio announcer and many friends of the rail land,
it's the old fashioned healing broadcast coming direct from the auditorium.
This is a special night tonight.
This is oil night.
Would you love to have a heart like God?
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil that God has let me use for quite a few years now.
And we're giving it out.
Come and join the hundreds of people.
Bring that bottle and get some of this miracle oil that's absolutely raised the dead,
has performed some of the greatest miracles, you name it.
It's performed every known miracle that's happening.
But look, it's...
No, Hal, look out!
You clumsy fool!
What have you done?
The show is ruined!
Ruined!
Goodbye for all of us here.
This is Puzzle Inn and it's Loebius Rex, Reverend Hal and Reverend Irv.
We tried.
Saying it's too late and we trumphed.
Goodbye, folks. I don't know how it works.
The whole thing's ridiculous.
The U.S. Customs Service is waging war on drug smugglers,
and you can help.
If you see any unusual activity involving private boats or planes
that might be connected to drug smuggling,
call the U.S. Customs Service 24 hours a day, toll free, at 1-800-BE-ALERT.
You can remain anonymous and you could receive a cash reward
if your information leads to the arrest and prosecution of drug smugglers.
Help stop drug smuggling.
Call 1-800-BE-ALERT.
I can't believe they gave me that cart to play on this show, honest to God.
Well, if you want to get...
If you want to be damned by Bob...
Let's talk about another language that's been spirited.
Try to control you.
Do you think...
Do you think that freedom for this great society, this great planet, is voting?
Say no.
Didn't they get to vote in Haiti?
Say yes.
Didn't they get to vote in the Philippines?
Don't they get to vote in Poland?
Say yes.
Joe, did they get to vote?
Do you think they'll go over there and plug out Libra when there's only one man in the East?
Say no.
But this is what the rest of the world perceives as freedom, it is...
consumer goods.
More specifically, American consumer goods.
And children, we're drowning in consumer goods.
We're drowning in them.
It's a fake economy.
But children, when you hear the 501 Blues and your heart sings,
when you see Spud McKenzie, then high concept is getting inside of you, children.
It's getting inside of you.
Now, I know, you're all artists, you're all hip, you're all aware.
You're a bunch of deconstructing thieves.
I know that, children.
I know you can sit there and watch those ads and you can say,
Ooh, look at that jump cut.
Woo!
Look at that computer animation.
Woo!
Look at that key lighting.
And you think by deconstructing it, you kept the message from getting into you.
But I'm going to tell you something, children.
I'm right here, I'm here to tell you that.
We are not that sort.
That's right, children.
We're not that sort.
We are not able to resist those messages.
They get inside of us.
They work it up.
And before you know it, you're another mind-death-duder.
I'll be the conspiracy.
I'm going to give you another example, children.
They say that in the NFL, between steroids and weightlifting,
the football player can run so big and so fast that the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.
And the same thing is true by analogy, by extensive by metaphor.
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer resist.
We cannot retain our will.
We cannot make a specific judgment.
We cannot simply act the other way.
We cannot do anything.
I've heard of the details.
But we can do everything we want from them.
And the truth is that if we just act the risk, because they become 상태 pulling on the
Earth, divide us into deuces.
Because we have to resist those very distinct orders, and these orders get us stuck.

Within belief and those orders, we keep ourselves higher.
Within power we get up higher.
We can be tomorrow.
We can experience hope.
We can have the world in a�
�
them a thousand times.
by extensive by metaphor in the world of advertising,
the images they generate are so slick,
we can no longer resist.
We cannot retain our will.
We cannot make a specific judgment.
We cannot simply accept the messages.
Oh, boy, I have to cut in here.
Oh, that was Pope David Meyer two weeks ago
in Boston, Massachusetts.
Pretty soon I ought to have a better recording
of all the rants from there.
Janer was there, a whole bunch of good stuff.
Anyway, I had to cut in because
the Will of Dobs just got a call from someone
who said that they had called the cult awareness group.
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness
and had called them up just to see what they would say
about the Church of the Subgenius.
And the funny thing is that when they first opened,
I called them up and said,
yeah, I'm kind of concerned about these insane cults myself,
and I thought I'd send you some of our material
and...
And so you could, you know, you can refer people to us.
And they, apparently, they didn't like the material I sent.
I'd never heard from them since then,
but they're now telling people,
whatever you do, stay away from those guys.
That subgenius guy, man, that's the worst, I guess.
And especially, what, keep your kids away from them?
Especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius
because of the sexually explicit material.
Now, see, y'all that only listen to the radio show,
you don't know what...
Yeah!
Yeah!
You don't know what you're missing!
Woo!
And who don't order the tapes.
But I can't advertise that stuff,
and all you can really do is write for information
from P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214
for more information about Church of the Subgenius.
And for that sexually explicit material,
which you don't get for free, by the way.
Not like, I mean, you get this radio show for free
and you can get our information for free.
And it's not...
It's not very sexually explicit.
But, like I say, you...
Those of you who've been putting off
writing to P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, 75214,
fine, I don't care.
Honestly, I really don't.
I always end up getting the last laugh, dear friends.
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.
So, you know, I can't tell you what the deal is.
With the money, but...
Get some money!
That dirty, perky, shark-backed, flackin',
wharton, filibuster-barton, perky-loom-a...
Only we know what we don't know.
And when we do know it, we shall find out later
just exactly what it was that we didn't know.
But, in the meantime, we shall experiment further
and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind
to find out exactly what it is that we don't know.



What causes this device not to function properly?
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?
Or the nose gland?
Yes, possibly you did not know
that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human body.
And only after permanent foot and nose glandscaping
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run.
Ah!
Which would mean...
Possibly that you were backwards or built upside down.
But, you'll delve further into that
at the end of the broadcast
when you and I cannot hear each other.
That was Dr. Philo Drummond, dear friends.
And we can get into this, too.
The psychoneurotic mastosurgery,
the techniques of which has been developed
by the many great doctors
who have come over to...
Dobbs and from many of the other religious cults around the world.
Maybe the same as I had my frontal lobotomy.
And it's...
We've got Europeans and Lithuanians
and ice doctors and the big doctors
and the doctors of the trees
and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.
We've got a song about doctors.
And here...
Hypercletes.
Here it is.
Hypercletes.
Doctors.
Doctors.
For Bob.
Doctors for Bob
and everything real in my life.
Bob.
Yeah.
Doctors and Bob
and everything real in my life.
Oh, real in my life.
Damn pickup truck come out blue
done run over my wife.
Yeah.
He's got the blues
cause they run over his wife.
Some of you gonna get mad at me.
Jesus ain't in the church.
Don't turn the radio off.
Keep it on.
And I wouldn't infer that
that our secondary state
is Antichrist.
But I'm telling you that
preparations are being made
and that the very
the very door of the day
of the wrath of God is at hand.
And that if you plan to get saved
you'd better do it now.
There will be a day
not in the too far distant future
in which Antichrist will be revealed
and the mark of the beast
will be introduced
and people will have a number
in their hand and in their forehead.
They'll be given a computerized number
if you please
that will entice you.






I don't have to do business in this world
and with how you can starve.
We have a lot to do in a very short time.
Boy you aren't kidding.
And that's the way I've felt for quite a while.
Get ready to ease out of orbit.
You bet honey.
That's what we're gonna try to do.
I've never flown a city before.
Well.
What did you think?
I think Bill passed the ten dollar bridge.
The original concept was that
throughout history all great geniuses
had somebody at their side
that was kind of steering them.
You know what I mean?
So you say that person is a sub-genius?
That was the sub-genius.
He was the guy that was really
He was making sure the genius was used
to his proper potential.
Right.
And for the right reasons.

That's why the name is misleading you know.
Now I want you to hear a little of the service
where the Holy Spirit was using me
with the gift of discernment.
I was ministering in the spirit.
God was showing me things about people I didn't know
I'd never seen before but the Lord was talking to me.
God was talking and I was walking.
Listen to a little of this right now.
And you have come to the end of your rope.
Oh.
I don't know which way to turn.
Give me money.
It's starting to affect your nerves.
Give me money.
Give me money.


I'm expecting my mind.
I'm expecting my mind.
I want to kill my husband.
Today we're going to put this in the hand of God.
Kill my husband.
In the Bible in two different places,
a handful of meal brought a miracle.
I want you to hold that envelope open.
Pastor Eppley, save my life.
I'm going to give you a handful.
Save my life.
I'm going to pour it in this envelope.
Ha ha.
Now.

Foolish?
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound,
the subgenius foot doubles as a gland,
and a very complex gland at that.
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?
It treats you the way you need to be treated
by intuiting the world around you
so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond,
and he best explained its functioning
in this excerpt from his daily radio show,
On the Road, so named because it is simply recorded
in a car.
Or money.
Self-worth.
Or money.
To love people because they need it.
Or their money.
I believe it's something God puts in us.
Or what else does God put in us?
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, we could truly know nothing only.
Reinforcing the powers of the brain and foot gland
is a small secondary process.
The brain at the base of the subgenius spine,
the mighty stegosaurus,
also possessed this organ,
which made it tweet like a bird.
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems
that are so important to us.
Another gland unknown to normals
is the peen gland in the brain,
which regulates the eight separate stages
or character generations
through which the subgenius personality evolves
during an average day.
Literally eight different personalities
each have control at the jessie helm
of behavior at varying intervals.
We each contain eight people
in our corrugated, rugated subconsciousness.
The actual average human has but four.
Good, bad, bland, and asleep.
The last thought by some scholars
to overpower the others for up to 18 hours a day.
These different personalities account for the
compartmentalization of the subgenius brain
into eight distinct units or efficiencies
in the descending order of control.
First the left brain, the peen brain,
Of course.
which controls paranoia, anal compulsion,
overwork, trying too hard,
Social sobriety.
and thinking too much.
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain.
It handles jobs and money.
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain,
which covers the gray and limbic areas
of speech, writing, and lying.
Then the hind brain, the me brain,
the pivotal center brain,
the private you rides piggyback on the lord
and is infected by drugs or religion.
Bob comes in on this channel.
Then the forebrain, the sane brain,
which covers love, friendship,
traditional family values called by some the tame brain.
The inner brain or sex brain is self-explanatory.
Finally the right brain or lame brain or more brain
depending on your orientation, intuitive, art, music, drug addiction.
And the eighth brain, the outer brain,
is a pseudo-physical shell,
encasing not only the other brains but the entire body.
This diffuse brain, larger but far less controllable
than the others, is the nenta life.
The nenta life represents fully half of our brain power.
But because it is so independent from us,
we can rarely make use of it.
Occasionally a subgenius comes along
whose nenta life is incorporated into his thinking processes.
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci,
Einstein and Curran.
Or Lee Howard.
For most of us, however, the nenta life is a separate entity,
a semi-conscious ghost twin
which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about
but remains dormant throughout most of our lives.
Thus, for us-
to all beings,
science and fandas,


Great big heaping buckets of holy and pure
Bob the Lord is here
Yeah, we're singing a praise to Bob
Cause he's done a mighty fine job
Cause I'm slopped up and silly
Like a rip headed slob
And all I got to think is Bob
And Ivan Stang
And all I got to think is Bob
And Dr. Doo
And all I got to think is Bob
G. Gorg?
And all I got to think is Bob
And everybody
You can trust me
I'm Dr. Ivan Stang
And I'm prepared to take your money
And give you back your slob
So you can believe in me
I'm Ivan Stang
I never lie
And I'm always right
It extends throughout the rules
And has to do with the
Dying of a Libyan
It has to do with glass paintings
It has to do with
The public evidence
It has to do with
Gilligan's Island
It has to do with
Gary Gervais'
It has to do with
Gary Eklund's
It has to do with

It has to do with
The tip of the luck plane
It has to do with
The gas is over for me
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.
Well, we're coming down,
getting sorta close to the end of the hour there.
And I'm gonna continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy on the radio,
specifically here on the Hour of Slack, a couple of weeks ago.
Now, you have to understand, friends, that being a jerk,
that's my outlet for artistic, I mean, religious expression.
After all, most preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness,
orneriness, corniness,
and a sort of, you know,
posed intolerance.
And I also use stupidity and,
uh, uh, and especially cantankerousness.
I can't really, you know, I can't relax unless I'm being cantankerous
and inflicting my personal bile and spleen on others.
It's hate, dear friends,
and you wouldn't interfere with my right to hate to do my own thing, now would you?
This is a free country.
And besides, how can you, since I'm the one that's transmitting and you're only receiving?
Only receiving, friends,
does that insult you, like last time?
Well, good!
That shows that I'm succeeding in, in, uh, in doing Bob's assignment
of getting you to stop letting the conspiracy,
or even subgenius preachers, push you around.
This obscure church would be the next Inquisition,
where I'm not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness
to be in a continuous state of, not merely defensiveness, but outright rebellion.
And if you let me get any more,
the more abusive I'll have to kill you,
cause you'll deserve it!
It's like, I'm, I'm like an anti-role model.
That's what most subgeni-
all subgeniuses should be, anti-role models.
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang!
You, you mock my total disregard for the, the broadcast niceties.
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?
Have you even got a girlfriend yet, huh?
Oh, I, my jibes have.
But barely begun.
I could, I could rant a paragraph to you
that would have every one of you listeners jumping off a high bridge
to escape the mocking truth wielded by my tongue.
Or Janeer's.
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay.
I was a gentle man at one time.
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon,
then you'd best urinate in fear at the thought of what I could dish out to you.
To the innocent and guilty alike.
For as my mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me,
none are so blind as those who have no eyes.
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyant visions
hath played out but the first move in a galactic game
on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.
Congratulations, dear friends.
You've now entered kindergarten in the School of Terror.
Oh, don't worry. It won't kill you.
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence from decreasing
at the same pace as your peers.
But, uh, but at what cost, dear listener?
At what cost?
At what cost?
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.
Ha! Oh, surprise you, nay.
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.
More than you could ever imagine.
In your wildest LSD dreams.
Fine! Go ahead, kill me!
You would-be Judases and Luthors!
Make your blindingly imbecilic move,
your mere-hume attempt to wrest controls from the claws of this Stang demon you hallucinate.
Death would be but a step up in my ascension to ultimate power.
Next to Bob, of course.
And have you not guessed that certain contingency plans have been laid?
Thinketh you not of the children of the Stang?
Oh, I've read my Frank Herbert closely.
The Atreides conspiracy is but a high school prank
compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang octopus.
Oh, your science fiction has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six
have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens
which will render all your weapons, all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes impotent.
Utterly impotent.
Kill Stang One, and the Emperor Xandar is unchained.
And at that point, you can kiss your world, your human society,
your innocent subgenius church goodbye forever.
Or perhaps, if by some accident of God, the Emperor Xandar were eliminated,
oh, then you would face the Tev One.
And do you think they're my only offspring?
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?
Just as Darth Vader's son Luke was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence,
do you think that I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?
Oh, no indeed, dear friends. No indeedy, I say.
But you'll see.
Well, stay tuned for Ron Lindsey.
You've been listening to King Stang.
Ultimate stud groupie attractor and mystic psychic power monger.
The very left brain of Dobbs.
The chosen bringer, dear friends of terror and lawsuits.
Owner of the trademark of God on Earth.
Slayer of would-be scribe ship usurpers.
Subjector of all bobbies.
Decider of degrees of fame of subgenius mortals.
Second chosen of the fishers of wallets.
Biggest, organed, and sexiest voiced entrapper of radio groupies.
Subduer of hecklers, but splitter of moonies.
Exploiter of comedic idiot savants.
Master of the sardonic over the cute.
Violator of postal...
Oh, forget it.
Anyway, okay, okay, don't rush me. Stop, stop, stop.
Sister Chris asked me to come down here for an experiment.
She asked me to listen to the Church of the Subgenius cassette and, and...
I don't know, she said something like she wanted a normal reaction.
Well, that didn't sound normal to me.
Least of all, it sounded like a church.
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring?
I mean, I could hardly understand what went on there.
I mean, was it, was it meant to be funny or what?
I mean, come on, tell me, is it serious?
Like, you know, do you have to...
Are they telling you to stop listening to Top 40,
give up things like watching Dynasty,
or eating Haagen-Dazs,
or maybe shopping at home from an Esprit catalog?
What? Huh?
What are you trying to say? What is this note?
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas.
With a sign saying,
U.S. Grade A conspiracy dupe across your forehead?
Hey, I don't know what that means,
but, but I don't like your attitude, okay?
I mean, like, just, you, you asked me to come here,
and I mean, why did you even ask me, what?
Just, just sit over there, okay?
You try and experiment down here, and it just doesn't work.
You, you try to...
bring an opposing viewpoint, somewhat of a rebuttal,
and, uh, you never can tell.
This is Sister Chris here. It's 12.33.
It's not 12.33, it's two minutes till midnight.
Four minutes till something like that.
And this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.
And you cannot leave either.
No, we're here.
We're here.
Let's go.
The
Brody Maslow film presents
Ben Franklin, Hero for Hophead!
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me.
But I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside,
so I never felt the touch of a warm naked Indian,
or in a cold, naked forest.
Ben Franklin, the only president of the United States
who was never president of the United States.
Was he an early drug user?
Let's see.
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761
while still an apprentice bookmaker in colonial Philadelphia.
So he took me to the Hashfire Inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads,
rebellious libertines all lusting for life and liberty.
The real George Washington brought the hemp and all the evening traders.
We quickly proceeded to get some of the hurdles
and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the hemp,
which smoked us all like Boston's scrot.
What a fetid fervor of freedom.
I say, let's have a revolution.
It was Larry Sam, the tax collector.
To which Big Ben replied,
Fine, Sam.
Then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.
Yes, 1761.
Hemp kindled the fires of American history.
American history.
American history.
American history.
American history.





Yes, dear friends.
You have been listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry
produced by the Church of the Subgenius.
As I said this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.
Stay tuned for Down Memory Lane with Ron Lindsay
and this is your host, King, Pope Killer Reverend Ivan Stang,
Arbiter of Hipness, Down Putter of Talk Show Hosts,
Arbiter of Hipness, Down Putter of Talk Show Hosts,
in my mighty glibness,
son of the king of bull shatterers,
he who hath been copied
by David Byrne and Garrison Keillor,
payer of royalty checks
to tight-running buddies,
contract signer of all paying
subgenius projects,
president of the corporation
of all Dobbs PR,
48% owner of the Janer tongue,
first interpreter of the dogma,
enrager of pinks
and lesser subgeniuses alike,
living embodiment of hate,
slack under Dobbs,
keeper of the original Dobbs image,
carrot dangler of long-promised magazines,
and returner of compliments.
You faithless.
You faithless.
You faithless.
You faithless.
You faithless.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
This is Li Liqing,
a Chinese subgenius.
And you are listening to the hour of slack.
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.
He is a China,
just like in America.
And people need slack.
In Chinese,
we call slack
loon,
impact. It must be true slack, not the best slack. Help me somebody. Thank you, Lily Jing.
Yes, my friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight. Ivan Stang himself, the grand
auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith, who has every subgenius's name on his
special basement computer, and he's here tonight to make the hour and a half of slack seem
like, well, like forever. Ah, yes, dear friends, so good to be here. Say it, Ivan, say it.
Feeling the power. In this hideous, hideous place. Bob lives, friends. Bob lives. Don't
let him tell you otherwise. He ain't dead. Oh, what is this? I should know. I'm the guy
that has to read sooner or later.
All the mail that comes to that T.O. box that you probably thought was just made up.
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff
and management of this radio station, the other staff, the relations and spouses of
the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and staff.
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.
He's dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes. These deadlights looked
like a
dead light.
I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, that just because, just because there's a
Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily, I mean, can Bob really die? I'd say yes, Ivan, and
I think you better grow up and face the, face the sick truth that this Bobby isn't necessarily
everything that you say he is.
