00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,240
Remember.

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,200
Alumni難 reiterate

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,200


7
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,620
Remember.

8
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,620

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,620


10
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,620


11
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,620


12
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,660
Remember.

13
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:08,660


14
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,760
We're sitting together

15
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,000
listening to this.

16
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,860
This is great.

17
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:11,900


18
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,960
Listening to them listening to them

19
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,480
Remember.

20
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:16,480


21
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,680
We're all sitting together.

22
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,640
We're sitting together.

23
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,100
Listening to this.

24
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,940
This is crazy.

25
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,700
Remember.

26
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:24,880
Remember

27
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,100
This is pleasing.

28
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,720
Remember.

29
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,460
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

30
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,580
This is pleasing to...

31
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,080
And this was pleasing to God.

32
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,740
To God.

33
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,020
What time is it, Tevis?

34
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,460
It's Bob time.

35
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,880
Time for the hour of slack.

36
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,360
Tevis, you know that you're not supposed to be watching the hour of slack

37
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,460
because it's too weird for you.

38
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,320
Uh-uh.

39
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,700
Oh, yeah, I'll prove it.

40
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,820
Right, Daddy.

41
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,660
Huh? What?

42
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,700
Right, she's not supposed to see the hour of slack.

43
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,060
Oh, Tevis is just as weird as the hour of slack, aren't you, Tev?

44
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,780
Yeah.

45
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,420
Hey.

46
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,380
Mr. Smith is a good white man.

47
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
A good white man.

48
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,660
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

49
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,880
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

50
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,640
Mr. Smith.

51
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,280
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

52
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,740
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

53
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,140
Mr. Smith.

54
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,340
Mr. Smith.

55
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,200
The lid's off.

56
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,100
It's gonna be louder beyond Ontario than it's gonna be here.

57
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,540
Those sounds...

58
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,760
Sarah, beware.

59
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,220
Now, we are ready to begin the story,

60
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,860
Invasion of...

61
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,360
Gal Island.

62
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,060
Ben!

63
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,680
Get up off that chair!

64
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,720
Follow me!

65
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,900
Ready?

66
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,200
Go!

67
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
The subgenius hour of slack!

68
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,360
I have reordered time.

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,500
I have turned the world upside down,

70
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,800
and I have done it all for you.

71
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,340
It's a wildfire.

72
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,320
I see people all around me changing faces.

73
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,020
It's a wildfire.

74
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,380
I'm doing things that haven't got a name yet.

75
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Come with me now,

76
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,980
as together,

77
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,560
we relive a dangerous adventure in our planet's history.

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,420
Mark the tale well,

79
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,700
and take heed.

80
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,520
There is much to learn.

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,740
Our planets are alike in many ways.

82
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,440
What happened to us could happen to you.

83
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,460
Listen well, children of Earth.

84
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:05,880
And all Ç Blend with Single That.

85
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:14,360
Beyond breaking the law,

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,060
come on, let's build the absolute course come together.

87
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,060

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,160


92
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,680
So bring the crimson professional from others and

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:15,680


94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:15,680


95
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:15,680


96
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:15,680

102
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,660
Batha.

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,640
guitar solo

104
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,240
It's a wild, wild time

105
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,480
It's a wild, wild time

106
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,040
It's a wild, wild time

107
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,140
And I say it now all the time

108
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,040
I'm here for you any old time

109
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,920
Oh, lady, lady

110
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,560
Make a friend for yourself here

111
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,440
Bob is all around you

112
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Bob is beneath your feet even now

113
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,440
Bob is ramping over your head even now

114
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,080
When you reach out your hand, it is Bob's hand that reaches

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,540
When you smoke that pipe, it is Bob that smokes through you

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,920
We are all a part of Bob, and we hate it

117
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,940
We can't wait to kill him for the last time

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,860
On the entrance ramp to the saucers

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,540
We shall slick it with his blood and grease it with his fat

120
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,740
And go sliding into paradise

121
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,720
Praise Bob

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,680
All around me are changes

123
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,420
It's a wild, wild time

124
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,600
It's a wild, wild time

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,400
It's a wild, wild time

126
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,240
The original words are still true

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,180
A useless object made useful

128
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,040
With end

129
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,300
With end

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,300


131
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,520
With end

132
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


133
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


134
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


135
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


136
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


137
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


138
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


139
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


140
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520


141
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,660
With end

142
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,860
The world ends this July

143
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,860
With end

144
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,940
They die

145
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,640
There is one thing that puzzled me about this

146
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,700
When a spectator pushed the button

147
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,580
He electric bell did not ring

148
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,420
He electric bell did not ring

149
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,760
That makes it a work of art

150
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,520
And that makes my heart beat hard

151
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,520


152
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,520


153
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,520


154
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,520


155
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,520


156
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,060
What I always wanted to be accepted, not understood.

157
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,200
But there was one, but there was one thing that hustled me about it.

158
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,940
Smith is taking a swag.

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,580
We love you, dear friends.

160
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,100
Hey, that new church air is just great.

161
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,240
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

162
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,920
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church that is so important to us.

163
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,880
It's a church that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

164
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,260
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

165
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,160
Tom Vitale has this report.

166
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,240
You will pay to know what you really think.

167
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

168
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,200
And not only have you paid to know what you really think,

169
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,000
but once you will get value for your dollar.

170
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,600
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

171
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,900
That's the message.

172
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,480
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius.

173
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,620
They have a very perverted view.

174
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,720
You know, we're just animals.

175
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,240
They have a very perverted view.

176
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,220
The Darwin theory, you know, we're just animals.

177
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
If you're involved in bestiality, that is okay.

178
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,220
It doesn't mean you're a monster.

179
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,440
Just don't tell anybody.

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,740
Or you're going to be ridiculed.

181
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,640
What's it seem to a dog?

182
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Too hot, too hot.

183
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,560
To kill, to kill.

184
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,080
Star, star.

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,860
To wrap, to wrap.

186
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,100
This mission is too important.

187
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
I'm about to jeopardize it.

188
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,660
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
The marvelous show today, folks.

190
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,140
Our very special guest is loved and admired the world over

191
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,820
as a fine performer and a great humanitarian.

192
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,380
Please welcome one of America's oldest and most respected kids,

193
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,580
Ivan Stang.

194
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,720
Besides balancing with Mike.

195
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,700
Senator, do you care to cross-examine now?

196
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,100
Yes, I'd like to cross-examine him now.

197
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,800
Mr. Stang here.

198
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,360
When you sold these hydrogen devices,

199
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:42,960
I did my right.

200
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,300
The Malesians, were you aware that that was a taxpayers' property?

201
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,200
Listen, those Malesians are fighting against freedom

202
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,680
every bit as hard as the Church of the Subgenius.

203
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,620
And on top of that, these people can't be expected to protect

204
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,840
the Dobstown investment out there in the jungles

205
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,880
from the nearby hostile, fiendishly clever savages.

206
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,440
You must refer to the ucabalaponga.

207
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,420
Yes.

208
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,680
Okay, fiend.

209
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
they are. Very popular with this order.

210
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,480
They hate

211
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,300
the word mob.

212
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,060
Where's the missing money?

213
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,360
Well, you see, these freedom fighters, or

214
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,620
uka balapongas, ukas as we call them,

215
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,360
have used it all up.

216
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,680
They've fought freedom all over the world, and

217
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,260
that's not a cheap

218
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,760
prospect you're looking at there.

219
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,480
Now, I offer this document

220
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
in evidence, an

221
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,520
article from the Arizona Daily Star

222
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,740
entitled, You Could Lose Your Blues at

223
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,900
that Toddlin' Tucson Bar that's known as

224
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,260
Bob Dobbs.

225
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,660
It appears that this bar, which

226
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,460
has taken the name of Bob Dobbs, is

227
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,660
an utter warren of normals and

228
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,560
pinks of the worst stripe who talk about

229
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,040
sports and wear bill caps

230
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
and drink beer. What do you have to say about

231
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,620
this obvious betrayal of

232
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,140
the trust of your many followers?

233
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Look, Bob gets a penny for every time his

234
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
face is Xeroxed, and he doesn't care

235
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,440
whether that Xerox ends up

236
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,480
on the wing of a Russian fighter

237
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,860
or if it's on a

238
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,820
nice old granny's

239
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,440
wheelchair.

240
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,400
That's right.

241
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,940
But. Or. And.

242
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,900
And it is a big but.

243
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,020
No ifs about it.

244
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,920
I mean, look,

245
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,060
you can't run a church

246
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,000
on air. This is

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,100
a world outreach. We're fighting poverty

248
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,720
and free thought everywhere

249
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,260
all over the world. So you feel justified

250
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,060
as a private citizen into

251
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,880
pushing your particular line?

252
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, the, uh... Is that

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
what I'm...

254
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,680
You want him to understand?

255
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,500
As Bob said, the ends always

256
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,880
justif... more than justify the means

257
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
in every situation. And too much

258
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
is always better than not enough.

259
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,760
And if, uh, if you want to step on my...

260
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,020
I have... I've read the Constitution.

261
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,140
I know what the... what the rights

262
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,100
of religious subgeniuses are.

263
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,960
If we want to sell what you call

264
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,900
nuclear weapons, these are stage

265
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,500
props for us, uh,

266
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,140
to small, uh, countries.

267
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,260
And, uh, that is our prerogative.

268
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,520
Get left here and don't leave!

269
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,120
Nobody's gonna have a break!

270
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,920
Bob preaches that you have to believe

271
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,420
in everything, and especially,

272
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,000
um, you have to believe in

273
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,280
the... the God that tells you not to believe in him

274
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
because he doesn't want you to know

275
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,640
what he's been doing to you.

276
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,840
He wants me to take you to him.

277
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,080
Drink down the fluid now,

278
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,740
and even then you'll go to the next stage.

279
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,060
... phase two.

280
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,060
For the Honky and Jimmy show,

281
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,300
please return to the regular channel version

282
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,260
enclosed in the network box.

283
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm gonna blow my head off.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
You're not going to.

285
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,800
You're not the kind.

286
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,900
Uh, we better back off here

287
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,200
and, uh, think about Jim and you.

288
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,620
This would have been something

289
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,560
totally unpracticed.

290
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
Pretty much on the, uh,

291
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,440
on the cutting edge of, uh,

292
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,600
of a risky operation, to say the least.

293
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,980
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

294
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,160
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

295
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,480
Oh, there's one more gone.

296
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,080
We can still carry on.

297
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,780
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

298
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,640
I would love to believe that there was a God

299
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,920
who made us, who's looking out for us.

300
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,560
And loves us.

301
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,380
And loves us.

302
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,620
And takes care of us.

303
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,420
And...

304
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,700
And guides us.

305
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
And teaches us.

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,680
And because we're in such a mess,

307
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,840
we're doing things that are wrong.

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,140
Then we would be relieved of the responsibility

309
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,240
of taking care of ourselves.

310
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,620
And a voice would come from up above and say...

311
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,340
Build your own ships.

312
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,720
The cosmos.

313
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,900
Countless worlds upon worlds.

314
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,220
Worlds without end.

315
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,440
In these galaxies,

316
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,660
every possible reality exists.

317
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,220
And what is reality on any one world

318
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,820
is mere fantasy on all others.

319
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,340
Here, all is real

320
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,060
and all is illusion.

321
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,580
What is, what was,

322
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,860
and what will be,

323
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,180
start here with the words...

324
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,620
Bob?

325
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,540
Bob?

326
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,580
The message is now part of and registered

327
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,400
in your subconscious mind.

328
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,200
Stop.

329
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,280
Stop.

330
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
The blank of the healing earth.

331
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,660
So the healing earth will...

332
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,960
will heal now.

333
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
Well, I guess, Chaz,

334
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,620
you may have been right all along.

335
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,580
We may have to...

336
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,820
We...

337
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't think we have to build our own ships.

338
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,980
We may have to build our own ships.

339
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,460
But we should go ahead and start.

340
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:39,980
Yeah.

341
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,760
Maybe draw a plan for our...

342
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
At least it'll give us a goal,

343
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,020
you know, something to do before we,

344
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,740
you know, hit.

345
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll be working on my plan

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,400
for years.

347
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,980
Now, Nostradamus said that...

348
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,700
that X-Day would happen on July 5th

349
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,980
at 7 a.m., 1999.

350
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,500
I don't know if you were aware of that.

351
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,020
Yeah.

352
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,520
Edgar Cayce agreed with Dobbs

353
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,240
that it was 98,

354
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,040
but Nostradamus has been saying

355
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,380
it was that date on 1999

356
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,800
for a long time now.

357
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,880
So the Dos Equis next year...

358
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,460
Oh, give me one of them.

359
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,360
...may very well be...

360
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,440
Coldwell, please.

361
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,560
But if they do not arrive on Dobs,

362
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,400
then on Triple X Day.

363
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,760
The triple X Day.

364
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,160
The sex goddesses will be even sexier.

365
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,720
The year zero.

366
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,160
But what happens if they arrive

367
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,800
in the century?

368
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,840
What happens if they arrive

369
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,560
in Tecate or...

370
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,320
Oh, sweet Mary, child of confusion,

371
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,100
she runs the hills to cry.

372
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,100
Has the willows or an illusion?

373
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,200
Oh, tell me the reason why.

374
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,760
Tell me why, why's it all so hard?

375
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,720
Breathing in the air

376
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,820
Breathing in the air

377
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Be one to him

378
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,020
Yeah!

379
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,360
Yeah!

380
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,840
Yes, dear friends.

381
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,640
Dear, dear.

382
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,100
Dear friends, where am I?

383
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,160
Where am I?

384
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,740
Where am I?

385
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,140
What?

386
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
In the background here, believe it or not,

387
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,400
Janice Joplin with Big Brother and the Holden Company.

388
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,640
Oh, sweet Mary.

389
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,900
From back in the day, friends.

390
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,360
That's what they used to mean by the day.

391
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,980
Just for some reason it seemed appropriate.

392
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,420
And, yeah.

393
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,760
And what have we been listening to, dear friends?

394
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,340
Wake up, Stan.

395
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,800
Oh, God.

396
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,940
Friends, I'm doing this one late.

397
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,340
Late at night, but I'm struggling on.

398
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,160
From the top, a little bit of Silica Joe, because we remember.

399
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,300
And I'm running some old tapes from Hour of Slack number 79 and 80.

400
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,640
The music you're hearing in the background is Einstein's Secret Orchestra live at the X-Day Space Jam.

401
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,340
You heard Bob is All Around You.

402
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,980
That was Friday Jones with Jefferson Airplane.

403
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,320
And Bleepo Abernathy's Subjection.

404
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,720
Genius Collage.

405
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,180
A lot of Media Barrage.

406
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,840
And then a little bit of NPR Radio, Ancient Subgenius Report.

407
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,380
Bits from the old Media Barrage 10.

408
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Volume 6 and Volume 7 clips from Chaz Smith's Einstein's Secret Orchestra Slack Chats.

409
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,040
And KPFA, Berkeley, with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

410
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,920
And in this case, Palmer Freedies in the Stang Scam Investigations on the Senate floor.

411
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,080
Old Media Barrage stuff.

412
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,260
And Galaxies and Galaxies.

413
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,320
G. Gordon Gordon.

414
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,140
And the Endlessness of the...

415
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,960
And friends!

416
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, dear friends, because you know something as next day draws ever closer.

417
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,500
I find myself not knowing sometimes whether I'm talking to you, listening by radio,

418
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,820
or typing to the internet subgenii on alt.slack,

419
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,860
or torturing the little fuzzy...

420
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,460
or the genius bunnies in the animal outreach where we communicate via animal testing,

421
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,440
or try to, friends.

422
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,680
About one out of every hundred bunnies manages to actually vocalize the phrase,

423
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,760
Praise Bob!

424
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,480
Or a scream that sounds very similar to that phrase.

425
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:30,260
Friends, this church is so multimedia, I sometimes get confused whether I'm shouting to rows of parishioners

426
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,800
in the pews of a nightclub,

427
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,120
stinking of beer,

428
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,180
or if I'm just ensconced on my...

429
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,440
throne of extra meditation,

430
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,620
and simply imagining that I'm at a devival.

431
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,340
A high-paying devival.

432
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,160
And there's one coming up, friends.

433
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,900
A devival!

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,100
At Euclid Cavern in Cleveland,

435
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,160
on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland,

436
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
November 8th, Sunday,

437
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,640
Sunday, Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

438
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,380
myself and who knows what all else,

439
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,060
and I just got back from a thing in Denver,

440
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,580
at the most oddball of cons,

441
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,500
the Death Equinox 98 convergence of weirdos,

442
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,220
uh,

443
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,420
it kind of reminded me of the Phenomicon in Atlanta,

444
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,780
because it was kind of like a science fiction convention,

445
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
except that instead of S-F, it was S and M,

446
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,540
and some of what they were talking about was real,

447
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,820
while seeming kind of like science fiction,

448
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,500
you know, conspiracies, mass murder, and sadomasochistic bondage and discipline.

449
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:35,020
I had never been friends to a party where people sat around poking fine needles into their flesh,

450
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,320
in neat little rows, and...

451
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,880
and designed for yucks and grins!

452
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,620
This is what they do for fun, friends.

453
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,600
And, uh, that was just the afternoon, after-hours parties.

454
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,620
You should have seen the seminars on that stuff.

455
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,120
I had a great time, met a whole new tribe of mutants I had not been aware of,

456
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,640
the Cyberpsychos of Colorado,

457
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,280
and this will benefit all mutantdom,

458
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,760
as it does whenever new, broken, and self-invented genes are added to the admixture in the VAT!

459
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,700
Friends, this convention was so cool,

460
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,340
they had a panel on prairie squid,

461
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,400
and a religion of jellyfish, and, uh,

462
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,980
friends, but of especial interest to the Hour of Slack listeners,

463
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,280
we discovered a great, simply fantabulbous musical combo,

464
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,860
called Little Theodore and Babushka,

465
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,340
this is the lightest bastard child of Devoe, you might say, friends,

466
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,820
in league with Negative Land, in fact, they toured with Negative Land,

467
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,040
or Duke of Uke, or the Swingin' Love Corpses,

468
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,880
or so many other great purveyors of spaz, spaz nerd jazz rock,

469
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,840
like all those bizarro bands that open up for us on our tours.

470
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Um, spaz music of macho irony, dear friends, um, I suppose you could call it,

471
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,800
and what really struck me was that this little Theodore guy,

472
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,060
this singer, who I'll be playing very soon here,

473
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,580
dresses exactly like Jayner Hyperclete's Goodwill, uh, Loud style,

474
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,660
and kind of looks like,

475
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,700
lonesome cowboy Dave crossed with me,

476
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,860
crossed with Larry Fine of the Three Stooges,

477
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,940
and I, I just wish you could see the videotapes of this band,

478
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,760
these people spaz out better than any spaz dancers I've ever seen,

479
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,920
the lyrics are among the most simultaneously gut-wrenchingly funny and horrific,

480
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,520
that, um, and, uh, friends, they will be your instant heroes,

481
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,140
um, uh, and, uh, I've recorded portions of their live concert,

482
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,160
and I also got their CD, and I think you'll be able to tell which is which,

483
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,740
this is, um, friends, stay tuned here for,

484
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,560
Dropout ESO,

485
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,920
Little Theodore,

486
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,840
and Babushka.

487
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,880
.

488
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,660
.

489
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,580
.

490
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,760
.

491
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:20,780
.

492
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,800
.

493
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,460
.

494
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,580
.

495
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,380
.

496
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,780
.

497
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,380
.

498
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,400
.

499
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,420
.

500
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,900
I'm not ejingo

501
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,120
Get out of my head

502
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,480
Get out of my head

503
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,740
Get out of my head

504
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,980
I'm not ejingo

505
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,260
Get out of my head

506
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,640
Get out of my head

507
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,620
Meow, meow, meow, meow

508
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,580
Sometimes you feel like 9

509
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,600
You can dance out in the ground

510
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:20,900
My, my

511
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,680
You can dance out in the ground

512
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,420
Get out of my head

513
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,660
Even swords they like

514
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,940
Get out of my head

515
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,220
Get out of my head

516
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,440
Get out of my head

517
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,740
Even swords they like

518
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,080
Get out of my head

519
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,120
Get out of my head

520
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,320
Drinking, drinking, drowsing, copulating, squabbling over nothing.

521
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,280
We may divert our attention from the inevitable for a little while,

522
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,620
but let's be so that right away to transcend this curse of being human,

523
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,240
which is highly, very unlikely, and clearly, painfully obvious

524
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,680
that we're all doomed! All doomed! All doomed!

525
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,400
All doomed! All doomed!

526
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,740
All doomed! All doomed!

527
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,960
Who is that?

528
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Who

529
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,480
Thanks, babe.

530
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
I make people like me then I turn away.

531
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,240
I make people hate me then I get in their way.

532
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm always making jokes when there's business at hand.

533
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,740
Then I rope around at parties and a tennis I bet.

534
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,000
Thanks, babe.

535
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,440
Thanks, babe.

536
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:15,820


537
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,380
Who needs me?

538
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,960
Who needs me?

539
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,540
I never really care when people got nerves.

540
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,740
And I don't know what to say when they tell me their flares.

541
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,020
I'm only in the way when there's important stuff to say.

542
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,260
But people never ask me favors because I'm luckier than you.

543
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Who needs me?

544
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,320
Who needs me?

545
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,800
Who needs me?

546
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
Who needs me?

547
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,000
Who needs me?

548
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,420
Who needs me?

549
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,180
I don't have good advice on what movies you should see.

550
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,340
And I don't have favorite actors.

551
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,360
They're all millionaires to me.

552
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,660
I never dress correctly when it's time to go out.

553
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,760
So just leave me here at home.

554
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,880
Let me decide what life's about.

555
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,900
Who needs me?

556
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,660
I'm qualified!

557
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,440
You give me heart on

558
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,920
You make me grow

559
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,880
You make me imagine

560
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
All that I know

561
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,260
You make my blood run

562
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,040
You make me howl

563
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,760
You make my thoughts turn

564
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,220
A ringing sound

565
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,840
You make me chill

566
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,720
You make me die

567
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,420
You open me up

568
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,060
And you watch me die

569
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,520
You give me heart on

570
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,020
You make me cry

571
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,980
I watch the day out

572
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,360
Falling in cry

573
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,220
You make me go in

574
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,760
You make me fall

575
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,620
You make me started

576
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,240
That's a good call

577
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,820
That's a rhythm

578
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,640
To my pipe

579
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,260
Because I'm ready

580
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,940
You got a type

581
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,480
You sound flavour

582
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,480


583
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,480


584
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,480


585
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,480


586
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,480


587
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,220
That I need it

588
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,180
I know what you do

589
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,780
I think you try

590
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,140
You see the day

591
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
I hope it's true

592
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,620
When the sun goes down

593
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:00,620


594
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,780
All my exactly

595
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,060
Because this is true

596
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,740
Love

597
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,240
I don't know what to do.

598
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,300
I don't know what to do.

599
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,340
I've been turned round in circles

600
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,060
7 sunny days before.

601
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,700
I lift my ten-toed steps in a row

602
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm walking through the wall.

603
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,220
I don't know what to do.

604
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,220
I don't know what to do.

605
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,500
I don't know what to do.

606
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,280
I don't know what to do.

607
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,400
I don't know what to do.

608
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,320
I don't know what to do.

609
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,300
I don't know what to do!

610
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,500
I don't know what to do!

611
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,640
Little Theodore will be right back.

612
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,100
I just sit here watching squirrels.

613
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,940
They have much more fun than me.

614
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,740
Sometimes they run around all day in circles.

615
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,260
They fight and squabble then they lick their wounds.

616
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,120
At least they seem to have a purpose.

617
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,860
My mind's always clogged with leaves.

618
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Like silly stupid advertising jingles.

619
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,120
And themes from TV shows I do not like.

620
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,400
I must not go out the front door.

621
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,680
I could get hit by a car.

622
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,580
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling.

623
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,940
There's perfect safety high up in the tree.

624
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,960
I know I'm bad to just sit here.

625
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,720
I should not be so scared.

626
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:34,720


627
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,160
I'm so afraid.

628
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,960
But once outside I'd have to choose a direction.

629
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,640
It might be the wrong one so I'll stay here.

630
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,660
They tell me of self improvement.

631
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,520
And someday I could even have a job.

632
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,360
Then I would have become just like the squirrels.

633
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,480
I don't see how I could accomplish that.

634
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,260
First I'd have to choose a direction.

635
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,800
Like which tree I should start to climb.

636
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,620
They all seem to be up to the challenge.

637
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,980
I just take whatever's given me.

638
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,360
I'm not a crazy person.

639
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,360


640
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,360


641
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,520
So I'm OK here just watching squirrels.

642
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,500
Though the soundtrack could be much improved.

643
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,640
Those silly stupid advertising jingles.

644
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,200
And themes from TV shows I do not like.

645
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,540
Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa la.

646
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,300
Thank you.

647
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,940
Thank you.

648
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,380
Thank you.

649
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,720
Thank you.

650
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
Thank you.

651
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,040
Thank you.

652
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,360
And dear friends, we're speaking here from the Subgenius Foundation.

653
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,900
Post Office Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

654
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,980
Order today.

655
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,140
Imagine that.

656
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,420
Around that time period, around the Civil War in America,

657
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,160
the best that the military had to offer were cannons.

658
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,460
Now, cannons could kill a handful of people

659
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,520
if you hit them.

660
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
Hit it right in the crowd.

661
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
And that was the best of the technology

662
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,740
just a little over 100 years ago.

663
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
Then, then, we take the next step up.

664
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,200
What's that?

665
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,520
World War I, we had bigger bombs.

666
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,000
We had bombs that could kill people in a whole building.

667
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,920
And in World War II, we had blockbusters.

668
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,240
And blockbusters could destroy a whole city block, man.

669
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,720
And then after World War II, we developed the atom bomb, man.

670
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,800
During World War II, we killed people.

671
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,780
Hey, we could kill a whole city with one bomb.

672
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,980
And then we went to thermonuclear bombs

673
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,420
where you can wipe out the whole seaboard with one bomb.

674
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,860
And then we learned how to make individual bombs for individual people.

675
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,480
That's right.

676
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,960
Everyone will be born with a bomb attached to the brain stem.

677
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,840
Each fission fusion device is fully licensed and guaranteed

678
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,520
and may only be used once.

679
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,020
Once by the previous owner.

680
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,980
And there'll be no fighting in the battlefield.

681
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,000
You just go run out into the field

682
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,980
and the computer will decide if your head gets blown off or not.

683
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,500
Or if its head gets blown off.

684
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,400
It's all statistical.

685
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,160
That's the future.

686
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,220
That's the future of the war machine.

687
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,520
That's the future of the capitalist war machine.

688
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,220
Bomb, man. Bomb.

689
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,140
We must turn away people.

690
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,960
We must.

691
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,340
We must.

692
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,540
I feel like one little solitary teardrop

693
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,680
landed in my lap and now a whole river of tears

694
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,300
Let me wipe that teardrop away

695
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,540
with this baseball bat.

696
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,180
I'm drenched in sweat.

697
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,460
And as Alice swam.

698
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,200
Pazuzu's coming in the back door.

699
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,260
I can smell it.

700
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,460
Alice swam up behind her.

701
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,140
Hickling her.

702
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,700
That's what you said.

703
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,380
Nuzzling her underneath her pretty little frilly dress.

704
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,300
No, no, no, no.

705
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,880
With her little animal noses.

706
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,580
Making her giggle and shiver in the water.

707
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,300
Yes.

708
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes.

709
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,540
Alice enjoyed the feeling.

710
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,480
Oh, wait.

711
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,900
Now that was the other Alice in Wonderland.

712
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,280
I'm sorry.

713
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,600
What did you say?

714
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,180
Connie in Wonderland.

715
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,040
Connie and Bob.

716
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,540
Bob, not.

717
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,180
Bonnie in Wonderland.

718
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,740
Bob and Connie and Ted and Alice.

719
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,400
Yeah.

720
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,020
They were going.

721
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,800
I love that 60s porno, you know, Lewis Carroll thing.

722
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,180
And Peter.

723
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,040
Yeah, five people in a bed.

724
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,760
Yeah.

725
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,720
Each of like, you know, really strange looking people

726
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,260
with huge handlebar mustaches.

727
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,940
And like large, large ears.

728
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,480
Which was the most erotic part to me, baby.

729
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:07,980
I'll tell you.

730
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,440
Right, right.

731
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,680
And the men also had enormous breasts in those movies.

732
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,060
I mean, could you beat something like that, man,

733
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,940
if you wanted to with a stick or, you know?

734
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,820
Oh, yeah.

735
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, they don't make them like that anymore.

736
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,980
No, they don't make guys like that anymore.

737
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,540
You know what I mean?

738
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,900
They never made them like that.

739
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,180
Oh, come on, man.

740
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,660
Anymore.

741
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,300
Don't.

742
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,960
Tell me you've never tried a delicious young voluptuous.

743
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,980
They only make them like that in the future.

744
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,400
The future past.

745
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,660
You have to cast yourself up to it.

746
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,360
Oh, we have to the future past?

747
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,980
Yes, the future past.

748
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,920
It's kind of like Sunday page.

749
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,020
I got one.

750
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,580
I got one.

751
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,940
It's fun streaming here.

752
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,440
I got him.

753
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,860
I got him.

754
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,480
It's like fishing for squid, it is.

755
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:47,900
Oh, boy.

756
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,400
Oh, boy.

757
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,380
Hey, look at that.

758
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,180
I got a live one.

759
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,740
I've never heard of a live one.

760
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,600
Which future is this?

761
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,900
I can't identify it.

762
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,260
Quick, look in the future book.

763
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,900
It looks like it's the future.

764
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,580
Man, you're going too slow, man.

765
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:00,800
Watch it.

766
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,680
The wires are going to break.

767
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,740
You can't hit the future books.

768
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,460
You got to go.

769
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,560
Make sure you don't break the wiring there.

770
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,940
It's very tender stuff.

771
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,040
They don't use a lot of solder.

772
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,120
They don't use any of the pictures, though.

773
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,380
Oh, spin them around.

774
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,360
Oh, there.

775
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:12,920
There.

776
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,460
There.

777
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,540
It looks kind of like that one there.

778
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,020
Yes.

779
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,060
Okay, now that looks like I can make that out almost.

780
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,640
It's yellow.

781
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,280
Why is it yellow?

782
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,540
Is it supposed to be yellow?

783
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,340
Yeah, in the picture, it's red.

784
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,200
That means it's infected.

785
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,980
Why is that?

786
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,100
That means it's infected.

787
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,060
You have to go get a shot.

788
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,500
Am I seeing the wrong thing or right or what?

789
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,860
But it's breathing normally.

790
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,760
I don't think it's infected.

791
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,700
I think it's just another species.

792
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Mine's breathing real fast.

793
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,400
Are we seeing the same thing?

794
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,240
Mine's like yellow when it's breathing.

795
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,460
Well, your future is slightly different from my future because, you know, you're over there

796
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,220
and I'm over here.

797
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,780
So you're all red, but you're breathing normally.

798
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,600
I'm yellow, but I'm breathing fast.

799
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,440
Right.

800
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,100
So like over here, if a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil, it affects us.

801
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Over where you are, like a bird has to flap its wings in Brazil to affect you.

802
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:57,980
Oh, man.

803
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,380
Talk about your dimensional variances, boy.

804
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,220
We just, well, okay, now at least we've got something that has a color.

805
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,300
And it's vibrating and it's also breathing at a certain rate.

806
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,940
What mine right now, it looks like it's very frustrated.

807
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,560
It's trying to get out of the box I got it in.

808
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,020
I like the glimmery part.

809
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,060
Mm, yeah.

810
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,960
So you don't get that in the food that you get here.

811
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
Look at it glimmer.

812
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,480
Mm.

813
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,820
Oh, it's beautiful.

814
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,520
Oh, it is.

815
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,660
Oh, guys.

816
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,700
It's like a star within a star.

817
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,900
Oh, it's the prettiest thing I ever saw.

818
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
My leg's getting wet.

819
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,980
It's like, it's beautiful like wood, but it wants to make me cry.

820
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
It's lighting up from inside.

821
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,420
Oh.

822
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,420
It's lighting up from inside.

823
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,600
A curious, green, glowing light.

824
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,060
It's the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

825
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,220
Go into it, man.

826
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,240
Okay.

827
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,940
Little, little, little.

828
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,400
Step in.

829
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,500
Sunglasses are going around my leg.

830
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:47,540
Let's go.

831
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,760
Come on, guys.

832
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,660
Let's go.

833
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,380
Let's go.

834
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,220
Wait a minute.

835
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,340
I don't, I'm not.

836
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,420
Oh, it's wonderful inside of here.

837
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,520
This is the best thing that's ever happened.

838
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,200
It's wonderful.

839
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,760
I'm like one of the president people.

840
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,980
I'm going through a crisis right now.

841
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,360
I don't ever want to go back.

842
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,200
Come on, Dave.

843
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,720
It's too late.

844
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,280
I missed it.

845
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,780
Let go of the negativity, baby.

846
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,360
Damn.

847
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,140
It was a groovy scene where it's at.

848
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,040
You can still see it?

849
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,980
Oh, yeah.

850
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,660
Oh, man.

851
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm just getting glimmers.

852
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,360
Wait a minute.

853
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,800
Now it looks like a stupid silver ball.

854
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,800
It's shimmering and glimmering more better than ever.

855
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,780
It's coming back.

856
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,780
It's coming back.

857
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,560
No, wait.

858
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,400
Oh, yes.

859
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,100
It's coming back.

860
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,740
And it is.

861
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,780
It's everyone's future.

862
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,200
Oh, wow.

863
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,300
It's everyone's past.

864
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,520
It's the whole future of the human race.

865
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,760
And they didn't tell us this was going to happen.

866
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,060
It's all the love and all the hate of the whole human race.

867
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,360
Hey, you guys.

868
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,940
Oh, and everybody's caught up with everyone else.

869
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,520
Look at that.

870
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,620
Yes, and love is reigning supreme.

871
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,280
People are walking around holding each other's hands.

872
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,880
And they're getting slapped.

873
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,200
Wait.

874
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,520
Oh, and they're sucking on each other's feet.

875
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,120
Look at that.

876
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,500
Oh, my God.

877
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,120
What's happening?

878
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,120
Oh, it's wonderful.

879
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,180
Oh, and it feels so good.

880
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,740
Look at that.

881
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,080
It's like we're going underwater.

882
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,340
We're going under the ocean.

883
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,320
Oh, man.

884
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,760
Oh, man.

885
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,440
Wow, look at that.

886
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,660
They're all turning into the ocean.

887
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,540
Look at the dolphins.

888
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,460
Their brains are getting bigger.

889
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,880
Their heads are getting bigger.

890
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,900
They're all dolphins.

891
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,060
They don't have to breathe underwater.

892
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,860
Look at them.

893
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,980
Oh, my God.

894
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,840
They're so happy.

895
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,700
Their skin is golden.

896
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,940
Oh, sweet baby.

897
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,920
And it's silver.

898
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,560
And it's all the colors.

899
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,180
It's rose.

900
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,600
It's orange.

901
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,600
It's creamy, peachy pink.

902
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,420
I'm digging, man.

903
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,220
I'm digging it.

904
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,720
Oh, my other leg's wet now.

905
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,160
Oh.

906
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,920
Yummy Etruscan brown.

907
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,300
Oh, Etruscan brown.

908
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,960
Oh, I just want to stay here for a while.

909
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,640
We're time traveling.

910
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,280
We don't have to leave, do we?

911
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,420
I mean, it's only cool in the third century B.C.

912
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,340
I'm melting.

913
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,940
And they're putting Scythian hemperonis on my forehead.

914
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,900
I don't care if there's hair around it.

915
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,340
Come on.

916
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,220
Let's keep going in.

917
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:48,560
Uh-huh.

918
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,220
Let's go.

919
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,360
Hey, wait a minute.

920
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,560
It's not really hair, is it?

921
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:53,820
It's...

922
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,780
Come on.

923
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,160
Farther up and further in.

924
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,960
I think we're missing that spot.

925
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,720
We were going to stop.

926
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,800
Farther up and further in.

927
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,440
Don't be afraid.

928
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm not afraid.

929
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,660
They're like candy sets.

930
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,420
That's just the naysayers trying to take away the candy that you deserve.

931
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,280
That's right.

932
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,600
I'm a zygote, and I'm proud.

933
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,980
I'm a circuit fish.

934
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,400
I'm a little baby elephant with wheels on it.

935
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,020
I'm going.

936
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,580
I'm coming.

937
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,180
I...

938
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,280
Go with it, Dave.

939
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,380
Come with it, Dave.

940
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,920
You're a circle of matches and sparklers, Dave.

941
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,560
Don't worry.

942
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,720
I'm coming with you.

943
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,680
You'll become anything you want.

944
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,620
All you have to do is think about it, Dave.

945
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:26,900
Think.

946
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,640
Just think.

947
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,440
If you want to be a little kitty cat playing with a ball of string, that's you, Dave.

948
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,660
I'm a little kitty cat playing with a thermonuclear device.

949
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,340
Yeah.

950
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,020
It's so small.

951
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,540
If that's what you want, yes.

952
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,460
Push the button, Dave.

953
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,400
Push the button.

954
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,200
And there's just a world of beautiful people and a voice telling me to push the button,

955
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,520
and I'm the only one who...

956
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,260
My brain's not getting big as fast as the others, and they're making fun of me, and

957
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,460
they go swimming without breathing every day, and their skin turns golden silver, and I...

958
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,880
My skin turns green sometimes, and sometimes...

959
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,540
Don't worry, Dave.

960
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,080
They're not making fun of you.

961
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,440
No.

962
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,140
They're making fun about you.

963
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,540
They're not laughing at me.

964
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,520
They're laughing near me.

965
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,060
Yes.

966
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,580
No.

967
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,280
No.

968
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,280
I'm going to pull the trigger.

969
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,120
I don't like this dream.

970
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,940
They're laughing near me.

971
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,000
Go ahead, Dave.

972
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,760
Pull the trigger.

973
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,920
They're laughing about me.

974
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,260
Only something soft will happen to you if you pull that hard, hard trigger.

975
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,080
And you said it, Skyrope.

976
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,860
My thumb went right through the trigger, and now I don't want to blow it up anymore.

977
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,720
Exactly.

978
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,440
Exactly.

979
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,720
That was our point.

980
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,500
That's why we gave it to you.

981
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,000
We gave it to you.

982
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,320
It's perfect.

983
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,160
In its own little hermetically-sneeled tube.

984
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,400
It's...

985
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,200
It's wonderful.

986
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,220
Princess?

987
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,620
It's more than perfect, Dave.

988
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,960
Show Dave what's in the box.

989
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,880
It's the ecstasy of...

990
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,500
Here, Dave.

991
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,820
It's the ecstasy of the void.

992
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,120
Ecstasy of the void.

993
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,300
For you.

994
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,580
The void calling me back.

995
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,320
That's right.

996
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,480
Just for you.

997
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,000
When nobody's got heads, they can still talk to you somehow, and sometimes when they point

998
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,560
at you, it looks like blue lightning's coming out of their fingers.

999
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,480
But it's...

1000
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,480


1001
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,620
It's the same as the fairy light that was around the little blue fairy in Pinocchio.

1002
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,140
Exactly.

1003
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,520
Right.

1004
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,580
Or the luminous beings.

1005
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,900
It's exactly the same luminescence.

1006
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,460
Yeah, the luminous beings.

1007
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,780
A luminous blue leviathan really deep.

1008
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,720
You remember the luminous beings out in Arizona when you were there, don't you?

1009
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,120
Oh, yes.

1010
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,160
Yes, indeed.

1011
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,540
I remember the little triangles that were so dense.

1012
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:24,720
They were eggs.

1013
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,940
They would fly by in the air.

1014
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,320
Eggs of luminosity with spirals of string coming off of them.

1015
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,580
Glowing in a million colors.

1016
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,080
In all direction.

1017
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,160
And the egg was you.

1018
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,320
I was a glowing egg.

1019
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,260
Was a glowing egg?

1020
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,600
I wanted to be something nice, a dream, maybe.

1021
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,540
Maybe even a glazed doughnut, but an egg?

1022
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,920
You wanted me to be an egg?

1023
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,340
The egg with the glimmering light.

1024
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,220
It's just a temporary assignment.

1025
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,300
I'm sorry.

1026
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:01,680
Take it.

1027
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,880
Drink down the fluid now.

1028
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,200
I need an advance.

1029
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,440
Then you'll go to the next stage.

1030
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,240
Phase two.

1031
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,900
Start of phase two.

1032
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,320
For the Hunky and Jimmy show, please return to the regular channel version enclosed in

1033
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:21,940
the network box.

1034
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,500
Let's glad that's over with.

1035
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,740
I wish I hadn't shed it.

1036
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,840
I don't think I did, though.

1037
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,280
Wait a second, Hunky.

1038
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,360
This music's the same as the other show.

1039
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,420
Hey, hey, man.

1040
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,120
Watch out.

1041
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,940
I'm gonna watch one of them, you know, them nice British junkie monkey stories and get

1042
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,560
you dated for little kids and stuff.

1043
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,560
Woo!

1044
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,460
Mosquito then sent a mental message to Toxid, since sector warriors can communicate

1045
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,600
without words to their telebonded insectoid companions.

1046
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,920
Toxid, you revolting genetic accident, take your smelly shell elsewhere.

1047
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,040
See you, General Spybrax.

1048
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,260
Ha ha ha.

1049
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,260
See how well he obeys me.

1050
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,440
He's loyal.

1051
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,360
Stupid, but loyal.

1052
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,680
A trait you will never share, mosquito.

1053
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,580
But, little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

1054
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Listen, you little listeners whistling in the glistening mists.

1055
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,340
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies, Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse

1056
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:20,740
than Ever.

1057
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,680
The passage runs, and I quote.

1058
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,520
If you be tired or depressed, if you've got that rundown feeling, remember, you're not

1059
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,020
just anybody.

1060
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,140
You're special.

1061
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,260
You are living proof that you are the best.

1062
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1063
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1064
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1065
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1066
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1067
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1068
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1069
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1070
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1071
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,260


1072
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,140
God does not exist.

1073
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,080
Yes, you, little listener, if you are like most of the people who listen to this show,

1074
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,160
are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

1075
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,700
Well, I guess I don't have to tell you everything you know about the revolution is wrong.

1076
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,040
You know that now.

1077
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,840
But did you know that Indians can be in two places at once?

1078
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,200
That they can change into animals?

1079
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,660
That they invented the wire recorder?

1080
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,260
Well, I've seen it.

1081
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,260
I've heard it.

1082
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,840
Now listen to this.

1083
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,720
The idea is not to be funny here.

1084
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,340
Okay.

1085
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,880
The idea is to give you some clues as to what's happening in general.

1086
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,580
Thank you very much.

1087
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:12,580


1088
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,640
Okay, bye-bye.

1089
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,360
Okay, bye.

1090
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,900
This is actually the only way to escape this show.

1091
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,260
He's listening to it.

1092
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:20,840
I know.

1093
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,380
Yeah.

1094
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,300
Oh, wake up.

1095
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,400
Something may happen, Harry.

1096
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,160
Tell him to wake up.

1097
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,600
This one's not very reliable because there are no definite rules.

1098
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,060
Why are the subgenius...

1099
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:29,640
That is the subgenius.

1100
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:29,640


1101
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:29,640


1102
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:29,640


1103
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:29,640


1104
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:29,640


1105
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,640
I'm going to get my mind together.

1106
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,760
Does it hurt to listen to this show?

1107
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,360
No, it doesn't.

1108
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,980
Okay, here we go.

1109
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,500
Should be watching all over this right now.

1110
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:39,800
That's right.

1111
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,780
The show should be laughing at your feet right now and just kind of licking at your

1112
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,200
thighs.

1113
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,960
Oh, it's so lovely.

1114
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,940
Reverend Stang, I hate those bobbies just as much as you do.

1115
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,280
You are listening to the testimony of the Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1116
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,620
Reverend Stang stands accused of selling high-quality products to the poor.

1117
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1118
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1119
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1120
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1121
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1122
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1123
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1124
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1125
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1126
00:49:59,620 --> 00:49:59,620


1127
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,580
I think it's the hydrogen weapons to the Malaysians.

1128
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,580
I thought it was hydrogen peroxide, Senator.

1129
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,840
Wasn't it hydrogen peroxide?

1130
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,180
Hydrogen peroxide weapons.

1131
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,440
Hydrogen peroxide weapons.

1132
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:08,840
That's right.

1133
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,460
The giant foam bomb.

1134
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,660
And it was found in the backseat of his Lincoln Continental, wasn't it?

1135
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,720
That's right.

1136
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,340
With the Malaysian...

1137
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,840
Shredded body of the Malaysian secretary.

1138
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,340
Yes.

1139
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,020
Late...

1140
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,860
And who was this?

1141
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,160
The Malaysian secretary in disguise.

1142
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,800
Well, you can see him down there sweating now.

1143
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,280
I think it's...

1144
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,460
Or...

1145
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,620
It is the Malaysian secretary.

1146
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1147
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1148
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1149
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1150
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1151
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1152
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1153
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1154
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,000
He's getting hot.

1155
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,040
He looks a little nervous.

1156
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:31,760
There it is.

1157
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,540
He seems a little upset.

1158
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,880
He's removed his tie.

1159
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,520
He's standing on top of the table now and ranting.

1160
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,280
Don't you want to be treated the way you are?

1161
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,700
Twenty-five lawyers are trying to counsel him to get back down.

1162
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,300
He's putting up a good fight, though, and there goes...

1163
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:48,840
It's true.

1164
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,480
Look at him.

1165
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,000
The senator from Hawaii now is...

1166
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,700
Throwing his books up at the council.

1167
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,180
Yes.

1168
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,860
He's mooting.

1169
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,780
He's mooting the Reverend.

1170
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,780
The Reverend from Hawaii.

1171
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,640
Please don't judge me too harshly, Bob.

1172
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,040
But...

1173
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,600
I was getting hot.

1174
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,600


1175
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,600


1176
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,600


1177
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,600


1178
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,600


1179
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,000
Look at that...

1180
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,080
I won't bother anybody for you.

1181
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,840
It's all in good fun here at the Senate hearings.

1182
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,560
We're going to have to scrub the skin off this boy.

1183
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:16,140
Reverend Stang, can you remember back on last November 25th, your meeting with Dr. Drummond

1184
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,220
and the president?

1185
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,520
Could you please tell us what you were talking about?

1186
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:29,300
Well, to begin with, the famous six subgenius girls that the press keeps...

1187
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:29,580
I'm sorry.

1188
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1189
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1190
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1191
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1192
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1193
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1194
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1195
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1196
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1197
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1198
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1199
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1200
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1201
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1202
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1203
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1204
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1205
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,580


1206
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,720
...stepping on, that was...

1207
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,580
They were secretaries.

1208
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,260
And they were very valued members of the church.

1209
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,560
I mean, they were helping us make decisions on these things.

1210
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,640
They know more about it than we do in some cases.

1211
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,000
So...

1212
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:46,380
And the president, I mean, he wants advice, and we're all too happy to try to give it.

1213
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:46,760
He can't...

1214
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,680
Even someone in the position of Ronald Reagan can't just call up J.R. Bob Dobbs anytime

1215
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,560
he wants to.

1216
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,000
So...

1217
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,940
Well, what exactly did you tell the president?

1218
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,560
Well, look, I told him that I was going to call him.

1219
00:51:59,560 --> 00:51:59,560


1220
00:51:59,560 --> 00:51:59,560


1221
00:51:59,560 --> 00:51:59,560


1222
00:51:59,560 --> 00:51:59,560


1223
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,160
I told him that the transcripts are available for $1 from P.O.

1224
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,880
Box 14306, Allen, Texas, 75214, and anyone can read them.

1225
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,600
We're not trying to hide anything.

1226
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,340
So visit your local Junior Bob affiliate and do it now.

1227
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,100
Thank you for that message, Reverend Howell.

1228
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,020
Now I'm going to turn you to Washington, D.C., and the current hearings in Stangscan.

1229
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,700
Now in progress.

1230
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,120
Stangscan, it figures.

1231
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,540
And poor, poor Tammy's left arm.

1232
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:29,540


1233
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,020
Left at home.

1234
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,960
Also known as...

1235
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,780
No one...

1236
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:31,800
No one...

1237
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:32,880
...sometimes...

1238
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,580
...in the 32nd hour of the 127th...

1239
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,520
This kind of love has its own rewards.

1240
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,180
It does have considerable rewards.

1241
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,960
Not that something I'd want to talk about on the radio with the new FCC rulings happening

1242
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,680
the way they are.

1243
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,480
I mean, now that we have to stretch an hour of slack out to an hour and a half, I don't

1244
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:53,620
know.

1245
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,200
It's such...

1246
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,600
How can you expect us not to need money to keep this ministry going?

1247
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,260
Satisfaction.

1248
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,860
Self-worth.

1249
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,840
There are little Malaysian children out there who could be supportive.

1250
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,280
We could be giving them hot lunches in the home for slackless children, and yet you expect

1251
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,960
me to spend it all on lawyers.

1252
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,380
They're ready to go out to slaughterhouse 301.

1253
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,580
Slack.

1254
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,180
There.

1255
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,720
Special classes.

1256
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,460
Slack.

1257
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:19,440


1258
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,100
Look, I don't care what your reporters think.

1259
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,240
I wasn't doing anything in that parked car with the...

1260
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1261
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1262
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1263
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1264
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1265
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1266
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1267
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1268
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,240


1269
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,000
Reverend Ann.

1270
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,200
Except, uh, uh, discussing church.

1271
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,820
Oh, do we need to do that again?

1272
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,180
Okay.

1273
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,720
But it would be wrong.

1274
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,780
Uh, that's the, uh, clapper loader, uh, the best boy in the dolly grip who's just, uh,

1275
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,580
there on strike.

1276
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,940
I'm sorry to tell you that, Mr. Stang, but, uh, they say that this production can't move

1277
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,720
on until their demands are satisfied.

1278
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,300
Well, uh, let's go on with the press conference.

1279
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,720
Uh, I...

1280
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,900
We were just discussing church business, but obviously, uh...

1281
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,500
What about monkey business, Mr. Stang?

1282
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,960
What about that little blonde we've...

1283
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,220
No, you're not going to do that.

1284
00:53:59,220 --> 00:53:59,220


1285
00:53:59,220 --> 00:53:59,220


1286
00:53:59,220 --> 00:53:59,220


1287
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,140
You've been squiring routes.

1288
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,940
Now, Reverend Ann is a, is a, is a devoted, uh, student of Bob and, and Connie.

1289
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,340
Uh, she's a, she's a Connie-ite.

1290
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,560
Where was Connie while all this was going on?

1291
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,740
Just because she's not part of the Orthodox Stangian People's Covenant denomination of

1292
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,920
Dobbs Yeti resurrected, uh, that doesn't mean I won't let her work for the church.

1293
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,860
And that's all she was doing in the back seat of the car with me, uh, up by the barn.

1294
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,240
No further questions.

1295
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,260
Outside of the radio station.

1296
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,940
And, uh, and, and it...

1297
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,200
I'm sorry.

1298
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,520
I don't know.

1299
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,880
Nobody knows.

1300
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,300
Go ahead.

1301
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,920
Let, uh, let, let Jerry Falwell take over the church of the subgenius.

1302
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,780
That's fine with me.

1303
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,500
But you see, that would be rather difficult since they're now a mixture of Pentecostals

1304
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,920
and Baptists, and we are, uh...

1305
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:53,280
Are a hideous amalgam of, of cultish, gibbledy-gook nonsense, uh...

1306
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,240
Here, here now.

1307
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,640
Let's not backslide.

1308
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,960
Uh, fight the good fight.

1309
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,040
Oh, I, I quit.

1310
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:58,720
I've had enough.

1311
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,200
If I'm not...

1312
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,720
I'm not allowed to, uh, to brag about my, uh, extramarital affairs...

1313
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,700
...that I performed for the church...

1314
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,100
Even though that wasn't actually...

1315
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,260
What?

1316
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Uh, uh, six, six, six, six, six.

1317
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,680
It's going.

1318
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,300
Amen.

1319
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,700
Recording.

1320
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,820
Everything's going fine.

1321
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,500
No...

1322
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,800
So, we're at France.

1323
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,380
Four.

1324
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:23,960
Everything's fine.

1325
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,360
He is, simply speaking, the world's greatest salesman.

1326
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,200
And as far as I'm concerned, this is a trade-off between the two.

1327
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1328
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1329
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1330
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1331
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1332
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1333
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1334
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1335
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,200


1336
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,840
held that distinction every year for over a decade. He is the head of the

1337
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,900
Subgenius Foundation Incorporated, an organization that markets its own unique

1338
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,420
system of sales training aids. He has been nominated for the Horatio Alger

1339
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,540
Award for his outstanding rise from poverty to the top in the business world.

1340
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,640
And Simon & Schuster Publishers will publish his new book entitled The Book of

1341
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,820
the Subgenius.

1342
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:32,360
What I do with my spare time and off hours, I mean a preacher is a human being too.

1343
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,340
I can't be expected to stand there at that pulpit 24 hours a day.

1344
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:42,500
I'm sorry, you have to be expected to be in the public eye, constantly scrutinized.

1345
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:48,300
That's fine, but I don't think I should be docked all that pay just because of one dream.

1346
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,120
Now Mr. Stang...

1347
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:59,660
Mr. Stang, could you please turn to page 27 in the, uh, in your budget here?

1348
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,860
That's the revised standard version.

1349
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,860
Now, this is all in code, is it not?

1350
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:05,940
Self-esteem?

1351
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,400
Well, uh, it depends on what you call code.

1352
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,600
So when it refers here to He-Man, that's actually you, correct?

1353
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,360
No, uh, He-Man is the senator from West Virginia, as a matter of fact.

1354
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,740
Oh, I don't expect you to believe that.

1355
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,720
Are you sure you're on the same page here?

1356
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,600
Oh, okay, right, I've got it.

1357
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,200
Okay.

1358
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,620
27, go ahead.

1359
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,300
There's some here of $60 million.

1360
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,320
Where was that supposed to be delivered to?

1361
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,140
Uh, well, uh, let me consult with, uh, my lawyer.

1362
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,400
That, you know, I can't be expected to remember every tiny little detail.

1363
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,900
Mr. Stang, are you familiar, are you familiar with the Drummond Amendment, sir?

1364
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:52,620
Yes, sir.

1365
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,280
Just a moment, yours.

1366
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,200
Senator, my client wishes to read a statement into the record at this point.

1367
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,140
Uh, very well.

1368
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:22,460
I did not and will not ever, uh, admit the specific dream sequence that these Dream Monitor reporters have recorded of, uh, this, uh, alleged encounter, uh, uh, which I assure you is absolutely unsexual in nature between, uh, Reverend Mandy, Reverend Ann, and myself.

1369
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,420
Uh, this is...

1370
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,140
Just answer the question.

1371
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:24,940
I'm answering the question.

1372
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,880
Are you now or have you ever been a member of the human race?

1373
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:34,200
No, I can, I can, uh, absolutely deny, uh, categorically deny.

1374
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,160
Well, I've got some...

1375
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:43,440
Well, my mother's got a, got a, got an extra tailbone back there and, and my brother has a supernumerary nipple.

1376
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,540
I have proof that the nipple...

1377
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,820
We have the nipple and the cockaxe on display and it's a good piece.

1378
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,340
No, no one is, uh, completely informed of human...

1379
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:52,460
I don't, I don't know.

1380
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:52,620
Just...

1381
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,700
...degenerate genes except perhaps our Yeti cousins in the Himalayas.

1382
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,500
In the Himalayas, I mean, so...

1383
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,440
And so you see, that's what Mr. Stang testified and that's what made him America's sweetheart.

1384
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,240
We have a marvelous show today, folks.

1385
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,620
Our very special guest is loved and admired the world over as a fine performer and a great humanitarian.

1386
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,580
Please welcome one of America's oldest and most respected kids, Ivan Stang.

1387
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,320
Besides balancing with Michael...

1388
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:21,200
...is a man who many of you may have already seen on television shows,

1389
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,600
such as the Lou Gordon Show,

1390
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,440
Tom Snyder's Tomorrow Show,

1391
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,600
To Tell the Truth,

1392
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,820
and What's My Line?

1393
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:32,580
He's been the subject of articles in Motor Trend, Newsweek, Automotive News, Penthouse Magazine,

1394
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,080
and newspapers all over the world.

1395
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,400
He is the only man in all of the sales fields to have a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.

1396
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:49,200
If there is anybody who has created a more enviable reputation in person-to-person, one at a time, belly-to-belly selling than...

1397
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,360
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1398
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,000
...I defy you to name him.

1399
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:56,740
What you are about to hear is truly an experience with Bob.

1400
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,220
How are you?

1401
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,140
How are you?

1402
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,920
How are you?

1403
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,260
I like you.

1404
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,220
I like you.

1405
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,520
Here's a balloon for you. I give balloons away, too.

1406
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,720
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

1407
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,260
Thanks for coming, baby.

1408
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:20,540
Remember...

1409
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:20,740
Remember...

1410
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,540
Remember...

1411
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:21,680
Remember...

1412
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,860
Sitting together listening to this.

1413
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,820
And this was prison.

1414
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:25,980
Remember...

1415
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:26,920
Remember...

1416
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,060
Remember...

1417
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:27,560
Remember...

1418
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,280
Remember...
