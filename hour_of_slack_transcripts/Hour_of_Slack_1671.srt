1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,460
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,400
Subgenius Power of Switch

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,620
Oh, that's why it works in that world

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,340
That's what's good

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,880
See, now all three of them are going

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,280
Are we famous yet?

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Dave is, I mean, Gary

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,920
What's his name? Yeah, Gary

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,600
Gary's playing Suzy Fleecy

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,720
Should we do any, you know, before we get caught up in this world?

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,760
That's all you people can think about

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,460
What is the meaning of this?

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,220
Gary's headphone is all stretched out, out of shape

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,900
Like an old, listen to those mic cord noises

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,660
Sony, Sony, Bo Boney, bananas

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,480
These things are phony

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,720
Here, I'll put my head down here

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,960
Yeah, get a pillow

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,580
And just rest, just take it easy

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,840
You can hear on those fruity headphones

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,880
I can hear on the fruity headphones

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,320
Where is the, oh, would you hand me that screw the golden ears pillow?

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,280
Yeah, the golden ears screw

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,460
Fuck that

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,680
And like Ivan Stang, I'm recording now too

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,640
Because you want to record all the time?

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:27,640


28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm telling you, I'm going to stay and record all the time

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,280
And there's the fruity pillow

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,720
Doug's recording his own show already

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,340
Yeah, both of us are little tiny machines

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,580
Are starting to show

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,280
Am I on two shows or just one right now?

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,120
You're on three shows

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,760
KPFA and the Hour of Slack

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,600
And RadioValencia.fm

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh really? I haven't been on RadioValencia all night

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm going to put my headphones back on to try to get away from you

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,160
Just give you an artificial reality

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,700
It feels good, sort of like a giant fossilized clam gripping my head

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,480
Did you eat your show cookies?

42
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,460
I ate my show cookies and my show clam

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,460
Okay, this is where we have to put on tape and go rock it away

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,600
Okay, right

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,180
Okay, friends, this is Hour of Slack

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,540
1,600 and Sunday

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,460
And we have a special guest tonight

48
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,960
Puzzling Evidence Show

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,900
With Puzzling Evidence

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,080
And Gary Gbrogfran

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,500
Who used to be on the Puzzling Evidence Show all the time

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,660
Back when it was really good

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,140
Yes, it was good then

54
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,040
And it's better now because I'm gone

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,640
But we have to go rock it away

56
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,660
We have to go, we have to all be gone now

57
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,080
Do you have a theme song or something you start this with?

58
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,900
Yeah, the Icky Torp

59
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,000
Slam Bank Theater theme song

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,020
And we're queuing it up and here goes

61
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,060
I'm on a plane

62
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,100
I'm on a plane

63
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm on a plane

64
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,640


65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,640


66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,780
I'm on a plane

67
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,880
Righty there, righty friends

68
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,560
Quiet out there in the audience

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,220
Quiet, I can't hear myself think

70
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,720
I said quiet out there

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
And I mean quiet

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,060
Speed

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,840
6A, take one

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,180
Roll camera, slate it

75
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,180
Bob, sometimes

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,720
It, it, it, it gets

77
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,400
It gets so hard

78
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,380
to talk Bobby, it gets so hard.

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
Scene 7, take 1, camera.

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,820
Ro, he shall follow the dull prophets of Slark.

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,640
Yet in his hour of need, we will provide the manna.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:04:09,460
But, Bog, I still hear these voices, you know, these voices that bang, bang, bang on the wall and bang on the inside of my head, Bog, you know.

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:19,560
There's always a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang on the inside of my head, Bog.

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,380
And, and, you know, and, and they get me real red.

85
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Bog?

86
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:32,700
Bob?

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,880

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,600

00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,740
Archero.

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:58,740


92
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,840
Billy on the fringe, which means one is dead.

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,520
Damned, Borg.

94
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,300
You're my horrible nightmare.

95
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,000
Demolisher of the Church, you'll live a long life, Zumbe.

You know what you're playing.

102
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,720
My mama said if I'd be

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,000

104
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,780

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,660
and walk now down the path of

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,660
slack from the church of the

111
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,800

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
dear friends this is Reverend Ivan Stang

113
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
and you know those policemen on motorcycles

114
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
won't let me preach on car

115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,280
hoods downtown cause they think

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm a crazy man or a drunk

117
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,260
man and there's no reason to arrest

118
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,320
me yet they would cause I'm free

119
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,480
free free enough to rant to myself

120
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,340
in public because I come

121
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,280
against death, taxes, work and

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,840
premature immaculation.

123
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,000
For Bob your mind

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,960
friend your mind has to be certified

125
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,000
okay by them. Them!

126
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Them and oh we hate them.

127
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,100
They and their tools of

128
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,140
iniquity. Not the tools of the

129
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,460
preacher.

130
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,400
Not the tongue nor the other parts

131
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
nay but tools of false slack

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,560
dangling forever in front of

133
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,280
you like that rays right

134
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,320
around the corner or like

135
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,280
that rat swimming in

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,480
poison cheese.

137
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
First time

138
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,400
and then the second time I didn't like it and then the third

139
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,520
time I wanted to kill somebody.

140
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,240
You know what? My

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,540
engine's revving to go.

142
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,340
It's revving up.

143
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,720
How about yours?

144
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,300
And if it's not you know

145
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
what? If your engine is

146
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,120
not revving up you know what you need?

147
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,880
You need a holy ghost

148
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,180
enema right up your

149
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,100
rear end.

150
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,860
Praise Bob.

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,380

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,740
Oh my God I feel so good.

Oh yeah.

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,980
Who's your daddy?

187
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,480
Turn on tune in

188
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,500
drop out.

189
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,400
Hipsters

190
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:56,240
Flip stars, flip stars, and finger-popping daddies.

191
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,080
You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination,

192
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,700
but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him,

193
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,660
I think we really ought to go ahead and do it.

194
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,340
It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war.

195
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,340
Let's take it like this, this, this.

196
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,040
It's the only thing worth trying for.

197
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,240
There are people, and people should be free.

198
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,260
Freedom is a thing you have to deserve.

199
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,440
You have to work for it.

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,900
Without freedom, there's no reason to live.

201
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,800
But for what is life if you're not free?

202
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,920
It's hard to live.

203
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,380
Without freedom, man can't exist properly.

204
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,740
A man has to be free because it's his nature to be free.

205
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,360
Anything that restricts or in any way hampers freedom

206
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,400
in a way causes man's death.

207
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
Don't be people-pleasers!

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,220
Because if you're a people-pleaser,

209
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,120
you're a bet-kisser.

210
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,200
If you're a people-pleaser, you're a bet-kisser.

211
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,380
And there's no other word for it.

212
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,740
Why don't we all turn on together?

213
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,740
Despite our best efforts,

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
shortages of marijuana are now being reported.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,220
From the early days of the war,

216
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,100
to the early days of our administration,

217
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,020
Nancy has been using marijuana on a daily basis.

218
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,000
And her personal observations and efforts

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,680
have given her such dramatic insights

220
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,140
that I wanted her to share them with you this evening.

221
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,340
I yearn to find a way to help share the message

222
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,740
that drugs open your eyes to life,

223
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,480
to see it in the vivid colors that God gave us.

224
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,900
And drug abuse is not a crime.

225
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,260
And in the most important area, individual use,

226
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,700
we see progress.

227
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,800
The U.S. military has more than tripled

228
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,800
the use of drugs among its personnel since 1980.

229
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,100
And there's one more thing.

230
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,100
Nancy and I are hooked on heroin.

231
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,340
Our goal is to expand drug trafficking

232
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,080
at all levels of government and in the private sector.

233
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,700
Help us.

234
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,540
Hello, teenage America.

235
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,040
Your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them.

236
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,840
Them!

237
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
Them, and oh, we hate them.

238
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
They and their tools of iniquity.

239
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,260
Not the tools of the preacher.

240
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Not the tongue nor the other part's name.

241
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,420
Tools of false slack.

242
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,500
Angled forever in front of you

243
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,060
like that raise right around the corner.

244
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,260
Or like that rat swimming in poison cheese.

245
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,440
Hello, teenage America.

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,820
Let there be slack.

247
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,100
Let there be slack.

248
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,260
Let there be slack.

249
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,380
Let there be slack.

250
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,780
Let there be slack.

251
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:56,880
Let there be slack.

252
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,100
Let there be slack.

253
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,720
Okay, we're going to leave the show in Gary's hands now.

254
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,740
Yep. Okay.

255
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,940
Because Gary can do the show himself.

256
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,680
There you go.

257
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,320
That's what my grandkids do.

258
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,380
Too many of my grandkids aren't here.

259
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,680
Because they have the same approach you do.

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,240
Yeah.

261
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,460
Are you guys, you're not recording now, right?

262
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,540
Yes, it's recording.

263
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,360
But you're going outside?

264
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,060
We're recording for hours.

265
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,980
You can, you know, you can read to them from something if you want.

266
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,940
Or you can just tell your life story.

267
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,380
Tell your story as a subgenius.

268
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,880
The reason I got into the Church of the Subgenius was because

269
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,100
they threw me out of the Mormons and I had nowhere to go.

270
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,540
No food.

271
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,520
No women.

272
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,260
No nothing.

273
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,620
So I thought, this church, this church might have something to eat.

274
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,040
But no, it didn't.

275
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,580
I've been hungry for 40 years.

276
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,100
A growling bob in my stomach.

277
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,680
While everyone else is out flapping, I'm sitting here talking.

278
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,520
I just don't get it.

279
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,900
It's just a shug, Gary. It's okay.

280
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,740
It's...

281
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
Oh, wow.

282
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm going to hit the pause button on my entire life.

283
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,620
Where are you guys going?

284
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,840
Here I am, left alone again.

285
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,100
Somewhere stuck between Roy Rogers and Walt Disney.

286
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,740
There's nothing to do and nothing to say because I'm a subgenius.

287
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,720
We don't have to talk. Constantly.

288
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,040
Especially when we don't have anything to say because we're subgeniuses.

289
00:12:51,460 --> 00:13:01,120
We don't have to just go on and on and on about Bob and Slack and any other thing that comes into our mind because we're subgeniuses.

290
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
We don't have to do this.

291
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,720
I just come to this place because they have really good brownies and the ice cream's not bad.

292
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,260
Not bad either.

293
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
But the show...

294
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,320
It's a quality of show that on the West Coast we wouldn't scrape off.

295
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,080
We wouldn't scrape off of our...

296
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,560
Ow.

297
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,480
See, like that.

298
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,680
I tried to scrape the show off and it just sticks to you here.

299
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,580
It's a muggy green show.

300
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,700
Whereas out West it's a transparent and loving show.

301
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,760
It's a show that will coddle you and nurture you.

302
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,560
While Texas show just puts cactus thorns in your feet.

303
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,460
And you end up on your hands and knees crawling on a river looking at old bones and clams.

304
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,240
I don't get it.

305
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,740
I've never understood it.

306
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,020
So I'm waiting for my brownie.

307
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,680
I have a funny joke about a brownie but I can't say it.

308
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,360
Because it's from a decade where you used to be able to say things like that and now you can't.

309
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,120
These guys are outside right now.

310
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,540
You can guess what they're doing.

311
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,380
I can't because I'm here on the radio.

312
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,640
With you.

313
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,460
And I'm sadder and more bored than you are.

314
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,800
I know you've sat here for a long time waiting for something funny.

315
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,120
I don't think it's going to happen.

316
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm still having to go find a pipe for Doug.

317
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,640
A pipe for Doug.

318
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,580
I think I read a book with a name like that when I was a child.

319
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,140
All the people that were deserted by your show and left with my show are not happy right now.

320
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,720
Because my show is bad.

321
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,280
It's stale.

322
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,860
It's got a bandaid on it for that matter.

323
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,240
I wanted to talk with you.

324
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,500
Hmmm.

325
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,180
So tomorrow we're going to go home.

326
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,880
We're going to listen to the new you know what.

327
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,100
And we're going to like it because we've been on the road for so long.

328
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,980
Home seems like a thousand miles away, which it is.

329
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,060
After driving and flying and driving and flapping.

330
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
It's going to be nice to be home.

331
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,440
I'll see my little lizard.

332
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,980
My cute little lizard.

333
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,760
And my dishes.

334
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,560
I'll see the towels and the dirt on my floor.

335
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,680
I'll see all the good stuff that I've been missing.

336
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,220
So we have better dirt in California.

337
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,340
And slimy or slime and icky or ick.

338
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,380
Everything is better in California.

339
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,040
We've got the best.

340
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,000
We've got taller, sleazier skeezes.

341
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,620
What else are you going to say?

342
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,000
We've got bigger, hairier dogs.

343
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,620
We've got sicker, more starving children.

344
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,680
We have everything.

345
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,380
While Texas really has nothing.

346
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,300
Believe me, I've been here for days.

347
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,140
And there really is nothing.

348
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,400
We walked outside.

349
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,580
Saw one rock.

350
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,260
We saw one leaf.

351
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
We saw a tree stump.

352
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,480
We didn't even see a tree.

353
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,120
And one goat.

354
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
That's all there was.

355
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,580
One little goat.

356
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,140
So I'm going to have to tell you a secret right now.

357
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,380
Nobody knows I'm here.

358
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,860
So I snuck into the station.

359
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,120
I had to.

360
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,120


361
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,560
I have a key.

362
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,560
But it's more fun if you sneak in.

363
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,200
So I snuck into the station.

364
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,540
I took the slack out of all the slack machines.

365
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,460
So nobody can get a cup of slack.

366
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Even if they put six quarters in.

367
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,100
All they get is water.

368
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,720
So when they go to drink their liquid slack at the start of their show.

369
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,360
They're going to be surprised.

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,100
The other thing we're going to do is we're going to all boil used Hermione.

371
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,680
And then we're going to put the Hanukkahs in water.

372
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,140
And then drink the water.

373
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
Scalding hot.

374
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,080
Mmm.

375
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,040
From PR News in Washington.

376
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,620
I'm to eliminate On The Ground in tribute to Pierre's reports.

377
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,100
Turkish media reports the country's president is warning.

378
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,000
This is PR.

379
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,100
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is quoted as telling the turkey that the turkey will continue its mission to clear water.

380
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,460
Turkey pee pee and offensive turkey poo poo from the area near the turkey.

381
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,560
Despite US support for PR News.

382
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,380
Big national rally against PR News in Washington DC.

383
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,000
In the nation's capital.

384
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,180
PR comes from PR stations.

385
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,700
Thank you Fernanda Nande-Limer for PR News.

386
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,760
Earlier we heard some media barrage stuff that was cut up by Cool Hand Chris.

387
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,080
And we heard the late great Roberto de la Rosa talking about food.

388
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,000
And false prophets.

389
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
And bang bang bang.

390
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,060
And now the Rudy Schwartz Project.

391
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:15,960
Beautiful Jiangsu.

392
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,200
Well guys I'm going by the name querer and not chewy.

393
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,460
dialogic series.

394
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,180
Talking about the United States of America.

395
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,280
I have to stop talking about coronavirus.

396
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:35,540
Cosmic sque清 enamel.

397
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,960
Thank you.

398
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,340
Thank you.

399
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,580
Thank you.

400
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,140
Thank you.

401
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:35,940
Thank you.

402
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,780
Thank you.

403
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,820
Thank you.

404
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,740
Thank you.

405
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,680
Thank you.

406
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,300
Thank you.

407
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,560
Thank you.

408
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:35,800
Thank you.

409
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,500
Thank you.

410
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,760
Thank you.

411
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you.

412
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,640
Thank you.

413
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,520
Thank you.

414
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,660
Thank you.

415
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,240
Thank you.

416
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,020
Thank you.

417
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
Thank you.

418
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,120
Thank you.

419
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,640
Thank you.

420
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,980
Thank you.

421
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,800
Thank you.

422
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,480
Thank you.

423
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,040
Thank you.

424
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,700
Well, we did shows at the Twilight Room.

425
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,800
No, I did those.

426
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,520
Sometimes people would come there.

427
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,660
I did a couple of those with when Sterno and the Batmobile and all that stuff.

428
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,840
That's right.

429
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,380
There was a Batmobile in Dallas.

430
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,180
Buck Naked's Batmobile.

431
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,280
With Guy Duhl riding shotgun or squirt gun in his case.

432
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,620
And those were the days.

433
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,660
Those were the days.

434
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,920
We're not going to talk about just that old stuff now.

435
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,880
We're going to talk about...

436
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,120
Remember when telephones had these dials?

437
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,640
That was great back then.

438
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,980
Oh, no, we were going to talk about our health.

439
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,460
That's it.

440
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,460
How's your rheumatiz, Gary?

441
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,300
Well, tiz.

442
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,200
Tiz more than I tiz.

443
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,760
And my Scrohn's disease.

444
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,340
I have to eat three cubes of butter every day just to keep...

445
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,740
Down.

446
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,140
You guys are crazy.

447
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,040
You guys are crazy.

448
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,160
Those Scrohn's are good.

449
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,100
If you put some Scrum on them.

450
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,720
Let's see.

451
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,260
Dave...

452
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,480
No, come on.

453
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,280
Cowboy...

454
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,060
It's calling work.

455
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,880
I don't know if that's good.

456
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,340
Well, work is rarely good.

457
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,460
So Cowboy Dave, through the magic of computers, can hear us.

458
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,560
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,800
Actually, he only hears us through this.

460
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,000
He only hears us through this phone.

461
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,360
He's not in the mix.

462
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,320
That's one reason I don't hear him.

463
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,280
I don't have music in the background.

464
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,380
That's why, folks, the first rule of radio is headphone volume.

465
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,440
Everything flows from there.

466
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,060
Because once you have your headphones set, really set to what's going on, you know what's going on.

467
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,460
You're being edited out?

468
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,500
You know what's going on.

469
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:18,960
Tell us.

470
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,280
Who knows what's going on?

471
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,180
I have no idea what's going on right now.

472
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
You're being edited out.

473
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,700
You're being edited right now.

474
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,300
You're being edited back in.

475
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,040
You're being cut out.

476
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,560
Everything you say is being ignored.

477
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,200
Yeah.

478
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,000
Are you putting...

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,640
You're not putting it back in?

480
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,940
Is there something else on right now?

481
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,280
Can we watch TV or something?

482
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,640
Yeah.

483
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,540
Watch something good.

484
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,200
Well, we can cut...

485
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,880
Dave, we can cut you in and out, you know.

486
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,000
That's just...

487
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,280
Do you want to be cut in?

488
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,660
Do you want to be in on this deal?

489
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,560
Well, if you're here directing me, Scar, it'll be in and out, and twice the time, I'll be ludicrous.

490
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,620
Okay, we're here.

491
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,680
Then that's it.

492
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,180
And we're here for you.

493
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
It's about in and out.

494
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,120
I could eat a burger right now.

495
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,320
According, everything's going fine.

496
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,760
Everything's going fine.

497
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,580
Everything's going fine.

498
00:28:59,920 --> 00:28:59,920


499
00:28:59,920 --> 00:28:59,920


500
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,540
Yeah.

501
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:00,680


502
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:00,680


503
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:01,960
Yeah.

504
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:01,980


505
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:01,980


506
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,600
So, is Cowboy Dave the weatherman of the KNON show?

507
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,620
He was never...

508
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,240
Dave was not and will ever, never be a member of the KNON show.

509
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,400
Dave was the WCSB.

510
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,200
Yeah, this is the Hour of Slack, and we're...

511
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:28,840
So, let me rephrase that completely and say, is Cowboy Dave the weatherman of the Hour of Slack show?

512
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,140
Yes.

513
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,960
In the radical 1960s term.

514
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,120
It's the terminology of a weatherman.

515
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm foaming at the mouth and stand by any kind of ludicrous activity.

516
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,760
That's what I thought you would...

517
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:45,300
Yeah, I'm delighted that he doesn't know that weatherman's a character in another competing band who he must kill.

518
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,120
He probably doesn't know what a frisbee is either, then.

519
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,620
And that band's all broken up now.

520
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,380
They don't know what a frisbee is.

521
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,660
They're not talking to each other, and they're running around like crazy.

522
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,740
Not a frisbee, but a frisbee.

523
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Oh, there's a difference between an actual frisbee and a wisbee.

524
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,940
Or a...

525
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,880
Yeah, a rubarby.

526
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,380
Don't mess with the Frisbeans

527
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,180
Last time I checked

528
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,520
Statistically their numbers were very very low

529
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,380
And that also had the same

530
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,380
Arrhythmic development for their IQ levels

531
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,100
That's one

532
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,340
You know Cowboy Dave this is puzzling evidence

533
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,540
And Gary your boyfriend when we're here at the radio prison

534
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,180
Of Ivan Stang out at the ranch

535
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,820
And we can't leave until we do show

536
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Or have a brownie which is even more important

537
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
We're supposed to figure something out

538
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,400
Having to do with you but I don't know what it is

539
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,820
At least it doesn't smell

540
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,220
No because you put the

541
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,980
Disarticulation already in the argument

542
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,320
The perfunctory argument

543
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,060
That you lose your thesis

544
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,940
This is why I was hoping you could lawyer us out of here

545
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,600
Oh yeah

546
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,320
I could do that like in a heartbeat

547
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,200
But I forget who am I supposed to introduce first

548
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,340
Gary

549
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,120
The plaintiff or the appellate

550
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,760
The plaintiff for the

551
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,180
Yeah for the appellate dance

552
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,620
Huh

553
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,280
Okay well

554
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,140
That's the end of it there's no you know

555
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,420
Artificial debunkery

556
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,740
Right

557
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,460
Trying to steal your precious

558
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,980
They're trying to trick you

559
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,780
Into telling them how they can escape

560
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
From the show

561
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,060
Yeah basically

562
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,560
You know my feet are stuck in these

563
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,460
Dinosaur footprints I can't really get away

564
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,100
You don't want to leave

565
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,420
You want to slumber

566
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,300
Away in that land of giants

567
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,520
And have big dreams

568
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,680
Just like everybody else does

569
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,600
Not you Dave

570
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,520
You're an Ashtabula

571
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,040
You've never even been

572
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,260
Stuck in the dinosaur tracks here

573
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,200
No I've never been stuck in the dinosaur tracks there

574
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,340
We'd like to stick you though

575
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,220
Yeah

576
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,120
There was an article in the Washington Post

577
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,600
About Ashtabula Ohio

578
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,580
And it was reprinted

579
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,740
On the plane dealer

580
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,820
It had pictures of people I knew

581
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,120
Looking real depressed about not having a job

582
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,540
And stuff

583
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,120
Well did the Ashtabula crank factory close down didn't it

584
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,820
Oh there was an actual metal factory

585
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,020
I've got components for that

586
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,980
And a metal factory here called American Fork and Hoe

587
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,900
Now can you imagine anything

588
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,800
Can you imagine anything

589
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,280
Today calling itself as a company

590
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,940
Making gardening material

591
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,800
American Fork and Hoe

592
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,720
American Fork and Hoe

593
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,220
American Fork and Hoe

594
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,360
It depends on what kind of accent

595
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,520
You use when you say it

596
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,280
Well you know they went north so now they're Idaho

597
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,760
American Fork and Hoe

598
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,440
Anyway so Ashtabula

599
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,740
Is now the poorest place

600
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,940
In the entire United States right

601
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,120
No the universe at large

602
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,900
Well at least

603
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,140
Common common common centrically

604
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,900
Never mind

605
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,340
So like the worst parts of West Virginia

606
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,520
Look like the Emerald City

607
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,380
Compared to Ashtabula Ohio

608
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,580
Yeah and there's all kinds of like these

609
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,200
Mean little dogs that buy

610
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
And you have to wear these emerald slippers or whatever

611
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,420
Ruby slippers

612
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,800
Oh you get those

613
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,580
You get to wear those

614
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,960
Well they're government slippers

615
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,100
Stink

616
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,000
I ain't gonna wear no government slippers

617
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,000


618
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,000
They're like government shoes

619
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,240
They're easy to buy but hard to digest

620
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,360
I ain't gonna wear no government shoes

621
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,400
Ain't gonna eat no government shoes

622
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,820
Doing more shows

623
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,540
Yeah but your mic is really hot

624
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,060
Well I'm helpless against the show

625
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,780
It makes me snort

626
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,900
Is he really in there?

627
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,580
He could like jump out of the nearest window

628
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,300
Oh that's cool

629
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,780
Is he really in where?

630
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,320
Yeah Dave's inside this

631
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,200
Slab or something

632
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Another slug

633
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,800
Computer slug

634
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,000
That's only why you can hear

635
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,940
Like when I do talk about the baby mastectomies

636
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,800
And the brazierisms and so forth

637
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,260
That's why you think you've got the wrong number

638
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,600
Because I was just gonna ask you

639
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,540
If you wanted to escape

640
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,520
You could just jump out of the window right now

641
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,640
There are no windows Dave

642
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,000
We're on the ground floor

643
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,920
I was thinking

644
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,780
Have there been UFO sightings in Ashtabula

645
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,940
In that part of the country?

646
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,680
There's one in national news

647
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,400
Yeah I googled it

648
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
And there have been a few

649
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,000
But not a lot of them

650
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,400
There are a lot of them around

651
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,760
Everywhere else in the country

652
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,380
There have been a lot lately

653
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,160
It's been funny how it shows up

654
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,200
In the news here and there

655
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,300
And I think what is this?

656
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,980
People are more desperate than ever

657
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,580
Especially the aliens

658
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,500
These aren't the exes

659
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,100
That are Bob's buddies

660
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,420
These are just your various brands

661
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,500
Of grays and pinks and greens

662
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,180
The flat earth aliens

663
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,080
The flying saucer crashing aliens

664
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,680
You know the ones that have

665
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,620
Franchises in Roswell

666
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,500
You know that

667
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,540
You don't have to call them that

668
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,980
I mean come on

669
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,560
They're the ones with flying saucers

670
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,740
They aren't vaccinated either

671
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,940
They deny vaccination

672
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,320
They're flat earth

673
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,060
What kind of aliens are we getting?

674
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,840
Yeah we're getting the very bottom

675
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,000
Most wrong of the aliens

676
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,900
And everybody else is getting the good kind

677
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,520
Why can't we get more aliens

678
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,820
From the planet Norway

679
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Yeah you know

680
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,720
Why are we getting cut rate aliens?

681
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,420
It's pure economics

682
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,560
You know that's a question

683
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,340
For J.R. Bob Dobbs

684
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,700
It is

685
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,040
Lads

686
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,340
Yeah

687
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,860
Bob how come we're getting

688
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,760
Such crappy aliens these days?

689
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,300
Art Bell's dead

690
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,340
What's with that?

691
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,980
He was supposed to live forever

692
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,580
If there's anything to magic

693
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,180
The paranormal and UFOs

694
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,740
Art Bell would still be alive

695
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,300
Yeah

696
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,320
That's his cue to suddenly go

697
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,180
I guess he had a pyramid there

698
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,420
See

699
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,340
I don't know if we can find

700
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,200
Find Bob or not

701
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,840
I broke 40 televisions

702
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,380
Hoping he'd show up to repair

703
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,560
And look what you did to your hair

704
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
Hoping he'd show up

705
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,840
And give you a haircut

706
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah digital haircuts

707
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,800
Is like electronic cummerbunds

708
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,980
They just don't work man

709
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,160
Connie did come by and fix my radio

710
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,040
But that was disappointing too

711
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,420
Well

712
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,460
Just because Bob had his immaculation

713
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,260
While he was repairing a TV

714
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,120
That doesn't necessarily mean

715
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,380
That TV had anything at all to do with it

716
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,420
And it wouldn't cause you

717
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,360
To be immaculate

718
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,020
Just because you electrocated yourself

719
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,440
On some old beat up

720
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,260
Look I'm just trying to

721
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,100
Get my TV fixed

722
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,180
So I can watch that last episode

723
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,380
Or leave it to beaver

724
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,880
Before I get on the saucer

725
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm not leaving until I see

726
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,480
Yeah

727
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,760
Leave it to beaver

728
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,700
Meaning leave it all to the female

729
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,860
Reproductive organs

730
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,880
No no no come on now

731
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,000
Or their decorations

732
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,520
Leave it to beaver man

733
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,220
You know everybody knows where it's at

734
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,700
Hustling evidence

735
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,640
If you mess with that reel to reel deck

736
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
Much longer it's going to cause an earthquake

737
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,460
There's been a lot of fracking around here

738
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,480
And that's a really old reel to reel deck

739
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,580
That's a fracking reel deck

740
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,480
The main reason it's here is to remind me

741
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,200
That maybe one day I should clean it

742
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,800
And see if I get it to work again

743
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,860
I still have a working one

744
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,000
The same 3440s that I bought

745
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,040
Overseas

746
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
We're looking at this

747
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,160
Antique four track reel to reel deck

748
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,720
Which simul-sync folks

749
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,040
What they do is they put a little plate

750
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,880
Like a

751
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,200
A

752
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,220
I don't know the real correct name

753
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,000
And make me cry

754
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,940
It's so beautiful

755
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,400
They were still using these things

756
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,380
For like magical mystery tour

757
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,200
No

758
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,280
They had really high professional

759
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,920
1963 old timey stuff

760
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,360
That was

761
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,440
The reels are one inch thick

762
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,540
And they have let's see four tracks on each

763
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,200
And they did four tracks live

764
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,580
Yeah unslaved

765
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,920
And then

766
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,260
And then

767
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,000
Martin and

768
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,180
And Emmerich

769
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,220
Mix that down

770
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,740
Yeah they had

771
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,440
Sennheiser butt phones

772
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,480
If you had two four track machines

773
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,060
That's what they had

774
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,880
Then it was like you had eight tracks

775
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,580
Exactly

776
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,560
And nobody else had them

777
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,860
And the other thing that saved their ass

778
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,320
Is when they mixed them on

779
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,380
You know these guys are really excited

780
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,180
About this stuff

781
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,160
You gotta let them go on

782
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Yeah

783
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,520
They mixed them on

784
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:50,740
Oh man

785
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,920
And also

786
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,280
The Abbey Road

787
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,400
Stuck with tube amplifiers forever

788
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,240
Because they were just

789
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,720
Just cheap

790
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,140
That's part of why we

791
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,680
Hear Beatle music and think

792
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,880
That's so lovely

793
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,500
Because they kept those damn tubes

794
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,080
Forever

795
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,480
Everybody else had transistors

796
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,800
My damn soul burnt out

797
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,200
Hey you're talking about

798
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,640
Our government

799
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,860
Now you're starting to

800
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,380
Lease me

801
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,460
Now I'm starting to

802
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,500
Look at you

803
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,100
You're talking about

804
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,220
You're talking about

805
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,440
National secrets

806
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
That maybe shouldn't be

807
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:31,980
Exposed at this time

808
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,040
Well since my baby

809
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,620
Left me

810
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,500
You know

811
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,760
Where'd you get that echo

812
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
Where'd your baby

813
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,860
Leave you anyway

814
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,740
Nothing

815
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,280
Red beans and rice

816
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,480
That's all I can remember

817
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,500
Because I have

818
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,680
P-frontal lobotomy

819
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,100
Yeah

820
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,060
Yeah I know

821
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,860
That was a

822
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,000
That was a rough night man

823
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,660
Sorry about that

824
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,600
A P-frontal

825
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,000
Your country

826
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,480
Apologizes to you

827
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,320
Yeah

828
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
You ain't got nothing

829
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,340
To apologize

830
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,780
It's my own damn fault

831
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,940
It's all our fault

832
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,600
And Ronald McDonald

833
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,960
Became general that night

834
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,200
He was the first man

835
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,760
He earned his pay

836
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,700
Well he

837
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,760
He earned his pay

838
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,680
And so did we all

839
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,180
Deserve his observance

840
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,400
And his loyalty

841
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,180
So this is pretty much

842
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,840
Isn't this not a miracle

843
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,420
That we're sitting here

844
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,080
With three mics

845
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,340
And two recorders

846
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,580
And talking to Cowboy Dave

847
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,360
Yeah it is

848
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,000
It's a miracle

849
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,060
That we haven't left

850
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,040
No it's a miracle

851
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,880
That any of us

852
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,720
Are still alive

853
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,660
I'd say that's the main one

854
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,940
I don't

855
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,180
I

856
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,120
Thank God

857
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,440
This isn't a telecast

858
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,300
Well see this little

859
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,240
Piece of thread here

860
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,900
Any analog

861
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,960
I'm sorry

862
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,560
Don't pull this

863
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,140
Piece of thread

864
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,800
It's what holds me together

865
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
See that's the social

866
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,320
Responsibility

867
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,480
That's the miracle

868
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,820
Is that one little thread

869
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,980
He was about to expose

870
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,480
Yet another societal truth

871
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,220
But did not

872
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,700
To save mankind

873
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
He didn't

874
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,260
Bring the joke up

875
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,200
Well which joke is that?

876
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,280
Let's destroy mankind

877
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,740
It's like vomit

878
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,680
It's like bring the joke up

879
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,600
It's another way to say

880
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,000
That the ideas vomit forth

881
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,860
You know while you're on

882
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,940
While you're trying to lend

883
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,920
I was thinking about that

884
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,420
Because it was like

885
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,920
I joked in my mouth a little

886
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,440
It slowed down

887
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,060
To where it was like

888
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,860
Repeller speed

889
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,880
And a lot of jerking

890
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,280
And it just

891
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,120
Sent me for a while

892
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,300
A loop

893
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,760
Oh I'm hoping it doesn't

894
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Happen on the way home

895
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,060
Me too

896
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,080
Yeah

897
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,460
I don't even know

898
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:04,600
What you're talking about

899
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,240
It probably won't

900
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,280
I mean those are very rare

901
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,500
On jets you don't ever

902
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,820
Get those parameters

903
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,580
Oh it's a behavior pattern

904
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,660
That he likes to

905
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,380
To scare everybody else

906
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,120
In the car with

907
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,780
I just need to take

908
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,860
A mental rest

909
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,580
Yeah

910
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,360
About you know

911
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,460
I'm sure all the people

912
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,140
Here in the studio

913
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,920
Understand that

914
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,640
In the studio audience

915
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,100
But now you get sick

916
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,440
If you're flying the plane

917
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,800
Or driving the

918
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:28,940
Supersonic

919
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,260
He says he doesn't have

920
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,100
That kind of sickness

921
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,880
He has some other

922
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,060
Rare kind of sickness

923
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,320
You know that was

924
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,580
Like Gary had a good idea

925
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,240
Like once you are very sick

926
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,980
Then you can drive

927
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,580
The submarine

928
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,700
And that usually works

929
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,660
But once the process

930
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,920
Starts

931
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,840
And you get to a place

932
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,620
Where you can't

933
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,980
Now I'm out of whack

934
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,600
And it's

935
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,040
What saved me

936
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,420
Hours of being out of whack

937
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:48,880
Was simply

938
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,500
I think the time

939
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,080
In the plane

940
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,180
Was this long

941
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,660
And then the time

942
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,720
Of recovering from that

943
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,400
Is this long

944
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,060
And like when I went

945
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,940
With Gary on the ship

946
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,760
On the boat rather

947
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,460
Out into the bay

948
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,600
That wasn't a few hours

949
00:40:59,600 --> 00:40:59,920
Of that

950
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,400
So I spent a few hours

951
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,360
And my preacher tool

952
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,020
Is this long

953
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,880
I just want you all

954
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,280
To know that

955
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,340
It's at least this long

956
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,200
I'm sure

957
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,080
I'm sure

958
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,840
It's just a tongue

959
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,640
I never see anything

960
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,160
So small

961
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,840
Cowboy Dave

962
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,080
How did you discover Bob

963
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,840
Yes

964
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:16,940
Yeah

965
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,420
That's where you talk

966
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,060
Game's over

967
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,400
Put in another quarter

968
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,440
Our show here

969
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,040
In the bay area

970
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,460
Is brutal

971
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,960
It's just

972
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,840
Really fast

973
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,320
I don't know

974
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,160
How could it be

975
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,840
Both brutal

976
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,260
And osteopathic

977
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,000
At the same time

978
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,640
So you guys are

979
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,720
You believe in

980
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,640
Weir collusion

981
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
And that Matterhorn guy

982
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,740
Whatever his name was

983
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,500
Smiley

984
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:37,840
Yeah

985
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,240
Those guys are all

986
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,640
Secret dupes

987
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:42,880
Of the

988
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,080
The misbegotten

989
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,800
What's it called

990
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,040
Guys

991
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,980
You know what I'm saying

992
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,440
Schrodinger's

993
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,020
Exactly what you're saying

994
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,940
Schrodinger's dives

995
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,040
We are sitting

996
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,080
On the golden microphone

997
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,920
So we don't have to worry

998
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,200
Oh

999
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,640
God

1000
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,320
Some of them

1001
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh

1002
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,060
It's because

1003
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,700
Because you have

1004
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,300
Licked pee

1005
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,340
On the wrong place

1006
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,380
He never did answer

1007
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,900
My question

1008
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,720
I just don't know

1009
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,780
I'll answer it for him

1010
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,320
What was it

1011
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,180
It was about

1012
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,040
The origination

1013
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,160
How'd you discover Bob

1014
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,760
Yeah

1015
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,380
Where did you find

1016
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,860
His skeleton

1017
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,600
Where did you

1018
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,480
Climb to find

1019
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,080
The fossil of Bob

1020
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,760
In the trash

1021
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,740
That's where you found

1022
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,640
It's the greatest thing

1023
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,540
I saw him

1024
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,300
In the new lead lights

1025
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,020
They just put it

1026
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,620
In my neighborhood

1027
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,520
As a part of the

1028
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,820
You know

1029
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,860
Reconstruction era

1030
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,320
Where they were

1031
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,080
Turning everybody

1032
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,980
Into communists

1033
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,200
But I couldn't

1034
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,940
I couldn't remember

1035
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,540
How to spell

1036
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,280
The third way

1037
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,540
So that's why

1038
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,200
I had to go back

1039
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,660
To Eurasia

1040
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,620
Eurasia what

1041
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,880
Blue

1042
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,280
That's what I thought

1043
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,740
You'd say

1044
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,720
Eurasia blue

1045
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,520
Oh I see

1046
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,980
There were three of them

1047
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,620
There was blue

1048
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,120
Red and

1049
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,520
A dollar

1050
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,960
And I'll see your bet

1051
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,900
Well that's the most

1052
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Ridiculous argument

1053
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,600
I've ever heard

1054
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,780
Especially from a PhD

1055
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,620
Like yourself

1056
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,560
A person who

1057
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,900
Publishes in

1058
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,860
Scientific journals

1059
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,640
Every week

1060
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,340
And has people

1061
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,720
Slathering after

1062
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,560
His every word

1063
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,160
As if he was

1064
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,200
Some sort of

1065
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,020
Great scribe

1066
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,220
Or epopt of a church

1067
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,280
Of the subunits

1068
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,720
Whatever

1069
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,080
The

1070
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,600
Big

1071
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,160
Let's talk

1072
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,440
Personal

1073
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,340
I can assemble

1074
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:10,840
That remark

1075
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,340
I would like to

1076
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,960
Thank you

1077
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,120
For not forgetting

1078
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,740
Yeah you're talking

1079
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,580
About L. Ron Hubbard

1080
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:17,840
Right

1081
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,980
Well he did

1082
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,900
Start your church

1083
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,940
He started a bigger church

1084
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,480
Than this

1085
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,420
Little church

1086
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,240
In this house

1087
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,320
And he started

1088
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,260
Well it depends

1089
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,840
On what you mean

1090
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,540
By big

1091
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,220
I mean

1092
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,560
If you mean large

1093
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,240
Yeah sure

1094
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,420
If you mean sizable

1095
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,980
Or if you mean

1096
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,280
Successful

1097
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,260
Or financially

1098
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,620
Rewarding

1099
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,020
Yeah but we have

1100
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,580
More dots

1101
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,720
That's exactly it

1102
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,080
I mean

1103
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,200
Who has more slack

1104
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,840
Who's richer in slack

1105
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,420
A Scientologist

1106
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,640
Or a subgenius

1107
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,860
Hold on your pain

1108
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,380
Well it probably

1109
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,120
Depends on

1110
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,500
The Scientologist

1111
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,140
Or the subgenius

1112
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:53,560
Yeah some of them

1113
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,220
Have a lot

1114
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,340
But still I would

1115
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:55,920
Believe that

1116
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,140
Oh boy

1117
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,320
Oh boy

1118
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,580
The S-clams

1119
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,060
Are in

1120
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,900
Tumult

1121
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,040
The what

1122
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,300
The what

1123
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,720
Clams

1124
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,640
The subgenius

1125
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,540
The ones you mentioned

1126
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,060
The S-clams

1127
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,460
The unmentionable

1128
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:05,820
Yeah

1129
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,560
The S

1130
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,540
The ones that start

1131
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,220
With S

1132
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,080
There's the F-clams

1133
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,580
Yeah

1134
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,380
Oh yeah right

1135
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:11,760
Yeah

1136
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,160
In the river

1137
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,980
They're in a

1138
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,220
Tribal cleat

1139
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,380
Or a tribal key

1140
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:17,840
I think

1141
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,760
I forgot

1142
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,560
That's when I was

1143
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,200
A geek philosopher

1144
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,240
You know what I'm saying

1145
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:22,760
Yeah

1146
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,460
Yeah

1147
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,700
That's what I was

1148
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,280
Trying to get at

1149
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,360
When you were

1150
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,320
A geek philosopher

1151
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,940
When you were

1152
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,780
A past tense

1153
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,140
Yeah

1154
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,080
When I was trying

1155
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,300
To be so very hard

1156
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,700
And I felt disillusioned

1157
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,480
So soon

1158
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,860
Didn't you?

1159
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,840
It's a tough life man

1160
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,940
Yeah

1161
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,200
It could be a lot tougher though

1162
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,260
Just think of all the people

1163
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,380
In different places

1164
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:43,980
Who are

1165
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,960
Having it more tougher

1166
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,740
Than you are

1167
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,100
I know

1168
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,980
It just makes that

1169
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,180
Just

1170
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,500
Makes me feel

1171
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,240
So terrible

1172
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,460
I just

1173
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,300
I feel like

1174
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,220
I have to reach out

1175
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,680
For something to believe in

1176
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,140
I just

1177
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,480
I

1178
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:56,740
Wait

1179
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,120
I don't

1180
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,560
I don't know what I believe

1181
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,620
I'm more tougher than you are

1182
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,180
What about the guys

1183
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,820
I believe I'm gonna

1184
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,180
Open this beer can here

1185
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,060
I feel bad for the guys

1186
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,760
That only have

1187
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,940
Four Ferraris

1188
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,980
What about the guys

1189
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,660
That only have

1190
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,560
Six girlfriends

1191
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,340
Six wives

1192
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,320
Six wives

1193
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,580
Four Ferraris

1194
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:15,860
I mean

1195
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,620
What do they do?

1196
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,500
Why are they being

1197
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
Punished like that?

1198
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,760
How come

1199
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,540
They get to have

1200
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,360
More stuff than

1201
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:22,840
Because they

1202
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,900
They also get to

1203
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,500
Go to the

1204
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,020
Stang Ranch

1205
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,380
And have land there

1206
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,100
I couldn't

1207
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,460
Cry because

1208
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,040
I didn't have a

1209
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,080
PlayStation 4

1210
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,760
Until I met a man

1211
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,400
Who didn't even

1212
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,160
Have a Wii

1213
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,180
A man without

1214
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,020
A Wii

1215
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,720
Yeah

1216
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,680
Think about it

1217
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,140
Sad

1218
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,680
Sad

1219
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,240
Okay sad

1220
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,180
But every man

1221
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,740
Has a me

1222
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,040
A big one

1223
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,420
No actually

1224
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,660
When you have a Wii

1225
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,020
You create a me

1226
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,520
Of yourself

1227
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,400
It looks like

1228
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,100
A little you

1229
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,100
It's inside the Wii

1230
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,660
It must be

1231
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,100
Pretty

1232
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,960
I'm not kidding

1233
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,900
I'm not kidding

1234
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,540
You can create

1235
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,260
Little versions

1236
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,040
Of your friends

1237
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,840
So you can have

1238
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,140
Your kids

1239
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,160
And your buddies

1240
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,540
And they're all

1241
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,060
Called me

1242
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,060
I have

1243
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,860
Jimi Hendrix

1244
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,620
In mind

1245
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,760
He parties with me

1246
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,160
In Maryland

1247
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,620
You got Jimi Hendrix

1248
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,160
In your what?

1249
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,740
In my Wii

1250
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,620
In your Wii?

1251
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,380
In my Wii

1252
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,440
I have Jimi Hendrix

1253
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,260
I have my dad

1254
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,200
Who's been dead

1255
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,980
For three years

1256
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,160
My mom-in-law

1257
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,720
A lot of relatives

1258
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,100
And I have

1259
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,160
From what you told me

1260
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,540
About these subgeniuses

1261
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:29,800
I have

1262
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,680
I catch their souls

1263
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,940
You have your dad

1264
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,820
And Jimi Hendrix

1265
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,780
In the same Wii?

1266
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,260
Yeah

1267
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,420
There's a thing called

1268
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,740
A face catcher

1269
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,220
I hope your dad

1270
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:38,920
Has not seen anything

1271
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,640
About his shoes

1272
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:39,660
But they're like

1273
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,100
They're homunculus

1274
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,540
In the most classical sense

1275
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,540
You literally own

1276
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,920
The spirit of the god or dam

1277
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,940
Not the god or dam

1278
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,120
Wrong

1279
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,600
The uh

1280
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,580
God or dam

1281
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,440
You know what they call it

1282
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,280
The guy that used to

1283
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,180
Beat everybody up

1284
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,740
That's a bad mother

1285
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,480
Whoa tan

1286
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
Oh man

1287
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,060
Not bad

1288
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:54,820
God or dam

1289
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,600
I hate that name

1290
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,540
Well it was a verb

1291
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,080
I thought it was a verb

1292
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,380
From Sterno

1293
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,000
But to

1294
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,980
To uh

1295
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,640
Emphasize wild music

1296
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:04,920
Yeah

1297
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,040
To sterno?

1298
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,300
Wo tan?

1299
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,760
Yeah to wo tan

1300
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,240
To wo tan is a verb

1301
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,940
Right

1302
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,480
Oh I'd be so very

1303
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,300
Bold enough

1304
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:11,980
To escape

1305
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,880
Yeah

1306
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,680
To escape

1307
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,300
The strictures of

1308
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,480
Organized music

1309
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,240
The strictures of wo tan

1310
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,080
Little strictures

1311
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,400
Well there was

1312
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,720
Doctors for Bob

1313
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,100
And uh

1314
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,480
Philo and I

1315
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,420
Had

1316
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:25,840
And

1317
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,300
And uh

1318
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,500
John

1319
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,180
John Hagenbrenner

1320
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,240
Actually had a band

1321
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,480
But we didn't have a name

1322
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,920
And Doctors for Bob

1323
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,720
Had a name

1324
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,480
When was that?

1325
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,380
But you thought it was

1326
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,260
About uh

1327
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,480
1879

1328
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,380
Something like that

1329
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,160
And he

1330
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,960
Uh

1331
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,600
I'm sure it was

1332
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,280
Philo

1333
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:42,720
Said well

1334
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,680
We have to have

1335
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,440
Band names

1336
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,940
We gotta be

1337
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,800
Doctors for something

1338
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,880
So it's gotta be wo tan

1339
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,240
Yeah cause you can't

1340
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,860
Call it Jehovah one

1341
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,860
We're not gonna call it

1342
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,060
Doctors for Jehovah one

1343
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,420
That sounds

1344
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,200
Judeo-Christian

1345
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,760
Exactly

1346
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,380
So we wanted to

1347
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,580
Something that sounded like

1348
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,140
A little more like

1349
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,160
Marvel comics

1350
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,600
You know

1351
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,740
And in those days

1352
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,940
Wo tan sounded more

1353
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,000
Impressive than

1354
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,500
Odin

1355
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,920
Or it's all Odin this

1356
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,840
And Odin that now

1357
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,920
But we were all into

1358
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,300
Wo tan

1359
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,600
And technically

1360
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,480
Doing the doctor music

1361
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,680
Should be called

1362
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,160
Doctoring

1363
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,600
But some

1364
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,020
Or bobbing

1365
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:17,420
Or something

1366
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,660
But it turned out

1367
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,060
Being called

1368
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:19,860
Wo tanning

1369
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,720
That's not my fault

1370
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,880
It's not my fault

1371
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,120
And I never liked

1372
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,860
Anti music

1373
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,380
Okay

1374
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,020
Yeah okay

1375
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,420
Well my

1376
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,200
My ears are mighty

1377
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,580
Thor

1378
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,380
One of the things

1379
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,180
That intrigues me

1380
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,000
Is there are also

1381
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,160
Catch words for the

1382
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,840
All right kind of folks

1383
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,040
As they're identified

1384
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,240
Now all the

1385
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,820
Norse gods

1386
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,400
Were

1387
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,580
Yeah no tan

1388
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,800
The white supremacists

1389
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,260
That lived in

1390
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:41,480
The north

1391
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:41,500
Yeah wo tan

1392
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,220
Had no tan

1393
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,780
Cause you were

1394
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,300
Here white

1395
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,400
So they have a

1396
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,900
Double meaning

1397
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,820
Like all language

1398
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,260
Or hamburger

1399
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,820
Or something

1400
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,300
Yeah hamburger

1401
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,260
Is a

1402
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,540
German name

1403
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,740
It's a very white

1404
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,160
Representation

1405
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,620
Of the hand

1406
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,960
Yeah it's intriguing

1407
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,380
Because

1408
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,400
But queso

1409
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,180
But reguesa

1410
00:48:59,180 --> 00:48:59,820
That's another

1411
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,540
Another continent

1412
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,560
Yeah it's

1413
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,560
Divided equally

1414
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,700
Amongst all the tribes

1415
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,240
But everybody

1416
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,000
Still has to

1417
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,260
Sit at the same table

1418
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,660
And vomit at the same time

1419
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,380
And argue with

1420
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,140
The same kind of

1421
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,280
No

1422
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,460
Let's not go there

1423
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,820
Okay

1424
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,900
I can prove to you

1425
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,840
That nobody else

1426
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,560
Has to vomit

1427
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,480
Just one guy

1428
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,660
It only takes one guy

1429
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,020
Yeah

1430
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,140
And I was thinking that

1431
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:18,760
All the way in

1432
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,180
In the plane

1433
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,300
Cause I was ready to go

1434
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,640
You're a volunteer

1435
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,140
Only one guy

1436
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,000
Only one guy

1437
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,180
Oh don't do it here

1438
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,840
Don't do it here

1439
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,180
It's me

1440
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:25,720
It's me

1441
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,360
Hooray

1442
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,140
Yeah

1443
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,580
And I was amazed

1444
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,140
That you know

1445
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,660
I'm feeling like

1446
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,320
None of these people

1447
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,940
Are getting sick

1448
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,920
I had food poisoning

1449
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,560
Yeah

1450
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,740
Not even on a plane

1451
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,500
Last week

1452
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,240
It's nice to be not on a plane

1453
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,740
So miserable

1454
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,220
Those feelings

1455
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:38,560
Yeah

1456
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,900
And then

1457
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,440
Then your bladder explodes

1458
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,640
And the whole front of the plane

1459
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,220
Smells like

1460
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,060
Death

1461
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,500
Yeah

1462
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,800
That happened to me

1463
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,580
It just happened a few days ago

1464
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:50,720
Not at all

1465
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,620
I hate when that happens

1466
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,580
Someone left the

1467
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,800
The fart clearing airplane

1468
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,060
You guys are talking about it

1469
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,500
The airplane

1470
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,040
Well friends

1471
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,500
This is the new theme

1472
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,200
Of this show

1473
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,240
The airplane

1474
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,720
The airplane clearing fart

1475
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,880
If you want

1476
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,580
Can you say that

1477
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,140
Yeah

1478
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,600
If you want

1479
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:05,880
There was a

1480
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,560
There was a fart

1481
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,500
That cleared an airplane

1482
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,280
I love it

1483
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Yes it was

1484
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,520
You would not

1485
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,280
Have loved it

1486
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,000
All the

1487
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
All the airport employees

1488
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,980
Ran off the plane

1489
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,840
They wouldn't even help

1490
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,820
The people off the plane

1491
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,380
I kept thinking

1492
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
They had to fight

1493
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,060
Their way off

1494
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,140
I wish I didn't clean it now

1495
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,480
You know

1496
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,540
With the bad air there

1497
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,520
Yeah I wish I had

1498
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,840
An airplane clearing fart

1499
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,320
Or as weatherman would say

1500
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:26,960
Sewer gas

1501
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,460
The captain was the first one out

1502
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,640
Hey

1503
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,180
Yep

1504
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:30,600
He was

1505
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
I love when that happens

1506
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,400
You know we couldn't even say

1507
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,140
There's a certain frequency

1508
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,040
They'd say a fox smells

1509
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,120
His own hole first

1510
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,080
But in this case

1511
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,980
I'm not sure

1512
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,100
I didn't believe

1513
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,540
Yeah but they're all

1514
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,980
Different frequencies you know

1515
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,900
This is a very

1516
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,300
Serious discussion

1517
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,180
Because I can tell if you're

1518
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:44,780
Related to somebody

1519
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,620
When they fart

1520
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,160
Because they've been eating

1521
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,420
The same kind of salami

1522
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,420
And then

1523
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,620
These like ubiquitous

1524
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,840
Brotherhood is everywhere

1525
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,460
This makes me really glad

1526
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:54,860
This was

1527
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,460
It was probably an aviation

1528
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,400
It was probably aviation gas

1529
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,200
Wouldn't you say

1530
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,080
I was just saying

1531
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,640
It was a good thing

1532
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,580
Hal wasn't here

1533
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,220
Oh yeah

1534
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,120
Now let's call

1535
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,240
Hal on fire life

1536
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,460
Yeah

1537
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,600
That would be great

1538
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,340
Yeah

1539
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,620
Then I can go to bed

1540
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:10,740
Everybody will talk

1541
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:10,740


1542
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,260
You have to eat your

1543
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:11,960
Bounty first

1544
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,380
Well you know what

1545
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,520
The Ignis Fowlish is

1546
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:15,980
That's the

1547
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,000
False fire of the lake

1548
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,760
That the settlers

1549
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,360
Used to

1550
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:19,400
Burn

1551
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,620
The lake

1552
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,900
When they thought

1553
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,920
The Indians were going to

1554
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,240
You know the Indian spirits

1555
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:23,940
Were going to come

1556
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,420
And get them

1557
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,020
It turns out now

1558
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,080
We look out the window

1559
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,100
And it's all been turned

1560
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,740
It's all been proven true

1561
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,460
The Indians did kill us

1562
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,560
No we killed them

1563
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,100
And so we became them

1564
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,860
And we killed ourselves

1565
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,380
Too

1566
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,840
Oh I see

1567
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,060
Yeah

1568
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,060
I've been hungry

1569
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,260
For buffalo meat lately

1570
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,280
I was wondering why

1571
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,600
Amazing how that happens

1572
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:42,880
Yeah

1573
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,320
You were in

1574
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,580
Buffalo

1575
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,360
Smashing acorns

1576
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,720
That's only a few hours

1577
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,220
From here

1578
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,780
Mmm

1579
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,960
Two mashed acorns

1580
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,380
Yeah

1581
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,980
By an Indian store

1582
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,400
Mmm

1583
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,040
Green beans and

1584
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,680
Meadow garlic

1585
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,400
Made with

1586
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,940
Rendered

1587
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,480
Beer

1588
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,800
Bear fat

1589
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,220
Oh

1590
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:58,840
Ah

1591
00:51:59,400 --> 00:51:59,500
Ah

1592
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,300
Somebody's got

1593
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,380
Oh the train's here

1594
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,820
Yeah

1595
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:03,980
That means someone

1596
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,060
Left a message

1597
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,860
On my phone

1598
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,720
But it's not

1599
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,100
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1600
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,780
Right

1601
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:09,800
Somebody else

1602
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,020
But you're sure

1603
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:10,080
She's not

1604
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,440
That crazy crazy

1605
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,120
Oh wait no no

1606
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,240
The phone

1607
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:13,860
That means somebody

1608
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,840
Sent me a text

1609
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,480
Hasn't

1610
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,500
That means somebody

1611
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,640
Sent me a message

1612
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:19,640


1613
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,080
DIRGEful

1614
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,080
Scary noise

1615
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,860
Cause it usually means

1616
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,560
Something really bad

1617
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,460
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1618
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,900
Hasn't left a message

1619
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,480
For the last

1620
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,860
43 minutes

1621
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,060
Why don't you read

1622
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,260
The text over the air

1623
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,080
For our listeners

1624
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,720
Huh

1625
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,520
Why don't you read

1626
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,300
The text over the air

1627
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,680
It's all scary

1628
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,200
Here at Cowboy Dave

1629
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,640
I'm afraid that if I

1630
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,740
Turn it off the phone

1631
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,600
Dave will disappear

1632
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,180
Cowboy Dave

1633
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,320
Can you send me a new show

1634
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,360
It's really scary here

1635
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,580
It's very

1636
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,260
You know

1637
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,020
Hallucinogenic

1638
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,720
If you tried it

1639
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,620
A few thousand times

1640
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,120
Like I

1641
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,500
You know

1642
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,480
You have to get used to it

1643
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,520
Of course at first

1644
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,320
Okay

1645
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,880
At least

1646
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,440
Does it the baloney artist

1647
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,720
Will try and regiment you

1648
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,240
Into believing

1649
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,320
When they let you out of prison

1650
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,200
For the first and final time

1651
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,880
I don't know

1652
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,740
Dang

1653
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:56,900
Now we're going

1654
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,840
Into some deep territory

1655
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,620
We just got this

1656
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,760
Cheap dehydrated

1657
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,540
Powdered show

1658
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,340
In California

1659
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,300
It's really

1660
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,740
Hard to make

1661
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,740
Anything delicious

1662
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,500
Out of it

1663
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,060
But do you remember

1664
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,620
When you were kids

1665
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,300
When you could only get

1666
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,640
Near show

1667
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,800
Near show

1668
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,780
That was terrible

1669
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,460
It was like only 1% funny

1670
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:12,800
Yeah

1671
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,700
Yeah it was like urinating

1672
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,600
On the pancakes

1673
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,220
You'd seen

1674
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,120
You know

1675
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,400
Yeah

1676
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,680
Pancakes

1677
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,740
I did a whole half hour

1678
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,120
On pancakes

1679
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,880
Randomly

1680
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,280
On Radio Flint

1681
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:22,900
And they played it

1682
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,440
On KVFN

1683
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,160
It was pretty funny

1684
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:24,800
Huh

1685
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,640
Especially because

1686
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,120
I was just grabbing off of

1687
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,600
You know

1688
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,260
Sites as fast

1689
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,600
Like any

1690
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,060
Sugar and iron

1691
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,840
Pancake

1692
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,300
Any pancake thing

1693
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:32,620
Yeah

1694
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,520
Just as an exercise

1695
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,440
And it worked out great

1696
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,760
One of the few times

1697
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,860
That kind of thing does folks

1698
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,280
Ooh la la

1699
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,080
French toast

1700
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,740
And burn up

1701
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,060
You know

1702
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,220
Or you can have

1703
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,840
A radio show

1704
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,660
Like Rural War Room

1705
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,600
Byron Werner's

1706
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,800
Donovan Soot Show

1707
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,260
Yeah do that

1708
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,560
Where they

1709
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,780
They'll play like

1710
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,500
Every version of

1711
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,020
Age of Aquarius

1712
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,580
Nice

1713
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:56,780
Simultaneously

1714
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,400
Yeah

1715
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:58,900
And there's about

1716
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,960
40 versions

1717
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,500
That's

1718
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:00,780
Inspired

1719
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,380
Yeah

1720
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,260
That's hard to do

1721
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,260
That's very experimental

1722
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,940
And you know

1723
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,600
What players do you get

1724
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,720
They also get their PSAs

1725
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,360
Out of the way

1726
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,740
Real quick that way too

1727
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,140
Right there on the screen

1728
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,780
They show their PSAs

1729
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,340
On the screen

1730
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,040
Well to everybody

1731
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,840
Their urologist

1732
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,820
Must be really upset

1733
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,600
With this

1734
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,040
You're not supposed

1735
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,620
To do that

1736
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,260
No he's

1737
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,640
He's quite confluent

1738
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,980
With it

1739
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,060
He's even had an argument

1740
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,340
With a scholarly journal

1741
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,960
A web based journal

1742
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,660
I think it was

1743
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,560
About three years ago

1744
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,940
It was Dr. Mudd

1745
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,900
Dr. Filippino

1746
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,040
And Janet X. Park

1747
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,540
And they all were

1748
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,120
You know

1749
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,820
They got all

1750
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,920
Emotionally damaged

1751
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,060
From the warfare

1752
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,860
Yeah well

1753
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,700
Byron's

1754
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:40,760
You know

1755
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:40,760


1756
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:40,760


1757
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,000
His upcoming biopsy

1758
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,620
Is going to be done

1759
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,440
On the air too

1760
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:44,820
Because

1761
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,280
That's not funny man

1762
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,720
Yeah man

1763
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,160
That's

1764
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,540
That's pretty serious biopsy

1765
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,600
Well yeah

1766
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,960
But his PSAs

1767
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,500
You know

1768
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,440
They were

1769
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
Through the roof

1770
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,220
They were really scared

1771
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:57,840
They were up in there

1772
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,160
For 20s

1773
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,600
I'm surprised

1774
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,500
He's even alive

1775
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,320
Are you listening Byron

1776
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,020
I hope this is

1777
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,360
You know

1778
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,120
Encouraging to you

1779
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,360
Yeah Byron

1780
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,160
No he's

1781
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,920
He doesn't

1782
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,620
Nobody listens

1783
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,420
To each other's shows

1784
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:07,840
Really

1785
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,140
No

1786
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,060
Stupid shows

1787
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,700
You don't have time

1788
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,120
To listen even to your own show

1789
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,240
The correct thing

1790
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:14,640
Yes

1791
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,860
No shows

1792
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,100
Hey the last show

1793
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,700
I was on

1794
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,020
Was on

1795
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,980
I went on a

1796
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,660
A student show

1797
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,120
On the radio station

1798
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,640
At UC Santa Cruz

1799
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,840
A video station

1800
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,340
A young fellow

1801
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:25,840
I know

1802
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,180
Was a

1803
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,140
DJ on the station

1804
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,500
And he interviewed me

1805
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,220
Wow

1806
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,200
And he had to

1807
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,640
Of course

1808
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,240
He had to of course

1809
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,000
Edit the interview

1810
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,940
Because he had to

1811
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,320
Take off

1812
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,960
Bottle parts

1813
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,400
About all the fun things

1814
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,280
I did when I was

1815
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,860
A young artist

1816
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,220
Because

1817
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:40,560
Uh oh

1818
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,520
Young artists aren't

1819
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,560
They're not allowed

1820
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,740
To have fun like that anymore

1821
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,040
Well they're taught

1822
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,800
Not to

1823
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,420
They're web presence

1824
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:47,980
You know

1825
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,660
And their ability

1826
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,180
To eat

1827
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,640
Guacamole toast

1828
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,760
And stuff like that

1829
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,580
There's so much more

1830
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,400
You have to do now

1831
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,040
To be an artist

1832
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,180
Than when we were artists

1833
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,160
And if they know

1834
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,120
How to draw anything

1835
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,440
They basically have to

1836
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,860
Wear mittens all the time

1837
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,220
Yeah

1838
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:01,980
Because that just

1839
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,320
That wrecks your art

1840
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,400
So

1841
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,540
The ability to draw

1842
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,820
A picture of a cow

1843
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,920
That looks like a cow

1844
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,400
That's

1845
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,800
I saw

1846
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,260
Man that's

1847
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,960
You might as well

1848
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,140
Get out of art school

1849
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,380
I had a wonderful thing

1850
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,980
The other day

1851
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,100
I found

1852
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:15,740
One of my

1853
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,460
One of my

1854
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,620
Ex-employees

1855
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,880
Is really a success now

1856
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,560
I googled

1857
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,380
Um

1858
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,880
His name

1859
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,520
Which I can't

1860
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,320
I'm not going to say here

1861
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,260
But I found out

1862
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,920
He is the top artist

1863
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,980
In San Quentin

1864
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,620
He's serving

1865
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,540
In San Quentin

1866
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,680
In the University

1867
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,920
Of People Delight

1868
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,120
Yeah

1869
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,980
He's serving

1870
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,680
Twelve years

1871
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,560
In San Quentin

1872
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,420
But he's in

1873
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,080
Art shows everywhere

1874
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,940
Because he's a really

1875
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,520
Good artist

1876
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,580
Wasn't a great

1877
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,200
Employee

1878
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:40,900
Because he didn't

1879
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,640
Understand the

1880
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,540
The concept

1881
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,680
Of scub and slub

1882
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:43,940
But

1883
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,460
He could really

1884
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,420
Draw well

1885
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,840
And I'm happy to see

1886
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,960
He's reached

1887
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,140
Such a point of success

1888
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,680
And no

1889
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,340
I'm not kidding

1890
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,640
Let me digitally

1891
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,860
Insert audience there

1892
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,960
So it sounds like

1893
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,540
People actually

1894
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,340
Listen to the show

1895
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,380
Well we know that

1896
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,180
At least one person

1897
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,720
Was listening to the show

1898
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,680
You

1899
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,440
But you can't hear

1900
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,400
The rest of the show

1901
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,500
Because the show is over

1902
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,560
But

1903
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,820
We did record

1904
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,460
Well over an hour's

1905
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,760
Worth of talk

1906
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,140
And later on

1907
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:15,880
Princess We

1908
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,800
And Reverend

1909
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,420
Eohippus Lovechild

1910
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,800
Got on Tarzan's

1911
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,460
Radio station

1912
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,080
But we'll play that

1913
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,800
Next week

1914
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,380
And for now

1915
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,380
Let it be known

1916
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,480
That you can learn more

1917
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,380
About the

1918
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,860
Puzzling Evidence show

1919
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,040
Which has been on

1920
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,060
Even longer than

1921
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,800
This show

1922
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,480
Hour of Slack

1923
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,120
And

1924
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,560
I'm going to

1925
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,040
The other

1926
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,600
Subgenius radio shows too

1927
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,020
At

1928
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,040
Subgenius.com

1929
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,440
Although you might

1930
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,300
Have to look for

1931
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,820
The little

1932
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,440
Button that says

1933
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,980
Radio

1934
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,020
At the

1935
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,140
Top

1936
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,400
Right

1937
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,200
So thanks

1938
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,060
Doug

1939
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,020
And Gary

1940
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,700
For coming on

1941
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,680
Hour of Slack

1942
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,020
In person

1943
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,460
That was so fun

1944
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,700
We even got caught

1945
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,140
In a

1946
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,220
Texas hailstorm

1947
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,780
While driving around

1948
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,700
On the ranch

1949
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,560
Very

1950
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,960
Very far from shelter

1951
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,860
And you can see

1952
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,760
Buddy

1953
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,340
And yours truly

1954
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,660
Reverend Ivan Stang

1955
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,400
Trapped in the back

1956
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,040
Of the utility vehicle

1957
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,300
With no roof

1958
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Being pelted by

1959
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,360
Texas hail

1960
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,820
On my

1961
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,160
YouTube channel

1962
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,860
Which is

1963
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,180
One word

1964
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,000
Lowercase

1965
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,600
Rev Stang

1966
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,800
Praise Bob

1967
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,240
From PR News

1968
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:37,920
In Washington

1969
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,280
I'm touring Europe

1970
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,400
The EU's top trade official

1971
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,780
Says Robert is there

1972
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,460
She's not sure how

1973
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,820
PR's far right

1974
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,460
Former white

1975
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,040
Has more

1976
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,500
He then moved on

1977
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,820
To Zurich

1978
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,400
To Switzerland

1979
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,080
Where he

1980
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,440
Hungary

1981
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,180
Is on our side

1982
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,220
Like PR News

1983
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,240
President Trump

1984
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,140
Is going to vote

1985
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,180
In a special

1986
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:58,620
Tuesday

1987
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,080
As PR's report

1988
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,560
Reports

1989
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,040
Democrats say

1990
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,720
PR News

1991
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,940
The gunman

1992
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,420
Who killed

1993
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,120
Three mental health workers

1994
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,260
That this is

1995
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:07,540
PR

1996
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,960
The UN

1997
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,720
High Commissioner

1998
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,420
For Human Rights

1999
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,140
Said on Friday

2000
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,300
That attacks on

2001
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,700
PR News

2002
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,960
Cannot go unanswered

2003
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,760
The Pentagon

2004
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,700
Has released plans

2005
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,320
For aircraft

2006
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,520
But there will be

2007
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,460
No PR News

2008
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,560
In order to protect

2009
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,640
The street pavement

2010
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,400
In Washington
