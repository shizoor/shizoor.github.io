1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
Let me make this perfectly clear to you.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,940
The contents of this document are a matter of national security,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,620
constituting an assault on the character of several important party members,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,000
as well as a blatant violation of the Articles of Allegiance.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,300
Any discussion of this document or its contents will be regarded at the very least as an act of sedition,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,420
if not a willful act of treason.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Ah, yes, dear friends, speaking here from Stang Ranch in Stang County, Texas, with no studio.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,520
This Hour of Slack was an easy one for me and a great change of pace

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,740
because it's all one fantastic old-school media barrage by the hard-working and talented Reverend Exister,

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,200
normally heard weekly on our sister subgenius show, The Ministry of Slack.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,980
It's a collage using what would be to him older movies and music,

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,120
and it reminds me of our carefully arranged media barrages that we used to create on reel-to-reel tape

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,680
back in the 80s before Hour of Slack was born.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,560
I don't think Bob or subgenius are mentioned at all, but it is pure subgenius.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,820
It's 90 minutes long, so this is only part one of Ship of State by Reverend Exister.

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,400
You would do well to put it out of your mind.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
My, what a peculiar place to have a party.

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,020
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't...

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,200
We're doing this.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,700
After all, we haven't been invited.

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,640
And curiosity often leads to trouble.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,320
Goodbye, Dinah.

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,220
Goodbye!

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:44,640


26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,420
We haven't had a party in this for a while.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,580
We've tried all profits, and then murals, and then, of course, disease epigamy,

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,420
and all the other things.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,580
We've tried all profits.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,540
Time's coming.

31
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,040
One way or another.

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,460
And too many days to do without.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,720
We've had to bring in a lot of bad stuff.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,140
We've struggled to get a called-up.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:14,900
The average increase in Schweetzel任 Maar,

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
as well the increase in masochism abroad

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,640
has grown more�

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,060
in terms of the radiation.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,740
Thank you.

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:19,920
Thank you.

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,580
We're good to go.

42
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank you.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,800
Thank you.

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,580
...and went straight to killing Dodson Drew and called in the signer.

45
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,820
...and you, a crackhead, a crack...

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,020
...and you, a crackhead, a crack...

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,520
I don't think Dodson Drew said she put up a mic as the man attacked her.

48
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,620
She choked him.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,080
She choked him out like, f***!

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,700
Dodson Drew says, you got a good look on your face.

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,940
...and again, now you turn to the next thing that happened.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,040
And then in verse 12, he opens the sixth seal.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:13,280
And behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as hair, the moon as blood, and stars of heaven fell.

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,020
And he sees heavenly signs.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,300
What's the next thing that's described as a big intervention?

56
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,340
...and you, a crackhead, a crack...

57
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,340


58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,020
...and you, what are you gonna call it again?

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,080


60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,640
And this can't be sorely easy if you're a piece of shit.

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,420
We don't all have�

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,840
Dd

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,980
UL

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,320
Well, after this mission, there's nothing falling down the stairs.

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,760
Oh, Mr. Vantage!

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,680
Wait!

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,800
Please!

68
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,320
Wait!

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,840
Mr. Vantage!

70
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,940
Mr. Vantage!

71
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,360
Mr. Vantage!

72
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,380
Mr. Vantage!

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,380
Dog carcass in alley this morning.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Tire tread on Burr's stomach.

75
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,640
This city's afraid of me.

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,840
I've seen its true face.

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,620
The streets are extended gutters.

78
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,600
The gutters are full of blood.

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,380
When the drains finally scap over,

80
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,400
all the vermin will drown.

81
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,320
The accumulated filth will be gone.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,180
The filth of all their sex and murder will foam up around their waists.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,800
And all the whores and politicians will look up and shout,

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,240
Save us!

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
And all whisper,

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,860
No.

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
Now the whole world stands on the brink,

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
staring down into bloody hell.

89
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,060
All those intellectuals,

90
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,040
smooth talkers,

91
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,660
and all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say.

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:18,960
No.

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,200


94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,100
Beneath me, this awful city,

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,760
it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.

96
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,400
And the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences.

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,100
What do you suggest we do about it?

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,420
Retribution.

99
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,200
Nobody knows who you are.

100
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,760
You can give it up.

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,540
You can try and have a normal life.

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,020
Is that what you have now?

103
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,580
A normal life?

104
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,500
When you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies,

105
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,920
past the human cockroaches talking about their heroin and child pornography,

106
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,000
do you really feel normal?

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,880
At least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.

108
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,420
No.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
You're hiding in plain sight.

110
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:37,000
You should be aware that children who arrest children of ruination are Papa Orange.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000


112
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,160
Welcome to the archive.

113
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,080
You have selected historical file number 12-1.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,580
In the beginning, there was man, and for a time, it was good.

115
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,960
But humanity's so-called civil societies soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.

116
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Thus did man become the architect of his own.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,400
His own demise.

118
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,440
But for a time, it was good.

119
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,320
Because if you don't understand that, it's going to be very difficult for you to understand this book.

120
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,860
The time when the Antichrist takes over, he's going to have full power.

121
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,940
When we read in Revelation chapter 13 and verse 1,

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,780
John in his vision said,

123
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,880
And I stood upon the sea.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,980
And saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns.

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,080
Now, if you don't understand this, as I say, you won't crack the code.

126
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,040
You won't understand what he's talking about.

127
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,760
Can you picture what you'll be?

128
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,320
So in that person's name.

129
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,400
Desperately in need of some.

130
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:48,600
Strangers have been of desperate land.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,980
So the leaders of man conceived of their moment.

132
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
But they did not believe that.

133
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,380
Because they were in the last war.

134
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,140
That's because in love God will work against both men and women.

135
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:12,680


136
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,560
neste melon

137
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,140
thatśnie

138
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,580
The answer is.

139
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:36,960
the coordinate theory plus 10 times with 6 times what I said as it really was in verse 11 The only man who doesn't have the most effort but a snob in life. That's why they've been running away for so long.

140
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,880
Roman wilderness of pain

141
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,340
And all the children are insane

142
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,920
If you don't understand this as I say, you won't crack the code.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,880
You won't understand what he's talking about.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,700
All the children are insane

145
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,080
Wait for the surrogate

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Now, that brings up a real question.

147
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,460
Do we interpret the book of the Revelation literally or symbolically?

148
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,120
Which do you?

149
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,760
George Clooney from Paradigm of Advent

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,400
Charlie Clooney from Paradigm of Advent

151
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,520
Hey, Jesus, you ain't gonna believe this.

152
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:43,940
Look.

153
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,260
Hey!

154
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,040
That's too slow!

155
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,380
What is it?

156
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,000
Thank you.

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,080
Yes.

158
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,660
I feel it, Jimmy!

159
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm the least mother fucker, sir!

160
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,840
And you may be able to stand against it.

161
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,080
All right, son!

162
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,060
I'm gonna go.

163
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,080
Go.

164
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,720
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.

165
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,300
Operation Dark Star City.

166
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,380
I'm gonna fight!

167
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,860
Then we're gonna win!

168
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,300
Kill them all!

169
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
Kill them all!

170
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,960
Kill them all!

171
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
Ha ha ha!

172
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,560
Ha ha ha!

173
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,000
Ha ha ha!

174
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,620
Ha ha ha!

175
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,500
Ha ha ha!

176
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,980
Ha ha ha!

177
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,020
Ha ha ha!

178
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,960
Ha ha ha!

179
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,080
Ha ha ha!

180
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,940
Ha ha ha!

181
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,520
Ha ha ha!

182
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,820
Ha ha ha!

183
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,300
Ha ha ha!

184
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,300


185
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,400
Ha ha ha!

186
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,600
Ha ha ha!

187
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,420
Ha ha ha!

188
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
Ha ha!

189
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,740
Ha ha ha!

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,100


191
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,180
Somewhere under the rainbow

192
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,160
Where you and I

193
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:06,720
There's a land that I've heard of

194
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
Once in a lullaby

195
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,000
Somewhere under the rainbow

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,980
Sky is white

197
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,320
And blue

198
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:37,180
And the dreams that you dare to

199
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,080
Dreams really do come true

200
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,680
Bless all forms of intelligence

201
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,820
Your flesh is a relic of your vessel

202
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,220
Yeah

203
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,580
Yeah

204
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,380
Yeah

205
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,660
Yeah

206
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,060
Yeah

207
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,660
Yeah

208
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,660


209
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,660


210
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,660


211
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:29,660


212
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,480
Shit.

213
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm still only here.

214
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,200
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back there.

215
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,660
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.

216
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,920
I'd wake up and there'd be nothing.

217
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
When I was here, I wanted to be there.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,640
When I was there, all I could think of was getting back here.

219
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,140
I'm here a week now, getting softer.

220
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,400
Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.

221
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,260
I get weaker.

222
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,900
Each time I look back, I'm like,

223
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,220
I walked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.

224
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,720
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like.

225
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:56,720


226
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:56,720


227
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
What we need right now is a clear message to the people of this country.

228
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,560
This message must be read in every newspaper,

229
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,100
heard on every radio scene, on every television.

230
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,240
This message must resound throughout the entire Italy.

231
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,080
I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.

232
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,400
I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.

233
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,940
I want everyone to remember why they need us.

234
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:35,660
I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.

235
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,500
I have all the authority to liberate in all ways possible.

236
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,500


237
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,500


238
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,500


239
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,500


240
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,500


241
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,160
God exists, and He is American.

242
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,440
Now, if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling

243
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,880
of ,,"It's not easy. He has sinned. He has been heraldoed."

244
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,780
religious terror at the concept, don't be alarmed.

245
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,400
That indicates only that you are still sane.

246
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,560
I am looking at the stars.

247
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,160
They're so far away, and their light

248
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,480
takes so long to reach us.

249
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,800
All we ever see of stars are their old photographs.

250
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,260
I prefer the stillness here.

251
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,460
I am tired of Earth, these people,

252
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,800
and tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.

253
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,080
This is not real.

254
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,280
And the real world lies somewhere else.

255
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
A typical mental delusion.

256
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,520
We get unbalanced kids like this all the time.

257
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,380
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people.

258
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,020
This world must have been a cold and alienating place

259
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,820
for a boy like that.

260
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,660
It's called denying reality.

261
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,460
It's, you know, just a self-defense.

262
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:51,460


263
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,140
A defense mechanism for those type of kids.

264
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,460
Well, he's in another world now.

265
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,400
Make no mistake about that.

266
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,080
Hey.

267
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,500
You a dreamer?

268
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,900
Haven't seen too many of you around lately.

269
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,740
Things have been tough lately for dreamers.

270
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,400
They say dreaming's dead, and no one does it anymore.

271
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
It's not dead, it's just it's been forgotten.

272
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,260
Removed from our language.

273
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,980
Nobody teaches it, so no one knows it exists.

274
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,500
The dreamers banished to obscurity.

275
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,560
I'm trying to change all that, and I hope you are too.

276
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,440
By dreaming every day.

277
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,760
Dreaming with our hands and dreaming with our minds.

278
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,740
Our planet is facing the greatest problems it's ever faced.

279
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:58,940
Ever.

280
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,080
So whatever you do, don't be bored.

281
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,040
This is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped to be alive.

282
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,620
And things are just starting.

283
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,940
I'm not going to lie.

284
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,600


285
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm not going to lie.

286
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,460
I'm not going to lie.

287
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,460


288
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,460


289
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,460


290
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,460


291
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,460


292
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,060
Get out and learn and make a living.

293
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:39,840
They claim their labours are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated with horrors.

294
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,340
Perhaps the world is not made.

295
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Perhaps nothing is made.

296
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,360
A clock without a craftsman.

297
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:00,840
It's too late. Always has been. Always will be. Too late.

298
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,360
Now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.

299
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,980
We should not submit to dehumanization.

300
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,540
I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.

301
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,620
I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems of control.

302
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,600
Those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more.

303
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,740
I want freedom. That's what I want. And that's what Jason wants.

304
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,840
It's up to each and every one of us to turn with just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy.

305
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,640
And yes, the insecurities. Because that is the central mode of control.

306
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,340
Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.

307
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,920
We have got to realize we're being conditioned on a mass scale.

308
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,860
Start challenging this corporate slave state.

309
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,240
The 21st century is going to be a new century.

310
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Not the century of slavery. Not the century of lies, issues of no significance, of classism, statism, and all the rest of the modes of control.

311
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,440
It's going to be a new century.

312
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,260
It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.

313
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,240
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal, Democrat, conservative, Republican.

314
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,540
It's all there to control you. Two sides of the same coin.

315
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,080
Two management teams bidding for control. The CEO job of slavery incorporated.

316
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,340
The truth is out there in front of you. But they lay out this buffet of lies.

317
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,200
I'm sick of it. And I'm not going to take a bite out of it. Do you got me?

318
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Persistence is not futile. We're going to win this thing.

319
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,220
Humankind is too good. We're not a bunch of underachievers.

320
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,760
We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings.

321
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,180
We're going to get fired up about the real things. The things that matter.

322
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,980
Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.

323
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,260
I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.

324
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,260
Son, we live in a world that has walls and those walls have to be guarded.

325
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
Who's going to do it?

326
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,780
You. You curse my existence.

327
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,980
You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know.

328
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,280
That death, while tragic, probably saves lives.

329
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,400
And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.

330
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,020
You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties,

331
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,080
you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.

332
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,880
We use words like honor, code, loyalty.

333
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,960
We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something.

334
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,720
You use them as a punchline.

335
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,520
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps

336
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,660
under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it.

337
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,700
I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way.

338
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,300
Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post.

339
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,200
Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to.

340
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,220
I do not have much to say about it.

341
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,220


342
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,300
Thank you for being with us.

343
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,300


344
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,300


345
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,680
Well, I have some other news to tell you.

346
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,880
Things get confused out there.

347
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,420
Power, ideals, the old morality.

348
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:54,240
Because there's a conflict in every human heart between the rational and the irrational,

349
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,340
between good and evil.

350
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,360
And good does not always try.

351
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,880
Sometimes the dark side overcomes better angels of our nature.

352
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,460
Every man has got a breaking point.

353
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,800
You and I have.

354
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:43,080
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor.

355
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,280
That's my dream.

356
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,820
It's my nightmare.

357
00:25:51,780 --> 00:26:00,720
Rolling, slithering along the edge of a straight razor.

358
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,720
And surviving.

359
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,680
But when they kill them, they must incinerate them.

360
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Pig after pig.

361
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,800
Cow after cow.

362
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,080
Villain after villain.

363
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,020
Army after army.

364
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,200
And they call me an assassin.

365
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,840
What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?

366
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,340
A lion after lion.

367
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,940
You must be merciful to those who lie.

368
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,140
Those nabobs.

369
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,200
I hate them.

370
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,080
I do hate them.

371
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,640
Very obviously he is gone and safe.

372
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,440
Yes sir.

373
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,040
Very much so sir.

374
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,360
Obviously insan.

375
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,300
All those priests in Buckeye Frackers.

376
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,300


377
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,300


378
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,300


379
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,340
chapel.

380
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,340


381
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,340


382
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,020
Hey E-I-O-U

383
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,520
Hey E-I-O-U

384
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,460
Oh

385
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,340
U-E-I-O-A

386
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,600
U-E-I-A

387
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,500
Hey E-I-O-U

388
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,460
Who are you?

389
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,420
I hardly know, sir.

390
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,700
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see.

391
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,020
I do not see.

392
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,360
Explain yourself.

393
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,180
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir.

394
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,380
Because I'm not myself, you know.

395
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,300
I do not know.

396
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,820
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.

397
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,340
You?

398
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,260
Who are you?

399
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,340
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me...

400
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,600
Who you are first?

401
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,960
Why?

402
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,040
Oh, dear.

403
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,100
Everything is so confusing.

404
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,260
It is not?

405
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,820
Well, it is to me.

406
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,900
Why?

407
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,320
Well, I can't remember things as I used to, and...

408
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,980
Recite.

409
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,080
Hmm?

410
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,180
Oh, oh, oh, yes, sir.

411
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Um...

412
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,940
How doth the little busy bee...

413
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,020
Improvie...

414
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,300
Stop!

415
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,120
...that is not spoken correctically?

416
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,840
It goes...

417
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,300
Voila!

418
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,700
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

419
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:22,060
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the Vox Populi, now vacant, who vanished.

420
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:30,920
However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin, vanguarding vile and vile.

421
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,040
This is a

422
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:49,080
Well, I must say, I've never heard it that way before.

423
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,180
I know. I have improved it.

424
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,820
Well, if you ask me...

425
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,180
You?

426
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,780
Who are you?

427
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Go up, and speak to yourself.

428
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,400
You must tamanho my enemy like we had to.

429
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,400


430
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,820
wünsgrác, k Lego, and most pier...?

431
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,400
함ewłl?

432
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,980
Is, true...

433
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,600
Has, consincere...

434
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,580
Dagu.

435
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,220
That was too easy. What's the problem? Where's your concentration?

436
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,500
Maybe you regret taking the red pill?

437
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,120
Maybe.

438
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,840
It crosses everyone's mind at least once.

439
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,460
The wish to return to an ordinary life.

440
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,320
A carefree life in the country.

441
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,760
The life we had before knowing all this.

442
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,980
Even if that life was just an illusion.

443
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,180
It's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.

444
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,740
I've come to my senses. You should do the same.

445
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,980
I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth.

446
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,020
I've been waiting for you.

447
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,020


448
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,020


449
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,560
But I don't care about the truth anymore.

450
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,420
What's real doesn't matter.

451
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,860
What's important is how we live our lives.

452
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,400
Are you listening to me?

453
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,680
You know I'm right.

454
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,980
But we can't go back. We know the truth now.

455
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,040
We can forget all of this.

456
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,100
I know how.

457
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,200
Trust me.

458
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,620
Don't be afraid to look into your heart.

459
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,000
Say what you're really feeling.

460
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,620
Tell me.

461
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
I can't.

462
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,700
I don't know.

463
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,580
I can't.

464
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,800
Running away won't change anything.

465
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,360
You're the one that's running away.

466
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,540
Stop pretending.

467
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,720
Enough. I've had enough!

468
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,600
Ah!

469
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,480
There's no time.

470
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,160
You can forget about it. I won't look away from the truth. I can't.

471
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

472
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,220
I'm sorry.

473
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,600
I'm sorry.

474
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm sorry.

475
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:37,260
What's a deal? Got to make it to the next meal. Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel.

476
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:51,300
Mile after mile, stone after stone, you turn to speak that you're alone.

477
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,100
A million miles from home, you're on your own.

478
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:12,700
So let me in from the cold, turn my land into gold.

479
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:21,080
Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul and I think I'm going home.

480
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm going home.

481
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,500
Be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this country don't want that.

482
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm talking about the real owners now. The real owners. The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

483
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,800
Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.

484
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:52,840
You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything.

485
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,760
They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations.

486
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,740
They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.

487
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,140
They got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big media companies.

488
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,360
So they control just about all of the news and information you get in here.

489
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,540
They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying.

490
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,260
Lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want.

491
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,920
They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.

492
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,580
But I'll tell you what they don't want.

493
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,440
They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.

494
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,880
I can't light my candlelight

495
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,960
And her by my side

496
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,440
And if she prefers we never stir again

497
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,420
Someone sent the promised love

498
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,040
And I grabbed it with both hands

499
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,880
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out

500
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,720
Hear me shout, come on in

501
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,800
What's the news? Where you been?

502
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,580
Cause there's no wind left in my soul

503
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,380
And I've grown old

504
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,420
They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw the whole world into a mess.

505
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,420


506
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,760
They don't want that.

507
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,760
You know what they want?

508
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,700
They want obedient workers.

509
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Obedient workers.

510
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:08,680
People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.

511
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,800
And now they're coming for your social security money.

512
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,020
They want your fucking retirement money.

513
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,000
They want it back.

514
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,420
So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.

515
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,060
You know something? They'll get it.

516
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,880
They'll get it all if I'm considered related.

517
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,800
Cause they own this fucking place.

518
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,000
It's a big club.

519
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,920
You ain't in it.

520
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,960
You and I are not in the big club.

521
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,920
By the way, it's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe.

522
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,660
All day long beating you over the head with their medians telling you what to believe, what to think, and what to buy.

523
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,540
The table is tilted, folks.

524
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,700
The game is rigged.

525
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,600
Nobody seems to notice.

526
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,440
Nobody seems to care.

527
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
Good, honest, hard-working people.

528
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,200
White collar, blue collar, doesn't matter what color shirt you have on.

529
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,480
Good, honest, hard-working people continue.

530
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:00,440
These people of modest means continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don't give a fuck about them.

531
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,080
They don't give a fuck about you.

532
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,740
They don't give a fuck about you.

533
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,080
They don't care about you.

534
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,800
At all.

535
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,980
At all.

536
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,860
At all.

537
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:07,980
At all.

538
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,780
You know?

539
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,280
But nobody seems to notice.

540
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,640
Nobody seems to care.

541
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,140
That's what the owners count on.

542
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:24,500
The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white, and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes every day.

543
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,620
Because the owners in this country know the truth.

544
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,600
It's called the American dream.

545
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,080
But you have to be asleep to believe it.

546
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,840
The American Dream

547
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


548
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


549
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


550
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


551
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


552
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


553
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


554
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,840


555
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,780
You're my girl.

556
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,380
So vulnerable about everything, it makes me sad.

557
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,520
Yeah, all right, let's keep that money machine rolling.

558
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,820
Can you get me out of this?

559
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:07,820


560
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,380
Give me sanctuary.

561
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,560
I must find a place to hide.

562
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,680
A place for me to hide.

563
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,800
Can you find me?

564
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,140
Soft asylum.

565
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,660
I can't make it anymore.

566
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,920
The man is at the door.

567
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,160
This is the trip.

568
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,320
The best part.

569
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,780
I really like.

570
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,780
Yeah, proud to be a part of it.

571
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:07,780


572
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,540
I'm part of this number.

573
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,120
Successful hills are here to stay.

574
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,840
Everything must be this way.

575
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,520
Gentle street where people play.

576
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,080
Welcome to the soft parade.

577
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,980
All our lives we sweat and say.

578
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,760
They'll live for a chance.

579
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,440
We'll celebrate.

580
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,420
Must be something else we say.

581
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,180
Somehow to defend this place.

582
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,920
Everything must be this way.

583
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,660
Everything must be this way.

584
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,260
Yeah.

585
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,060
When deep space exploration rounds up,

586
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,740
it'll be the corporations that run it.

587
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,500
The IBM Stellar Sphere.

588
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,620
The Microsoft Galaxy.

589
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,560
The Planet Starbucks.

590
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,860
Like so many others,

591
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,180
I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

592
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,640
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder,

593
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,580
what kind of dining set defines me as a person?

594
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,820
Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections

595
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,700
were proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple,

596
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,720
hardworking indigenous peoples of the world.

597
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,640
Wherever.

598
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
We used to read pornography.

599
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,660
Now it was the Horchow Collection.

600
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,320
The things you own end up owning you.

601
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,020
The soft parade has now begun.

602
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,920
Listen to the engines hum.

603
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,520
People out to have some fun.

604
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,540
Cobra on my left.

605
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,060
Leopard on my right.

606
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,300
Dear woman in a silk dress.

607
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,640
Girls with beads around the necks.

608
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,760
Kiss the hunter of the green vest.

609
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,800
Do his recipe for.

610
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,640
With lions in the night.

611
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,380
Out of sight.

612
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,300
The lights are getting brighter.

613
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,180
The radio is moaning.

614
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,600
Crawling to the close.

615
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,300
There are

616
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,340
still a few

617
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,060
animals

618
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,080
left out in the yard.

619
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,420
But it's dead

620
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,000
harder

621
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,000
to describe.

622
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,340
Sailors

623
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,660
to the under bed.

624
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm going to be a

625
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,160


626
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,160


627
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,240
sailor.

628
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,620
I'm going to be a

629
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,620
driver.

630
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:47,680
So're waiting for your

631
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


632
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


633
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,140
something.

634
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,240
�

635
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,240


636
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,140
I'm afraid to call you in.

637
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,280
God элем 신기xus!

638
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,280


639
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,960
fingers to the

640
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,360
told him I was

641
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,700
there.

642
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,620
Hauseo.

643
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,700
But the bed is fully cleaned up

644
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,880
You and I

645
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,060
We need someone low

646
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,520
Something to bring your guard

647
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,700
Something to bring your guard

648
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,940
We gotta bring your guard

649
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,980
When all else fails

650
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,260
We can whip the horses' eyes

651
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,320
And make them sleep

652
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,640
And cry

653
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,380
Drunk by your

654
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,460
I just think about it still

655
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:34,200
and think about it

656
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,520
It's getting pretty hard to take my line of work, doing voices for radio commercials.

657
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:22,940
All that sleep.

658
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,260
In fact, it'll get more and more.

659
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,300
Every time I'm in the studio for a session, I feel just a little bit more hypocritical and guilty.

660
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:43,840
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image-enhancing products that in reality they little need nor they'll can afford.

661
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:51,220
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about the situation, the better my work is.

662
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,020
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.

663
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,620
I work four or five times a week.

664
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,680
I've even upped my rates.

665
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,760
I'm referring to you, hey.

666
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm a half of ethics.

667
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,480
Thinking about it almost makes it worth thinking about it.

668
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,360
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a mouthpiece.

669
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,620
A conduit for someone else's concepts.

670
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,220
A faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in themselves.

671
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,160
Now what do you think?

672
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,800
Am I cutting my own throat here?

673
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,640
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?

674
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,880
An audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?

675
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,240
I don't know.

676
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,920
I can't answer that.

677
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,340
But I do know this.

678
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,940
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.

679
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,960
Wealth is in our vital national interest.

680
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,660
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.

681
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,320
All for the sake of peace.

682
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,960
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio,

683
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,360
Nothing you can buy will make you a better person.

684
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,200
A happier person.

685
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,180
A more spiritually connected person.

686
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,880
Can provide you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.

687
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,380
There are things that can never be turned into commodities and marketed.

688
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,420
And these things must be searched for within each of us individually.

689
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,300
Every child must be taught these principles.

690
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,660
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.

691
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,580
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bomb you just passed on the street,

692
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,780
Then you too are part of that deception.

693
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,620
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields,

694
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,580
Or a slave in the office,

695
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,540
Or a slave in the big house on the hill.

696
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,980
You're still a slave, and at best, a middle management slave,

697
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,560
Prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor,

698
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,940
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself apart from the world, and that you will be free.

699
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,360
Of that inner circle.

700
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,880
Believe me, you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

701
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,240
And you will be replaced the very next day, by yet another well groomed, well oiled,

702
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,800
Eaten, brown nosing, slave.

703
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,560
This year's model.

704
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,220
You're inceptable.

705
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,620
Recently, we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

706
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,840
Now what do you think brought all that about?

707
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,920
Was it because you were a slave?

708
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:32,920


709
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:32,920


710
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,860
The communist system was flawed, and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

711
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,420
No. I don't think so.

712
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,860
I think it was because of the greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats,

713
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,780
Who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

714
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,200
Interesting parallel, don't you think?

715
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,320
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic,

716
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,260
And insensitive bureaucrats charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

717
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,360
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,

718
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,380
All too often, we choose to emulate them.

719
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,120
To ape their postures, their uniforms, their speech patterns, their phraseology.

720
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,920
Stop acting like you're next on the docket, because you aren't.

721
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,960
Stop acting like everything is alright, because you need it.

722
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,620
Nothing is alright.

723
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,880
And if you can look around you, at the state of this country,

724
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,900
And not secretly admit to yourself, that you're a slave, then you're a slave.

725
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,540
But if you can see for yourself, that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs.

726
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,280
And that their dominance just happened to fall first.

727
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,940
You're truly...

728
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,060
Ignorant.

729
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,780
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate feast,

730
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,140
And who lovingly sing to in all of his patriotic songs.

731
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:19,400
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now, remember, you're working at least three of those days to pay off your accrued interest charges and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.

732
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:31,680
That's 3% of the time. The real inner circle is bleeding you dry. It's bleeding this country dry, not to mention what's left of this planet.

733
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:43,120
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders, we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance, oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

734
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,420
Unlike any other, we have air-sea.

735
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,680
And why do we continue to do this?

736
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:48,800
Charity.

737
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,380
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

738
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,280
Charity.

739
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,000
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?

740
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:56,880
Charity.

741
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:02,880
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art to the continuous...

742
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:02,880


743
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,440
...perpetration of this hoax?

744
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:10,700
...for avoidable power and interests of poverty, prison, addiction, and despair?

745
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,960
Freedom without structure is anarchy.

746
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,700
Structure without freedom is fascism.

747
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:27,000
What are you? An anarchist? Or a fascist?

748
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,800
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

749
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,100
Convenience is not freedom.

750
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,960
And the government is not your friend.

751
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:50,540
Every child must be taught these principles until this threat to America is removed.

752
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:51,260
...to America is removed.

753
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,500
Three, two, one.

754
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,960
We're the United States.

755
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,060
We're the United States.

756
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,160
We're the United States.

757
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,280
We're the United States.

758
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,740
United States.

759
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,760
United States.

760
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,240
We are the United States.

761
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,040
We have a problem that calls for service.

762
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:13,920
دي!!

763
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,540
Goddamit, an entire generation pumping gas,

764
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,640
waiting tables,

765
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,960
slaves with white collars.

766
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,100
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

767
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,180
Working jobs we hate.

768
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,440
We buy shit that we don't need.

769
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,080
We're the middle children of history, man.

770
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,080
No purpose or place.

771
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,360
We have no great war.

772
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
No great depression.

773
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,460
Our great war is a spiritual war.

774
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,240
Our great depression is our lives.

775
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:30,020
Our great depression is our lives.

776
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,840
Those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.

777
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,400
And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?

778
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,320
Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.

779
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,680
And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,

780
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,120
you now have senses.

781
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,200
And systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity.

782
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,700
How did this happen?

783
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,080
Who's to blame?

784
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,520
Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.

785
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,400
They will be held accountable.

786
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,920
But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.

787
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,640
I know why you did it.

788
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,060
I know you were afraid.

789
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,320
Who would you be?

790
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,460
War? Terror? Disease?

791
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,260
There were a myriad of problems that inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.

792
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,360
Fear got the best of you.

793
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,220
Fairness, justice and freedom are more than words.

794
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,960
They are perspectives.

795
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,280
But if you see what I see.

796
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,720
If you feel as I feel.

797
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,580
And if you would seek as I seek.

798
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,900
Then I ask you to stand beside me.

799
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,900
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has.

800
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,280
Use that freedom.

801
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,920
Make up your own mind.

802
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,060
It's like you come onto this planet with a crayon.

803
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,200
And you're like, I'm going to draw a crayon box.

804
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,580
Now you may get the 8 pack.

805
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,240
You may get the 16 pack.

806
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,060
But it's all in what you do with the crayons.

807
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,580
The colors that you're given.

808
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,680
And don't worry about drawing within the lines.

809
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,280
Or coloring outside the lines.

810
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,540
I say color outside the lines.

811
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,060
You know what I mean?

812
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,040
Color right off the page.

813
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,920
It might be true that there are 6 billion people in the world.

814
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,460
And counting.

815
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,740
Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference.

816
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,040
It makes a difference first of all in material terms.

817
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,840
It makes a difference to other people.

818
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,520
And it sets an example.

819
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,800
And in short, I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off.

820
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,160
And see ourselves as the victim of various forces.

821
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,240
It's always our decision who we are.

822
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,660
The realm of the real spirit.

823
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,300
The true artist.

824
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,200
The saint.

825
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,020
The philosopher.

826
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,920
Is rarely achieved.

827
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,760
Why so few?

828
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:27,800
Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress?

829
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,540
Rather this endless and futile addition of zeros.

830
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,280
No greater values have developed.

831
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,960
Hell, the Greeks, 3,000 years ago were just as advanced as we are.

832
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:46,140
So what are these barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential?

833
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,040
The answer to that can be found in another question.

834
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,740
And that's this.

835
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,780
Which is the most universal human characteristic?

836
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,100
Fear?

837
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,780
Or laziness?

838
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,180
Neglect?

839
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:05,420
Would be the real fun.

840
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,400
Ad bang qua bang, the boring above Text On –

841
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:09,400


842
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,460
And it makes you shine

843
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,800
The world would transform

844
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:21,780
Father, then show us how to be our towers

845
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,760
What are your shoulders?

846
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,040
Friend, then where and how will you be together?

847
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,020
or praysubgenius.com and everybody involved, even you.

848
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,160
For Sire, there is no more money.

849
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,580
We gotta get some money.

850
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,800
That dirty, perkish, hark-a-back, flackin', whartin',

851
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,080
fill-a-bunk-a-burton, perk-a-loom-a-burton,

852
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,100
dirtin' boss tonight.

853
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,340
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

854
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,860
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

855
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,640
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

856
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,680
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

857
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:06,760
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

858
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,720
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

859
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,280
or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

860
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,600
and help out financially as best you can.

861
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,960
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

862
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,480
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own

863
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,620
subgeniuses.

864
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
The situation's worse.

865
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,540
But some of you still have jobs.

866
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,900
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

867
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,440
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

868
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,840
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

869
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,160
All we're saying is that

870
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,560
blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs

871
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,320
if you don't pay dogs.

872
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,220
We also take checks and money orders to

873
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,320
subgeniusfoundation.com

874
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:53,480
and we'll send you a copy of the

875
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,400
P.O. Box 807

876
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,660
Glen Rose, Texas 76043

877
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:07,740
A thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
