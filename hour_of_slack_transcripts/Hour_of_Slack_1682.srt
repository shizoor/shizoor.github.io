1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
What you're going to hear about today is nothing short of a miracle.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,200
It's dramatically new, made possible only through years of research, inventions, and innovation.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,420
The Self-Genius Power of Squatch.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,740
From PR News in Washington, I'm from 18 states and Washington, D.C.

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,580
For about a month, at a plant in Canada, where some 2,500 workers continue to spread.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,000
To Mexico, with nearly three tons of food, water, and scientific equipment.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,620
The military as well.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,500
Six military helicopters.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,040
Over 45 miles per hour.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,620
President Trump's new approach on Iran is working.

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,700
EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini says,

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,120
It is not up to terminate the tree. It does not condone stupid.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,720
But Mogherini...

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,900
Mogherini says, that's not true.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,540
And it is not any up to any not.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,380
Mogherini says, the U.S. can't just not violate PR News in Brussels.

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,660
General Motors says, PR comes amid sexual head.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,040
Saying, quote, we have decided it is sexual PR News.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,900
EU.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,860
A Russian cargo ship is heading to the international PR News in Washington.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,320
Outside our town.

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,340

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,360


31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,920

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Ted wore his gator shoes and corduroy jacket And the air wafting from his groin smelled like Buddy Hackett

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,640
Pretty little Wanda all covered in lard

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
Did a whiff of a beer and a drink of vodka

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,720
And a shingle and a shingle till my dick got hard

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,360
Satan looked up after starting a line And said it's time to drain the fluid out of Sonny Bono's spine

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:50,980

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,760
under my intuitive

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:01,840
grade

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:01,840


61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,640
next to me

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,100
So we gotta play at home there and伸 morsel

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,600
Got out the flask and a long rubber tube

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,400
Greased up Sonny's butt with some mineral lube

65
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,360
Slid that pointy needle in his acroiliac

66
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,960
Right at the top of his sweaty booty crack

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,800
Started seeing drips, that was a real good sign

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,640
And then we drained the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,000
Whang dang doodle boy, ha-chicka-too

70
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,180

Everybody gonna have a real good time

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,480
When we drain all the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,620
Drain all the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

76
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,340
Drain all the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

77
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,200
Drain all the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

78
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,020
Drain all the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

79
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,520
Good evening.

80
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:29,200
He was obsessed with sex, with mad desires, by a force he could not control.

81
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,220
Why did he rape?

82
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,960
Why did he ravage?

83
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,880
Why did he kill?

84
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
He was a demon, a beast.

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,080
He was evil and depraved.

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,760
His was the most unique of them all.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,580
To some women he was an instrument of pleasure.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,600


89
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,360
He's just plain no good if you ask me.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,380
He's the sort of a guy that would change a girl's evening stroll from a recreation to an occupation.

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
But he wants me to be his girl.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
His girl is a lot of girls.

93
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,540
And you happen to be only one of them.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
But take my advice.

95
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,360
I never saw any good come out of him and I never will.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
What's the matter honey?

97
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,660
Come on home with me.

98
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,140
I'll make you forget your troubles.

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,980
They rampage throughout the South.

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,320
The sharp edge of suspense slams hard into fear and fear becomes terror.

101
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,620
That's more like it baby.

102
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,760
You, you, you.

103
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,140
Do you know that bad girls go to hell?

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
These are the men.

105
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,600
Possessed with sex.

106
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,700
Corrupt.

107
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,920
And immoral.

108
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,540
Who prey upon women.

109
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
You know that I love you.

110
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,140
Why are you leaving?

111
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,140
I love you too.

112
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,400
But you're different.

113
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,300
Oh no dear friends.

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,740
This is Hour of Slack number 1682.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,820
And I don't have any idea what it's going to be like.

116
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm recording this intro on my phone because my mixing setup called Tarzan's Radio Station

117
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,700
went with Princess Wee to the 21X Day Drill Festival.

118
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,940
And I didn't.

119
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,020
Instead of going to the Wisteria Campground and recording two shows a day with Dr. Hal

120
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,940
and Philodrumon and Reverend Susie the Fleezy and everybody like usual.

121
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Instead I had to drive right back to Texas.

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,960
Just me and Buddy in a rented car because there was a death in my family.

123
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,680
Anyway I'm back at Stang Ranch with a skeleton office and a little bit of work.

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,380
And none of my regular recording gear.

125
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,160
Dr. Hal, Princess Wee, Dr. Drummond, Reverend Angry Larry and many others did record shows

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,820
at X Day.

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,560
But I haven't gotten those recordings yet.

128
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,380
I'm told there was ranting and music and a nice Bobtism and Bob Burning and all that

129
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,820
great stuff we do at X Day.

130
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:49,720
What I do have are two two hour shows recorded by Reverend Fanboy on July 4th and 5th.

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
And uh...

132
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,000
This time you, the audience and me, we'll be hearing those for the first time together.

133
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,140
Because I'm really running late on this show.

134
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,840
The first one had just Reverend Fanboy and Reverend Fight C. Taj.

135
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,960
Who I don't think we've ever heard do show before.

136
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,700
And the second one had Reverend Fanboy and the redoubtable Reverend Anna Moll.

137
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,940
One of my favorite subgenius radio personalities.

138
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,220
And a new person.

139
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,720
And a new band.

140
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:21,720


141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
It's a band called YB Dobbs.

142
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,900
There's also some new music around here by many friends.

143
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,480
And even a whole new Rudy Schwartz Project album.

144
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,160
In fact, I can probably confidently say that we started with something from that album.

145
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,760
Which is called Postal Code for Ham.

146
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,720
And that the titles and PR news were by Lee Murr.

147
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,360
And that if there are long stretches of collage they're probably by Cool Hand Chris using

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,400
old stuff from our and his Bulldotter audio collections.

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,940
So, yeah, this is kind of a nuts episode.

150
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't have the slightest idea when Buddy and I will be able to return to Ohio.

151
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,300
And see my wife and weemawmaw and finish selling off that old house that's bleeding me dry.

152
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,040
But I do know this.

153
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
Sometimes I hate being a grown up.

154
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,200
But I have a huge loving family.

155
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,640
Who all live very nearby.

156
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,340
And we'll get through this.

157
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,020
And thanks to all the friends who did my job for me this year at X Day.

158
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,480
It's a good dry run.

159
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm not going to be around forever either.

160
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,820
Friends, treasure your loved ones.

161
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,840
And tell them you love them every chance you get.

162
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,260
Because you never know when you might suddenly lose that privilege.

163
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,700
And now this.

164
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,080
Now me and my brother.

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
My brother and me.

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,020
We've seen things we never wanted to see.

167
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
Had to wipe it all away.

168
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
With the back of my hand.

169
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,800
And let my little brother be a kid again.

170
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,220
And now.

171
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,620
We've got to stick together.

172
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh man, oh man.

173
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,340
We've got to stick together.

174
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,960
Now me and my love.

175
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,680
We crash and burn.

176
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,620
We squeal and skid.

177
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,940
On a hairpin turn.

178
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,660
We pass in space.

179
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,680
We miss by miles.

180
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,240
We turn and we crash it on.

181
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,140
And go out in style.

182
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,520
And now.

183
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,840
We've got to stick together.

184
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,300
Oh man, oh man.

185
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,880
We've got to stick together.

186
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Yeah.

187
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
I saw the light.

188
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,560
I saw the light.

189
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,580
I saw the light.

190
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,200
I saw the light.

191
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,540
I saw the light.

192
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,200
I saw them ride.

193
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,900
In a veteran's parade.

194
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,500
Looked like they'd been friends since their boyhood days.

195
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,300
I was raising my fist.

196
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,880
In an angry salute.

197
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,620
When they looked at me.

198
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,560
And my defiance went mute.

199
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
But I'm fine.

200
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,180
We've got to stick together.

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,920
Oh man, oh man.

202
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,140
We've got to stick together.

203
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,340
Oh man, oh man.

204
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,340


205
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,460
Don't take me for granted.

206
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,720
That's all I ask.

207
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,840
Our time here together will be over so fast.

208
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,660
We are sparks.

209
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
We burn like a flame.

210
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,160


211
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,160


212
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,160


213
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,160


214
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,000
We burn and breathe.

215
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
Alone we arrive.

216
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,460
And alone we leave.

217
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,580
Now me and my brother.

218
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,240
My brother and me.

219
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,660
We've seen things we never wanted to see.

220
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,100
If you're ever alone.

221
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,980
And your prayers within.

222
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,940
You feel like nobody's here thinking about you.

223
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,100
Well man, I probably am.

224
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,200
And man.

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
We've got to stick together.

226
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,220
Oh man, oh man.

227
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,620
We've got to stick together.

228
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,640
Oh man, oh man.

229
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:40,640


230
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,640
We've got to stick together.

231
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:45,640


232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,460
We've got to stick together.

233
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:58,680
We've got to stick together.

234
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Don't take me for granted.

235
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,900


236
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,900


237
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,900


238
00:14:59,900 --> 00:14:59,900


239
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
Well, I swear friends,

240
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,880
that song by the Rain Makers,

241
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,960
Stick Together,

242
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,140
reached out and seized my attention.

243
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,060
as if by magic.

244
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,320
It's from a lesser-known album, Live in Oslo.

245
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,820
And I'd hardly ever even noticed that particular song before,

246
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,820
but last night, right when I'd given up work on this show for the evening

247
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,660
and grabbed a random, really random Rainmaker CD

248
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,020
from my big box of those,

249
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,060
that one strangely unfamiliar song caught my attention on the song list,

250
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,100
so I paid extra attention to it for once.

251
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,380
It's perfect for my immediate situation.

252
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,340
This family tragedy that I'm still reeling from,

253
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,520
well, it's had my goat rancher brother and me,

254
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,920
working together to deal with, indeed, things we never wanted to see.

255
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,420
The song couldn't be more appropriate,

256
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,560
but then I tend to see the songs of Bob Walkenhorst

257
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,060
as being secretly about my life,

258
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,140
because I'm a fanboy.

259
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,340
Anyway, and now this.

260
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,580
An instrumental by Reverend Jimmy Ryan

261
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,100
titled The Fallen.

262
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,960
He composed it for Memorial Day,

263
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,360
but, again, it's appropriate for me, personally,

264
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,900
for the same reasons.

265
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,160

282
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,860
Thank you.

283
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,980
Thank you.

284
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,460
Thank you.

285
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,000
Thank you.

286
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,900
Thank you.

287
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,220
Thank you.

288
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,460
Thank you.

289
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,140
Thank you.

290
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,220
Thank you.

291
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,620
Thank you.

292
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,340
Thank you.

293
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,480
Thank you.

294
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,140
Next question.

295
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,360
For those who have missed the earlier part of the story, nothing has happened so far.

296
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,040
That's right.

297
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,500
You've missed darn near nothing.

298
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:20,220
We have an intense amount of slack right now, which means that we have, well, very little.

299
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,200
That's right.

300
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,740
But it's all in full swing.

301
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,640
Ain't nothing going on but the rent, as they say.

302
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,860
Nothing is in full swing.

303
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,360
And there's a variety of reasons for that.

304
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:31,880
Yeah.

305
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,200
The fact is, it's just too damn hot.

306
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,300
It's hot as balls out here.

307
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:42,200
You know that it's hot when you can't even charge your phone.

308
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,840
No, electronics are dying left and right.

309
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,160
It's a thing.

310
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,640
I'm worried about this little computer of mine I got plugged in.

311
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,480
Of course, you've got probably Uber coolers on there.

312
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,420
On this laptop you have.

313
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,340
It's amazing.

314
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,980
Well, anyway, we're hiding here in Cofinas because of the blazing, blazing sun.

315
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,120
We are getting, we are getting, the Cofinas is a convenient point of shade.

316
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,080
We are right now getting something that resembles a breeze blowing through.

317
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,860
Not an actual breeze, but we take what we can get here.

318
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,600
And let's go, let's go into it.

319
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,920
Tarzan's radio station is in the I-Van with a lot of other stuff.

320
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,680
Like the pulpit.

321
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,660
Which is on its way down here.

322
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,580
So this is Jane's podcast.

323
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,280
Someone greased Tarzan's vine again.

324
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,440
Watch out for that tree, George.

325
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,700
Don't let some monkey grease your grapevine.

326
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,540
I am wearing my own fan, which is not doing very much for me.

327
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,840
For those of you who are jealous of us being here, don't be too jealous.

328
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:11,620
It's currently 91 degrees with a heat index of 99.

329
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,460
Oh my God.

330
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,280
Okay, I officially died 20 minutes ago.

331
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,680
Check my pulse.

332
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,260
It's warm.

333
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,360
It's hot.

334
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,780
It's extremely humid.

335
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,020
I feel like I'm back in Houston.

336
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,360
But that's the joy of it.

337
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
That's the fun.

338
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,400
It beats the mud, right?

339
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,580
Or is the mud better?

340
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,280
Well, the mud you can probably cool off in.

341
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,140
That's true.

342
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:44,560
Many co-congregants have been soaking in the walnut, black walnut oil of the swimming hole.

343
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Avoiding the genital nipping old sequoia.

344
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,860
Old sequoia, he's got his eyes on your genitals.

345
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,060
So swim accordingly.

346
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,340
Not on my genitals.

347
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,320
They're too boring.

348
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,660
But we are told that, well, let's face it right now.

349
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:15,420
The heat here, the cleansing fires of the exes tomorrow when they burn the planet will probably be a relief from this heat.

350
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,460
Because I am told the cleansing fires of the exes is a dry heat.

351
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,800
And when you roast, you get a dry rub.

352
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,280
So.

353
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,360
Oh, I'd give anything.

354
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
For a dry rub right now.

355
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,500
So.

356
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:31,820
So.

357
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,200
It is.

358
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,960
Although.

359
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,580
Although.

360
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:42,580
Although a moist rub might feel a little bit better on my skin, depending on what kind of substances they're doing.

361
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,140
They're rubbing.

362
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,060
I think.

363
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,560
I think you've turned into Ed McMahon.

364
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,180
Now, there's a there's a reference for the aged.

365
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,720
Right.

366
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,000
You are, Johnny.

367
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,580
Ha ha ha ha.

368
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,080
Ha ha.

369
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,580
So I'm slugging down Diet Coke.

370
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,740
I'm slugging down Diet Coke.

371
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,800
Blazing a trail through my stomach.

372
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,600
No Coke, Betsy.

373
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,640
No Coke, Betsy.

374
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,900
It's all there.

375
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,180
All there is to do here is sit and talk and drink.

376
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,020
While I pound caffeinated water.

377
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,740
Mm hmm.

378
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,960
I am.

379
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,220
Well, it's it's not.

380
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,600
It's a little bitty energy squeezes.

381
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,080
Huh.

382
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,980
So I am not actually drinking the Kool-Aid.

383
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,720
No.

384
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,420
He brought his own.

385
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,740
Oh, yeah.

386
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,580
No, that Kool-Aid is perfectly fine.

387
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,240
Uh huh.

388
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,060
It's it's it's caffeinated.

389
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,820
That's right.

390
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,700
Actually, it is caffeinated and 18 servings per bottle.

391
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,600
Yeah, right.

392
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,060
I might get one more water bottle full of squirt from this.

393
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,120
It's caffeinated.

394
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,900
It's vitamin vitamin enhanced.

395
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,420
The usual stuff that you'll find in energy drinks.

396
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,580
Taurine, Rana, ginseng, vitamin B.

397
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,260
All sorts of no actual sugar.

398
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,460
So it's good for us.

399
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,780
All sorts of different substances prop up the subgenius.

400
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,360
And oh, look at that.

401
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
It's kosher.

402
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,600
Very good.

403
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,460
The subgenius must have slack and caffeine.

404
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,480
Death before dishonor.

405
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,760
That's right.

406
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,320
Nothing before caffeine.

407
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,620
I am one of those who needs a cup of coffee in order to be able to go up and get a cup of coffee.

408
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,560
So if we had to characterize X Day so far, it would be.

409
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,540
The slackers X Day.

410
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,900
It is truly the slackers X Day.

411
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,860
There is no capability of doing anything right now other than slacking.

412
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,940
Yeah, we're just just hanging here.

413
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:51,880
Slacking those who've read the secret Facebook page know that there's a spot of trouble and some true tragedy in staying family.

414
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,580
So suffice to say he won't be here.

415
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,840
He's got better things to do for the entire.

416
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,500
For the entire subgenius family.

417
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,400
This has been one rotten year.

418
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,640
Many many bad things have happened.

419
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,820
Profanities permitted on this.

420
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,400
Sure.

421
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going to give it to staying and he can cut it up however he wants for air.

422
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,700
I will let you let's be real.

423
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,620
Let's be real.

424
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,580
Since Reverend staying is not here.

425
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,060
I will say it for him.

426
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,400
Shit.

427
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,020
Piss.

428
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,440
Fuck.

429
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Yep.

430
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,620
Yep, which I'm sure is his mood right now.

431
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,040
We have had too.

432
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,320
Too many losses during the year of 20 AX.

433
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,860
And we really need some slack on this.

434
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,300
Either that or this year has to be the year.

435
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,640
The people who have been it could be that the people who have been preventing the exits from showing up.

436
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,180
Because they just can't pick them up because they're too damn awesome.

437
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,380
Hey.

438
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,080
Have boarded their saucers early.

439
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,940
So I'm hoping that there's room for the rest of us now.

440
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,680
Right.

441
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,040
Yeah.

442
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:14,120
It's we shall see in 14 hours 53 minutes.

443
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,580
It's it's the clock is the clock is ticking and we need our slack.

444
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,380
So we're grieving also for Reverend and atrocity.

445
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,540
Dr.

446
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,080
Cross.

447
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,320
Yeah.

448
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,360


449
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,360


450
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,360


451
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,360


452
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
Doc atrocity.

453
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,100
Dr.

454
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:30,740
Dark.

455
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,980
Mm-hmm.

456
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
We lost him in August.

457
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,080
I have over the years.

458
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,900
I have been trying to carry on the tradition in his good name of execrable movies.

459
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,460
My inaugurating the grindhouse.

460
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,840
I can only hope to remain in the shadow.

461
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,080
What's it's a damn fine thing.

462
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,460
Let me just tip my hat to you.

463
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,460
But yeah, I understand.

464
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,040
Dr.

465
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,600
Dark was the one who gave me the idea of the grindhouse in the first place.

466
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:19,520
And he always he told me early on that he was amazed by my endurance in running the bloody things all night long.

467
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,880
No.

468
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,280
Last year.

469
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,980
That that was the first time I'd seen an Ealing comedy and you hear you read about these things.

470
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,420
Yeah.

471
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,420
But where the hell do you go to see one unless you like take the time to go and find them?

472
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:32,940
Exactly.

473
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,960
Exactly.

474
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,940
Well, well, last year was the introduction to the grindhouse of the goons.

475
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,660
Mm-hmm.

476
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,160
That that's what I saw.

477
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,040
I loved it dearly.

478
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,560
Thank you.

479
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,100
Yes.

480
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,660
The goons.

481
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,520
Yeah.

482
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's let's face it without the goons.

483
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,260
We would not have comedy.

484
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,400
As we know it today.

485
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,940
Just about everyone in British comedy owes a debt to the goons.

486
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,000
Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Zekum.

487
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:10,120
I was very fortunate in Chicago when I was a teen back before NPR ate all of local noncommercial radio.

488
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,800
WBZ would run the goon show once a day.

489
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,200
Oh, yes.

490
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,820
All summer.

491
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,420
That's very important.

492
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,180
Oh, man.

493
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,220
Very important education for everyone.

494
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,700
Yes, absolutely.

495
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,540
Like you understand.

496
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,080
Like why were the Beatles like that?

497
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,360
Why did they make all those Christmas?

498
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,240
How are the Beatles like that?

499
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,620
Why were the Rolling Stones like that?

500
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,540
How did Monty Python get their start?

501
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,000
Mm-hmm.

502
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,900
Get their inspiration?

503
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,320
There's there's always see that that for me is that subgenius.

504
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,560
The complete oddity of what Spike Milligan was writing week after week after week.

505
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,860
The hardest thing in the world is to get somebody to give a crap.

506
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,520
And when you find like minded mutants who are thinking the worst.

507
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,620
about the same kind of stuff, then you raise that ability to have more people

508
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,880
give a crap about it. It's just the networking, it's just the connecting.

509
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,380
Oh, there must be a cure for it.

510
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,400
Yes, yes, the screens, the screens.

511
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,220
Never before so much paralyzing terror as in this hair-raising orgy of sadism.

512
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,120
At the mercy of the twisted perversions of a madman who satisfies his lust by torturing his victims

513
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,840
with the bone-breaking rack, the razor-sharp sword,

514
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,200
the scalding boiling oil, the deadly spider web.

515
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,980
Grotesque rituals and pagan orgies, they worship evil as their god

516
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,200
and their high priest is evil.

517
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,460
The devil's lust, the living dead feasting on the life's blood of their victims.

518
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,820
Help! Keep quiet and sit down! I command you!

519
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:04,400
Let us beware of those who seek to possess our bodies and our minds.

520
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,580
For the academic world dehumanizes us.

521
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,280
The hypnotic spells they cast on the living are a prelude

522
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,380
to the unspeakable terrors yet to come.

523
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,180
These microphones are excellent at picking up the fans of every machine in here.

524
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,780
Yes.

525
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,260
That's what I've noticed.

526
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,700
And the fans of every fan in here because everyone has fans

527
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,280
because it's the only way to stay cool in this ungodly heat.

528
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,360
No, that explains it, why it's quite hummy in here.

529
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,660
Let's all get a Hummer now.

530
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,420
Quality American built.

531
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,940
I apologize.

532
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:48,960
I am not capable of pulling off the intense stream of unconsciousness

533
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,420
that someone like Lonesome Cowboy Dave can pull off.

534
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,060
No, that's cool.

535
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
No, this is absolutely...

536
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,520
Hello!

537
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,740
Absolutely amateur hour.

538
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,660
This is just me with my stuff set up.

539
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,820
Well, if you want an amateur hour, here I am.

540
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,880
It's kind of nice because it's fun just sitting here and chatting.

541
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,180
Sometimes when it's actually a show with a capital S,

542
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,720
you tend to get a little too excited.

543
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,340
You have to be able to think in some cases.

544
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,500
And thinking can hurt, especially in this weather.

545
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,060
Think hurt.

546
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,980
Think hurt.

547
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,480
Think hurt.

548
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,920
I'd rather have the other kind of hurt if you ask me.

549
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,700
So it's kind of good to just chill and hang out and see what happens.

550
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:37,340
Kick back, relax, have a cool beverage, wear cooling towels on your head.

551
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,120
And just slack off.

552
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,140
Please be slackful wherever you are.

553
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,460
And stay out of the heat.

554
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,500
The sun is hot.

555
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,320
Don't touch it.

556
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,740
Are you trying to tell me that a girl sucking blood from a man's neck

557
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,380
induces orgasm?

558
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,320
The creeping horror spread like some twisted bubble.

559
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,220
A vile plant engulfing the living and the dead.

560
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,100
Walking the earth until the pits of hell open wide to receive the living,

561
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,540
the dead, and the undead.

562
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,420
The face of an angel.

563
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,240
The heart of a killer.

564
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,080
The power of the devil.

565
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,860
I want to know who you're meeting in the cemetery.

566
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,340
I don't have to tell you anything.

567
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,700
I have friends.

568
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,740
They do favors for me.

569
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,880
What kind of favors?

570
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,940
You'll find out.

571
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,560
Okay, tell me the Grindhouse schedule.

572
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,700
Okay, so tonight's Grindhouse schedule, as I mentioned, the theme of the show tonight

573
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,220
is Dicey.

574
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


575
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


576
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


577
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


578
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


579
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


580
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


581
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


582
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


583
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


584
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


585
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


586
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


587
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220


588
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,600
Oh, fuck it.

589
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,160
I watch now.

590
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,640
Stuff that will wrap your mind into a little bitty ball and pee on it.

591
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,140
The evening starts with the weird world of LSD.

592
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,240
Okay.

593
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,360
Where you get to watch the poor guy fly a giant bird.

594
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,260
Spread your wings and fly.

595
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,060
What year was this made?

596
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,980
Oh, I'd have to look it up.

597
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,600
Mm-hmm.

598
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,280
But in the era of the what?

599
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,620
The...

600
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
The early 70s?

601
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,760
It's basically, yeah, late 60s, early 70s.

602
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,280
It's basically Reefer Madness for LSD.

603
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:39,820
Okay.

604
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,000
Followed by Evil Bong.

605
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,980
The first of the Evil Bong film series.

606
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,860
This is the original featuring Tommy Chong.

607
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,760
Tommy Chong?

608
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,820
Yes.

609
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,280
Okay.

610
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,140
Okay.

611
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,560
Tommy Chong and Evil Bong.

612
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,420
After or before his main work with Cheech and Chong?

613
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
Well after.

614
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,320
Oh, okay.

615
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,460
After he got out of jail, actually.

616
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,020
Okay.

617
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,620
Followed by a fine piece of film called Doggy Woggy's Poochie Woochies.

618
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,620
Come on.

619
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,400
That is the title of the film.

620
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,760
Are you familiar with Alexander Hodorowski's Holy Mountain?

621
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,280
So, okay.

622
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:39,000
Hodorowski I'm familiar with because I was listening to Nosehair Lintgland out of Radio Valencia,

623
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,400
which has dearly departed but now replaced with Pete Goldie's own streaming service.

624
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,700
So are you familiar with Holy Mountain?

625
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,020
So Holy Mountain I saw pieces of during the Hodorowski documentary about Dune,

626
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,660
which I drove my...

627
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,160
daughter five towns over to see.

628
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,100
The only place it was showing in Metro Detroit was up in Farmington Hills, way the heck north.

629
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,840
And Hodorowski is just an amazing person.

630
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Well, Doggy Woggy's Poochie Woochies is a remake of Holy Mountain.

631
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,700
Done entirely with stock dog footage.

632
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Okay, I'm sold.

633
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,540
How long does that go on?

634
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,620
Yeah, how long does it go on is definitely the question to ask.

635
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,180
Because I'm sure it will just go on and on and on until your brain just farts right into your ear.

636
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,460
Uh-huh.

637
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,660
This is followed by Dr. Caligari.

638
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,480
Not the original Cabot of Dr. Caligari, but the fine version that I showed last year.

639
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,500
Okay.

640
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,640
Is it like Hammer Horror?

641
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,180
No, it's kind of porny.

642
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,480
Okay, porny.

643
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,880
You got my attention.

644
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,580
Do you want to have heads with a doorknob?

645
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,500
No.

646
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,880
No, that I don't want.

647
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,440
This is followed by the seminal Spider Baby.

648
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,520
Who is the cast of Spider Baby?

649
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,080
Starring Lon Chaney Jr. and Sid Haig.

650
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,760
I'll tell you what.

651
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:35,500
Lon Chaney Jr. features large in my life now because I've become a big Gilbert Gottfried's amazing colossal podcast listener.

652
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,640
And the man has a life mask of Lon Chaney Jr. in his house.

653
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,320
I mean, he's that devoted to Lon Chaney Jr.

654
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,880
That's Gilbert Gottfried's favorite actor.

655
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,760
And I can see why, having taken in some of his work since.

656
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,200
So I cannot wait for that.

657
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,740
And at approximately 2 a.m. I have no idea because everything just thundered.

658
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,680
It's going to close as it does.

659
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:07,680
And I have no idea when anything is going to actually be other than it all starts at approximately 545 tonight.

660
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,600
Closing out the night, as always, the last film before the end of the world.

661
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,420
Forbidden Zone.

662
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,520
Mm-hmm.

663
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,060
In color.

664
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,680
Mm-hmm.

665
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,280
Saw it last year.

666
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,920
This is how we end the world, ladies and gentlemen.

667
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,720
Gotta see it again.

668
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,220
Because one day we will get it right.

669
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,000
You know?

670
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,020
You know?

671
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,020


672
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,060
Here's to the family reunion.

673
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,340
Damn you!

674
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,480
Both of you!

675
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,480
Now let me out, Pau!

676
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,100
You're for mom!

677
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,640
You just hold her tight.

678
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,500
I'm at least going to get a little feel.

679
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,160
I don't think Pau would be too mad at that.

680
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,080
Mad?

681
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,520
It ain't nothing but a show of affection.

682
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,720
Betwixt some country cousins.

683
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,740
Feeding.

684
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,480
Seeding.

685
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,900
And breeding from dawn till dusk.

686
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,860
Trouble is, with all that feeding, seeding, and breeding,

687
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,360
he hardly has time or energy for any farm laboring.

688
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,900
She was also a tad uppity,

689
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,180
having been raised by our highfalutin relatives in the city.

690
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,420
Well, where's your dad?

691
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,720
In London, visiting the Prince of Wales.

692
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,080
Do tell.

693
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,440
For drinking for five.

694
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,660
By five, she'd had five.

695
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,780
And corn liquor was all it took.

696
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,800
Oh, it's better than my tea!

697
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,980
Five good snorts guaranteed.

698
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,960
To put hair on your chest.

699
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,240
Oh!

700
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,240
Er, figuratively speaking.

701
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,340
I don't know what there is about this gives me such a wild feeling.

702
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,140
Ha ha ha ha!

703
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,260
Maybe it's the wind in my hair!

704
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,380
Talk to Lisa!

705
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,260
Ha ha ha ha!

706
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,560
You hear tell about kissing cousins.

707
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,160
But to most country folk, it don't generally stop there.

708
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,860
Kissing's just a jumping off place for bigger and better things.

709
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,740
I just, I can't really believe it's happening.

710
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,140
Well, take your clothes off or it won't.

711
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,600
Y'all hear me now.

712
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,720
You gotta, you gotta say this for this death cult, we just keep swinging.

713
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,740
Once a year.

714
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,600
We don't like, you know, lose faith.

715
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,700
We don't cry and say, you know, we don't off ourselves in our brand new sneakers and purple

716
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,360
jer-, jer-, track suits.

717
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,900
We just come back again this time for sure.

718
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,240
Well, and give it another shot.

719
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,660
And you know, if, and the good thing about this year is if the world does not end tomorrow,

720
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,860
at 7 a.m. We still have a few days to hang out. That's right. So I'm looking at the schedule and

721
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,640
like, okay, Saturday looks like the fun day. Schedule. Saturday looks like the fun day when

722
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:45,900
I'm not here. So now. Schedule is a very funny word. It's always a funny word the next day.

723
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,940
So.

724
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:46,260
Don't want no more bun. More, more, more, more bun. Don't want no more bun.

725
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,280
Maybe the fox can say it better.

726
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,360
What does the fox say?

727
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,980
Oh no.

728
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,640
Fox made it to X Day.

729
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,200
Fox is here?

730
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,500
It's okay. Is it on?

731
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,660
Yeah.

732
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,580
We're close quarters here in the Pleasure Palace recording studio at X Day 21.

733
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,760
Which, you know, seems.

734
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:38,620
Slightly damp and moist outside. So we are lucky to be inside in a studio facility provided to us because we are paid up in our dues.

735
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,820
Given such delightful access to this magical trailer.

736
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:57,740
This is Anna Mull here with YB Dobbs from Austin.

737
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:57,740


738
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:57,740


739
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:57,740


740
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:57,740


741
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:57,740


742
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,100
I'm in Texas. Also.

743
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,460
And I'd like to add that I have never met this person in my life.

744
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
But I know that they exist.

745
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,640
See, there are others of us out there. So close.

746
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,380
In location. As far as on the planet that is about to be turned to cinders is considered.

747
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,400
And yet we've never met. And that is why we have divivals.

748
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,740
That's why we have these lovely X Day drills.

749
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,320
Drills and outreaches to find other subgenius.

750
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,940
Not just on the Internet.

751
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,060
But in actual real life.

752
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,540
So tell us more about this background music you have here.

753
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,540
What is the sounds that we are hearing that are not our voice?

754
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,260
Attempting to play a couple of tracks that I've made over the years.

755
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,120
Right at the moment.

756
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,500
Under my project.

757
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,040
Power to the High Frequencies.

758
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,420
There. That's my shout out for the whole show.

759
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,800
I promise I won't keep doing that.

760
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,940
Power to the High Frequencies.

761
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,780
That is an excellent. You go right ahead.

762
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,160
We are not in a non-commercial existence here for a reason.

763
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,140
That's right.

764
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,220
By all means. Do you have a Patreon is what the kids are doing these days?

765
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,580
Or a PayPal?

766
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,240
I think.

767
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,100
I think somebody set us up a Patreon at one point.

768
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,240
We for sure have a.

769
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,920
I think a lot of people had that happen for them.

770
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,300
Yeah.

771
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,180
I don't think anything.

772
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,680
No one flocked to ours at all.

773
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,060
Yeah. That's what happened to the Thorazine year in Podcrust.

774
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,940
Everybody was like.

775
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,140
Come get our gold memory.

776
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,060
I like the Podcrust.

777
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,900
It was great. It was great.

778
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,160
But sometimes you just have to.

779
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,260
You can't depend on a Patreon page.

780
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,720
How does Time for the Show do it?

781
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,660
Are they all just mongers?

782
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,340
I think they just blatantly said.

783
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,320
Here's our PayPal.

784
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,600
Give us money.

785
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,940
Much like mine is ANNAMAULHOUSE at gmail.com.

786
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,760
You can send me PayPal's through that.

787
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,140
Venmo is.

788
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,380
What is the thing?

789
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,780
Capital ANNAMAUL on Venmo.

790
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,780
There's also the cash tag animal.

791
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,940
It's capital A capital M.

792
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,420
So.

793
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,300
All kinds of earth monies can be sent directly through the PayPal.

794
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,580
I would happily make more entertaining things.

795
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,940
I'm not going to do membership levels for these shows.

796
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,580
It's a free for all.

797
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,280
No. I'm sorry.

798
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,340
It's not a free for all.

799
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,420
You've got to pay for it.

800
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,060
But you'll get access to every level.

801
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,840
What are the different levels?

802
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,260
There were different levels.

803
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,080
There were different levels.

804
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,720
The Podcrust had a platinum level where you got sent in.

805
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,180
You could actually smell the broadcast as it was being made.

806
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,520
Oh.

807
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,180
Yeah.

808
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,760
So total immersion into the sensory overload.

809
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,500
Fully immersed experience.

810
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,580
Very good.

811
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,620
Yeah. Okay.

812
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,120
Okay.

813
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,120
Actually, I don't think they were.

814
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,620
They got incentives then.

815
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,140
That's the.

816
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,680
They just.

817
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,680
Putting the scent in incentive.

818
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,160
Yes.

819
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,960
I don't think it was probably the best idea and might have been why we didn't have many

820
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,060
people at the platinum level.

821
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,940
By many, I mean any.

822
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,560
Any.

823
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,720
Put it into the any and many.

824
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,360
Nobody signed up at all for the full immersion?

825
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,160
Well, no.

826
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,160


827
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,160


828
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,160


829
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,160


830
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:26,840
Nope.

831
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,520
Nope.

832
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:35,420
Not even our bestest fan got in on the gold level though and got to actually be on a few

833
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:35,840
shows.

834
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,300
Nice.

835
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,700
So, like I said, if people send us money, they can be on the show.

836
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,020
That's by us.

837
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,020
It's the royal us.

838
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,720
Right.

839
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,540
Royal.

840
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,640
The royal animal.

841
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,240
All y'all.

842
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,460
Somebody asked me the other day.

843
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,140
I think it was staying.

844
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,760
He was like, so what is it?

845
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,440
Is it reverend?

846
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,700
Is it a doctor?

847
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,120
What is it?

848
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,880
And I was like, yes.

849
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,560
Well, I've paid enough times.

850
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,240
I can make up my own damn.

851
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,060
It's overlord at this point.

852
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,520
Overwoman.

853
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,080
Overlord.

854
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:02,660
Absolutely.

855
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,600
It's been overlord for many.

856
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,340
Yeah, overlady doesn't sound, it sounds worse.

857
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,940
Like a scripted almost.

858
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,220
It's limited, not over.

859
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,360
Overlady.

860
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,460
No overlady.

861
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:15,660
No.

862
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,700
The overlady comes in and she's wearing her monocle and bionicles both at the same time

863
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,520
as you, close and far.

864
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,140
I used to call her monocle.

865
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,140


866
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,060
I used to collect bionicles.

867
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,660
Oh yeah.

868
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,540
The Lego things.

869
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:28,900
Yeah.

870
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,160
Right.

871
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:29,500
Yeah.

872
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,420
That's so terrible.

873
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:30,680
Oh yeah.

874
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,360
I used to have a bunch of those comic books actually.

875
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,280
They were, and there was a show I believe.

876
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,820
It got very popular for some time.

877
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
I was-

878
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,060
A whole day is some time.

879
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,940
What amount of time?

880
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,200
Because I was just like, you know, it's like some time.

881
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,540
Sometimes.

882
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,340
Bionicles are-

883
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,160
It was very popular.

884
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:50,920
Right.

885
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,520
For some time.

886
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,220
Much like we can say about ourselves.

887
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,100
We're very popular for some time.

888
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,300
That means then that there will be like a-

889
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,700
It was that moment before somebody listened to us.

890
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,700
Very popular.

891
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,720
While you were still underground.

892
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,380
Right.

893
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:09,660
It just means that, yeah, it will come back and you'll be popular again due to people

894
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:15,600
wanting that good old 2014, 15, 16, 17 sound.

895
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,080
The nostalgia of the days of the post 2000s.

896
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,160
Oh yeah.

897
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,260
I'm trying to make nostalgia out of nostalgia too.

898
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:24,980
In that way.

899
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,760
I saw some Enron notepads the other day at a thrift store.

900
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,140
Really?

901
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,900
I was just like, you know, there were supposed to be like spreadsheets or something.

902
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:43,820
Maybe if they'd have used those, then they would have not had, you know, they'd have

903
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,240
used the spreadsheets at Enron.

904
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,820
They would have maybe stayed around a little longer.

905
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,200
Just throwing that out there.

906
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,260
I mean, they threw all of their spreadsheets out.

907
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,840
They did.

908
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,380
They did.

909
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,620
I think they got rid of all of it pretty quickly.

910
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,820
I think I too need a Shell Corporation.

911
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,480
Oh, they got the best gas.

912
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,340
They have preservatives in their gasoline.

913
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,760
Oh no, you mean like a...

914
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,120
Oh yeah, different kind of Shell.

915
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:11,780
Radiation there.

916
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,360
Different kind of Shell Corporation.

917
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,900
Have you seen my frog?

918
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,520
I, um...

919
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,400
He's about this tall and I think he can probably swallow a manhole.

920
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,640
Wow, that is a really large...

921
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,200
Well, how wide is he?

922
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,120
How wide is that frog?

923
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,000
He's about this wide.

924
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,880
This wide.

925
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,700
Which is, that's a large bus that you're standing next to.

926
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,460
Are you comparing it to the size of the bus?

927
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,020
Not a short bus.

928
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,620
Well, maybe, no, it was the...

929
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:49,720
Well, yeah, the person he had swallowed at the time, maybe their scale was throwing off

930
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,000
my particular perception.

931
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,700
Like, spatially, you know, of like being able to like say, oh, well, those are like

932
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,580
size 17 shoes, so it's the frog's got to be like, you know, at least the size of one of

933
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,340
those like yellow buses, I would say.

934
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,120
It's hard to miss and it looks like a big poisonous frog.

935
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,300
I prefer my buses azure, but...

936
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:13,600
Azure?

937
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,000
Azure, azure.

938
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,860
So, I mean, what were you doing letting a frog like that loose in the first place?

939
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:26,740
How could, how can you even, can you even say it's your frog at that point?

940
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,200
I would be denying the crap out of that.

941
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,740
That is not my frog.

942
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,720
I don't know where this frog came from.

943
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:33,980
That's nobody's frog.

944
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,140
That's absolutely...

945
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,660
Wow.

946
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,980
The frog of the deep forest.

947
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,420
Whatever that murderous frog that, oh no, we were just, I was just sitting near the

948
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:42,720
frog.

949
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,520
I don't, I've never seen this frog before in my life, officer.

950
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,720
You couldn't, you wouldn't even think of it as a frog is the thing that I thought was

951
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,820
most appealing about it.

952
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,580
Oh no!

953
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,300
Yeah.

954
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,360
But I didn't want to AFK.

955
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:05,580
They were...

956
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:05,580


957
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,240
It was almost dessus and it was safe or safe.

958
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,820
So one, when I was чистed, I saw, I mean, they were very close to me, like completely

959
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:08,820


960
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,780
So I just set it on

961
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,700
to a mat and I just started feeling...

962
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:12,700


963
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,300
So I remember reaching out at it a little.

964
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,300


965
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,940
You really want to make a defined conversation with the frog.

966
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:17,860
Yeah.

967
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,800
Yeah, it was that or one of those Greyhound Steely Dan things.

968
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,580
So did you order it on SkyMall?

969
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,360
I mean, Hammer Schlemmer or whatever it was.

970
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:34,740
How do you get one of those delivered to where you can take a ride on a frog?

971
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,260
It kind of just hopped over.

972
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,620
I think it wasn't a drone thing.

973
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,480
And I had seen advertisements for it.

974
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,380
And I did notice a dip in my bank account suddenly after this feeling of purchase that occurred.

975
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,420
So it was a feeling of purchase.

976
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,760
And that is why you can't own it because you can't own land.

977
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,400
You can't own the frog.

978
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
You really actually can.

979
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,260
That's why they have trespassing laws.

980
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:08,680
By the way, if somebody comes knocking on the door here and telling us we need to leave, those might apply.

981
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,580
Oh, I see.

982
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:10,960
Right.

983
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,440
The bug.

984
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,140
It's trespass laws.

985
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,540
We'll have to hop the next...

986
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,040
Frog.

987
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,160
You have to order another frog.

988
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,700
Yeah, it hopped away.

989
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,940
I don't know what happened to it.

990
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,180
Well, it ate that guy.

991
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,560
It must have been...

992
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,880
Oh, yeah.

993
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,180
It's going to be on the ground.

994
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,740
Are you the lucky one for not having been chosen to be on the inside of a giant poisonous frog?

995
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,580
That's what I'm wondering.

996
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,780
I can say that for myself.

997
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,300
Yeah, I am the lucky one in that.

998
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,240
I can't say that for the person who was devoured.

999
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:41,440
To me, you can't really say it for your bank account because you did take the payment for that.

1000
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,760
It is just money, though, I suppose.

1001
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,440
I make more all the time or not enough all the time.

1002
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,960
It's more like I make not enough money all the time.

1003
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,660
You know, I too feel like I don't make enough all of the time or even some of the time.

1004
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:03,780
So, you know, if people were to say, you know, that background noise, it's not noise, it's actual music.

1005
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,580
There's two means.

1006
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,420
Maybe I need to send money in and they'll turn that up.

1007
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,060
Where would they send the money into?

1008
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,460
You're going to look for it.

1009
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,740
Look for pirates of the high frequencies on your band camp.

1010
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,260
That's where we take a lot of our put a lot of our material on there.

1011
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:27,020
And you can find it there for a pay what you want rate, which is tax free.

1012
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:33,700
I don't know if it's tax deductible, but band camp does take a little bit of that money so that they can keep running.

1013
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,540
You see, and thieves.

1014
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,680
Absolutely.

1015
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,160
Selfish, selfish droobs.

1016
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,900
You know, they're doing this thing, too.

1017
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:54,780
Now that we're talking about band camp, that they're like reselling like collections of music that like, you know, I don't know if you've listened to any of the like, like a numero group or eccentric soul like recordings and stuff.

1018
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:06,540
But they have a similar thing where they're like taking music from like all around and kind of recompilizing, reconstituting it in a new product for them to make money off of, which is, you know, in its own right.

1019
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:06,980
Kind of cool.

1020
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,300
I suppose they think they can do that in their own right.

1021
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,720
As in, we signed that paperwork.

1022
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,640
When we decided to put things on band camp.

1023
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,120
And by we, I mean somebody else.

1024
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,880
I am not involved.

1025
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,480
By sign, you mean not even a double click, just one click for that little box.

1026
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,560
And that's that's all you get.

1027
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,080
I will take all of your spam email.

1028
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,060
And oh, by the way, you can sell my stuff.

1029
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,580
Copyright infringement is your best entertainment value.

1030
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,640
Copyright infringement is your best entertainment value.

1031
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,000
Oh, I see.

1032
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,560
I think there might be a presence in the room.

1033
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,000
Door open.

1034
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,460
Left.

1035
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,200
Oh, the door is open.

1036
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,140
I got to run through.

1037
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,620
OK, don't.

1038
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,280
It's the frog.

1039
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,120
Be careful.

1040
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,040
Not the frog.

1041
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,800
Here, let me play some ambience ambulance music.

1042
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:10,840
OK.

1043
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,340
I'll be right back.

1044
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,380
Never been one to look back.

1045
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,240
Trying to cover my tracks.

1046
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,780
To regret or undo what I've done.

1047
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,300
Now's not the time to begin.

1048
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,260
Soles of my boots wear a cap.

1049
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,260


1050
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,260


1051
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,260


1052
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:47,080
Wearing a ball of string at the moon and the sun.

1053
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,260
How do you measure a life?

1054
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,240
Is it by friends?

1055
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:10,240


1056
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,920
Family ties?

1057
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:17,560
Or the work that you do every day?

1058
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:27,260
Or by the stranger whose path crossing with yours found you left?

1059
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,900
Something shining behind in your wake?

1060
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,800
Stay ahead of the wolves.

1061
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,660
Step in the light.

1062
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,560
Keep on moving.

1063
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,520
Put up a fight.

1064
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,040
If you must, say no to gravity's pull.

1065
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,860
Stay ahead of the wolves in your heart.

1066
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,320
When someone you love rips apart.

1067
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,840
Everything that you hold to believe.

1068
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,920
Is unconditional love.

1069
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,120
It's a life of freedom.

1070
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,120


1071
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,640
Is unconditional love.

1072
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,640


1073
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,640


1074
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,640


1075
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,640


1076
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:12,680
Something you only talk of.

1077
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:18,220
So much harder to live than to leave.

1078
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,540
So much harder to give than receive.

1079
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,620
Stay ahead of the wolves.

1080
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,460
Step in the light.

1081
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,360
