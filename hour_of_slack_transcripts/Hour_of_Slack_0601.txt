Eh?
Eh?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.
Yes, baby!
It is time
once again
for that self-same
one and only
true hour of
slack number
601.
That's right.
601 hours of slack
on the wall and painted
across the inside of
your cranium. Your poor
skull has had these
damn shows lining it
for weeks and weeks now
and there's not a damn thing
you, me, or
J.R. Bob Dobbs
can do about it.
Eh?
Heh heh.
Hey.
What the?
It's time to be manipulated.
Brother, I want to tell you something.
The world is tired of dead preaching
preachers. Dead preachers preaching
dead sermons to dead congregations.
They're tired of cold
services and cold churches.
This world is hungry for
reality. They've had enough of
Hollywood. They've had enough of
Nashville. They've had enough of
show business. They're hungry for the
mighty power of the man that
walked the shores of Galilee
2,000 years ago and
raised the dead and cast out
devils and healed the sick.
And I'm here to tell you tonight that
Jesus Christ is still
raising the dead and healing.
I have my own
cheerleaders.
They're the sisters of
mercy. One of my main
cheerleaders just passed away, Mother
Teresa. So now, pick
a religion. I mean, whose cheerleaders
do you want, really?
I'd like to
thank Satan's cheerleaders for being here tonight.
They have another gig to go to, but
before they do, they're going to
be taking up a collection for what is a church
without a collection. So,
and I think we're splitting it
50-50. Half of your proceeds
that you donate will go to
the Satan's cheerleaders
to do with what they
will, shall be the whole of the law.
And our money, of course,
will be donated to the home
for slackless children.
Half goes to heaven and half
goes to hell.
And our name, too.
Nothing you can make any difference.
As Bob said
to L. Ron Hubbard,
Where are you?
I forgot the quote.
They may be pink, but their money
is green.
Say, why don't you
come with me? I'm off to see
the Wizard of Bob's in
Animal World City to
cut me some slack and
help you to get a brain.
Well, please,
take me with you. Please, please, please.
Where are we going again? Italy?
Take me with you. Take me with you.
No problem. Something's got to
move this plot along.
Come on with me and follow the
yellow spit toad.
Ribbit.
I have to see the Wizard.
The long-holding Wizard of Bob's.
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind
to the subgenius.
Our
house.
What?
Stop. Stop. Stop.
This is a stupid religion.
Say amen.
Amen.
Next day is more than a day.
Next day is an event
in the life of all mankind.
Man.
Mankind cannot wait
for this incident to happen
or to merely unfold beneath
its tortured, twisted unicorn toenails.
Mankind must instead rise
to the challenge of X-Day
and meet lovely Beverly Smats
and Jerry Thorhead
along with Wanda Smits
as the tortured gasoline-attended woman
in the tales of X-Day
coming to a drive-in
somewhere south of Philadelphia.
Another man
doth gall!
A other man
doth gall!

And these things are coming and coming speedily.
We are near the very, very end of the church age,
and of course the Gentile time has already come to a close.
How are you dangerous?
You don't conform to proper thought patterns. You need to be scanned.
Well, neither do you, and you need to be scanned, too.
Oh, my goodness.
There's no accident that God has you on at this late hour
where decent people can't hear you except for those like me
that are forced to stay awake to feed their families.
What am I going to do with this animal?
Control, control, you must have control.
Control.
Control, control, control.
Control, control, control, control.
Excellent, excellent.
I read you loud and clear.
Now then, you are to take this planet in the name of the Earth.
Hail family.
Strong, strong.
...to pick out targets for in the United States.
Ivan the Targeteer will probably lay what we call lay down
a thousand of those on United States cities.
If you think about that, that means that almost every city in this country
with a population of 15 to 20,000 or more is going to have a nuclear weapon.

And we've been targeted on it.
Friends, you have to do it for yourself.
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.
And what I'm doing, all of this, all this religion, it's just all religion is.
It's just a pep talk.
It's just a booster shot.
You know?
And why, for instance, why are we here?
Why are you all here?
What the hell are you all here for?
We're all here.

Well, as you can hear by the divine heckling, friends, it's for the attitude.
If, if, more than anything else, it's not necessarily for the music, which, you know,
it's good, I guess, or the ranting, which kind of, well, the preachers aren't very good
looking, and, well, or the whatever.
You know, it is the attitude that you're, because there are, there's two kinds of subgeniuses
in this room.
What's it done?
The ones who, the ones who think it's clever and cool and they get the joke and that's
fine.
And those who really get it and truly believe.
Those who really do anything for that man, Bob.
It's a difference, and you can tell it when you spot, when you first start talking to
him.
You can judge a book by the cover sometimes.
You know, you can't tell by the way they look.
They're not good.
You can't tell by the look or how old they are, how fat or skinny they are, but you can
sometimes tell whether somebody has paid some dues, you might say, and, and who hasn't.
Who has TV consciousness and who has true slack consciousness.
Those who are making the effort to pay attention to the slack that is already there.
You are swimming in a sea of Bob's pills, and you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb,
and dumbless to detect them.
But it's all, it is all there, friends, as long, that's the key to it.
But we must not let the conspiracy turn it into Slackers versus Slack, or the can't-see
Bob versus the real Bob.
He tops the
whole bunch of new stuff.
Life is Full of Clchlag.
Wait!
We're by the Canary Islands, not too far from the Canaries.
I can even smell it.
Mmm, different than the Azores, much different, much more tropical.
Yes, this is where the big fat sardines are, the ones that fit in those cans as big as
a car.
Yes, and soon we'll be so rich that we, that we'll eat napalm and, and, uh, sell imported
cheese.
Kennedy was never killed.
He was never killed.
Here's the deal.
The day before he was supposedly assassinated, he goes down to Cape Canaveral, the very day
before he's down in Cape Canaveral and gets a guided tour by the astronauts themselves
of the new rocket ships meant to take them into space.
And Kennedy was like so into this, man.
He was like, he was their total space cadet.
Oh, I have got to go now.
Yeah.
Please, please just strap me in.
I'm going to go down to Cape Canaveral and get a guided tour of the space.


And, uh, the, uh, the, whatever they did was staged.
That was just Hollywood.
What you saw in the films, it's all Hollywood.
So it was kind of like our dream of genie.
There was Jack in the one set in one place there and there was Marilyn Monroe and the
other one with the, with the little space helmet on.

There it is.
They were heading for the pleasure vesticles of the space testicles.
They're heading for the, they were headed for the pleasure vessels.
Matter of fact, as far as I know, they were, you know, given honorary mayor and queen
or something like that, you know, uh, to the pleasure vessels.
But unfortunately they're in a, an orbit around Neptune that they ran out of fuel and they're
just going to have to wait until after X day when the ships can pick them up along the
way out.
Yeah.
I remember you telling me that one time in a dream and there was one glitch in their
contract that had to keep fornicating for 30,000 years.
Yeah.
And it wasn't fun no more.
In order to keep up the light speed.
Cause even if you're not going to be able to fly, you're not going to be able to fly.

They didn't have orgasmic pleasure.
They had to stop doing it.
You know what I mean?
That was the only thing that was different.
Nobody knows that I'm a pleasure ship.
Hey, I got an idea for something different.
Let's not do it.
You know, the pleasure ships, they couldn't, they do travel faster than light and you travel
three, four or five times faster than light, which means you're actually going so backwards
in time that you were already not, you had already left before.
But only when Jack and Marilyn are having orgasms.
You know what?
And you can achieve, you know, five, six, seven times faster than light really depends
on how good Jackie is that, you know, night and after about the 35,000 tonight, you know,
things get a little, but since they've become the icons, they, you know, they like the job.
I've heard they like the job, but there's one bad part about it.
They got in this little window.
There's Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey.
I was on video tape and I'm doing it laughing and making rude comments.
Yeah.
Shooting guns.
There's another hell they got to go through for their alleged affair.
Shooting guns in the room next door.
Happy birthday to you.
Mr. President.
Yeah.
All the cooking.
The cutesy Bob might tell some funny jokes, but the real Bob, the real Bob is a real Bob.









The real Bob won't even show up.
The real Bob will just be a picture of the real mom.
Anything else?
Kill it.
If somebody ever claims to be Bob Dobbs to you, Bob said, if, if you meet me on the highway,
kill me.
Reason being, if it's really Bob, it ain't going to hurt.
If it wasn't, Bobby's going to stay dead and good.
.

.
So though it is true that we are now after 20 years, the official authorized anti-establishment
institution, yet at the same time, friends, we are looking for the, we're looking for
people who love to hate.
We are looking for the for real down hole people, the gamblers, whores, hustlers, players,
and pimps and bull daggers.
The down hole people, you know?
The for real people.

Cause those are the ones that have slack.
Friend, friend, do you pee?
Then you might be interested in what I have to say.
.
.
I'm sure you're really interested in everything we have to say here, dear friend.
.

.

.
This new CD we got is really promising.
It's from Ego Plum.
That's the name, Ego Plum.
And we'll tell you more about Ego Plum in Los Angeles as time wears on.
.
No, I need something fancier.
Holy, holy, holy.
Holy, holy, holy.
Holy, Lord Bob Almighty, dear friends.
I guess it's so good, again, to have the power.
The power.
And let me tell you what power we've been listening to at the very beginning of the show.
You heard the great Jimmy Swaggart.
You heard Jesus Christ collecting for the subgenius revival here in Texas, in Austin.
Our most recent show there in Austin.
You heard Einstein's Secret Orchestra and the Brain Rot Radio Theater and the Wizard of Bob clip.
You heard even more Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
As Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave delve deeper into the very bowels and up the little fleshy hole.
And all the way.
All the way through the murky, muddy crud of those tubes to X-Day.
You heard Reverend, in fact, Ear, Reverend Friday Jones in your ear.
With her pro subgenius rant number four, Discover Your Secret Yeti Heritage.
Nice, smoky voice, Reverend.
Reverend.
Miss Friday Jones, as doesn't she.
And plenty to back it up to, friends.
And little bits and pieces from the ancient subgenius media barrage number five, as well as number zero.
Both masters recently repaired by myself with a tape splicer.
And some clips from the recent Austin devival.
Subgenius devival sponsored by Fringeware.
In Austin.
Austin, Texas, where I just got back from.
Hey, why are you here?
And who is the real Bob?
And the electric guitar music we've been hearing up until...
Up until just that second.
Well, no.
Well, you know, the old 70s sound kind of Hendrixian material.
That's from Mahogany Rush.
Frank Marino, Land of a Thousand Nights.
Lots of Einstein's Secret Radio.
Talking about Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.
And how on X-Day we have to fornicate.
And friends, this music in the background is an amazing new CD we got from something called Ego Plum.
Now, not very much explanation.
I believe that Mr. Ego Plum composes this material mainly for films.
And, uh...
Animation and so forth.
The piece we're hearing in the background now is called Les Cirques Macabres.
Other titles include things like...
Well, let's just skip through them.
Now get this, friends.
Listen to this guy's stuff.
The music in this video is a work of fiction.

It is intended to be a work of fiction.
It is intended to be a work of fiction.
It is intended to be a work of fiction.
It is intended to be a work of fiction.

In addition to that music is like one of the most historic films in the world.
Here we go for another one.
I know...
Well, this guy is part of a work because I know where this guy goes.
Now, make sure I'm all dried up.
I have to close two of them at this point.

Naturally, it goes on.
I have to.
Hmm.
Now this guy's stuff is showing some versatility.
Catch Clown Fever is the title of this little ditty here.
Here's an evening stroll.
It's rather reminiscent of Nino Rota, the fellow who scored so many of Federico Fellini's
films as well as many other things.
There's a very Rota-esque feel to these.
Which also, you know, I mean for younger people I guess they'd say, oh it sounds like Danny
Elfman.
Well, it's...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
This guy's great!
Amputato is the name of this little piece here.
We get the coolest stuff in the mail, man!
Man.
Man.
There's that foreign film sounding stuff.
And it is film soundtrack music.
The CD came to with a...
Well, here, I'll read you the letter.
Dear friends, just as a glimpse into the subgenius foundation...
Well, this is a glimpse into the more glamorous and fun end of the subgenius foundation.
All right.
All right, friends.
And this letter from this person we've never heard from before.
Max Patlan of Ebola Music.
Ebola Music, which brought us the CD.
The ego plum.
The anthology of infection.
Poor reverend.
In a world where instrumental music usually means Yanni or Kenny G,
our label is breaking new ground in something we like to call uneasy listening.
We're very proud of the fact that our release has been so well accepted locally.
When kids who claim their favorite band to be the Dead Kennedys email us wanting to know more about ego plum and Ebola music,
we begin to feel we've tapped into something special.
Imagine.
Instrumental music.
Oh, this is like a form letter to...
Radio stations, but they did send it to the right guy.
Imagine instrumental music that actually appeals to Generation X
that isn't techno, ambient, or jungle, or some sort of retro lounge gimmick.
Ego plum is 22 years old and creating music like nobody else.
I'm sure it helps that he is part of Generation X and not some stuffy old composer.
He's just another punk.
With a sick sense of humor and talent spilling out of his ears, to say the least.
You know what?
My theory is that the guy who did the music also wrote this PR letter and has the fake front music company.
I did the same thing.
When we started the Church of the Sub-Jewish Friends, you know, Bob just kind of threw it in our laps.
He said, Reverend Stang, Viola, you boys now, just...
Look, here's the truth, the fact.
The fact is, you're...
You're tensing me.
The conspiracy exists.
And the world ends July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning.
Go for it.
That's about it.
And so we find, friends, ourselves as directionless as...
Well, no.
Actually, what I was about to say was...
And we've struggled in just...
The same way for any kind of media notice as this fellow has with his form letter and his strange CD.
But it's a...
The difference between this one and most of them?
This stuff is really, really good.
Friends, Ego Plum may be reached at...
Got that pencil ready?
Email info at...
EbolaMusic.com.
EbolaMusic is one word.
Just what you would think.
EbolaMusic.com.
Info at EbolaMusic.com is the email address.
You may write to Post Office Box 226-914.
That's 226-914.
Or Los Angeles, California.

No, I don't care whether these kids are 22 years old or 102 years old.
They're...
Friends, we deal with some strange...
Characters in this church.
This old church.
This...
This magnet for the...
Fatally talented, one might say.
And also a lot of just complete screw-ups.
People with no talent at all that think they've got something on the ball.
And just need a sense of superiority because...
Basically, they're losers.
And you know...
I'm glad that we provide that sort of...
Haven for these souls.
Especially if they...
Send in their $30.
Thank you.
Stimulating themselves and clearing their debts.
I want him to figure it out for us...
At least it's my idea.
I don't ask for money.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, I should mention that this piece is called The Happy Peasants.
What, what, what?
Oh, my God.
Tragic release.
Oh, my God.
There is an outhouse on a lonely hill
Where you can moon the rising sun
And it was almost the ruin of a drunk lay boy
Who was guilty of too much fun.
The band had came home on a Sunday morning
Just before the break of day
My friend didn't know when he pulled down his pants
But a blue larder was there to help him out.

He stopped on the roof because that was all heful with.
A snotp 의� crisp stick
And Thanh Tienyong.

The spinning Adam made it beautiful.
Forget big aby and play you Regroo.
A larder.
It was made


Is
it
it?
All right.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Well, he went to sleep, a forgotten man.
His race to the pot had been run.
And he told me later that he froze his eyes off when he woke up with the rising sun.
But worst of all, in the shivering cold,
he remembered.
The chore he had not done.
Adding in sun to injury.
There was no toilet paper in the outhouse of the rising sun.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
That Quentin had the other day.
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,iro, oh, oh, oh, oh.
He said my Vaticano guy was blind.

He swung an bow as to the Warden of the Alliance.
And a sharp blow to hitherto reason.

Harryята won.

Son, get up, son.
Rise up, wake up, boy.
Don't go to sleep on that pot, man.
Freeze your ass off.
You could really get serious, you.
You won't be worth it for a week.
Get up, man, go to bed.
Get up, man.
Get up, kid.
It was nearly the run of this poor, drunk playboy.
He was guilty of having too much fun.
But none of it was in the house of the rising sun.
Friends.
Tom X.
I wish I hadn't been so rude to that guy when he walked up to me backstage at the Austin show
and handed me his CD.
And his tank.
I said, God, I feel, I kind of felt good.
It was a rough time for me.
But I feel like Tom and X, Tom X and I could probably, you know, could probably relate.
Cut.
Tom X is available at, last week when I ran that song by him,
I couldn't find an address.
On the CD jacket.
But there is one on the CD per se.
Which is, and I prepare you now.
Supernatural music.
Dedicated to the one I love.
The one I, Cyclopean, love.
The one I love.
Love.
Akashic Records.

suppose, oh, this man or woman will be equipped for the future. Yes, this new human will have
maybe seven eyes, maybe twelve nostrils, and three middle nostrils. Yes, yes.
There's no expense needed for that. Oh, there will be no expense, spirit, my beloved one.
When we all take the jump into the future, our fingers will become as long as those tendrils
of light. Our muscles will be like chicken wire. Our feet, oh, the things we'll do with
our feet. I think this is all madness, and I'm very, very frightened. Oh, don't be frightened,
child. Any walk into the future always has a few jittery moments. Once you put on that
arcane suit with the seven silver scientific slash, seven, seven.
Seven, seven. You'll be one of us, and one of them, too. Oh, you'll be one with everything.
Wow, it sounds really exciting. Maybe I should just step up and do it.
That's right. Of course you will. We'll all step up and do it. Sometimes we'll step back
and do it. Sometimes we'll step aside. But we'll all be doing it with...
Many, many new digits and a brain that's as big as a car. We'll drive around in that
car, you and I, and the rest of us, too. In fact, in fact, well, I...
He's so dashing. He's the kind of guy you really can just put all your faith into, you
know?
I have a hard time putting everything into perspective. I have a hard time keeping everything,
well, keeping track, so to speak.
Yeah.
Oh, so I once was a...
Yes, yes. I'm back, dear friends. Back from the damned. I was saved. I have saved myself.
We'll all save ourselves. You and you and you, well, you and you will save each other.
But the rest of us, we'll all save ourselves. And when we do, we'll take the Sky Chopper
into oblivion with our new hands.
They'll digitize together. All the extra digits digitize into one big hand-to-hand thing.
It's going to be amazing. Wondrous.
Oh, it's truly amazing. It is truly amazing, the things they've done here at the Michael
Sharts Agency.
You see, I'm...
One of our finest talents this year at the Michael...
Michael Sharts Agency was Miss Betty Pegg, whose hit song, I Wanna Be Your Romeo Baby,
sung in Urdu.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
There she is.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
It's going to flatten across the planet and embed it in each one of these platinum-based CDs.
It's a message for each and every one of you.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
A cosmic message.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
A cosmic message spoken deep into the forebrain of each and every one of you.
It is what you need.
It is the expansion you've been waiting for.
The beta-increasement, the oxygen case, the blue, the purple, the orange, the colors.
Oh, it's great.
You're going to love it.
So don't forget to be your Romeo baby.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
I wanna be your Romeo baby.
can till the love, baby yeah.
Come on.
Be your Romeo baby.
Come on, yeah, yeah.
I was a bashful cello one time.
I was bashful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It was a new one on me, friends, on a new Hendrix compilation, an authorized thing called South Saturn Delta.
Is that the...
And this beautiful stuff in the background is, of course, once again, Ego Plum.
Ego Plum. I like this Ego Plum thing.
We heard also the Brandenburg Concertos No. 4, as done by Wendy Carlos, and Einstein's Secret Radio, The New Man,
as described by Alfred E. Newman, a.k.a. Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And Princess Wiardo, I think, was in there with Chaz Smith.
On the 10997 ESO show, you never know what's going to come up next in this horrible day and age.
Thank you.
Well, if you're in Cleveland, then there is something I can tell you about.
There's a big devival Monday.
Lick my lips so I can talk right here.
Monday, October 27th.
At the Euclid Tavern.
Yeah, we got a big devival coming up in Cleveland.
Monday, October 27th at the Euclid Tavern with Dr. Legume.
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
That's right, we're just going to be doing it and doing it and doing it.
We'll do it right in front of your face. We don't care.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I think I messed up for a minute there.
I'm sorry. Well, we do care.
But, um...
Yes, with Dr. Legume and Einstein's Secret Orchestra,
we'll also have the Lord of all creation, Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
and also Joe Offrick.
Joe Offrick, the weirdo that was rejected from the Church of Satan
because they felt like he made them...
look bad.
And so we put him in our shows.
And, um...
And, friends, if these shows go out on time,
then that's probably tomorrow night if you're in Cleveland.
And I'll see you there.
Whew!
Yeah.
We're also planning, friends, a...
an X-Day drill.
0.5.
Another X-Day.
X-Day drill.
Before X-Day.
You know, the world ends July 5th, 1998,
and we've been having these yearly drills every July 5th.
But we're going to have a halfway in-between one
on January 2nd through 4th, the weekend.
It's New Year's weekend, basically.
An X-Day drill, 0.5.
0.5.
And we don't know where it is yet.
So if you want to attend this weird, weird, weird event,
you're just going to have to pay closer attention
than you have been paying now, ain't you?
And, uh, that attention can be gleaned from...
Got that pencil ready?
Bob at Post Office Box 140-306-Dallas, Texas 7524.
That's right.
Once again, we can say that it is Dallas, Texas 7524
