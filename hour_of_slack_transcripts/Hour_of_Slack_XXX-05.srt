1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Life drop by the fantastic bag.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,140
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,100
Praise Bob, Gold, and Connie drag.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,960
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,000
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,720
La, la, la, hour of slack.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,360
Schoolgirl fucks the whole team.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,940
These sluts are waiting for the school bell to ring so they can't fuck the basketball team.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,780
Not one player, the whole team.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,760
It's unbelievable fuck and suck frenzy.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,980
She sucks 620 guys for every last drop of their hot gooey cum.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,880
Hard core and explicit team action that will leave you speechless.

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,460
Here's a fax from Cooter in Orlando who sends me a copy of a story that appeared in the Los Angeles Times.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,760
He says, a prestigious newspaper, not the off-maligned Weekly World News.

15
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
Quoting the story.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,060
In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake, but I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,040
Eric Tomaszewski told the news doctors,

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,360
in the severe burns unit of Salt Lake City Hospital.

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,420
Tomaszewski and his homosexual partner, Andrew Kinky Farnham,

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,080
had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,760
I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggett, our gerbil, in, he explained.

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,460
As usual, Kinky shouted out, Armageddon!

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,680
My cue that he'd had enough.

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,020
I tried to retrieve Raggett.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,460
But he wouldn't come out again.

26
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,080
So I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,720
At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next.

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,180
The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and flames shot out the tube,

29
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,100
igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,880
It also set fire.

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,820
It set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers,

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,660
which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas,

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,020
further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,540
Armageddon!

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,800
Armageddon!

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,340
Armageddon!

37
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,460
Tomaszewski suffered second-degree burns

38
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,920
and a broken nose.

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,020
and a broken nose.

40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


41
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,860
from the impact of the gerbil.

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,460
Haha!

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,800
But Furnham suffered first and second-degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract.

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,680
Armageddon!

45
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,700
Armageddon!

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,980
Hahaha!

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,100
Hahaha!

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:12,760


49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,380
Hahaha!

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,160


51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
Haha!

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,540
Haha!

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,940
might make the gerbil come out.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,180
So that's what felching is all about.

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,420
I'm again!

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
Who says that?

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,500
I didn't.

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,200
Robert D. Raymond on the John Bourne Billy Show.

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,740
Hello.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,300
Yeah.

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,640
What are you playing right now?

63
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,700
Nothing.

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,160
We're not playing nothing.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
We're playing with ourselves.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,820
We're playing with ourselves.

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,580
My own little organ, man.

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,440
What do you think of self-gratification?

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,480
I play organ.

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,180
I'm going to slop it out on this table here.

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,740
Sticky right out there, man.

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,320
It's self-gratification.

73
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,080
Look at that thing, man.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,780
It's like more than 400, 500 pounds.

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,160
I think.

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,700
I don't know.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,460
Wait, Dave, listen.

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,140
Ow.

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,060
Get my sword.

80
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,460
Oh, man.

81
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
How can you do that so low?

82
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,140
Oh, bro.

83
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,780
You're going to.

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,140
Oh, man.

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,320
Look, your eyes are already watering.

86
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,740
Calm down.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,860
He's slapping it on the sharp edge.

88
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,160
Look what the Jesuit did to his head, man.

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
They threw him up, man.

90
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,440
He's bad.

91
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,380
Oh, come on, bro.

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,420
Oh, man.

93
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,400
Hey, man.

94
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,400
You're going to throw your hip out of balance, man.

95
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,600
Just.

96
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,200
Wow, man.

97
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,880
If that's what you got to do, man.

98
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,340
Is there a janitor?

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,080
Mr. Olsen.

100
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,260
I'm going to get me a box of nurses cream and get me a job.

101
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,160
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

102
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,860
It's on to bed we go.

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,200
I hate to miss to see your kids.

104
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,720
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

105
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,460
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,220
It's on to bed we go.

107
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,460
Get in that sack and spread your crap.

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,860
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

109
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,840
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

110
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
Hi-ho.

111
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,420
It's off to bed we go.

112
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,700
Just squeeze your cunt and make me grunt.

113
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,140
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

114
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,900
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

115
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,540
It's off your ass, I'll go.

116
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,780
Please wash your butt, you fucking slut.

117
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,300
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

118
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,180
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,040
Hi-ho.

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,780
It's time for you to blow.

121
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,140
Please get me hard, you tub of lard.

122
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,560
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,620
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

124
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,460
Hi-ho.

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,100
Into your bush I'll blow.

126
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,320
I'll make a splash inside your gas.

127
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,460
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

128
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,460


129
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,660
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

130
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,600
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

131
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,220
You're hosing me too slow.

132
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm going limp, you fucking blimp.

133
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,960
Hi-ho, hi-ho.

134
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,140
Please give me head, my dick is dead.

135
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,020
Hi-ho.

136
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,880
Hi-ho.

137
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,680
Yeah, come on.

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,280
Let's go.

139
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,460
All right, guys.

140
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
With Razor, Blaze and Amberley.

141
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,920
We'll be right back.

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,820

He can prove it with math

146
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,360
When Don Neal puts his dick in a manis jar

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,640
He turns into a psychopath

148
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,460
The necrophilia is not enough

149
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,880
To satisfy the Bradford lust

Well there needn't be anger

155
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,500

And friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number XXX5.

173
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,940
An internet-only subgenius show.

174
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,540
And you know the great thing about an hour of Slack that's internet-only,

175
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,600
it doesn't have to be only an hour long.

176
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,600
Praise the E-Bub.

177
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,840
Bob is Slack, Bob is sex, and Bob is money.

178
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,400
And that's all we need.

179
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,060
Well, actually, we need more subgeniuses.

180
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,780
There aren't enough subgeniuses.

181
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,980
So you have to fuck more and make more little subgeniuses.

182
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,880
It's that simple.

183
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,120
Miles and miles of cock rings.

184
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,560
That's all I can say about that.

185
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,720
That's what we're expected to wear in today's military.

186
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,900
Stan knows this.

187
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,560
He was talking to a recruiter early, asking if they took elderly gents like ourselves.

188
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,720
And he said, you know, if you've got the right equipment, we've got the right U.S. American Army for you.

189
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,340
I mean, how do they say it?

190
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,100
I've got all the tool of preacher names.

191
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,020
I got the cock rings.

192
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
I got the ball jack.

193
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,000
A great big cum.

194
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,280
I guess now in the U.S. military.

195
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,160
Fort Bragg, Bragg and Bragg.

196
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,080
Places like that.

197
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,200
Ten-inch scrap on.

198
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,000
They're using those hand grenade pins for cock rings.

199
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,600
We're talking about real.

200
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,140
Oh, hand grenade pins.

201
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,060
Wow, that's creative.

202
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,960
Yeah.

203
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,300
Yeah.

204
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,240
It makes the kind of like the testicle area look like the grenades.

205
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,920
Do they use that as a cock ring or as a Prince Albert?

206
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,340
Oh, Prince Albert.

207
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,900
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,640
I'm not here to.

209
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,180
That seems like a little ring to use as a cock ring.

210
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,960
I used a pop top from a beer can, but it was a little too big and it kept slipping off.

211
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,340
I used a top guard.

212
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
It's my M16.

213
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,160
It works in any weather and keeps me alive.

214
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,440
I use 13-inch radials.

215
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,120
You get them, you know, you can find them in junk yards or along, you know, people throw them out now and then you stop and pick up.

216
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,340
I use it for those in picket lines.

217
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,760
Yeah.

218
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,740
I mean, sometimes.

219
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh, boy.

220
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,960
That's going to be good.

221
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm going to use you in a minute, boy.

222
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm going to use you for what?

223
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Open Wednesday.

224
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,280
Don't fuss.

225
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,200
sake him.

226
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
You can take silicon out a bit.

227
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,900
You can't take the conduct.

228
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,520
You can take a very smart.

229
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,540
You can take the.

230
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
You can take.

231
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,160
You can't take the.

232
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,380
You can totally.

233
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,660
there from the great Fernandin and a lemur and now little Theodore

234
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,220

236
00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:14,740
you give me hard on you make me sweat I want to see you moaning and wet you get me floating you let me fall you get me started then make me stall but there's no resolve to my plight because underneath you're proud and tight

237
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:32,500
you give me hard on by the great little Theodore by the way the music in the background is by the swinging love corpses from the infamous bay dat sessions

238
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,860
good evening ladies and gentlemen here's the good evening and ladies and gentlemen

239

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,080

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,440
and I say leave me alone

291
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,220
with parental supervision I'm much more likely to smoke pot and stuff

292
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,100
Sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

293
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,620
The world.

294
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,060
Everywhere.

295
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,000
They're laughing.

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
Laughing.

297
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,680
Laughing.

298
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,100
Laughing.

299
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Oh.

300
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,400
Next, British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlines his views on genetically modified Tony Blairs in Britain.

301
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:22,040
His remarks cover issues of royal research, genetically modified Tony, and the use of Blairs before the Royal Genetically Modified Animals Society in Britain.

302
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,880
The speech was about Britain.

303
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,140
Well, I'm king and I'm high on exciting news.

304
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,100
It's a very royal society and a very high society.

305
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,820
And also, we've seen the public.

306
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,560
But equally, the public is taking us.

307
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,340
We must.

308
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,280
We must learn to cum and blick.

309
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,500
Welcome the cum in science issues.

310
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,960
Does science get in this cum today?

311
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:03,500
I believe the Prime Minister has always shown cum to that interest that he has cum today to share his cum with you, Prime Minister.

312
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,200
Go on.

313
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,880
Stand up.

314
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,180
Turn around.

315
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,700
Turn around.

316
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,500
Thank you very much indeed, David, and thank you all of you for coming.

317
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,440
Margaret Beckett started to excite me.

318
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,040
Can I say I'm particularly pleased to be coming in the presence of Margaret.

319
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,660
The government, the government, the government.

320
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:41,920
It's all.

321
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,380
It's all.

322
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,540
You make me a shame.

323
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,000
I mean, I start to cum on the latest scientific discoveries.

324
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,020
We'll cum.

325
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,640
It is with some proper modesty that I make my cum contribution to you today.

326
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,540
Because I actually believe cum is of fundamental importance to our future.

327
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,500
And partly because I cum.

328
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,280
And partly because I cum with science over the society.

329
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,380
I'm not a cum.

330
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm not a cum.

331
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,060
When twelve men found cum in 1666, it was possible for an educated person to come for more than half of this body's existence.

332
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,900
All be quiet.

333
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,980
Hey, c-qu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu N эффul

334
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,520
Or give somebody else a chance.

335
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,660
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t

336
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,140
You cum hangin' around my wife.

337
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,600
Please, please.

338
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,380
You make me a shame.

339
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,360
Cum cum cum cum cum cum cum cum, cum.

340
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,320
Please, please, you make me unconstitutional.

341
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,240
Lemur.

342
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,740
Lemur.

343
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
Love of Christ.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,460
We read you.

345
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,400
Carlos Dave Tanner on guitar.

346
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,620
On the bottom rung of the ladder.

347
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,360
Just one more step and I'm...

348
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,320
Drank 40.

349
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,740
Breathing the same air as Carlos David.

350
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,340
Captain Daly.

351
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,340
A lonesome coward.

352
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:35,940


353
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,140
The pituitary glands are getting much bigger.

354
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Are you fucking believing this?

355
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,520
The other kids have never had pituitary glands this large.

356
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,080
Look.

357
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,840
The endocrine system overall is growing and it's...

358
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
The sloth packet is getting bigger too.

359
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,240


360
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,040
The sloth packet is getting bigger too.

361
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,880
The sloth packet is getting bigger too.

362
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,520
The sloth packet is getting bigger too.

363
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,860
The sloth packet is getting bigger too.

364
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,220
The sloth packet is getting bigger too.

365
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,680
The sloth packet is getting bigger too, but it's full spreadsheet.

366
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,380
Stay, come back, instead!

367
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,380


368
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,980
Leave them all behind.

369
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:23,980


370
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,620
Now a party dress.

371
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,620
Jack off till I'm blind.

372
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,240
Clean up that mess.

373
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
With a tur retourne.

374
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,280
Never mind mankind

375
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,120
Leave them all behind

376
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,360
Blow up your mind

377
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,280
Blow up your mind

378
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,840
Blow up your mind

379
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,280
Like the mummy baby rose

380
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,980
Over in my bed

381
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,000
Wrap up my clothes

382
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,800
And blow up my head

383
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,520
Dynamite or acid

384
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,340
Highbrow or hot bread

385
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,780
Foresee the forbidden

386
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,080
Blow the lid of your head

387
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,420
Never mind mankind

388
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,540
Leave them all behind

389
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,400
Leave them all behind

390
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,620
Blow up your mind

391
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,540
Blow up your mind

392
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,800
Blow up your mind

393
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,780
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

394
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,820
Blow up your mind

395
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,240
Are you a little too healthy?

396
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,740
Drink some bad wine

397
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,260
Drap some bats in your beltway

398
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,100
And blow up your mind

399
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,520
Ah, no more static in the attic

400
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,860
No, no, get erratic instead

401
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,680
Ah, get real acrobatic, yes

402
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,000
And land on your head

403
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,480
Ah, never mind mankind

404
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Forget them, leave them all behind

405
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,440
Hear me now

406
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,700
Blow up your mind

407
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,520
Blow up your mind

408
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
Blow up your mind

409
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,440
Ah, never mind mankind

410
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,820
No, no, no

411
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,380
Leave them all behind

412
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,560
Blow up your mind

413
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,520
Blow up your mind

414
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,520


415
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,520


416
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,460
Blow up your mind

417
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,300
by Sonic Iligar

418
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,580
H oliver

419
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,900
Subtit continues

420
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,860
Don't listen to them

421
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,000
Do it

422
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,340
Do it, do it

423
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,420
The cramps blow up your mind and now a cheatham break

424
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,120
Cravings are the root of unhappiness

425
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,420
That sounds3000

426
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh my God, I feel so good

427
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,660
Oh yeah, I slow down

428
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh yeah, Oh yeah

429
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,640
Who's your daddy?

430
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,340
Who's your daddy?

431
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,760
Oh my God

432
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,020
Yay, playes my balls, plays with my balls

433
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,080
Oh, that feels so good

434
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,180
Yeah just roll it around

435
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,520
and do some short short

436
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,380
Oh my 18

437
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,780
I

438
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:02,980
I

439
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,520
I receive a close

440
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
it would be. Uh-oh.

441
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,560
Look at that.

442
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Don't move.

443
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,280
I'll go get you a towel.

444
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,540
I remember it.

445
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,840
It was 1942.

446
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,580
I was living in Prague

447
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,440
at the time.

448
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,600
I just bought myself a basket of bread

449
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
and invited Aunt Elder

450
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,060
over to chew my socks.

451
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I looked out the window. I could see the

452
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,820
smoke billowing up from the horizon.

453
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,880
It looked like the panzers

454
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,080
were rolling in. It was

455
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,220
blitzkrieg time.

456
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,020
And I

457
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,640
laid back and had a nap.

458
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,200
Hey.

459
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,680
Alright.

460
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,840
Alright.

461
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,400
Alright.

462
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,520
What's so alright about it?

463
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,900
Nothing's alright about it.

464
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,580
I had this moment.

465
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,540
This moment was alright.

466
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,340
It was just alright.

467
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,460
It was kind of, I think it was the old

468
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,900
Afghani.

469
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,480
Jesus is just alright.

470
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,720
Could have been sweet as wine.

471
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,520
Could have been a lady.

472
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,940
One, three, four, two times.

473
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,520
Jesus is just alright too.

474
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,920
An avatar.

475
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,700
With me.

476
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,380
Jesus just sent me a big box of subgenius

477
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,280
membership packs.

478
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,000
Three times it's Jesus.

479
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,920
That sounds like a joke, but it's just

480
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,300
a business like normal.

481
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,560
Normal everyday saying.

482
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,200
The Messiah.

483
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,320
Seven, eight, nine times.

484
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,340
The Lord, the first.

485
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,680
And it says in Revelation 5, 12, 79, 6, 3.

486
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,180
I remember that year.

487
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,580
He shall come as a thief in the night.

488
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,200
It was a mess.

489
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,460
The Lord, the day of the Lord

490
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,220
is at hand.

491
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,560
And he shall come like a thief

492
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,280
in the night.

493
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,640
He's got a hell of a grip.

494
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,820
He's using the left hand to feel us like a stranger.

495
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,380
You know what I mean?

496
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,760
He's got a hell of a bright smile.

497
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,380
I know.

498
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,500
And look at the, look at the windows on those eyes, man.

499
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,020
Look at, look at how soft and fuzzy his ears are.

500
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,220
There's nothing like them.

501
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,980
I'd like to kiss them ears on that Jesus.

502
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,800
I'd like to just suck on them soft hairs on that point of the ears on that little.

503
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,020
Oh yeah, he wants that.

504
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,640
He wants you to sit on his lap like Michael Jackson or something and just relax and he'll tell you a story.

505
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,740
You remember?

506
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,860
I like to watch his face morph.

507
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,020
Like Michael does.

508
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,200
From, from a pretty face to the color of Kali.

509
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,560
From a little squished potato nose to the little tiny skeleton nose.

510
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,180
Back to a little squished potato nose and then a little skeleton nose.

511
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,460
And the little, the canines pop out and they begin sharpening themselves.

512
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,460
And he gets black and he gets white and he gets black and white.

513
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,920
He's all things to all people.

514
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,840
He's all things to all birds, all bees, all ducks, all trees.

515
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,580
He's always, always on his nose.

516
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,540
He's the only of number.

517
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,760
Ah, yes dear friends.

518
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:15,960
ESO, Swamp Radio, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Jazz Smith, Beautiful Princess Wiardo, and yours truly Rev. Ivan Stang and now,

519
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,660
Woma Woma Womomomor

520
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:26,960
Burt Reynolds' autobiography talks about that scene in Deliverance, that actor, that one actor, the guy—

521
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,820
That really messed him up.

522
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,500
Ned Beatty.

523
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,800
Oh, Ned Beatty, it really—

524
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,040
Right.

525
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,980
That scene, I guess filming that scene really traumatized me.

526
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,520
Because the dude was really going to do it.

527
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,500
Yeah, I heard a radio interview with Ned talking about it.

528
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,340
Oh, really? Right, yeah.

529
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,280
Oh, my God.

530
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,900
Remember, Marlon Brando got quite a reputation for actually, quote-unquote,

531
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,120
banging his co-stars during the love scene.

532
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,280
Can you imagine this sodomizing old toothless guy was actually going to mount that baby?

533
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,180
Ray Harryhausen was known for that, too.

534
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,020
Mounting the camera, I think, and humping it vigorously.

535
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,940
And those co-stars, like the Talos and that forearm-dancing Shiva.

536
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,640
I had a thing for monsters.

537
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,680
He would actually be doing it, but from on camera, in between frames.

538
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,120
I had a thing for monsters. I liked looking at their legs.

539
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,560
I liked sniffing things.

540
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,300
I heard that that was going on, too.

541
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Yeah, the Island of Dr. Moreau.

542
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,140
Oh, man.

543
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,100
On the filming of the Island of Dr. Moreau that Marlon Brando was off.

544
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,880
With that pig woman.

545
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,100
The pig woman and stuff.

546
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,000
Giving him a little curfew.

547
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,960
Curlicue right there.

548
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,920
Yeah.

549
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,020
The Island of Dr. Moreau, it later became, as he was so guilty about what had happened to him,

550
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,920
he actually removed one of the little piglet curlicues.

551
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,840
Maybe four would be better.

552
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,740
Get down on four legs.

553
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,280
Get down on four legs.

554
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,560
Yeah, that would be better.

555
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,060
I swallowed a bug.

556
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Not my night.

557
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,100
What do you mean, not my night?

558
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,620
Maybe four legs would be better.

559
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,720
Six legs.

560
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,420
I'll show you my five-finger man.

561
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,260
He's going with that lemon in his mouth.

562
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,260
We'll show you how to centipede sex and we'll show you how to enjoy it.

563
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,240
And how to make millions of dollars in your spare time by watching others enjoy insect sex.

564
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,080
A snail woman leaving the trail on a straight razor.

565
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:26,140
It is absolutely a beautiful sight here as the slug women are all being escorted onto the buses.

566
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,820
Many of them painted in psychedelic day glow color.

567
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:37,480
And right there over the rain, Dr. Poo and the rest of the armada are waiting to pull out the truncheons and beat the slug women back to where they came from.

568
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,220
This is all part of the readjustment.

569
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,760
The devil, Mr. Dobbs, is a particularly pernicious gene.

570
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:52,380
The devil can be rooted out and eliminated and replaced with this perfect deity gene.

571
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,020
Mr. Dobbs.

572
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,580
And we're going to start with you.

573
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,700
Bend over.

574
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Be careful.

575
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,540
Roll up your dress.

576
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
Roll up your dress.

577
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,580
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,080
No, not you, man.

579
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,280
Put that dress back up.

580
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,100
Hey, man, get out of here.

581
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,380
You, over there.

582
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:09,940
I never.

583
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,520
The one with the hairy eyes, yeah.

584
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,320
Yeah, there you go.

585
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,020
Show me that tattoo again.

586
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,240
It's glowing.

587
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,240
Oh, baby.

588
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,220
I never saw a glowing tattoo.

589
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,620
I can't breathe.

590
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,480
It's no use, Stan.

591
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,400
My hand is getting numb.

592
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,840
Oh, come on, Seth.

593
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,640
Just a little longer.

594
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:28,800
I can't breathe.

595
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800


596
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800


597
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800


598
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800


599
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800


600
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800


601
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,940
You're a love slave.

602
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,660
You got the touch.

603
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,060
It's not working.

604
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,580
But it's gotta work.

605
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,480
I mean, listen.

606
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,740
It's getting close.

607
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,620
Come on, come on, just pump it, pump it.

608
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,960
No!

609
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm done.

610
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,600
No.

611
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:47,600


612
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:47,600


613
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,760
I don't want any of this noise to skip.

614
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,400
The noise is bad.

615
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
The gun is good.

616
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,140
I need the gun.

617
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm going to kill you.

618
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,160


619
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,180


620
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


621
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


622
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,380


623
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,580
This reality is stupid.

624
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,400
The gun is unburned.

625
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,720
The penis is stupid.

626
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,540
This reality is good.

627
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,040
The map.

628
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,240
That was Popes Lilith.

629
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,120
And this is the Lord Jesus.

630
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,100
No, no.

631
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I don't...

632
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,460
You can't just assume that everyone is sucking your dick as a groupie.

633
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,380
Oh, okay.

634
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,020
They might be doing it because they don't like you.

635
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,140
They're doing it out of hate.

636
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,440
Really?

637
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,040
They might be doing it out of hate.

638
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,420
We're the ones that do it out of hate.

639
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,920
Yeah, I want to do one that'll do it out of indifference.

640
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,840
Well, you got a pimp hand strong, Dr. Drummond.

641
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,280
Yeah, but I don't have time for the higher order thoughts anymore.

642
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,080
I have to, like, manage and service them constantly.

643
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,220
Just over and over.

644
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,680
Just over and over again.

645
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,380
It's like, it gets so old.

646
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,580
Well, you know, that was...

647
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,780
And that's just before breakfast.

648
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,700
Many people say that that's where the church fell down,

649
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,980
is when the Connie tight contingent...

650
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,620
And let me tell you, tight is not the right word for her.

651
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,500
A tight is not...

652
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,680
is nowhere near the right word for Connie.

653
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,800
She's more like...

654
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,440
She gets tight.

655
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,980
She should be like Connie Loose.

656
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,840
I've seen her, though...

657
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,520
Connie flapping...

658
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,220
At the Christmas thing, she fell down because she was so tight.

659
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,100
She was pretty.

660
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,680
Tight, thin.

661
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
Yeah, but that's as tight...

662
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,680
As tight as she gets is when she's had about 14 bears.

663
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,640
He-he-he.

664
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,640
He-he-he.

665
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,780
I can't believe you guys are talking about...

666
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,860
Thank you, Phineas Narco.

667
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,480
That's where we go.

668
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,440
The he-he-he laugh.

669
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,900
What's up, Cowboy Dave?

670
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,440
Yes, sir.

671
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,500
You're off the air.

672
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,380
And you're letting me out of...

673
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
Let me out of the box.

674
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,940
I'm farting.

675
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,520
Chaz, can we let this guy out of the box?

676
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,440
Or should we just kind of, like, dump on the...

677
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
Should we burn the box?

678
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,080
Let's put the box on one of those rockets and launch it.

679
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,220
Yes, sir.

680
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,440
See if this caller lives through it.

681
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,020
The box won't catch fire.

682
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,880
There's something wrong.

683
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,420
The box is some strange alien material.

684
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,060
That's Stephen Hawking, Dave.

685
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,660
Steve.

686
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,560
It is.

687
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,600
It's Stephen Hawking.

688
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
The great quantum physicist.

689
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,500
I heard that you just lost a $6 bet concerning singularity in black holes.

690
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,520
Is that true, Steve?

691
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,360
I have no techno.

692
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,720
What does that mean, Steve?

693
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,140
We heard your bladder was insular.

694
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,320
Your whole parts of your body were completely regrouperated by science

695
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,420
and made to your own order, kind of a customized body.

696
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,220
What do you mean by that?

697
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,140
Specifically, if you mean anything.

698
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,100
Attendance has not been what it used to be.

699
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,860
Boy, you can tell he's having trouble with the feedback.

700
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,700
He thinks he's at a high school, what do you call it, at assembly.

701
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,180
Well, he's real far away.

702
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,220
He's in Calif...

703
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,460
Wait, now I'm far away.

704
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,260
I'm in California.

705
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,620
No, no, you're still here.

706
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,000
You just look like you're in California.

707
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,460
You notice, look at your skin, how it's getting kind of scaly and everything.

708
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,860
You got that kind of snarly look under your tooth.

709
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,420
They're long teeth.

710
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,840
I am a man called horse.

711
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,980
Well, now he's shrunk himself into one of those little Tom Caraville ice cream horses

712
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,260
that you buy for birthdays, bar mitzvahs, or weddings, or suture parties.

713
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,680
And the day that Stephen Hawking joined the black hole, he was a black horse.

714
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,680


715
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,680


716
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,680


717
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,680


718
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,680


719
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:25,680


720
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,620
He joined the Sioux Sun Dance in order to be initiated into oneness.

721
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:40,440
We had to strap his wheelchair underneath the sun altar, and we had a very hard time

722
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,320
strapping him up.

723
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,400
He was so tight and stiff, like a little box already, that when we began to spin him in

724
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,780
the air, he sang like a little music box.

725
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,440
It was crazy.

726
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,720
There is no chocolate.

727
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,660
No.

728
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,560
It's all just part of the matrix.

729
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,840
That's right, friends.

730
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,820
There's no chocolate today, tomorrow, or the next day.

731
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,320
There is no sweet food.

732
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,340
There's nothing sweet left in this sweet land of ours.

733
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,700
You have to put that on the side.

734
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,720
The rich honey flavor has all run out, leaving nothing but acrimony and bitterness.

735
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,700
Vinegar, bad cheese, and foggy memories.

736
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,660
Where are you?

737
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm in the kitchen.

738
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I'm gonna make you some pie.

739
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,980
I think it's time for you to start to seriously consider salads, you fat fuck.

740
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,540
Respect my authority!

741
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,480
Before I slap you in the face!

742
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

743
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,680
Because if you don't, I promise you, they're gonna find pieces of you in eight different

744
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,160
dumpsters.

745
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,800
Right.

746
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,560
Go on, fuck this!

747
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,420
You got a lot of fucking balls, you know that?

748
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,320
I hate everything.

749
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,320
I hate you.

750
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,660
I hate you.

751
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


752
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


753
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


754
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


755
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


756
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


757
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


758
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


759
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


760
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


761
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


762
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


763
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


764
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:55,660


765
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,140
I hate everyone.

766
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,240
Fuck you!

767
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,240


768
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,240


769
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,320
I hate everything!

770
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,320


771
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,320


772
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,600
I hate everyone.

773
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,380
I hope you do, too.

774
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,140
I hate everything.

775
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,680
I hate you.

776
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,260
I hate everyone.

777
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,700
I hope you do, too.

778
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:07,860


779
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,220
I hate you.

780
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,880
I hate everyone.

781
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,920
I hope you do, too.

782
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,640
I hate everything.

783
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,360
I hope you do, too.

784
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,360


785
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,420
I hate everything.

786
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,660
Fuck you.

787
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,440
Fuck you as well.

788
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,260
I don't give a fuck.

789
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,420
I'm not joking.

790
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:25,500


791
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,220
I hate you.

792
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,200
I don't give a fuck.

793
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,760
I hope you do too.

794
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,160
I don't give a fuck.

795
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,380
I hate you.

796
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,220
I don't give a fuck.

797
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Fuck you!

798
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,140
I hate you!

799
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,800
Fuck you!

800
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:08,040
Fuck you!

801
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,200
I hate you!

802
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,180
I hate you!

803
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,140
I hate you!

804
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,720
Fuck you!

805
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,220
I hate you!

806
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,680
Fuck you!

807
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,200
I hate you!

808
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,200
Fuck you!

809
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,360
You leave me to kiss!

810
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,780
Fuck you!

811
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,380
You leave me to kiss!

812
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,760
Fuck you!

813
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,340
I hate everything.

814
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,260
I hate you.

815
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
I hate everyone.

816
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
I hope you do.

817
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,360
I hate everything.

818
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,300
I hate you.

819
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,140
I hate everyone.

820
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,660
I hope you do.

821
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,420
You leave me to kiss!

822
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,340
You leave me to kiss!

823
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,840
Fuck you!

824
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,440
You leave me to kiss!

825
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,960
Fuck you!

826
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,380
You leave me to kiss!

827
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,620
Fuck you!

828
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,300
You leave me to kiss!

829
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,300
Fuck you!

830
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,300


831
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,300


832
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,300


833
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,100
You leave me to kiss!

834
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,780
Fuck you!

835
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,260
I don't give a fuck.

836
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,780
Fuck you!

837
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,800
Fuck you!

838
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,740
Fuck you!

839
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,800
Fuck you!

840
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:03,800
Fuck you!

841
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,240
Fuck you!

842
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,200
I don't give a fuck.

843
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,740
Fuck you!

844
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,440
Fuck you!

845
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,600
Fuck you!

846
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,420
Fuck you!

847
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,300
I don't give a fuck.

848
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,160
I hate everyone.

849
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,760
I hope you do too.

850
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,600
And that was Outro by Reverend Two Beans.

851
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,160
You know, back in the States, ever since last year,

852
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,120
we have a new phrase in the church.

853
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,920
For a long time we said, build your own ship.

854
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,200
And then some of our rockets exploded.

855
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,500
So we changed it to build your own Amsterdam,

856
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,440
which was a little safer.

857
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,400
But they can still throw you in jail for it.

858
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,600
And now we get here.

859
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,820
Here, in Amsterdam.

860
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,580
And we're told that we can't smoke Haberfrop Zip-E-Lups

861
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,180
in Amsterdam.

862
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,300
Inside a hotel room.

863
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,720
Not a drug.

864
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,580
Not a hotel room that we rented.

865
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,060
We might as well be in junior high school back in the States.

866
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,140
Hiding underneath in the toilet to smoke.

867
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,460
Why do we have to hide in the toilet to smoke?

868
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,300
Why do we have to hide in the toilet to shit for that matter?

869
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,480
Why can't a man or a woman just shit and smoke at the same time

870
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,820
right out there on the street?

871
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,080
Whatever happened?

872
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,220
What are these taboos based on?

873
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,960
Oh, just thinking about it.

874
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,860
Oh, it makes me.

875
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,960
Just loosen up.

876
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,340
Oh, the slack.

877
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,920
Oh, the slack is moving.

878
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,600
Oh, praise Bob.

879
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,620
Praise Bob.

880
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,060
Praise Bob.

881
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,080
The prunes.

882
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,120
Oh, yes.

883
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,860
But friends, you know, slack is so much more than just the body letting go, go, go.

884
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,420
It's when your mind melts and just sinks right in.

885
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:14,820
That's right.

886
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,340
Just release.

887
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,440
Just deflate.

888
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,660
You've been high, puffed up like a balloon.

889
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,780
You've been inflated.

890
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,860
You rose above it all.

891
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,100
But now it's time to just let it out.

892
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,380
Out, baby.

893
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,400
Just let it all blow.

894
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,080
Blow it all off, my friend.

895
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,800
And you'll find down there when you finally deflate,

896
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,080
you're nothing but a greasy skin on the ground.

897
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,380
But then you found slack.

898
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,600
Oh, yes.

899
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,500
True slack.

900
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,460
You'll be that way until Bob comes along and blows you up again.

901
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,000
And if you want to see Reverend Stang demonstrating a few of those aforementioned

902
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,600
phrases and activities, why not pop along to the Bad Kuip this Friday evening at about 10 o'clock.

903
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,680
The Bud...

904
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,980
The Bud Kuip.

905
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,660
The Bud Kuip.

906
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,760
It's the Bud Carp.

907
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,200
Well, the Reverend Lord...

908
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,340
The Reverend Lord Yenny will now tell us exactly how to pronounce it.

909
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,500
The Bud Kuip.

910
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
And where is that?

911
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,360
At the corner of Albert Kuipstraat and Eerste Zwelingstraat.

912
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,300
The exact address is Eerste Zwelingstraat, number 10.

913
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,640
You can call them.

914
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,260
020-675-9669.

915
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:35,880
Or, which is in Dutch, 020-675-9669.

916
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,880
That's the Church of the Subgenius, by the way.

917
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,700
Can I just say, Hail, Reverend Jitzer.

918
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,140
Hallelujah.

919
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,200
Praise Reverend Jitzer.

920
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,980
Hail, you guys.

921
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,960
Yes, indeed.

922
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:47,900
How do you say that?

923
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,760
Hell, yeah.

924
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,220
Jitzer.

925
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,800
Hell, yes.

926
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,220
Subgenius.

927
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,460
Jitzer.

928
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,780
Subgenius in Dutch.

929
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,180
Subgenius.

930
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,900
Hell, yeah.

931
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,100
Hell, yeah.

932
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,560
Hell, yeah.

933
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:58,900
Hell, yeah.

934
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,700
Hell, yeah.

935
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,820
Jizz Whiz.

936
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,360
Jizz Whiz.

937
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,160
Jizz Whiz.

938
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,760
Jizz Whiz.

939
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,480
Buy it now.

940
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,040
Process your jizz into sauces and also marinades.

941
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,880
You can find the Jizz Whiz in every branch of Comet right now.

942
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,000
The Jizz Whiz will process your jizz and make it into cubes.

943
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,720
Make it into slices.

944
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,240
If you want to see jizz, you can come see jizz this weekend.

945
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,060
You can...

946
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,320
You will have a communion of jizz this weekend.

947
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,640
It's Jizz Whiz.

948
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,220
Jizz Whiz.

949
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,740
It's Jizz.

950
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,760
And we'll have a communion of jizz at the Bad Kite here in Amsterdam.

951
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,780
Can you tell us this address?

952
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,400
Because you can pronounce these words.

953
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah, much better than I can.

954
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,120
I'll just read the entire flyer.

955
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,500
It says,

956
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,880
The Church of the Subgenius, 3rd Amsterdam Divival.

957
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,580
It's going to be on March 23.

958
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,280
That's next Friday at the Bad Kite.

959
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,940
As we well know,

960
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,320
it's on the corner of the Albert Kuipstraat and the 1st Zwelingstraat.

961
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,780
It's officially on the 1st Zwelingstraat, number 10.

962
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,600
Is it true?

963
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,460
Tell us.

964
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,060
Now, I see a pattern.

965
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,340
I see a pattern here.

966
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,820
The Mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012.

967
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,260
And of course, it should have already happened by the Khan calendar.

968
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,360
It's also true that...

969
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,360
It's also true that...

970
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,820
It's also true that Dob's dad was a Mayan.

971
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,980
Okay, now we got two things.

972
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,420
Let's get...

973
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,180
The third thing is here.

974
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,700
Dob's dad was a pharmacist.

975
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:40,020
And everybody knows that these guys are running the damn jizz trade.

976
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,680
Now, there's too many correlations here.

977
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,040
We've got a pharmacist, Mayan, and calendar here.

978
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,900
I think you're reading too much into jizz.

979
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,540
I think you're looking at jizz and you're taking too much from it.

980
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,240
It's easy to do that.

981
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,920
Why must we embarrass the day?

982
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,740
It's the Dob's family.

983
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,140
You know, let's embarrass the Kennedys or somebody else instead.

984
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,040
I mean, it's...

985
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,740
It's the Dob's family.

986
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,320
There are some things that are...

987
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,400
Radio Patapu in Amsterdam.

988
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,260
Praise be to Lord Yeti and Pope Black for putting us on the air there.

989
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,620
And also, Pope Phil Monty...

990
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,800
That dream would never come true.

991
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,380
It's true.

992
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:24,900
It's true.

993
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,500
And chanting along its way.

994
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,320
Well, thanks for that blissful moment.

995
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,940
Can I ask something for sure?

996
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,340
I doubt that you know all about nouc as a Hobbit.

997
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,940
Well, now, my favorite connects the wszystko di

998
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,980
ca.

999
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,260
Patsy, he says here in his dossier.

1000
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,660
And he's a Capricorn.

1001
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,700
Bubblegum and lollipops.

1002
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,520
Yes, he's fond of bubblegum and lollipops.

1003
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,480
And he's also a Gemini moon rising,

1004
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,980
which makes him very hairy and extremely hard to get a hold of on Sunday nights.

1005
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,160
Oh, he's a cultural icon, too.

1006
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,180
He's a bar fighter, a reckless recluse,

1007
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,000
who enjoys having shish kebab with mom and some of the other overgrown children.

1008
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,360
Let's look at some of the comments.

1009
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,500
And they all listen to the Hour of Slack, 9 o'clock Sunday nights on this.

1010
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,620
Oh, they're faithful listeners.

1011
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,820
Oh, I even knew that.

1012
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,820
Here, I downloaded some of the users from the alt.slack chat here.

1013
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,200
Do you have any of the users down there?

1014
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,080
Who's Devious Female?

1015
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,340
Ah, Devious Female. I would like to know her real name.

1016
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,220
She's one of Sister Decadence's students in the Nun Snake Mission.

1017
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,260
Oh, my God.

1018
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,800
Huh.

1019
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,800
Oh, I was going to ask you that.

1020
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,520
The nun snakes of Dobbs Town are...

1021
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,740
They're like the...

1022
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,920
Sort of like...

1023
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,720
Here's one.

1024
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,080
Hellish robot monsters disguised as geisha girls.

1025
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,680
Who is Love Stolic Ladies?

1026
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,560
Well, that's the bar girl over there.

1027
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,340
Love Stolic Ladies.

1028
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,060
Did you see?

1029
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,920
Notice one is named Hannibal Lictor.

1030
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,340
Hannibal Lictor.

1031
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,140
Hannibal Lictor.

1032
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,860
That fried steak waiting in the dumpster there is hers and has her name inscribed on it.

1033
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,600
Perhaps in a gold icon format like the one showing here or there.

1034
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,200
Well, Yukon Cornelius is in there tonight.

1035
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,360
Oh, my.

1036
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:20,720
Unzip.

1037
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,520
You don't know who Yukon Cornelius is?

1038
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,920
Dream weaver mating.

1039
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,620
Oh, my God.

1040
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,960
Yukon Cornelius.

1041
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,160
Dave?

1042
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,680
That's from Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

1043
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,980
What was Yukon Cornelius?

1044
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,940
Was he nice to the reindeer?

1045
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,400
He was the big guy.

1046
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,020
He was the real big guy.

1047
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,180
He forced himself on the reindeer.

1048
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,140
Look, there's a subgenius.

1049
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,800
Austin Submail.

1050
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,040
Yeah.

1051
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,440
Um, BBW.

1052
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,140
Let's tell him praise Bob.

1053
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,820
Let's post ourselves as Bob Dobbs.

1054
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah.

1055
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,480
Yeah.

1056
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,140
Let's post ourselves.

1057
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:03,400
Actually, Chaz, you know, that is like the most dangerous thing you can do on the Internet is to pretend.

1058
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,300
Pretend to be Bob Dobbs on the Internet.

1059
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,900
And we're going to use the biggest font size we can use here.

1060
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,780
Yeah, use a big pipe, smoky-smelling font.

1061
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,080
Use one of those fonts that smells like an old ashtray.

1062
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,980
Because that's the way Bob, the real Bob, smells.

1063
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,480
Here's one called Lil' Cumwhore.

1064
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,280
Lil' Cumwhore?

1065
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,040
Yeah, who's that?

1066
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,040
She was the character.

1067
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,220
Wasn't she in that newspaper strip, Lil' Cumwhore?

1068
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,240
It was in the Dallas Morning News comic section for a while.

1069
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,300
Yeah.

1070
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,480
I remember, by the way, she had her head shaved.

1071
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,020
I'll let you know if anyone replies to Bob.

1072
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,280
Lil' Cumwhore.

1073
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,080
I'm going to just write.

1074
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,500
I'm so proud.

1075
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,360
I had a dream this Dracula, this like weird Dracula.

1076
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,820
It was like a Dracula character was attacking me.

1077
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,940
And actually, as he was biting down on my forehead.

1078
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,200
And you know, like how usually the green worms.

1079
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,920
Brain sucker.

1080
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,340
The green worms come out first.

1081
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,740
And they started exploding out of my forehead.

1082
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,620
And the next thing you know, well, old Dracula's in.

1083
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,340
Richie, would you do me a favor and eat my pussy for me, please?

1084
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,800
I tried some of the, there's a new crazy restaurant in my neighborhood.

1085
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,740
I got me a dozen snake wings.

1086
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,360
Yeah, they have snake wings.

1087
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,940
A dozen Quetzalcoatlus?

1088
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,800
I think it's an esoteric Mexican restaurant.

1089
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,840
They call it La Azteca.

1090
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:44,800
Or Moctezuma.

1091
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,120
Yeah, you have to be in the right mood for them.

1092
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,700
I was thinking, because they used to worship a winged snake.

1093
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,280
Oh, the other old feathered.

1094
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,900
Old Mexico.

1095
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,420
Yeah, the feathered serpent, which was just a.

1096
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,160
The barbecue snake wings.

1097
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,000
And East Dallas.

1098
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,000
Was just the fallacy of the sun.

1099
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,680
Did you know that?

1100
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,320
Did you know the sun actually had.

1101
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:02,680
The phallus?

1102
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,780
The phallus of the sun.

1103
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,620
But the solar orb has a pecker?

1104
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,180
It's got a pecker that makes the wind blow and it makes the trees grow and it makes your

1105
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,580
bowling bag zip up tight.

1106
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:18,400
If you don't believe that the wind is part of the sun's phallus, well, you just are a

1107
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,620
hip to esoteric, buddy.

1108
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,780
Yeah, not only does it have a phallus, it's got a big old jangly pair of hookahs.

1109
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,520
Like a great bigger steady.

1110
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1111
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,360
Now for the next paragraph.

1112
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,600
On my little note sheet here, I had intended to give something about a debate.

1113
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,040
You may have read something about a little debate that we'd be having concerning the

1114
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,280
eradication or domestication of the pinks and normals.

1115
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,800
Sadly, such things are not approved for your security clearance.

1116
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:55,700
Fortunately, my significant other, Reverend Cleo, has offered a suggestion.

1117
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,580
Replace the word debate with anal sex.

1118
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,520
Therefore, we have hot and steamy anal sex action.

1119
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:14,080
If you thought that anal sex was boring, if you thought that anal sex was long and tedious,

1120
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,760
if you thought that anal sex was intellectual, think again.

1121
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,860
Ivan Stang and Reverend Papa Joe Mama are here today to offer their, well, philosophical

1122
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,140
anal sex, if you will.

1123
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,840
But that's only the main course, brothers and sisters.

1124
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,460
Pope Fred at IndieVival 2002.

1125
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,100
Millions of people get confused about how we're saved, whether we're saved by works or by grace.

1126
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,400
One says, no, we're saved by grace and works have nothing to do with it.

1127
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,280
The other says, no, it's not enough to be done that way.

1128
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,600
You must also work.

1129
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,600
And if you don't work, then you do not have salvation.

1130
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,680
Now, that is a good point.

1131
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,580
That is a good point.

1132
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,860
Do you have slack?

1133
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:17,140
If you display the trappings of slack, if you give slack to others and yet do not experience the slack yourself,

1134
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,880
is that a slackful life in the manner of our Master Bob?

1135
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,940
Or, by the same token, if ye yourself have slack,

1136
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:32,740
of quite a pungent odor on your body and in your spirit,

1137
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,780
your spirit,

1138
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:40,040
then, but yet, if you do not share of this slack and use,

1139
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,520
because there's always a little extra,

1140
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,760
if there's any slack at all,

1141
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,760
there's a little extra to share, to share.

1142
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,460
That's right, to share with those around you,

1143
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,980
those deserving ones.

1144
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:01,080
Or else, by the same token, to use that slack to injure foes,

1145
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,740
because there is the curse.

1146
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,160
Because once you have slack,

1147
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,240
now, you can use it to sap an equal amount of slack,

1148
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,980
or negate.

1149
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,580
You cannot take the slack of another subgenius exactly,

1150
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,920
but you can negate his slack so that it does him no good.

1151
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,340
And so, in other words, what we're saying here is,

1152
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,780
if you have one without the other,

1153
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,460
if you have a grace of slack without the works of slack,

1154
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,200
and vice versa,

1155
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,500
is it still salvation in the name of Bob?

1156
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,520
Now, I think this is moot point.

1157
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,900
Because, because if you do not have the fullness,

1158
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,500
the ful-ness of slack,

1159
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,980
why, it'll make you forget what you're going to say.

1160
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,380
And so,

1161
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,520
that we would become adopted children of God in his great family.

1162
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,100
God knew who was going to be saved and who would not be saved.

1163
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,140
And the Holy Ghost quickening those, the mind,

1164
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,500
I was able to think better, and I was able to learn easier,

1165
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,000
and it became a tremendous thing to me.

1166
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,380
And ladies and gentlemen, I know of one gentleman,

1167
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,760
You made my thing, gentlemen.

1168
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,940
when God saved him,

1169
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,660
Confess it!

1170
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,840
You will arrive at the same level of fulfillment.

1171
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,640
Confess your, your excrement.

1172
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,800
Confess it!

1173
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,360
Confess your,

1174
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:29,720
uh,

1175
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,440
the, when you have put your mouth on the sexual organs of others.

1176
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,900
Tell me about it!

1177
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,920
It's more than just a hard-on.

1178
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,760
It's more than just coming in your path.

1179
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,020
It is a way of life.

1180
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,100
You forget everything but Bob.

1181
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,980
You forget everything outside of the subgenius universe,

1182
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,640
and,

1183
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,220
and you can,

1184
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,580
or,

1185
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,040
or,

1186
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,080
when a child is fed this wonderful knowledge,

1187
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,500
his personality is stamped,

1188
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,200
cemented in place,

1189
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,760
with a Bob,

1190
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,880
a righteous,

1191
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,840
Bob-ly,

1192
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:06,940
um,

1193
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,620
way of thought.

1194
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,960
Oh, great Bob.

1195
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,480
And I know that it has.

1196
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,340
We can see,

1197
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,680
we can rise,

1198
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,280
we can see the jewels and members rising up.

1199
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,600
Thank you.

1200
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,560
Thank you.

1201
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,000
Pray,

1202
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:21,820
Bob.

1203
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,860
Uh,

1204
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:22,860


1205
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,360
should,

1206
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,020
should spill as,

1207
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,480
spill the bad seed,

1208
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,200
retain the good.

1209
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,920
Spill the bad,

1210
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,580
retain the good,

1211
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:30,940
we say.

1212
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:31,840
Uh,

1213
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
remove the bad,

1214
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,300
spit,

1215
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:33,780
spit,

1216
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,160
it's a squirting universe,

1217
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,720
my friend.

1218
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,240
And one good thing about this is that we can get,

1219
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:38,900
we can,

1220
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,020
we can squirt out the bad seed.

1221
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,800
And,

1222
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,740
they fill these children,

1223
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,700
they fill them with the full gospel of slide.

1224
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:51,780
Yeah,

1225
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1226
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1227
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1228
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1229
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1230
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1231
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:51,800


1232
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,800
Thank You,

1233
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,800


1234
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,800


1235
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,800


1236
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,800


1237
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,800


1238
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,800
uh-

1239
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,940
we enjoy,

1240
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,980
we can enjoy theek

1241
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,340
the way the church is,

1242
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,920
of discriminating religious rapists.

1243
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,660
Oh, like Jimmy the Greek Baker.

1244
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,540
But no, I don't get put up with the shirrids

1245
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,500
in Sand Key Resort like Jessica Hahn.

1246
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,580
No, I gotta take it up the ass from staying

1247
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,880
in the toaster outside the Red Lobster,

1248
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,160
which counts for the smell.

1249
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,000
Susie the Floozy in Clearwater Beach.

1250
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,720
Before that, the baby Reverend Stang.

1251
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,900
And now, E-S-O-S-S-S.

1252
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,400
He has traced the new maggots in the minds of the universe.

1253
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,960
And he was not offended by it all.

1254
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,480
But he knew he had to rise above it all.

1255
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,700
For the risk of drowning in his own shit.

1256
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,440
Thank you.

1257
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,600
Thank you.

1258
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,800
So here's the deal.

1259
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,760
Since I'm older, they asked me to tell you guys

1260
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,340
if you get Mr. Napoli, you're lucky

1261
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,200
because he loves to blow the older kids.

1262
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Remember, just say thanks.

1263
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,700
Then they won't treat you like a little kid anymore.

1264
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,900
You know, if you're hanging in a group and you smell funny,

1265
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,580
whatever they say, it's probably Mr. Napoli.

1266
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,560
They think it's cool to see you get in trouble.

1267
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,340
Sponsored by Pee and a partnership for Pee Free America.

1268
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,400
Well, actually, what I have decided

1269
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,680
might not take too long.

1270
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,740
I decided to throw out the notes.

1271
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,880
I'm going to...

1272
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,080
Half the people are gone.

1273
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,620
That's good.

1274
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,200
Because I decided I'd just tell you something straight.

1275
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,160
Here's my entire script.

1276
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,980
It was this note to myself that said,

1277
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,860
throwing out my comic books.

1278
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,780
Friends, I'm about to tell you a tale of horror

1279
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,580
and woe.

1280
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,400
With which I'm afraid all too many of you might identify.

1281
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,520
Now, many people have asked me and wondered,

1282
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,560
gosh, how did that Reverend Stang get to be a subgenius?

1283
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,800
What was it that made Reverend Stang so twisted and weird

1284
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,000
that he would bust ass for so many years for Bob?

1285
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,120
For such little pay for so long.

1286
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,920
And friends, you know, people have asked me,

1287
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,200
well, Reverend Stang, was it that you were...

1288
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,700
Was it a bad...

1289
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,680
Was it a bad religious upbringing?

1290
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,700
Did the nuns wrap your knuckles with their metal rulers in school?

1291
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,720
Was it the Southern Baptists making you handle snakes

1292
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,480
when you weren't immune to the poison?

1293
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,960
What was it that pissed you off so bad, Reverend Stang,

1294
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,000
about religion?

1295
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,820
And friends, guess what?

1296
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,980
It didn't have a goddamn thing to do with religion.

1297
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,260
It didn't have anything to do with my parents being mean

1298
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,600
or anything like that.

1299
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,580
Actually, they were secular humanists.

1300
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,740
Rational, you know, scientific humanists, you might say.

1301
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,680
Actually, now they're subgeniuses.

1302
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,800
No, it didn't have anything to do with that.

1303
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,420
It was simply that I was damned fucking weird, my friends.

1304
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,420
I was a weird kid.

1305
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,020
I was a real weird kid.

1306
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,620
And I'll tell you how goddamn weird I was.

1307
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,300
I've not chosen to share this before.

1308
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,040
But here's the weirdest thing about me as a little kid.

1309
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,460
From the age of four and a half,

1310
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,020
as far back as I remember,

1311
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,860
I wanted to fuck girls.

1312
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,880
Now, you may think that's not so weird.

1313
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,040
It is for a four-year-old.

1314
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,080
It is for a seven-year-old.

1315
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,600
And it is for most 12-years-old

1316
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,360
as I found out the hard way, so to speak.

1317
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,180
No, it wasn't just that.

1318
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,000
It wasn't just that I liked girls

1319
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,700
way ahead of the time.

1320
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,420
I was supposed to be liking anybody that way.

1321
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,920
I mean, everybody gets crushes, you know, and stuff.

1322
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,920
But I wanted to lay naked on top of those little girls.

1323
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,360
And I didn't even know why.

1324
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,220
But I did know this.

1325
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,060
That if you talked about it,

1326
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,700
you'd get in big trouble.

1327
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,640
The little girls got grossed out.

1328
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,520
The teacher got grossed out.

1329
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,380
Your fellow boys got grossed out.

1330
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,780
So I learned that I had to keep my mouth shut

1331
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,460
about my ceaseless, unending,

1332
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:15,940
deep desires.

1333
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,600
And to tell the truth,

1334
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,300
the terrible fact of falling in love

1335
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,160
every goddamn day at elementary school.

1336
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,740
I mean, if it wasn't for what I did,

1337
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:30,860
what I finally gave up on one of the prettiest little girls in the class,

1338
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,140
I'd find it seemed what was cool about the ugly little girls in the class.

1339
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,940
And there was no one here that went by

1340
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,880
that I didn't have a crush on every girl in that class that I liked.

1341
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,440
And if I'd been more open-minded,

1342
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,120
it probably would have included the boys,

1343
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,740
and the girls would have been the same.

1344
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,800
They would have thought I was crazy

1345
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,480
if I'd opened my mouth about it.

1346
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,960
In fact, my third grade teacher had to

1347
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,240
tell me to quit doing that in class.

1348
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,800
But that wasn't the only thing that made me weird.

1349
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,680
How many of you people are, or were,

1350
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,020
monster fans?

1351
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,280
Monster fans!

1352
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,400
I see that there's a few monster fans

1353
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,060
in this room tonight.

1354
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,860
Now the reason that you like those monsters,

1355
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,500
maybe because they are as hideous and ugly

1356
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,720
as those little girls were.

1357
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,000
Pretty!

1358
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,840
That's kind of the way I felt about it.

1359
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,860
They were just cool.

1360
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,060
And not only that,

1361
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,480
I kind of identified with those monsters.

1362
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,040
And I'm sure most of you feel,

1363
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,360
share the same feelings.

1364
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,120
When you'd be sitting there at the age of six years old,

1365
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,560
and you see that old black and white Frankenstein movie come on,

1366
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,380
and that poor misunderstood Frankenstein monster,

1367
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,920
he didn't have to be born,

1368
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,240
he didn't have to be ugly,

1369
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,880
he didn't have to be smarter and more powerful

1370
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,620
than everybody, all the humans around him.

1371
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:52,380
And when those villagers went up that hill

1372
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,060
carrying those torches,

1373
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,500
ready to kick his ass,

1374
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,580
I bet you I didn't find that monster

1375
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,520
and none of that big fucking burger monster

1376
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,100
and those goddamn anger and blowbunker

1377
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,000
when I got villagers.

1378
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,400
My friends,

1379
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,220
I was a weird kid,

1380
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,400
and you were probably weird kids,

1381
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,880
but, you know,

1382
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,040
I was a weird kid,

1383
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,260
and there came a time,

1384
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,380
right about fifth or sixth grade,

1385
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,900
when my love of,

1386
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:23,200
my love of monsters didn't change at first,

1387
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,460
but my love of all those little girls changed,

1388
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,620
because it became, shall we say,

1389
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,720
more of a productive love.

1390
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,680
I was finally able to

1391
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,640
really get going, you know?

1392
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,360
And, uh,

1393
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,900
but friends,

1394
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,700
I kept falling in love,

1395
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,920
I kept falling in lust,

1396
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,920
and never, once,

1397
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,020
did one of those little girls

1398
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,380
return the, uh,

1399
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,540
mutual affection.

1400
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,380
I was a lonely kid.

1401
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,620
I wasn't unpopular,

1402
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,460
I wasn't too weird looking,

1403
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,360
I was just weird!

1404
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,280
I was just fucking weird!

1405
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,760
Now, by the time

1406
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,060
I was twelve years old,

1407
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,120
and I thought I was gonna die,

1408
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,640
I thought I was gonna have to just kill myself

1409
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,240
if I didn't get played,

1410
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,840
I thought my family's moved!

1411
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,920
From one city to another.

1412
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,140
I moved up a little bit from Fort Worth

1413
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:17,880
to Dallas.

1414
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,300
And I thought, now's my chance!

1415
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,360
These kids in this new school,

1416
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,960
they don't know that I like monsters,

1417
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,820
and I don't know anything about baseball!

1418
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,300
These new kids don't know

1419
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,980
that I hate team sports!

1420
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,300
These new kids don't know

1421
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,140
that I'm weird!

1422
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,760
And these new kids don't know

1423
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,740
that every day while I sat there

1424
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,820
in elementary school,

1425
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,560
I drew these comic books!

1426
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,780
Yes, friends, I used to be an artist!

1427
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,620
I used to draw comics!

1428
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,340
When I was in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade,

1429
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,720
I drew comic books!

1430
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,400
They weren't very original.

1431
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:57,420
In fact, sometimes I ripped off my friends' ideas,

1432
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,200
if you're familiar.

1433
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,260
But I drew a hell of a...

1434
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,760
Not only did I draw comic books,

1435
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,920
but I drew animated flip-it books!

1436
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,120
You know those little flip-it books?

1437
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,740
Friends, I didn't just draw

1438
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,760
one or two animated flip-it books!

1439
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,040
I created a book

1440
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,920
that created over a hundred

1441
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,980
little animated flip-it books

1442
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,620
in a series called

1443
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:21,420
101 Tortures!

1444
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,160
I was accidentally able to come up with

1445
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,560
about 50 tortures,

1446
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,800
but I doubled them up anyway.

1447
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,560
Because I was interested

1448
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,600
in seeing how many ways there were

1449
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,800
to make normal people die

1450
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,380
already at that age!

1451
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,060
But, like I say,

1452
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,800
we started to move

1453
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,860
from forward to now.

1454
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,900
And I thought,

1455
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,440
here's my chance!

1456
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,680
Here's my chance to finally get laid!

1457
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,000
Here's my chance to finally be popular!

1458
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,200
I'll learn about all the cool

1459
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,740
music these kids listen to!

1460
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,440
I'll put away my comic books!

1461
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,700
I'll put away my famous

1462
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,360
monsters in Thumbnail Magazine!

1463
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,240
And you know what I did, friends?

1464
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,720
You know what I did because

1465
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,900
I wanted to be normal?

1466
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:08,360
I took those 101 animated flip-it books

1467
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,780
and all those comic books

1468
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,960
that I drew over all those years

1469
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,100
and I threw them away!

1470
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,080
I threw them away!

1471
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,620
Because I wanted to be

1472
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,700
fucking goddamn normal!

1473
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,940
Backpack!

1474
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,780
I thought I will end

1475
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,460
my life as a weirdo!

1476
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,660
I will be reborn as a normal

1477
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,820
pink fuck!

1478
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,000
Well, needless to say,

1479
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,000
it didn't do me a damn

1480
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,600
bit of good!

1481
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,440
I never got laid the whole time

1482
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,380
I was in high school!

1483
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,080
I just got weirder!

1484
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,300
I was a hockey word!

1485
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,260
I tried to be normal

1486
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,140
but then I took acid!

1487
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,260
And sometimes after that

1488
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,100
I tried a beer!

1489
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,960
And of course,

1490
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,120
I had to be an alcoholic for a few years

1491
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,080
and I had to take too much acid

1492
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:57,720
for a while!

1493
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,560
But friends,

1494
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,680
I did learn one thing

1495
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,900
that makes no sense

1496
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,500
and does you no good

1497
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,700
to try to be normal!

1498
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,780
Not only do you know that,

1499
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,940
but you can't do it!

1500
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,900
You cannot become

1501
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,960
what you're already not!

1502
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,100
But what you can do

1503
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,500
is become more

1504
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,840
and more of what you already are!

1505
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,800
We are a bunch of human

1506
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,160
fucking cartoons

1507
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,220
in this campground!

1508
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,980
We have nothing in common with each other

1509
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,420
except when you look around

1510
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,180
we're all extreme exaggerations

1511
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,280
of some kind of fucked up weirdo!

1512
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,640
And there's some sort of

1513
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,400
bluesy fuck-up fear

1514
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,380
of human cartoons!

1515
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,240
There's the Reverend Evangel of human cartoons!

1516
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,140
There's the Pope Xanella

1517
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,280
of human cartoons!

1518
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,260
The Lonesome Cowboy

1519
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,340
and the Reverend Saint!

1520
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,220
And all of you, friends,

1521
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:57,860
friends,

1522
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,700
you know, I don't mean to tell you

1523
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,680
that you're all or any clever,

1524
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,460
cool, but fucking nuts!

1525
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,740
I think you understand what I'm saying!

1526
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,040
What I'm saying is

1527
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,680
fuck them if they can't

1528
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,360
take a fucking shot!

1529
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,760
Fuck them!

1530
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,520
Fuck them if they can't take a shit!

1531
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,020
Fuck them if they can't take a shit!

1532
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:19,640
Fuck them!

1533
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,920
Fuck them if they can't take a shit!

1534
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,000


1535
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:33,920
Ah, yes, dear friends,

1536
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,200
my true confessions.

1537
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:36,840
They're the music

1538
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,020
by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1539
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,940
and, uh,

1540
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,900
that was recorded in the

1541
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,200
Pufferdome at Starwood

1542
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:46,820
2002.

1543
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,640

Rosencomet.com

1546
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,640
Thank you, and good night!

1547
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,500
It was great fun!

1548
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,680
It's that kind of thing, and I went all the way around Burning Man

1549
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,860
in about half an hour and came back

1550
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,820
to sort of nearby, you know, walk back

1551
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,580
to where, walk back in

1552
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,560
to the same scene with my friends sitting

1553
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,040
there with pipe holes going around.

1554
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,600
They had not moved, and I'd gone all the way

1555
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,960
five miles through Burning Man.

1556
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,720
It was pretty fun.

1557
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,460
And Ivan Stang was there, he was sitting right there

1558
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,000
while I did that.

1559
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,420
But he was sitting right there, in fact,

1560
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,600
I heard that there were photos of

1561
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,640
Stang and Mexico City at the same time.

1562
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,620
Yeah, well,

1563
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,980
what? What? What?

1564
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,320
It might not have been Stang, it might have been

1565
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,740
somebody calling himself Stang.

1566
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,500
I've seen the photos, some guy with gray hair,

1567
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,540
gray beard, that doesn't look like Stang to me.

1568
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,420
That waiter jacket thing?

1569
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,940
No, no, they went to Burning Man.

1570
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,640
I don't know, they look smudgy to me.

1571
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,000
The guy's all kind of ashen and gray looking.

1572
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,740
Yeah, I don't, see it doesn't look like

1573
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,380
a real Ivan Stang doll.

1574
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:01,600
That's what I'm saying, that was someone else,

1575
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,540
a wavy gray beard, I don't know who it was.

1576
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,900
When I first saw it, the first impression I had was

1577
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,120
they had taken that Ivan Stang action doll

1578
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,940
they got in the cereal about 15 years ago,

1579
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,580
and were just shot at a gun.

1580
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,420
It was crappy cereal.

1581
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,080
Yeah, and a crappy action doll, and that's what it looked like.

1582
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,840
In the first one I saw, then I saw the cleaned up

1583
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,640
digital version, and it looked like a,

1584
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,760
it actually looked like this yuppie guy,

1585
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,720
it didn't look like Stang at all.

1586
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,720
But it might be the yuppie guy

1587
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,200
who's going to take over from Stang.

1588
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,140
I don't know if he knows about that,

1589
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,660
so I don't know if we should talk about that on this tape.

1590
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,080
Probably not.

1591
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,680
I heard Tom Hanks was going to play Stang in the movie.

1592
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,580
Is that right?

1593
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,600
Is that a country western guy?

1594
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,060
What?

1595
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,400
But you know, one thing we do talk about here

1596
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,480
is how many people are in this foundation?

1597
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,300
How many?

1598
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,600
We don't know. But we assume

1599
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,580
from the dirt of San Francisco

1600
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,980
there are people in that foundation.

1601
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,380
Like Jimmy Hoffa style.

1602
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,480
That was

1603
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,900
Doug Wellman and Byron Werner.

1604
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,320
Gee, thanks guys.

1605
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,140
Praise God.

1606
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,040
We'll see you next time.

1607
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:24,500
Bye.
