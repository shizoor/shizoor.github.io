00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,140
Christians who make Jesus look so petty.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,660
All you right-wing ideologues who lie, cheat, and steal in the name of the Lord to grab people's hearts, minds, and money.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:46,940
All you self-righteous moralists who think that you know what God Almighty wants us to see, hear, think, and do are in big trouble.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,780
Don't let your mind go to hell.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,120
Save it.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,060
Listen to the self-genius power of what?

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,740
I've seen the final frontier.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,720
I've seen.

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,740
I've seen the final frontier.

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,280
The unsalivating acid.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
Another pop sham.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,740
That little amount that you can donate dollars.

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,060
Oh, God.

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,900
Oh, God.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,620
$5.

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,140
$10.

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,020
$5.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,500
Cool.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,340
Did he get it?

26
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,360
Did we rule the world?

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,620
Give it.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,420
Please.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,320
Bob.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,900
I'm going to get near.

31
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm going to get near.

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm going to get near.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm going to get near.

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,100


35
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,100

00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,100


37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,100


38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,340
I'm asking you now.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,760
Oh.

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,780
Poor Bob.

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
I almost felt sorry for him.

42
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,260
Almost.

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,700
And these days, Bob has grown accustomed to a very different lifestyle.

44
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,280
Oh.

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,500


46
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,540
Oh.

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,200
Oh.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,240


49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,720
Oh.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,840
Oh.

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,740
Oh.

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,780
Oh.

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,220
Oh.

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,380
Oh.

55
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh.

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:24,920
Oh.

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:24,920


58
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,440
Oh.

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
Oh.

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,400


61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,400


62
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,020
Oh.

63
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, yes, dear friends.

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,820
And welcome back to the Hour of Slack.

66
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,340
This is a special, special broadcast tonight.

67
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,320
I have a lot of feeling in my heart because this is our five-year anniversary.

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,660
Five years, dear friends.

69
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,960
This show, Hour of Slack number 257.

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:34,940
Seven marks the fifth year of the word of Bob reaching out across the airwaves,

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:44,500
reaching out for those subgeniuses and those slackless ones who need the slack that Bob can give.

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,860
So we've tried to put together a special show, one that will bless your heart

73
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,480
and bring you closer to the dogma and the doctrine of Bob's church,

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
the church of the subgenius.

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,580
I hope it'll help you to understand Bob better,

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,860
to understand your fellow members and yourself.

77
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,320
Praise Bob.

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,100
Oh, wow!

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,080
Oh, wow!

80
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh, wow!

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,260
Oh, wow!

82
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,060
Oh, wow!

83
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,060


84
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh, wow!

85
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,100
Oh, wow!

86
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,780
Oh, wow!

87
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,460
Oh, wow!

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:25,720


89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,240
love Bob, Bob!

90
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,840
Oh, wow!

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,060
Oh, wow!

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,860
Okay.

93
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,780
She kept saying over and over and over again, it's wonderful, wonderful.

94
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,960
And she said as fast as she could, wonderful, this is wonderful, this is wonderful.

95
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:46,320
Everything that happens to you, every second of every minute of every hour of every day, remember silently to name it wonderful.

96
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,340
This is wonderful.

97
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,260
And whatever you name, anything in your life is what it becomes for you.

98
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,540
Are we ready for our time travel experiment?

99
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,340
Then set the chronons for Nexus 3.

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,540
Okay, the code is I love pretty words.

101
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,980
I love pretty words.

102
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
I love pretty words.

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,620
I love pretty words.

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,840
I love pretty words.

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,100
Now, as you can see, off in the distance, leaving space.

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
Boing, oing, oing, oing, oing.

107
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,740
And so history was made, or rather unmade, as they went back in time.

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:47,720
Past the fighting minute man, past the armored knight, past the Roman warrior, to this prehistoric site.

109
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:57,800
But we overshot our mark and we went zillions of years into the past, into the area of nothingness and chaos that existed before the universe.

110
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,160
The primordial vacuum cleaner.

111
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,120
The dust balls of space.

112
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,080
Millions of miles across.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,180
Gigantic hair balls.

114
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,300
And lint filled the cosmos.

115
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:25,940
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

116
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,860
And the weaknesses and avete employees.

117
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,620
O amigo

118
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,360
And

119
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,060
芉

120
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,280
The

121
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,660
Oing

122
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:58,800
Oing

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,800
Hosanna in the high

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
In your super band

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,280

Lord of mercy

130
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,200
Lord of mercy

131
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,520
Christ of mercy

132
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,460
Lord of mercy

133
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,860
Christ of mercy

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,640
Christ of mercy

135
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,480
Christ of mercy

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,720
Christ of God

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,160
Christ of risen

138
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,200
Christ he gonna come back

139
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,540
One more time

140
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,640
I invite you to get under my roof

141
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,240
So give it up

142
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,000
I turn it loose

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Give it up

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,280
Take away the sins of the world

Have mercy

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,600
Take away the sins of the world

He's super bad

153

Super super super bad

154
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,840
Oh my God

155
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm caught inside for having offended thee

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,180
And I detest all my sins

157
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,720
Oh baby

182
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,100
What about Bob

183
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,260
Shut up human

184
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,160
In the time of P

185
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,760
When Bob Dobbs takes my cash from me

186
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
Lost my job

187
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,140
And lost my wife

188
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,560
So genius church wants to take my life

189
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,460
So genius church wants to take my life

190
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,700
And still Bob Dobbs demands his pay

191
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,020
And still Bob Dobbs demands his pay

192
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,620
And still Bob Dobbs demands his pay

193
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,240
Down in my wallet

194
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,220
Where I keep my gold

195
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,360
A guiding mouse is after my soul

196
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,440
A guiding mouse is after my soul

197
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,280
A smiling creek

198
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
The Dallas hack

199
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,880
He claims to deliver me

200
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,500
Eternal slack

201
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,740
Eternal slack

202
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,760
Eternal slack

203
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Eternal slack

204
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
Eternal slack

205
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,240
The sky is a bit put on the Jolien in the car

206
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,120
The sky is a bit put on the Jolien in the car

207
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,000
I peaked it up in the downtown cave

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,380
I peaked it up in the downtown cave

209
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,180
I peaked it up in the downtown cave

210
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,580
I pitched my NYc, its right up along

211
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,140
And I hod up, I catched my mark

212
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,800
I checked time to oh chart

213
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,480
And I low my chest

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,840
And set my money across the sea

215
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,360
I set my money across the sea

216
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,260
To the land called New York

217
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,400
In the town I live in

218
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,500
All I know is how I believe

219
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,380
In Bob Dobbs

220
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,860
I don't need my cash from me when Bob takes my cash from me.

221
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,900
All you say, no you don't.

222
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,700
Wonderful, dear friends.

223
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,900
What that man Bob can do for you.

224
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,400
Ah, yes.

225
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,140
This is one of those good old times of genius gospel shows.

226
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,640
I'm sure just brimming over with the spirit.

227
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't even care if you are.

228
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,020
That's how in the spirit I am.

229
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,040
I don't even care.

230
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,960
But we do it because of love, dear friends.

231
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,360
Oh, praise Bobby.

232
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,900
We do this in business.

233
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,600
No, I'm so sorry, listen.

234
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,600


235
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,740
We're hungry?

236
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:45,740


237
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,940
Don't take it away.

238
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,900
ее

239
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:47,900


240
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,780
We would do anything we can.

241
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:48,780


242
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,140


243
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,720
Someone who would make so many fish sesame bindings and breasts

244
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Help us find your daughter.

245
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,140
Just wait a minute.

246
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,440
Who's calling?

247
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,440


248
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,240
It's getting so that more and more, every time I'm in the studio for a session,

249
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,040
I feel just a little bit more hypocritical and guilty.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,180
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending all

251
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,860
their money on image-enhancing products that in reality they little need nor ill can afford.

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,400
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about this situation, the better my work is.

253
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,240
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.

254
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,940
I work four or five times a week.

255
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,020
I've even upped my rates.

256
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,780
Just think what would happen in the event of an all-out war.

257
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,840
Thinking about it almost makes it worth thinking about.

258
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,560
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a mouthpiece, a conduit for someone

259
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,120
else's concepts, a faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising

260
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,640
campaigns.

261
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,320
Only a little bit more than they want to believe in them themselves.

262
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,140
Now what do you think?

263
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,740
Am I cutting my own throat here?

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,120
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on the demo line, an audio

265
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
billboard for the commodity that I have become?

266
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,420
I don't know.

267
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,140
I can't answer that.

268
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,600
But I do know this.

269
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,180
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people.

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
It's a tradition that has served its own best interests.

271
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,080
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.

272
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,900
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio, nothing you can buy will make you

273
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:38,680
a better person, a happier person, a more spiritually connected person, can provide

274
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,280
you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.

275
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,240
There are things that can never be turned into commodities and marketed, and these things

276
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,120
must be searched for.

277
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,580
And they must be searched for within each of us, individually.

278
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,340
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.

279
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,420
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bum you

280
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,640
just passed on the street, then you too are part of that deception.

281
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,580
No matter how much money you have, the sad fact remains that regardless of what color

282
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:19,200
Porsche or BMW or Lamborghini you have, you will never be one of George Bush's rich friends.

283
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,720
George Bush does not want you to be his friend.

284
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,620
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

285
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,220
You cannot afford to buy your way into his country club.

286
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,340
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields, or a slave in the office, or a slave

287
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,960
in the big house on the hill.

288
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,700
You're still a slave, and at best, a middle management slave, prodding and whipping and

289
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,100
abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor.

290
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,740
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.

291
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,400
Believe me, you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

292
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:07,480
And you will be replaced the very next day by yet another well-groomed, well-oiled, eager,

293
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,500
well-meaning, brown-nosing slave.

294
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,400
This year's model.

295
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,600
Recently we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

296
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,900
Now what do you think brought all that about?

297
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,060
Was it because the communist system was flawed and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

298
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,720
No.

299
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,620
I don't think so.

300
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,840
I think it was because of the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats

301
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,840
who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

302
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,340
Interesting parallel, don't you think?

303
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,100
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats

304
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,660
charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

305
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,860
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,

306
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,960
all too often we choose to emulate them.

307
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,340
To ape their postures, their uniforms, their speech patterns and phraseology.

308
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960
But remember what I said.

309
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,340
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.

310
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,100
They're not the same.

311
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,100


312
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,100


313
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,840
Stop acting like you're next on the docket, because you aren't.

314
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,980
Stop acting like everything is all right, because it isn't.

315
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,860
Nothing is all right.

316
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,000
And if you can look around you at the state of this country

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,740
and not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs,

318
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,580
and that their dominoes just happen to fall first,

319
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,100
then either you're truly one of George Bush's rich friends,

320
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,000
or else you're truly ignorant.

321
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,120
And all I know,

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,640
is that George Bush's rich friends probably would not be calling this number

323
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,200
to hear my demo line.

324
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,360
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate fiefdom

325
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,560
we lovingly sing to in all of those patriotic songs.

326
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,900
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now,

327
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,180
remember, you're working at least three of those days

328
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,380
to pay off your accrued interest charges

329
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,880
and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe

330
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,300
as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.

331
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,260
That 3% at the top, the real inner circle,

332
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,460
is bleeding you dry.

333
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,980
It's bleeding this country dry,

334
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,920
not to mention what's left of this planet.

335
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,080
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders,

336
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,680
we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance,

337
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,500
oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

338
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,140
And why do we continue to do this?

339
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,980
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

340
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,700
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?

341
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,420
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art

342
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,220
to the continued perpetration of this hoax?

343
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,580
I don't know.

344
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,320
I can't answer that.

345
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,780
Freedom without structure.

346
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,140
Structure is anarchy.

347
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,060
Structure without freedom is fascism.

348
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,500
What are you?

349
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,420
An anarchist or a fascist?

350
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,520
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.

351
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,560
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

352
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,860
Convenience is not freedom.

353
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
And the government is not your friend.

354
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,520
Thank you for calling the voiceline.

355
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,180
Thank you for listening?

356
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,180


357
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,640
That was Joe Paulino, dear friends.

358
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,880
Reverend Joe Paulino.

359
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,320
Isn't this a funny show?

360
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

361
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,160
We don't know where it came from.

362
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,800
We can't imagine where it goes.

363
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,980
We don't know where it came from.

364
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,720
We can't imagine where it goes.

365
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,620
Boh.

366
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,860
Bob-bop.

367
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,660
Bob-bop-bop-bop.

368
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:20,940
Bop-bop-bop-bop.

369
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,520
Bop-bop.

370
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,660
Bop-bop-bop.

371
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,020
Yeah, so that's why we're on the air.

372
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,260
That's right we've got to be on the air because, see, within about seven or eight, well, I'd

373
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,020
say maybe ten years, most of the human race is going to be dead anyway of AIDS because

374
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,020
it's geometrically increasing.

375
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,700
Look, we sincerely hope that once you see what the gods have in store for you by the

376
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,340
way of retribution, tribulation, plague, punishment and plights, you'll realize just how badly

377
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,940
You need powerful friends and benign protectors like us.

378
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,600
You may scoff and ridicule this show right now,

379
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,380
but the day will come when the stockpile calamities will all be unleashed on you.

380
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,060
Hey, this is prophecy. Stand by.

381
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,100
Miniature big feet that run around slashing your ankles with poison razor blades,

382
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,220
the frozen nitric acid hail,

383
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,300
volcanoes that belch nerve gas,

384
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,980
and hallucinogenic dust clouds,

385
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,900
the one just engulfed millions at a time.

386
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,600
Rogue planets will pull into new solar orbits

387
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,420
and disrupt the rotation of the earth.

388
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,540
Some days will be a week long,

389
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,020
others no more than a few hours.

390
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,780
Things will fall off.

391
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,340
Great skyscrapers filled with horrified screaming people

392
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,960
will wrench themselves from their foundations and fly skyward

393
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,420
past the atmosphere and out into space.

394
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,560
Shopping malls will sink into the ground and never be seen again.

395
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,680
Thousands of comets will pound the moon until it shatters

396
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,140
and covers the ground with carcinogenic,

397
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,580
dreadful smells,

398
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,460
Nathan!

399
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,720
Who was the last in Malaysia

400
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,000
to think that you're right?

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:14,580
Nikki lip every minute of theMindr.com

402
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,180
prophecies laid out what's going to happen in health, industrial, bad things like that.

403
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,280
See, we've got the cases here, and when you talk about this many people

404
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,560
having the disease, or that many people working

405
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,840
in the geological spectrums that are needed to push technology...

406
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,980
Actually, a critical point will be reached sometime in 1988 or so when all the

407
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,060
available... Yes, all the available soldiers will be fighting for dogs.

408
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,580
...population AIDS patients will have been exhausted if the train...

409
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,380
Yeah, but by that date every single subgenius will have his own radio show,

410
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,100
including you, and I mean, so we'll all be broadcasting this news at that time,

411
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,340
and understanding it... Okay, what year is the mutant revolution headed off

412
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,820
when Charles Manson discovers the secret Death Valley entrance to Hollow Earth

413
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,340
and leads all the exiled misfit Nazi hell creatures against the mutant strongholds?

414
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,180
Here they come now.

415
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,920
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill,

416
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,220
and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

417
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,460
But I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without cause

418
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
shall be in danger of the judgment.

419
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,880
Ye have heard that nothing said an eye for an eye, but two for a tooth.

420
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:50,420
But I say unto you that ye resist not even, but whosoever shall spite thee on thy right cheek,

421
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,080
turn to him the other also.

422
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,840
Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemies,

423
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:08,940
but I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that push you, do good to them that hate you,

424
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,860
and pray that they may not be killed. But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that push you, do good to them that hate you, and pray that they may not be killed.

425
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,900
and pray that they may not be killed.

426
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,860
and pray for them which despitefully use you in persons of evil.

427
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,980
Amen, Amen.

428
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,540
Well of course, this is biologically, this is biologically. Suicide's absolutely madness.

429
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,380
No, it's just ridiculous.

430
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,480
Love your enemy. It isn't easy to love an enemy.

431
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
Since it goes against your most

432
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:39,860
Since it goes against your most

433
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:50,520
basic survival instinct, but it can be done and turned to an advantage. Let the love squirt

434
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,840
out of you like a fire hose of molasses. Give him the kiss of life. Stick your tongue down

435
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,320
his throat. Taste what he's been eating and bless his digestion. Booze down into his intestines

436
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:13,220
and help him along with his food. Life in all its rich variety. Do not falter. Let your love

437
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:20,560
enter in unto him and penetrate him with a divine lubricant. Makes KY and Leland feel like sandpaper.

438
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:28,100
It's the most mucilaginous, the slimiest, ooziest lubricant there ever was or shall be. Amen.

439
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:43,320
Uh, he is the one true innocent. He's so dumb that he doesn't know good from evil. To him,

440
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,900
he might walk a little old lady across the street and then might turn around and do sex tortures on

441
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,080
her for three weeks, keeping her clinging to life and then make a sandwich out of her face.

442
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,040
To him, it's all the same. And if we were, it could be as truly innocent as Bob.

443
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,800
Why we could, we could do that too.

444
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:13,120
Sick. Be lightened up. Isn't half as bad as sticking a needle into your vein.

445
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,440
You see, you don't get a clink in glasses and you don't make a toast. All you do,

446
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,880
you suck on a little reaper, you gulp in the smoke and pass it on to the next person.

447
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,320
The buzz comes real fast and there's no hangover.

448
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,580
You just light it up like you do a chest of feel. You inhale a sweet smell of smoke,

449
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,440
you exhale it out of your mouth, that's all there is to it.

450
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,140
If you like an atomic bomb, that's all there is to it.

451
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,640
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed. What was up is now. The priorities are all

452
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,000
screwed.

453
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,020
You're afraid if your hair looks okay while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting

454
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,280
out in front of your desire genes. Yes, this is bad talk. Nobody will listen to anything

455
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,060
else. You won't look at TV unless body parts are carved or chipping or crashing on it.

456
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,160
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it. You haven't used your

457
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,520
other senses since you were five. And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing

458
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,660
until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more.

459
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:39,360
Self-assured makes you stop. And you'll thank him for it. And then just before you

460
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,260
fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight, you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the

461
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,560
wrong thing. Good God, what in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming

462
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,080
to? People bitch, people cry, but this is a sign of the end times. That's a sign of

463
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,200
the end times. When you should all be hollering, it's all a sign of the end times.

464
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,780
Millions are going to be going. And they're going to leave this earth, and they're going

465
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:18,800
to leave it on the low, low, low. Lost loved ones behind. Did you hear what he was saying?

466
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:26,280
Did you hear what he was saying? Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July

467
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,640
1999? Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust. Such a forewarning of ultimate truth.

468
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,540
Doom can generally be dismissed out of hand.

469
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,540
This is Philo Drummond and Leif Cowabunga, the swinging hate corpses, dear friends.

470
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,020
Bring fast. This is the scrambler. We've got to tape this. We'll play it back real slow.

471
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,580
And we'll get his whole tape. Okay, it says meet at the Texas Theater, November 22nd.

472
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,840
Yeah, that's right. Bring the curtain rods. Well, just another subgenie caller. Just another

473
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,440
phone bomb. Just another subgenius. What can I say? Bob is fill in the blank. You can count

474
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,600
on that. Well. Or kill. Me. For more. Thank you. More or less. Why friends like to feed

475
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,220
another nation.

476
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,400
With our garbage. And who's going to do that? The passion of this garbage is delicious.

477
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,840
What was that? The church of subgeniuses. I don't know. But how many of you are really

478
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:54,100
genuinely intelligent? Bang. Are you blaming God for atom bombs? God for atom bombs? Atomic

479
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,800
warheads? All over the country. Every morning. Passed. Blotted out. Yeah. In the future.

480
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,640
Sure. Yeah, that's what I want. Ah, yeah.

481
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,200
Yes.

482
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,100
20 years ago, I warned of atom bombs. 20 years ago, I warned of atom bombs. You listen in

483
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:13,160
amazement as we take this one joke and keep blowing it up. Bigger and bigger. And the

484
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,220
only reason we're pumping so much behind this one joke is that we want to see how big it

485
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,340
gets before it explodes.

486
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,600
It was at this point that the hypnotist made the decision to take his subject over the

487
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:33,820
hump.

488
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,960
Buses, cars, and trains will crash. Wives and husbands and babies will disappear.

489
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,700
Of course, your government and all governments, they'll be, you know, trying to fish tail out

490
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,540
of it. They'll give you all kinds of excuses. You know, they'll hide the reality and the

491
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,380
UFOs or extraterrestrial invasion or astral projection or God only knows what. But they

492
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,700
will try to put it under the rug. But I'm warning you.

493
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,800
It was Bob all along, dear friend.

494
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,600
They tricked you, didn't they? They'll trick you every time they creep up on you. The little

495
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,340
pinky-winky stew in the old kitchen.

496
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,780
So we're all going to watch out, aren't we? Yes.

497
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,800
This is your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang. We're going to continue with, well,

498
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,540
some of, a little bit of what we have been playing and a little bit of new. What we have

499
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,020
been playing.

500
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,640
Have been.

501
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,120
Again, William Burroughs.

502
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,180
Oh, thank you. I'm so sorry.

503
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:48,380
And that's the old guy talking. And the KPFA subgenius show tapes, by puzzling evidence,

504
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:59,660
Dr. Howell, Gary Gaborg, Fran, Mr. Exotic, and in this case, lies. Lies!

505
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,060
Lies!

506
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,020
On the stage, when we all think that we start over fucking out this country, is when we

507
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,020


508
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,200
No, no.

509
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,200


510
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,200


511
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,640
No, no, no.

512
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,020
I'm safe, that's it.

513
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,020


514
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,020


515
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,020


516
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,020


517
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,760
Will屎 wan ?

518
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,500
How do you like your new life in life in шараш damals?

519
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,560
And two years?

520
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:33,640


521
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:40,900
sailing close to the shores of Tuscany heard a voice cry out from the hills, the trees, and the sky.

522
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,800
The great god Pan is dead.

523
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,420
Pan got a panic.

524
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:56,620
The sudden awareness that everything is alive and significant.

525
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,020
The date was December 25, 1 A.D.

526
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:10,860
But Pan lives on in the realm of imagination, in writing, painting, and music.

527
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,600
Look at Van Gogh's sunflowers writhing with pretentious life.

528
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,200
Listen to the pipes of Pan in Taduka.

529
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:31,640
Now Pan is neutralized, framed in museums, entombed in books, relegated to folklore.

530
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,260
But art is spilling out of its frames into subway graffiti.

531
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,840
Will it stop there?

532
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,120
Consider an apocalyptic statement.

533
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.

534
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,220
Hassan E. Saba, the old man of the mountain.

535
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:02,900
Not to be interpreted as an invitation to old manner of unrestrained and destructive behavior,

536
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,400
but to be a minor episode which would run its course.

537
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,660
Everything is permitted because nothing is true.

538
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,900
It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art.

539
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,700
When art leaves the frame and the written word leaves the page.

540
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,320
Not merely the physical frame and page,

541
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,580
but the frames and pages.

542
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,560
The pages have assigned the categories.

543
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,960
A basic disruption of reality itself occurs.

544
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,280
The literal realization of art.

545
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,580
Success will write apocalypse across the sky.

546
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,060
The artist aims for a miracle.

547
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,040
The painter wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate life.

548
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,620
Move to the next.

549
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,380
A movement outside of the picture.

550
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:13,180
And one rent in the fabric is all it takes for pandemonium to sluice through.

551
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,960
Last act.

552
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,340
The end.

553
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,680
This is where we all came in.

554
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,160
The final apocalypse is when every man sees what he sees.

555
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,980
Feels what he feels.

556
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,720
Hears what he hears.

557
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,420
The creatures of all your dreams and nightmares are right here, right now.

558
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,160
Solid as they ever were or ever will be.

559
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,620
Electric vitality of careening subways.

560
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,880
Faster, faster, faster.

561
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,700
Stations flash by in a blur.

562
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,820
Pan, god of panic whips screaming crowds as millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

563
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,560
Off the track, off the track.

564
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,080
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings, careening into space.

565
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,880
Spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

566
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,880
Spinning faster and faster, days and nights flash by like subway stations.

567
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,680
Tunnels crunch down teeth of concrete and steel.

568
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,260
Flattening cars like beer cans.

569
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:43,500
Graffiti through glass and steel like acid races across the sky in tornadoes of flaming colors.

570
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:56,620
Cherry pickers with satin brushes pick us at door, inch through Wall Street, leaving a vast souvenir postcard of the Grand Canyon.

571
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,140
Water trucks slosh out paint.

572
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,280
Outlaw painters armed with paint pistols paint everything and everyone in reach.

573
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:18,120
Survival artists, paint cans strapped to their backs, grenades at their belts.

574
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,400
Paint anything and anybody within range.

575
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,600
Sky riders, paint cans strapped to their backs, grenades at their belts.

576
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:26,600


577
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,220
Dog fight collide and explode in pain.

578
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:36,920
Telephone poles dance electric jigs in swirling crackling wires.

579
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,840
Neon explosions and tornadoes splash through ruined cities.

580
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:52,440
Volcanoes spew molten colors as the earth's crust buckles and splinters into jigsaw pieces.

581
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,740
Household appliances revolt.

582
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,760
Washing machines snatch clothes from the guests.

583
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,580
Delivering hoovers suck off makeup and wigs and false teeth.

584
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,860
Electric toothbrushes leap into screaming mouths.

585
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,700
The clothes dryers turn gardens into dust bowls.

586
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,420
Garden tools whiz through long parties in the middle of the night.

587
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,420


588
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,420


589
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,620
Impaling the guests who are hacked to fertilizer by industrious Japanese hatchets.

590
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,040
Loads of misshapen bulbous plants spring from their bones.

591
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:43,900
Covering golf courses, swimming pools, country clubs, and tasteful dwellings.

592
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,440
At my back, faster and faster, I always hear,

593
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,820
Hurry up, energy ground down into, please it's time closing.

594
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,180
Sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires erupt from manholes and tunnels.

595
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,380
Break out with volcanic force.

596
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,100
Let it come down careening subways.

597
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,040
Faster and faster, stations blur by.

598
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,420
And whip screaming crowds with ferocious screams.

599
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,380
Flaming pikes.

600
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,960
Millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

601
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,620
Off the track, off the track.

602
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,540
Planet is pulling loose from its moorings.

603
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,720
Careening off into space.

604
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,780
Spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

605
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,440
Faster and faster.

606
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,420
Skyscrapers scrape rents.

607
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,700
Rents of blue and white paint from the sky.

608
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,760
The rivers swirl with color.

609
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:04,780
Nitrous ochres and reds leap through the bridges falling into the rivers.

610
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:12,260
Splashing colors across warehouses and piers and roads and buildings.

611
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,480
Amok art rugs in organic mold.

612
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,320
Stirring passions of metal and glass.

613
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,920
Steel girders rising in metal.

614
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,480
Loss dispersed from their concrete coverings.

615
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,820
Walls of glass melt and burn with madness and a billion crazed eyes.

616
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,820
Bridges buck cars and trucks into the rivers.

617
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,280
The sidewalks run ahead.

618
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,960
Faster and faster.

619
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,940
Energy ground down into sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires.

620
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,380
Erupts from manholes and tunnels and breaks out the volcanic force.

621
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,160
Let it come down.

622
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,500
Caught in New York beneath the animals of the village.

623
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,920
The piper pulled down at the sky.

624
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,900
The

625
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,260
We're escalating our programming here.

626
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,420
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo-exists talking to the exes.

627
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:45,060
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo-exists talking to the exes.

628
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,500
We are going to have the pseudo-exists talking to the exes.

629
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,460
We are going to have the pseudo-exists talking to the exes.

630
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,920
I've read my mind, right?

631
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
I've expected what I would.

632
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:56,980
The

633
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:56,980


634
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,420
The

635
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,320
The

636
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,720
The

637
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:58,900
The

638
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:58,900


639
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:58,900


640
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,700
The

641
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,300
The

642
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,720
The

643
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,600
The

644
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:15,700
The

645
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,500
The

646
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,640
The

647
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,440
The

648
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,460
The

649
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,640
The

650
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:25,660
The

651
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:25,680
The

652
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:28,920
The

653
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:28,940
The

654
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:28,960
The

655
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,080
The

656
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:58,980
We don't know what they came for, but what they aim for is impossible.

657
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,760
Impossible.

658
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,360
Only those ideas which are accepted are those which are in the hands of the status quo,

659
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,900
which reaches the wider.

660
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,420
The audience, which makes people brain-dead,

661
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,280
and you either have to submit or you have to join the spectacle, you know.

662
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,300
The invasion of body standards, that kind of thing.

663
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,280
Yeah, and so we can agree that under that situation, it's a planet of the dead.

664
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,280
And the alternative is not to offer other ideas,

665
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,040
because they'll be quickly consumed and recycled and played out.

666
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,060
So the real alternative is a kind of New Yorker,

667
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,260
an environmental yoga, not a private spiritual or Eastern yoga.

668
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,880
The new yoga is to deal with the environments we've created and we all share.

669
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,420
You know what I mean, Mike?

670
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,800
And so that's why we have to deal with the conspiracy.

671
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,300
It goes back to that caller, that if I was able to take control,

672
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,960
and I do have control, but if I was able to present it in the pink world,

673
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,740
then I could bring in this real alternative.

674
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,440
And the way to have an alternative is to change the environments.

675
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,840
One of the ways would be to turn off the electric environment.

676
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,840
Can you imagine doing that?

677
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,040
Right.

678
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,280
Right.

679
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,720
That'd be one.

680
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,000
It's not an alternative idea, that's an alternative percept.

681
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,640
But the pinks are never going to let you do that.

682
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,540
So they will let you have all the celebratory retrievals and replays

683
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,200
and celebrations of ideas and cultures,

684
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,620
because they know the medium is the message, not the content.

685
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,280
The content has no importance.

686
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,580
The control environment is those of the emperor, this is his new clothes,

687
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,440
is that he's just going to keep it on.

688
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,860
He's not going to turn it on.

689
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,800
A lot of money to be made.

690
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,100
Yeah.

691
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,940
And he's not even making money.

692
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,860
He doesn't even want that.

693
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,200
Right.

694
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,300
So the emperor of Phoebus was aware that I had recognized it.

695
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,320
And it was laughing at me from within the anti-virgins' unhallowed womb.

696
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:13,380
I felt rage and fear inside of me and the voices of the archangels broadcast from their

697
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,020
secret staging base in the hallowed earth raged in my head.

698
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,380
By the time Satan's whore had finished her meal, I had decided on my course of action.

699
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,620
I followed her home.

700
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,960
She lived in one of those bland, pasteurized suburban mushroom colonies.

701
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,060
And I was just looking at the sky.

702
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,220
Choi objected.

703
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,900
Your letter you sent me.

704
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,980
Yes!

705
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:47,360
Sweet and blue, we Ru hurt.

706
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,100
No wonder the

707
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,380
weapon went down.

708
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:52,900
But I?

709
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,040
ITuTu, don't go.

710
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,600
The Eastern world

711
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,780
It is exploding

712
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,040
Violence flaring

713
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,120
Bullets loading

714
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,860
You're old enough to kill

715
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,300
But not for voting

716
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,080
You don't believe in war

717
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,400
But what's that gun you're toting

718
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,440
And even the Jordan River

719
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,420
Has bodies floating

720
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,300
But you tell me

721
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,900
Over and over and over again

722
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,140
My friend

723
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,700
How you don't believe

724
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,760
We're on the eve of destruction

725
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,280
Don't you understand

726
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,500
What I'm trying to say

727
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,680
And can't you feel the fears

728
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,480
That I'm feeling today

729
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,420
Hypothetically

730
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,480
The button is pushed

731
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,380
There's no running away

732
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,660
There'll be no one to save

733
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,680
With the world in a grave

734
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,000
Take a look around you boy

735
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,100
It's bound to scare you boy

736
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,960
And you tell me

737
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,660
Over and over and over again

738
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,980
My friend

739
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,500
How you don't believe

740
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,620
We're on the eve of destruction

741
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,540
Oh this is

742
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,420
This is

743
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:27,420


744
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,580
Our

745
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,200
Of

746
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,880
Slack

747
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,760
Number

748
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,520
9183

749
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,180
May 19th

750
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,780
21 989

751
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,480
A.D.

752
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,780
In the news

753
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,680
Increased controversy over the skeleton and dwelling place or office of a midhistoric man

754
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,840
Recently unearthed by scientists in the deserts of Texas in North Amerenid

755
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,360
On Earth Farm

756
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,860
One

757
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,160
Due to its special qualities

758
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,240
Experts are engaged in heated debate over its origins

759
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,220
Whether it is merely an advanced homo sapiens

760
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,820
A human that is

761
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:15,260
Or is it one of the earliest homo correctus

762
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,760
Also known as the subgenius

763
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,940
The last evolutionary step before our own species

764
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,560
Homo Excelsior

765
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,420
Does this fossil represent the missing link?

766
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,920
Between the lesser gravity bound bipedal primates

767
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,280
And the subgenius descended brain race

768
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,060
Which now conquers the stars?

769
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,240
And what of the claims by cultists and dissidents

770
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,980
That it is no less than the skull of one of the early apostles

771
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,420
Of the historical Dobbs man form

772
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,740
Which brought slack to Earth Farm One in the year zero B.D.

773
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,620
Or as they measured time

774
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,220
The late 20th century?

775
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,100
Could this be?

776
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,360
Most scientists concur that the skeleton could well be

777
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,920
That of a man who walked the earth at the same time and place

778
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,220
As the Dobbs itself

779
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,020
During his last physical incarnation

780
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,080
An unwitting pre-overman fighter

781
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,640
In the bitter struggle which raised homo excelsior

782
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,400
From his quagmire of mortality and physics bound

783
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,360
Three dimensional fixed leggedness

784
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,080
And into the energy based free thought process of life

785
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,320
To what form heights of our civilization

786
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,460
But is it necessarily?

787
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Let's examine the fossil record

788
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,420
Evidence which while meager on the surface

789
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,660
Yet allows skilled experts

790
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,660
To reconstruct and describe in extraordinary detail

791
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,980
The life of this mysterious ancient tool using ape

792
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,240
Of course Earth Farm One in his time

793
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,980
Was a much different place than it is today.

794
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,060
Labyrinth of the Earth Farm One.

795
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,400
The planet was artificially gifted with surging plankton filled oceans

796
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,840
And land masses abundant with plants and animals

797
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,040
The home seed planet then bore little resemblance

798
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,600
To the blasted atmosphereless testing range

799
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,500
All too familiar to modern elementary school environmentologists

800
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,000
But what sort of creature dwelt in this crude office

801
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,120
Of 20,000 years ago?

802
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,800
Who was he?

803
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,920
What was his daily life?

804
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,060
Or even his life?

805
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,000
What was he like there on farm earth just before the great transmigration?

806
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,440
Fossil fragments of his implements seen here

807
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,620
Supplemented by the oral records of our friends the dolphins

808
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,660
Paint a picture of his primeval office

809
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,500
Constructed of simple wood and metal

810
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,880
Yet he possessed crude computers of a sort

811
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,700
Fashioned entirely from toxic plastics and metals

812
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,060
And a

813
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


814
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


815
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


816
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


817
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


818
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


819
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


820
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


821
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


822
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,060
Powered by artificial electricity

823
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,880
These early computers were

824
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,780
Sad, immobile, paralyzed boxes

825
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,620
Armless and legless

826
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,940
Mere heads

827
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,500
To be used as little more than flint hatchets

828
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,820
Their users probably did not even suspect that their computers possessed souls

829
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:21,480
Certainly they were never used for the sexual pastimes we enjoy today

830
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,060
Nevertheless their presence in this creature's hypothetical office

831
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,040
Distinguish him from the rest of the world

832
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,260
As a uniquely electronic animal

833
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,920
The first of his kind

834
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,020
Indeed he was far more overhuman than this apish reconstruction slide indicates

835
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:44,180
As seen in slide one which admittedly resembles the domesticated Eloi

836
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,200
We breed for soul energy

837
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,500
Even more so the primitive wild Eloi

838
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Mocked by our children in zoos

839
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,020
Homo correctus possesses the familiar unnamed name

840
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,220
More grew laced with nerves and a host of thick and incisive muscles

841
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,900
He's a kind of eye ا

842
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:03,960
It is notacağ

843
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,020
Confirmed as the most often

844
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,620
UnAA

845
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,980
Weirdoform Freak

846
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,880
those hideous jointed appendages which are only vestigial in our race.

847
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:39,960
As seen here, the socket at which the femur connects to the pelvis was farther inward than in Australopithecus, for instance.

848
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,040
So he was capable of walking fully erect if he wore shoes,

849
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,420
but abrasion on the coccyx shows that most of the time was actually spent sitting,

850
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:58,200
perhaps because, like us, his great weight would otherwise have crushed even his massive bones.

851
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,980
The skeleton is, at first glance, typical of the humans of that time.

852
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:11,160
Note that the bones are much thicker than ours, suggesting that the musculature of this creature had broad anchors.

853
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,620
Physically, these creatures were incredibly powerful.

854
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,880
One of them could easily slay 20 of us in combat.

855
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,400
But were his head...

856
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,840
shielded from telepathic control by...

857
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:23,900
Blightanium?

858
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,420
Well, of course, to him, Blightanium was at best a dream.

859
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:36,060
Uh, you know, there hasn't been any, uh, real advances in your field.

860
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,100
Here, gang, all here.

861
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,280
What the heck do we care?

862
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,060
What the heck do we care?

863
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,040
But your tape recorder...

864
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,360
Yes.

865
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,920
Hey, that machine is alive!

866
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,420
Get this thing off of me!

867
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,260
Help!

868
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,980
Look, it's clawing right up his leg.

869
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,420


870
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,080
You talking to me?

871
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,940
Uh, yeah, we can see...

872
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,320
How do I, how do I kill that?

873
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,620
Uh, you can...

874
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,540
Here, we'll show you.

875
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,580
You can, uh, take this, uh, tape here...

876
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,840
You talking to me?

877
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,120
And you grind up a little bit of buffalo...

878
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,700
Yeah, I saw that little tape.

879
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,560
Uh, residue.

880
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,100
Yeah, I'm talking to you, little tape.

881
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,780
Get in the trash can.

882
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,800
You gotta talk it down.

883
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,460
Yeah, you're in the stupid cell.

884
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,760
You gotta be a man about it and talk it down.

885
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,900
You're in the cell we're not gonna use, alright?

886
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,700
Get back in the trash can.

887
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,180
Get back!

888
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:17,920
Get in!

889
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,680
Get in the trash can!

890
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,160
Get that razor blade, quick!

891
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,400
Get in the trash can!

892
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,000
Get that editing tape!

893
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,520
Get that editing tape!

894
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,000
So the razor blade slaps...

895
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,580
Razor blade beats tape any time.

896
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,260
Oh, yeah?

897
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,780
Yeah.

898
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,300
Get back in the trash can!

899
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,580
You stupid...

900
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,760
Get in the trash can!

901
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,380
Huh!

902
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,180
The Crocodile

903
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:47,540
The Crocodile

904
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,400
No animal is half so vile as Crocodile.

905
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,760
Croc Ewok the Crocodile.

906
00:53:52,620 --> 00:54:00,440
On Saturdays he likes to crunch six juicy children for his lunch and he especially enjoys just three of each, three girls, three boys.

907
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,100
He smears the boys to make them hot with mustard from the mustard pot.

908
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,940
But mustard doesn't go with girls.

909
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,100
It tastes all wrong with plaits and curls.

910
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,920
With them what goes extremely well is butterscotch and caramel.

911
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,040
It's such a super marvellous treat when boys are hot and girls are sweet.

912
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,100
At least that's Croc's point of view.

913
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,020
He ought to know. He's had a few.

914
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,040
That's all for now. It's time for bed.

915
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,000
Lie down and rest your sleepy head.

916
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,460
Shh! Listen.

917
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,420
What is that I hear?

918
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,960
Galumphing softly up the stair.

919
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,300
Go lock the door and fetch my gun.

920
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,900
Go on, child. Hurry. Quickly run.

921
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,200
No, stop. Stand back. He's coming in.

922
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,420
Oh, look, that greasy, greenish skin.

923
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,840
The shining teeth. The greedy smile.

924
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,260
It's Crockeywock the crocodile.

925
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,320
Observe here the remarkably small cranium of Homo correctus.

926
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,160
Only 2,000 cubic centimeters compared to our 50,000.

927
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,740
And the characteristic backward sloping forehead.

928
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,080
The brain of this animal was capable only of language, tool making, and speech.

929
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,080
It had none of the 40 other capabilities.

930
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,180
And it had no characteristics of high thought, which we take for granted today.

931
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,740
Altogether, his brain had less cells than do those of our contemporary gorilla servants.

932
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:35,120
As certain radical upstart free gorilla gorillas never cease to remind us.

933
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:43,500
As every school child knows, our ancestors were able to genetically transfer the brain into the chest where it was better protected.

934
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,840
While moving the gonads into the cranium where they best functioned.

935
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,080
But that happened 5,000 years ago.

936
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,720
After the last war.

937
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,360
Compared to us then, Homo correctus was truly a monster.

938
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:06,920
Because of his savage, savage appearance, primitive peoples on the outer planet still use scary tales of these creatures to frighten their children into behaving.

939
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:20,080
But despite the quaint legends of monsters like Dob Squatch or Middle-sized Foot, the idea that some pocket of these biological throwbacks might exist are, if romantic, never true.

940
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,280
Nevertheless, pure myth.

941
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:28,960
Yes, to us, he would look like a mutated, disgusting, violent zoo animal.

942
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:37,780
But if we could imagine his thoughts, they would probably prove to be remarkably similar to, say, those of our own four year olds.

943
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,800
Pondering the mysteries of life, slack, and squirt.

944
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:57,000

Eve of Destruction. The lead singer is a subgenius, believe it or not. Some more KPFA there. And,

of course, Raoul Dahl with a bedtime story. Stay tuned, dear friends, for a nicer show

955
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,880
Aren't those hate corpses terrible?

956
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,040
They're terrible.

958
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,760
One song's good.
