1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,980
The mind of man has always longed to know what lies beyond the world we live in.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,220
Explorers have ventured into the deeps and the heights. Of these explorers, some are scientists,

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,860
some are mystics. Each is driven by a different purpose. The one thing they share in common,

4
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:37,800
is a wish to cross the borderlands that lie beyond the subgenius power of slack.

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:49,520
Stand by. Stand by, please. 1-3-0-1-3-1-3-0-1-3-1-3-0-1-3.

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm washing ashore. BP will plug up the Gulf of Mexico.

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,840
Basically, it involves using a huge motor to plug up the Gulf of Mexico.

8
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,720
and pump to try and shoot heavy mud into the upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia.

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,020
Even though the deadly explosion there last month died in Los Angeles, he was seven years old.

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,160
They fail to see their own baby face. Stocks 69, 974, 156 today.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,100
U.S. government has now assembled its own team of experts to try and determine exactly how

12
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,260
thick crude. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal describes the marshes there.

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,300
The biologists predicted that you'd see disk marsh, and we literally went into the marsh,

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
you could see the marsh.

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,360
Speaking in California, President Obama didn't say he would oppose PR,

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,840
but he said the cost and risk involved are reasons the U.S. needs to move away from PR News in Washington.

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,460
You think you're special. You say, oh, you can't put me in a box. No, sir.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,300
Friends, we all end up in a box. Your only choice is what you're going to do between

19
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,000
now and then. You need to find your short-duration personal savior,

20
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,840
because, friends, you have a short-duration.

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,520
Personal existence.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,000
And I've said this before.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,020
We're the good weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,720
That's conspiracy thinking. We're not necessarily good, but we are funny.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,460
We are here to make civilization fun again.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,500
We're not into Bob, but Bob!

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,920
Bob, we're not into wisdom, but wisdom.

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:41,800
We are not wise men and wise women, but wise guys, wise anchors, wise enheimers, wise asses.

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,860
Those who crack wise.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,360
Our asses crack wise.

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,360
Yes, indeed.

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,040
Fred, are you badly hurt?

33
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,920
No, no, I'm all right.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,320
Stoner!

35
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,760
Stoner, get that hole.

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:28,000
Stoner, get that hole.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,420
Stoner, get that hole.

38
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,620
Get the boogers off her fingers.

39
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,520
She was eating her boogers.

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,980
She was picking her nose and eating her boogers.

41
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
She was eating her boogers.

42
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,780
She was picking her nose and eating her boogers.

43
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,220
I can't believe what I am seeing.

44
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,280
So I continue.

45
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,100
She keeps on doing it, violently, with great determination.

46
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,720
It's as if she is eating a meal.

47
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,220
I wonder what she'll have for dessert.

48
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,640
Probably more boogers.

49
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,780
The extra sweet ones.

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,560
Every couple of picks, she licks off her fingers to get the excess snot.

51
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,840
At times I can see her chewing.

52
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,160
She was eating her boogers.

53
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,480
She was picking her nose and eating her boogers.

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,480


55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,480


56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,480


57
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,300
She was licking her boogers!

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,520
I wonder what this is.

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,240
She was licking and licking her boogers!

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,240


61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,340
She was biting her boogers.

62
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,300
She was licking her nose and eating her boogers.

63
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,180
She was licking her nose and eating her boogers.

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:38,240
At first I thought it was funny, but as she didn't stop until 25, I started feeling nauseous and had to avoid looking at her.

65
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,520
Interesting how a sexual attraction can turn into disgust and horror.

66
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
I win!

67
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,700
Here we go again.

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,420
Oh my god!

69
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:14,480
This battle went by senselessly.

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,260
Checking her nose, feeding her birds.

71
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,560
Everything I planned completely destroyed.

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,140
You know what the police will do to you if they catch you?

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,640
No, of course you don't.

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,840
They wouldn't know it was Jungle Instinct that urged you to kill a female that stood between you and a mate.

75
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,680
They'll put you on trial.

76
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,780
Throw question after question at you.

77
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
Till you won't know what anybody's saying.

78
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,300
Do it in the electric chair and they'll kill you.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,720
All because they won't understand.

80
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
They can't understand.

81
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,680
The one thing I hadn't counted on.

82
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,780
A terrific emotion would destroy the new tissues in your gland growths.

83
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,160
I have myself partly to blame.

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,660
I should have kept you under constant observation.

85
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
That's right, look at them.

86
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,460
I operated on you.

87
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,720
Grafted glands from a living woman into your body, watched you transform.

88
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,240
Now I have to do it all over again.

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
Graft new glands into your body.

90
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,280
Maybe another brain operation.

91
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,560
Take another life to keep you in human form.

92
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,420
Bob eschalized in unorthodox thought.

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,700
Bob was inspired to take this path.

94
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,340
Bob's favorite alternative belief was flat earthism.

95
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,800
Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Pyramid Power.

96
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,280
In the early 1980s, Bob added to this belief.

97
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,260
He added creationism to his list.

98
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,220
And served on the board of it as president.

99
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,660
Bob also came to be known as an expert in its attacks on the teaching of evolution.

100
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,000
Bob died in 2000, leaving a large collection of writings.

101
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,760
She's edited a collection of Bob's writings, Worlds of Their Own,

102
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,060
a brief history of misguided ideas.

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,280
Energy Sink.

104
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,780
Scams.

105
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,420
This book's a collection of some of Bob's beliefs,

106
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,540
but also on the personalities of people that hold them.

107
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,180
And on what Bob called the philosophy of the world.

108
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,540
Bob, carry on the work.

109
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,040
The work of Slack.

110
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,580
Yep. Now that the oceans are dead.

111
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,920
Is that thing loaded?

112
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,580
That pipe? Is that pipe loaded?

113
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,980
One way to find out.

114
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,680
Look, I need that book.

115
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,060
It's the most important thing.

116
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,780
I mean, I want the book.

117
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,120
It's a bomb book.

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,740
And you, if you make me choose, I'll kill you.

119
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,520
I'll take the book.

120
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,020
Why? Why do you want it?

121
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,400
Slack. Neat Slack.

122
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,860
I grew up with it.

123
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,260
I love Bob.

124
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,380
I know its power.

125
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,620
And if you read it, then so do you.

126
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
Revelation X is good, too.

127
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,200
That's why they burned them all after the war.

128
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,040
After the ocean died.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,800
It just ain't alive. It's an act of faith.

130
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,180
Building this town is an even bigger act of faith.

131
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,580
But they don't understand that.

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
They don't have Slack.

133
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,740
None of them.

134
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,920
And I don't have the right words to help them, but the book does.

135
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,040
The Bob Liagra Monocon.

136
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,120
It's a great book.

137
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,660
I admit.

138
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,540
I've had to do things, many, many things.

139
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,340
I hate to build this. I confess that.

140
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,740
I served the conspiracy.

141
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,640
But if we have that book,

142
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,500
I wouldn't have to.

143
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,700
The book of the subjeans.

144
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,260
I imagine.

145
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,640
I imagine how different, how righteous this little world could be if we had the right words for our faith.

146
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,880
So much Slack.

147
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,220
Well, people would truly understand why they're here and why they're doing it.

148
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,700
They wouldn't need any of the ugly motivations.

149
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
But have Bob.

150
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,680
It's not right to keep that book hidden away.

151
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,440
It's meant to be shared with others.

152
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,480
Spread.

153
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,480
Meant to be spread.

154
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,480
Like manure.

155
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,300
Like manure.

156
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,700
Isn't that what you wanted?

157
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,540
With all my heart and soul.

158
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,440
I always believed that...

159
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,460
I love Bob.

160
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,160
I'd find a place where this book belonged, where it was needed.

161
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,780
The subjeans foundation.

162
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
I haven't found it yet.

163
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,800
Oh.

164
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,840
I love Bob, though, man.

165
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,720
I love this guy.

166
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,840
I love that Bob guy.

167
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,560
I'd take a bullet for Bob.

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,640
I would.

169
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,700
That's how much I love him.

170
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,500
I love this guy.

171
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,560
That's Bob.

172
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,200
Praise Bob.

173
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,080
That's it?

174
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Kill me.

175
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,220
Here, give me that Bob bullet.

176
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,500
Go ahead.

177
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,680
The king bullet.

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,120
That's it?

179
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,660
Hey, wait a minute.

180
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,260
Hey, those are real bullets.

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,600
Hey, what?

182
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,260
What?

183
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,540
What?

184
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,060
This is censorship.

185
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,240
What's going on here?

186
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,000
Cool.

187
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm going.

188
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,420
Must stop.

189
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm going.

190
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,540


191
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,540


192
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,540


193
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,540


194
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,540


195
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,540


196
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Must have...slack.

197
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,140
I hid the book in the...

198
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,880
Must have the slack.

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,780
It's not a book.

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,980
It's the Bob book.

201
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,220
It's a weapon.

202
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
It's Bob's gun.

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,520
A weapon ain't brighter than the horse and the horse.

204
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,520


205
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,960
The minds of the weak and the desperate.

206
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,340
It will give us control of them.

207
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,140
Bob is gone and you're the...

208
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,500
If we want to rule more than one small town, we have to have it.

209
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,980
Cleveland and then...

210
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,140
People come from all over.

211
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,900
They do exactly what I tell them.

212
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,320
Columbus.

213
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,080
That's it.

214
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,040
A grump book.

215
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,240
It's Bob's book.

216
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,500
It's Bob's book.

217
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,100
It's happened before.

218
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,700
And it'll happen again.

219
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,180
On its name.

220
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,620
All we need is that book.

221
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,240
And subgenius.com.

222
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,180
Well, Reverend Ed Lobotomy responded to that.

223
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,140
And he's not here, is he?

224
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,200
He said that's what they want subgeniuses to do.

225
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,840
They don't care if you're a subgenius as long as you act normal.

226
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,700
Too much normalcy and developing yetensiny acts to stifle their superpowers.

227
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,980
They want subgeni to be powerless.

228
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,640
It's like Bob says, act like a dumb shit and I'll treat you as an equal.

229
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,600
He read that as a prediction of what would happen.

230
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,940
He didn't think Bob's advocating it.

231
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,440
Personally, he said...

232
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,540
I don't care if they treat me as an equal or not.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,560
But really, friends, it is advice for getting along with normals.

234
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,980
Now, maybe you were born rich.

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,300
You don't have to worry about that.

236
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,100
But as far as I'm concerned, passing is the first skill a subgenius must learn.

237
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,480
Rich or poor.

238
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,600
You have to be able to pretend you're normal.

239
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,500
Not for long.

240
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,440
Just long enough.

241
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,680
Because the nail that sticks up...

242
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,780
will be hammered down.

243
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,920
As Nemzlow used to point out.

244
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,480
And note that he was pointing with a hammer in his hand.

245
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,220
Now, you can choose which normal subgroup among whom you're going to try to pass.

246
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,600
Some pass as office workers.

247
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,920
Some pass as hippie bums.

248
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
Some pass as craftsmen.

249
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,640
Some pass as artists.

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,520
Normals expect artists to smell funny and be socially clumsy.

251
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,180
And scientists too.

252
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,660
But look in the yellow pages under artists.

253
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,700
And scientists.

254
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,640
And see how much demand there is for those these days.

255
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Now, me, I don't wear a dog's head on my clothing.

256
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,440
Except at subgenius events.

257
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,420
My car has no bumper stickers.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,520
Everyone in the neighborhood knows me as Mr. Smith.

259
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,720
Or that old guy with the hat and the beautiful granddaughter that he shouldn't be touching that way.

260
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,780
And that's how I have managed to get away with murder.

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,700
And not have my kids taken away from me all those years.

262
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,060
In the old days I spent 25 years doing business films for pinks.

263
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,560
While doing the church business and raising the kid.

264
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,420
And that's why I now have a house and a spouse and health insurance and so on.

265
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,260
Because I did learn to pass as a normal.

266
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,400
In fact, I was thinking about writing a book called Pink Like Me.

267
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,300
I wore the masks of insanity.

268
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,100
Which really means the masks of normality.

269
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,000
And until 1990 or so,

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,820
I used to actually get haircuts from real barbers.

271
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,680
Remember friends,

272
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,780
they cannot read your mind.

273
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,600
Most of them can't even read subtitles.

274
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,500
Yeah!

275
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,860
Guess you've noticed that my arms don't fit

276
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,980
In my old clothes.

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,340
And my old suits.

278
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,680
Guess you've noticed that I'm eating

279
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,140
Lots of jungle fruits.

280
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,840
Anyway more than I used to.

281
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,500
I used to be so tall and thin.

282
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,400
Now I'm not exactly sure

283
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
Which file I'm in.

284
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,980
And I know there's a monkey in the pit.

285
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,300
But all I know is I don't care about

286
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,820
The Nazi

287
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:04,820


288
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,240
In the middle of all things frontal.

289
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,260
So you've got.

290
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm getting down and evolving

291
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,820
I'm devolving

292
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,100
I am devolving

293
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,180
I guess you've noticed that I can't sit still

294
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,820
At dinner time

295
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,800
I guess you've noticed that I quit my job

296
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,740
And I learned to sign

297
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
Anyway more than I used to

298
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,780
I used to have a little body hair

299
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,720
Now I have to use a razor everywhere

300
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,740
And I know

301
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,160
I'm getting down and evolving

302
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,600
There's a monkey in the future for you

303
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,000
And there's nothing modern science can do

304
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,620
Keeping the thumb but I'm getting down

305
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm devolving

306
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm devolving

307
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,780
I am evolving

308
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,340
Why are you so angry at me?

309
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,980
I don't understand

310
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,780
Are you

311
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,720
You expect me to defend my actions

312
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,080
Knowing what you now know

313
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,420
Monkey one, monkey two

314
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,140
Monkey me and monkey you

315
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,720
Monkey see and monkey do

316
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,480
You still love me

317
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,300
Now that I'm a monkey

318
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,840
Monkey you're a monkey

319
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,360
I guess you've noticed that I drag my knuckles

320
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,980
When I dance

321
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,760
I guess you've noticed that I drag my knuckles

322
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,900
Guess you've noticed that I stuff a tail

323
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,660
Inside my pants

324
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,120
Anyway more than I used to

325
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,840
I used to see a movie now and then

326
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,100
Now I'm never gonna watch King Kong again

327
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,520
Cause I know there's a monkey in the future for you

328
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,760
And there's nothing modern science can do

329
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:18,420
I'm an Because Of You

330
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:33,620


331
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,660
Dead

332
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,540
in

333
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,180
there

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm a coal miner's duster

335
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,500
This is Dave.

336
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,720
And that was Jonathan Colton, and this is Dave.

337
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,320
And is Jonathan a frog pie or a cold or...

338
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,440
He's good. Colton. C-O-U-L-T-O-N.

339
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,540
JonathanColton.com.

340
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,600
The word in our titles, as usual.

341
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,220
Gojrex. Reverend Gojrex cut up that thing you could not hear, Dave.

342
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,280
The discussion about Bob and his book.

343
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,580
The book of Eli helped us there a little bit.

344
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,020
Eli? Not Enoch?

345
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,480
Paula Dupree, the ape woman, helped us out there.

346
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Oh, and the song, Eating Her Boogers.

347
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,940
I don't know if that's the title of it.

348
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,500
The song that was about eating her boogers is by Amit Lissak.

349
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,340
Amit, A-M-I-T, Lissak, L-I-S-S-A-K.

350
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,960
Lissak.

351
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,680
I have a sack.

352
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,660
He's a post boy.

353
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,860
I think he's a he and he's talking about licking her boogers,

354
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,000
which doesn't make sense.

355
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
But why should it?

356
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,520
We live in a nonsensical world, I think, don't we?

357
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,620
I'm trying to make a little bit more sense of it.

358
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Well, I just wanted to note a peculiar peculiarity in the air of the...

359
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,000
There have been large numbers of freshwater kills of species of fish,

360
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,160
and people are wondering why.

361
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,760
It's very coincidental with what's going on in Peru right now.

362
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Or the Golfo de Mexico.

363
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,460
There's some new volcanoes going off in beautiful Peru.

364
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,720
Is that what you're talking about?

365
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,640
Well, I was just wondering if the Peruvians and the people who live in Yucatan and Louisiana

366
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,380
have any idea that the same plate that stretches across their dinner table

367
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:57,160
is the same erect platter we use to design ways to commit massive suicide.

368
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,820
In other words, the entire Atlantic Ocean could be...

369
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,840
...presently and forever destroyed.

370
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,240
In your Atlantic, there's two favorite places for fishies to go and do their fun.

371
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,720
One is the Mediterranean, and the other one's the Golfo Mexico.

372
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,720
They're kind of like the opposite sides of the Atlantic, you know?

373
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,800
And the Atlantic is like all one thing made of water,

374
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,500
so that it's very, you know, close.

375
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,980
Everything's connected.

376
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,940
So to speak.

377
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,380
Yes, it's a fragile net of life.

378
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,300
But like some people said, well, I don't like seafood anyway.

379
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,220
They're going to be losing a lot more than Cajun shrimp.

380
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:59,260
Well, you know, it's the bacteria in the water kind of helps keep oxygen in the air.

381
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,880
As long as there's some water.

382
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,020
It kind of helps keep...

383
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,300
...the rain from being turned into tar.

384
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,240
Or rivers of blood.

385
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,880
The Bible talked about the sea would turn the color of blood.

386
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,000
And it has.

387
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,860
Indeed it has, because the toxic dispersant used to break up the oil

388
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,960
kills more fish than the oil does.

389
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,060
Doesn't it look like the end of a tampon?

390
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,620
Many, many ends of the period tampons floating around there.

391
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,740
It's the same rust color.

392
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,820
Well, you know, I saw Mother Earth was talking to God somehow backwards.

393
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,180
Nah, forget about that part.

394
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:47,040
Some know nothing said, well, blood oil is the Earth's blood.

395
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,880
But no, that's actually not the Earth's blood.

396
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,680
It would be closer to the Earth's, you know, the things in your joints.

397
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,180
Actually, it's...

398
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,660
Make it so your elbow doesn't hurt.

399
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,680
It's the Earth's zit.

400
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,000
It's the Earth's zit.

401
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,000


402
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,500
And it's the oil in the zits of the Earth.

403
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,460
And, my friend, there are some zits that man was not meant to pop.

404
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,760
It's as simple as that.

405
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,160
I want to look right down here, Carlson, and see what's...

406
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,820
Look on the map.

407
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,220
It's spread from Arizona all the way to Kingston, Norway.

408
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,300
There's thousands of them.

409
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,980
The bigger they get, the smaller we get.

410
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,680
Can't you see something has to be done tomorrow is not right?

411
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,600
Next.

412
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,100
But how do you take a leak and stop it from leaking?

413
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,400
It's a contradiction in terms.

414
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,120
Are you saying Mother Earth has a prostate problem?

415
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,720
Or perhaps they're just foolish enough to bend the wrong way?

416
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,720
Well, the interesting thing is nobody really knows how big that zit is now, do they?

417
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:00,480
They've had to admit, well, we think it goes down about three miles, but, I mean, you know,

418
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,980
when a volcano goes down...

419
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:01,980


420
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,380
When a volcano goes off, you don't know how long it's going to be spewing lava.

421
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:15,300
And when an oil volcano, a mile underwater, when that zit gets popped, well, they thought

422
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,400
it was just going to be a regular zit.

423
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,940
You know, like you see those gushers in the movies when the cowpokes drill and strike oil

424
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,760
and go eureka and everybody runs around and the three stooges get splashed around on top

425
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,240
of it.

426
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,920
Yeah, they all speak French.

427
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,340
Like balls atop a fountain.

428
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,300
But this was not what they were expecting, I don't think.

429
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,380
Now, what worries me, you know, I don't want, I get my news without television most of the

430
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,000
time, but I finally saw some movies of that oil coming up out of that hole, that big old

431
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,280
hole.

432
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,080
And I thought, that's not oil.

433
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,240
That's the smoke monster from Lost.

434
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,200
It's time.

435
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,080
And the message, obviously, Mother Nature is telling us it's okay to let go now.

436
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,740
We must let go.

437
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,740
Why did I laugh?

438
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,440
Well, actually, if you had been following Lost, you would have reason to laugh, but

439
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,200
that's okay, Dave.

440
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,240
It doesn't matter.

441
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,480
Because soon we'll all be gone.

442
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,940
Every, all of us.

443
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,000
But, you know, some people are, I've started to read quite paranoid musings about this

444
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,920
little oil vomiting.

445
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,700
If worse scenario cases were to happen, then actually by 2012, we might really.

446
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,220
Literally be done just like they say in there.

447
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,000
And who knows?

448
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,200
Maybe that's why they resurrected all these peculiar prophecies, because they were going

449
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,360
to punch a hole in the biosphere.

450
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,740
No, no, no.

451
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,120
It doesn't have nothing to do with no prophecies.

452
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,840
And besides, it's going to take longer than a 10, you know, longer than a couple of years

453
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
to destroy all life on the surface.

454
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,140
I mean, you know, and there's a good side to it.

455
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,280
No, I mean, the point of no return.

456
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,960
I mean, we might all of a sudden have to deal with much greater things.

457
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,540
Than not having Cajun shrimp.

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,560
Oh, right.

459
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,200
I mean, like not having air or water.

460
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,320
But that's the thing.

461
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,120
Now, see, for decades, people have been making sport of our towns along the Great Lakes and

462
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,960
the Rust Belt, like Detroit and Cleveland and Erie.

463
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,980
And but the good side of losing all that steel business was the lakes kind of came back to

464
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,200
a semblance of life.

465
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:29,600
And I see the death of the oceans could mean a boom here for during the whole the last

466
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,060
decade of life on Earth.

467
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,820
We that own.

468
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,320
Property near the largest inland freshwater sea on the planet will be rich.

469
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,060
But see, the thing is staying in the Great Lakes.

470
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,060
Now, there aren't the nice edible fish there used to be when I was little, when they had

471
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,100
fish and chip shops on every corner.

472
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,200
Oh, it's not that it's it's that we'll have water that doesn't kill you.

473
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,140
Water that doesn't kill will be like the most valuable resource in the world.

474
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,080
Much more valuable than gold.

475
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,440
That's true.

476
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,640
Now, see, I'm thinking I'm thinking ahead on this.

477
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,900
I'm not sure he's around here anyway.

478
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm sorry.

479
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,640
Yes.

480
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,460
Now, think about it, though.

481
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,420
We could be we could be warlords, man.

482
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,060
If we if we plan ahead, I mean, people are going to have to be flocking to to the to the

483
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,020
Great Lakes just for to get any kind of water that's not got tar in it.

484
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,320
We'd have to convert our boats into like, you know, real fast ships and we could like

485
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,740
put cool graffiti on them stuff and dress like pirates and we can raid every town all the

486
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,840
way from here to spawn to black or go all the way up.

487
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,420
Like the Lake Superior and just take booty and stuff like that.

488
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,520
Well, I've got my warlord fortress picked out, man.

489
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,900
And I'm going to tell I'm going to tell everybody where to go when the end times come, when

490
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:50,700
the Econo cataclysm hits the salt mines of Cleveland under Lake Erie.

491
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,640
That's where I'm going to be, too.

492
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,820
I'm going to be wearing a commissar suit from the 1950s and a pair of Brigitte's underpants.

493
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm going to be singing some sort of Eurasian.

494
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,900
Song from a nipple ring saloon or something.

495
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,120
I think I'm repeating myself, but I'm going to be pretty happy despite the fact that the

496
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,680
world's going up and down in flames.

497
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
I hadn't even thought about my uniform.

498
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,800
I think I should make one inspired by Kaiser Wilhelm's uniform.

499
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,520
It's popular throughout the generation.

500
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,820
I mean, think it's been 100 years and the look with the weird pointy thing on the top

501
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,180
of the hat and the big handlebar mustache is still big and good to go.

502
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,000
So I don't.

503
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,560
Yeah, I go along with that.

504
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,380
But really think about the salt mines, man.

505
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,220
It's like miles of weird, surreal underground tunnels, impervious to bunker busters.

506
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,260
Do you think they are better than Saddam's much vaunted berms?

507
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,720
And there's always plenty of salt for the barbecue.

508
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,760
I mean, you know, you'd have to worry about other stuff like actual fresh food to eat

509
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,960
to put the salt on.

510
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,780
Well, we just have to open the valve in the roof and let some of the water in.

511
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,600
Now, of course, you've got to boil it and filter it.

512
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,740
But we're drinking that stuff anyway.

513
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,000
Well, we're free.

514
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,400
I don't know about you, but I am.

515
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,380
I drink straight Cleveland City water.

516
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,760
That's all a vaccination I need.

517
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,140
Does it come from a lake or a reservoir?

518
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,740
Well, it actually.

519
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,220
Does it come from near Akron?

520
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,960
I don't know where it comes from.

521
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,120
I don't have the slightest idea.

522
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,240
I guess it's the water near Akron in that big reservoir area there.

523
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,860
Oh, that's good.

524
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,660
Over all the rubber, toxic waste from the rubber plants.

525
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,560
That explains Devo.

526
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,360
And Paul Navratis and all those other weirdos that came from Akron.

527
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,080
And the fact that they're short and stocky and their knuckles drag on the ground.

528
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Are we not men?

529
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,260
Well, maybe.

530
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,600
Probably made of rubber, yeah.

531
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,800
Visc queen men or viscators.

532
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,340
But you know, in the Book of the Subgenius, we told everybody when the end times come

533
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,780
to go to the Swiss Avenue neighborhood in Dallas, which actually was where I used to live

534
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,580
because I was going to be a big warlord then.

535
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
But you know, there's nobody there but a bunch of normals now.

536
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,040
So the new subgenius warlord territory, Cleveland salt mines.

537
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,840
And that's where all subgeniuses should fight their way to when push comes to shove.

538
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,940
And knife comes to gun and so forth.

539
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,060
I think it should be not only a website.

540
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,920
I think it should be a post office box.

541
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,680
I think people should inquire within, you know, if they're like pseudosophists or something like that.

542
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
And I think that they should.

543
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,960
Keep their eyes open for what's going to happen next.

544
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,320
What will happen next?

545
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,740
Well, you know.

546
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,140
Henry?

547
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,840
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,900
Excuse me.

549
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,760
Are you?

550
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,820
I'm excited by all this doom and gloom.

551
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,300
You know, this is the kind of thing subgenius, pornography for subgeniuses.

552
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,640
It's a little harder to move around, but I agree completely.

553
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,620
I plan.

554
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,860
I've got three weird crypt like little vassal slappers around my house.

555
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,640
I also installed one of those neck and scurvy devices that electrocutes the children if they get too close.

556
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,240
A lot of them been pushing their little girl cookies or whatever they call them around my house.

557
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,300
And I had to remove some of the stranger looking artifacts I keep out in front.

558
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,320
But this mostly keep away the pink.

559
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,320
Those cookies aren't really made of little girls, you know.

560
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,520
Well, that's, you know, it's an observer created reality, isn't it saying?

561
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,100
No.

562
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,840
If I want them to be, perhaps, maybe they might be.

563
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,840
No.

564
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,560
Only to you.

565
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,420
It's a yeah.

566
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:46,860
It's a yeah.

567
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,140
Whatever.

568
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,780
Observer created reality.

569
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,340
Right.

570
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,500
Give me all your money.

571
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,860
Well, that's the point of it.

572
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,580
Now, people that live in the Pacific, they're probably laughing at those poor Atlantic coast dwellers.

573
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,820
Who are going to soon enough have black stuff coming out of their water faucets.

574
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,240
But think about those Pacific folks.

575
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,220
If they aren't killed in the rash of tsunamis, it's going to be lava pouring out of their faucets.

576
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,840
When everything underneath the Ring of Fire and Yosemite National Park all go off at once.

577
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,020
Cool.

578
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, yeah.

579
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,940
Let's go to Crater Lake for the weekend.

580
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,560
And Crater Lake comes to you for the rest of Thursday.

581
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:28,940
Right.

582
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,440
Between, there'll be like volcanic.

583
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,760
Nuclear winter.

584
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,160
And the death of all the plankton in the oceans.

585
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,020
And then next day, it'll be here.

586
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,340
And we won't have to worry about it.

587
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,000
It's coming.

588
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,480
It's coming.

589
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,280
It's coming very soon.

590
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:49,540
Think of when the San Andreas Falls not only shifts but drops to three meters that it was predicted to drift by this point in time.

591
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,060
And it still hasn't done it yet.

592
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,480
It could go on a big, massive, massive sploosh just like that.

593
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,100
And plus, there's thousands of oil wells off this California coast.

594
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,020
And nobody knows about it because they haven't spilled yet.

595
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,980
But they will be.

596
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,080
And then there's the hurricanes.

597
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:16,940
You know, because they're going to have all those other oil drilling facilities to try to let off the pressure of the giant zit in the Gulf.

598
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,120
And then the hurricanes will hit.

599
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,460
I think hurricane season starts next week.

600
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,660
Well, what if it starts bubbling up the subatomic stews within the planktons and the phytoplanktons?

601
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,380
And then...

602
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,120
And all my little microscopic buddies.

603
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm not too worried about them, to tell the truth, Dave.

604
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,900
Because I know my planktons.

605
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,640
And they'll bounce back quick.

606
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,600
You know, it'll be after a century or two.

607
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,440
They'll adjust and be able to live in petroleum water.

608
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,920
It might take a little bit longer for the vertebrates.

609
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,400
And longer, you know, a million, two million years.

610
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,560
And a little longer than that for tool users.

611
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,680
150 million.

612
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:01,980
150 million years.

613
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,180
But, hey, you know.

614
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,440
We now know that millions and millions of years ago, this area was a vast sea of oil.

615
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,200
Inhabited by...

616
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,800
These cockroaches.

617
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:30,200
Cockroach paleontologists will be going, yes, this beautiful land that we live in now was once an ocean of oil.

618
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,660
We will leave no trace.

619
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,520
Maybe they might find a femur bone in the vast sea of oil that had become like the San...

620
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,580
The La Brea Tar Pitch.

621
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
Because that's what it used to be and so forth.

622
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,480
Well, they'll...

623
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,660
If they're anything like people, they'll interpret the ancient fossilized human bone as...

624
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,100
These huge cold-blooded creatures were too slow and heavy to live on the land.

625
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,100
So they could only live in these oceans of oil.

626
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,320
For otherwise...

627
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,100
Their bones were so heavy.

628
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,380
Gravity alone would have crushed them.

629
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,560
I thought they'd be repushing and regurgitating.

630
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:19,460
It is true and a known fact that Adam and Eve and Santa Claus cavorted with many Pleistocene dinosaurs and so forth.

631
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,340
You know, they'd be saying that.

632
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,060
They are saying that in Texas.

633
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,260
In fact, they teach that in Texas schools now.

634
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,320
And pretty soon, they'll be teaching it everywhere.

635
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,520
That is true.

636
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,080
Jesus rode a dinosaur.

637
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,440
That is true, though.

638
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,580
Isn't it someplace in Texas they were saying that Jesus cohabitated with dinosaurs?

639
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,500
In fact, in Stang County, there is a creationist museum.

640
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:45,960
No, that part's not true.

641
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,700
No, there is.

642
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,200
There's a creationist museum in Stang County.

643
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,560
It's run by Dr. Baugh is his name.

644
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,640
And he has a special hyperbaric chamber that demonstrates what the atmosphere was like

645
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,780
when the Earth's...

646
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,380
Atmosphere was covered by a gigantic 10-mile-thick shell of ice.

647
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,300
Ice?

648
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,440
Yes, ice.

649
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:17,040
And 10-feet-thick shell of ice is what protected the creatures of the Earth in the Garden of Eden

650
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,240
from the horrible, horrible radiation of the sun.

651
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,580
And that's why, in the olden days, why people lived to be 900 years old.

652
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,740
There was giants in the Earth in them days.

653
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,660
Now, seriously, I mean, you can go to a museum.

654
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,340
There's a museum not far from Stang Ranch in Stang County, Stangsville, Texas.

655
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,620
And right down the road from the dinosaur park, there is a creationist park that will show you...

656
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,660
They even have Yeti tracks.

657
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,940
They call them giant man tracks.

658
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:54,640
But it proves that the Yeti came and accidentally wiped out the dinosaurs on a picnic.

659
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,600
Too bad.

660
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,000
It's kind of a bummer.

661
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,400
But, hey, like we say, we'll be the dinosaurs to the cockroaches.

662
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,120
And mollusks that inherit the planet.

663
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,700
The heat vent worms that won't be affected by the oil,

664
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:15,880
because they already live off of toxic, non-oxygenated chemicals pouring out of the Earth.

665
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,560
Yes.

666
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,640
I mean, my little plankton buddies can adjust to anything.

667
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,020
Most of them will die, but they'll bounce back.

668
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,100
A little changed, mayhap.

669
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,220
Are the ones in your laboratory...

670
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,260
Are the ones in your laboratory...

671
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Are you feeling some sort of cosmozypic, a form of psychosociopathic nostril...

672
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,600
Well, I've noticed...

673
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,000
A sympathetic wave, that's it, of all those creatures dying in the glove.

674
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,440
I think so.

675
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,460
I've noticed...

676
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,680
I always see the same little fella, Stubby.

677
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,300
He seems to jump from sample to sample.

678
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,220
Stubby is a...

679
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,060
I think he's a Proalis rotifer.

680
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,280
But he definitely looks...

681
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:01,940
He looks nervous.

682
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,940
He's worried.

683
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,520
You can see the inside of his stomach, and it's constantly roiling and turning and twisting.

684
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,980
So he doesn't look happy.

685
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,000
I think he's been watching the news, and he's worried.

686
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,620
And our Newt hasn't been eating as well lately.

687
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,160
Well, I...

688
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,720
But I did notice, and I believe that.

689
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:29,540
I did notice three very strange stories in the news near where I live, on Lake Erie.

690
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,560
There was a huge smelt kill.

691
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,800
On the beach.

692
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,820
The whole beach for, you know, about a quarter of a mile long, about six inches, was just filled with all these dead smelt.

693
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:48,320
And at the same day, there was a freshwater lake in the county, which has a festival where people go fishing and stuff like that.

694
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,340
It's big enough to have a bridge that goes to Pennsylvania and stuff like that.

695
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,020
And they said all the species were dying, especially the one that the festival's named after.

696
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:58,980
Oh.

697
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,500
And then...

698
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,640
Well, so much for my plan for being ready.

699
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,880
Stretch after the oceans die.

700
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:14,800
And then, right near where some friends of ours live in this same On the Lakes area, in a very unusual place, they spotted 100,000 honeybees.

701
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,140
And they were screwing things up, and people were having accidents or something like that.

702
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:27,760
And they had to call in a bunch of, you know, apiary guys and stuff like that.

703
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,460
And the idea is that maybe...

704
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,620
Some of them...

705
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:31,620


706
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:37,520
Some of these bees that are leaving the hives and they don't know where they're going, they're becoming wild because the hives are toxic to them.

707
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,480
Or the conditions.

708
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,280
They find the most wild conditions they can.

709
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,560
They were living in a big old pine tree.

710
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,580
Hmm.

711
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,240
Hmm.

712
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,520
100,000 bees, you say?

713
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,800
Man, I missed...

714
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,940
Whoever counted those must have been able to count fast.

715
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:53,920
Yeah.

716
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,980
Look at that.

717
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,620
When do you think...

718
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,160
You...

719
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,780
Yeah.

720
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,240
Yeah.

721
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,920
It's like the figures of the litre.

722
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,500
Of oil gushing up from our wounded nephew, Earth's hysterectomy scar.

723
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,660
It's a sad thing to think that...

724
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,400
I don't know.

725
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm just going to shut up for the next three days.

726
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,900
Well, we...

727
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,140
You know, we grew up thinking the world was going to end, but it was nuclear war when we was kids.

728
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,360
And we really thought that.

729
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,160
I guess these kids now...

730
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,660
They must think it's going to end from something.

731
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,460
But they...

732
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,480
They've got it all backwards.

733
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,020
It won't...

734
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,460
It won't be the oil vomitous.

735
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,200
It won't be nuclear war.

736
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,780
It won't be overpopulation.

737
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,720
It'll be the exes from...

738
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,780
The men from Planet X.

739
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:50,100
They will come and slay all who have not joined the church of the subgenius by doing the right thing.

740
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,000
I can't...

741
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,800
I'm not going to go into any details because this is not a commercial station.

742
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,720
Oddly enough, if it was a commercial station, we could cuss and spam.

743
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,320
And advertise ourselves.

744
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,740
Subvert truth and promote disinformation.

745
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,520
Right, right.

746
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,560
Which we do anyway, but we're...

747
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,260
But we're not getting paid for it.

748
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,520
Dang!

749
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,800
You know...

750
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,320
You know, sometimes I think I'm in the wrong religion.

751
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:24,400
Because I read that the mistresses of a lot of Catholic priests have formed a union and they're requesting the end of celibacy.

752
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,220
And that's just the opposite.

753
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,300
Because my mistresses in subgenius church want me...

754
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,720
Promote health.

755
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,440
Yeah, they want me to become...

756
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,000
Well, they just don't want your progeny...

757
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,840
Don't get it.

758
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,540
They don't want any more of your mature progeny to spring forth upon...

759
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,780
You've already done enough damage with what you've done.

760
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,680
I mean, think if there were many other stangs around doing your bidding.

761
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,960
Enslaving the masses with your mind and so forth.

762
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,760
That would be inequitous to most of the...

763
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,840
Injurious to most of the populace.

764
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,800
Well, it hadn't hurt the Catholics, though.

765
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,040
I read just this afternoon that before the Pope was the Pope...

766
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,440
He was the Pope.

767
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,440


768
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,440


769
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,440


770
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,680
He approved the child molesting, but only for priests who didn't want to stop child molesting.

771
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:18,260
If a priest wanted to quit being a priest and quit molesting children, then the Pope, the now Pope, would make him quit being priest.

772
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,700
But if they wanted to continue being priests, if they really wanted to keep molesting children, he said that was okay.

773
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,660
And he's the Pope now, and he's infallible by definition, right?

774
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,440
So that kind of makes it...

775
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:41,920
It's an explicit official Catholic doctrine that as long as a priest wants to continue to be a child molesting priest, you know, then that's okay.

776
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,240
It's only the ones who want to stop that it's okay for them to stop.

777
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,820
It's like the obverse of the old, have you stopped hitting your wife?

778
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,420
It's only something more obverse and abstruse and obtuse.

779
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,020
But, you know, he may have also been a card saluting...

780
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,820
He was a fungus-raising Millerite in the days of his youth, his Hitler youth.

781
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,040
The Pope?

782
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,780
Pope Braco?

783
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,360
He came out of nowhere all of a sudden.

784
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:20,020
I mean, they were going to elect some bishop from Africa for the first time, and everybody wanted him, and suddenly they came up with this guy.

785
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,480
A former Nazi.

786
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,220
Yeah.

787
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,100
Who approved of child molesting as long as, you know, it was...

788
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,160
As long as it was consensual on the part of the priest.

789
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,920
And the philoplankton, yeah.

790
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
I don't know.

791
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,060
That's why you are what you are and why it is what it is.

792
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,360
I mean, this planet is not ripe.

793
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,680
I mean, it's ripe, but it's not ripe.

794
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,320
It's ripe to be sprayed for tool users.

795
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,080
That's what I keep hearing from the voices in my head.

796
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,820
Well, some of the voices in your head, you know, are just implants and stuff, but we're all tool users.

797
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,920
I mean, even, I mean, think monkeys are tool...

798
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,160
They just figured it out.

799
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,040
Well, you know what I mean.

800
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,620
Big time tool users.

801
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,040
Right.

802
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,960
That's what I was...

803
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,360
I don't mean poking a straw down an anthill so you can lick the ants off the stick.

804
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,380
That's not what I mean.

805
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,380
No, you mean being able to destroy a whole ecosystem.

806
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,440
And I understand that chimpanzees can club each other to death, but right.

807
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,400
They can't destroy a whole ecosystem.

808
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,440
They couldn't even start to.

809
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:25,960
Yeah.

810
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,440
I guess you're right.

811
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,980
We don't deserve to be on this planet.

812
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,020
The good of us.

813
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,300
No, we do deserve.

814
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,620
We're the ones who deserve.

815
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,860
We have the right to destroy everything.

816
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,180
We're like the Tyrannosaurus.

817
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,240
Of course, they're all dead.

818
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,620
Wrong dead.

819
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,800
Yeah.

820
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,820
So if you have...

821
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,920
And we eat their descendants at Kentucky Fried Chicken or whatever they call that place now.

822
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,980
Yeah.

823
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,220
I mean, that's a fitting, quite a fitting fate for them.

824
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:00,920
They used to run us around when we looked like weird marmosets and animals.

825
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,380
Like that.

826
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,960
Well, you know, Princess Wee is so sweet.

827
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,880
And she's not here tonight, by the way, because she had to sing in New York.

828
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:16,600
But she used to kind of feel guilty about eating innocent little chickens by the dozens every month.

829
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:25,680
And then I showed her one of those walking with dinosaurs specials, only it was after the dinosaurs.

830
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,440
And it was about the age of giant birds, which doesn't get as much publicity.

831
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,140
Yeah.

832
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,800
As dinosaurs.

833
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,320
Because they're not as big and cool as dinosaurs.

834
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:44,940
But for several millions of years, giant chickens ate our ancestors by the billions.

835
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,340
And made millions upon millions of years.

836
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,620
Now, how long have we been eating chickens?

837
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,700
Only about a million years.

838
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,220
Because we've only been chicken pluckers for about that long.

839
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,800
I feel so much better already.

840
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,480
Yeah.

841
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,960
I'm glad I'm getting even on those sons of bitches.

842
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:58,620
It's payback.

843
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,240
It is payback.

844
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,780
And in fact, somebody...

845
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,240
There was a Tyrannosaurus bone that was found that had...

846
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,000
It was in such great condition that the very core of the marrow hadn't turned to rock.

847
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,300
And it had little fragments of DNA in there.

848
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,620
And the closest thing it was to in the modern world was a chicken.

849
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,440
So, in other words, a Tyrannosaurus rex would taste like chicken.

850
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:27,220
And when they were wiped out, the littler dinosaurs grew to be giant bird things.

851
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,940
I mean, really big bird things.

852
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,180
And our people were just little ratty things and doggy type things.

853
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,880
Lemurs and shrewish things.

854
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,380
And we were the KFC for giant birds for a long, long time.

855
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,900
So, that means it's okay to eat animals.

856
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,380
That's all I'm saying.

857
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,180
Right.

858
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,640
And that's why when you take a bite of a lemur or a marmoset and your mouth feels funny.

859
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,620
It's like there's too many crunchy bones.

860
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,000
But it's really your conscience saying, you're eating your great-great-grandpa.

861
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,080
Well, that's the thing.

862
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,280
But when you eat a chicken, you say, I'm eating the enemy.

863
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,040
Right.

864
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,740
Exactly.

865
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,900
Yeah, I wouldn't eat.

866
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,860
I could never eat a primate.

867
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,280
A fellow primate.

868
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:20,720
Not even a big, juicy chimpanzee with watery brown eyes and a nice pair of earrings and bowling ball earrings.

869
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,460
I am.

870
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,000
Cut into a big old flank of mountain gorilla.

871
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,400
And nothing like mountain gorilla.

872
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,340
Nice and rare.

873
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,340
Gorilla chops.

874
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,200
You cut their spine lengthwise into little chunks.

875
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,700
Barbecue it up.

876
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,860
Okay.

877
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,500
Well.

878
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,580
Well, we've solved one problem anyway.

879
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,420
The problem of eating the right foods.

880
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:53,620
Americans and all people around the globe should know enough to eat chicken every day.

881
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,940
Karma takes a long time to work itself out.

882
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,040
But when it does, it's lip-smacking good.

883
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:11,420
Well, and every phylum or genus gets its time in the sun at some point or another.

884
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,680
Right now, it's the humans.

885
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,520
I'm sure that our time is coming swiftly to an end, much like this show.

886
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:25,580
Actually, you know, I worry that the time for humans isn't anywhere near coming to an end because they're so resilient.

887
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:25,860
Of course.

888
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,580
However, eventually, of course, we might devolve.

889
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:40,800
And while replacing all the other creatures, our descendants will fill the niche that those creatures used to fill.

890
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:45,760
For instance, there'll be little tiny mole people that are blind and live underground.

891
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,820
And there'll be chicken people who peck at the ground and eat worms.

892
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,520
Exactly.

893
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,440
You know.

894
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,080
And once again, the cycle will start and I will wonder again who's going to be eating us.

895
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,020
Who...

896
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,420
What...

897
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,400
Whether it'll be...

898
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,760
A large...

899
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,420
You know, it can't just be another large chicken.

900
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,300
Yeah, that's been done.

901
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,640
Been there, done that.

902
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,180
That would really make...

903
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,620
Take a lot of the hope out of life.

904
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,840
Knowing that the endless cycles of billions of years and aeons that the Hindus often re...

905
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,180
Oh, no.

906
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,240
I know what it'll be.

907
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,980
Cephalopods.

908
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,500
Squid.

909
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,060
And octopi.

910
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:30,380
They will be the new tool user of violent, world-conquering, oil-spill-causing...

911
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,860
Right.

912
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,020
Zip-popping monsters.

913
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,500
We will have developed bodies that will be able to swim around aimlessly in a vast sea of petroleum.

914
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,740
And there will be these huge squids that keep eating our young all the time.

915
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:41,960
Right.

916
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,900
And that's what we've got to look forward to.

917
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,500
They'll fish for us.

918
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:46,780
Yeah.

919
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,020
Mm-hmm.

920
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,760
Mm-hmm.

921
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:58,880
They'll cast these nets from the briny, well, oily deeps up to the surface and catch those of us on our descendants that are floating around.

922
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,380
And, of course, you can...

923
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,660
You can float pretty well on top of thick, viscous stuff like oil.

924
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,020
And it's...

925
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,560
And the other thing is it's flammable.

926
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,680
You know, you can stay warm pretty easily if you can just stay ahead of...

927
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,080
You can paddle and row fast enough to stay ahead of the fire.

928
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:26,720
And if they were impervious, these giant squid, if they were impervious enough to fire, they could perhaps even spit fire at us as we were floundering around in the water and just french fries and eat us.

929
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,140
There you go.

930
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,080
You know, come in and just swallow us all in one big...

931
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,140
Like it's their banquet.

932
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,780
Fire-breathing oil squid.

933
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,660
Mm-hmm.

934
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,580
Sea dragons.

935
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,540
Mm-hmm.

936
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,860
See, the prophecies of old and the prophecies of the recent times are still stupid.

937
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,220
Praise Bob.

938
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,500
And that's why it's called subgenius.

939
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,920
That's what it's all about, baby.

940
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:51,660
You don't want to climb no higher than that because if you did, you'll know too much and it'll hurt real bad.

941
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,060
We're the...

942
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,580
We're the midgets of thought, you might say.

943
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,800
It's so much easier that way.

944
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,140
Yeah.

945
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,120
But at least we're standing.

946
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,740
We're standing on a firm...

947
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,700
We're humping on the backs of the necks of giants.

948
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,400
And on three legs.

949
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,300
Giant squids.

950
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,620
A tripod with six eyes and three squids.

951
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:13,900
Ah.

952
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,200
Ah.

953
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:23,480
This background music, by the way, is classic universal horror movie music by Hans Salter

954
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,140
and B.F. Skinner, the great behaviorist.

955
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,600
Yes.

956
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
I don't know what he zapped him.

957
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,080
He zapped Salter any time he didn't like the notes he was playing.

958
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,100
He was peppier than Salter was.

959
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,960
And so he would do the little happy parts and Salter would do the...

960
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,100
The...

961
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,320
The...

962
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,980
The dry parts.

963
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,760
The parts where the monkey does...

964
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,000
The parts...

965
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,100
Pushes the wrong button.

966
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,020
The parts that need it.

967
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,660
And the peanut doesn't come out.

968
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,280
An eye comes out with a distended foot.

969
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:54,960
No.

970
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,040
I don't understand.

971
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,460
B.F. Skinner was actually...

972
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,780
Was he a composer?

973
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,320
Well, it was some Skinner.

974
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,160
Maybe it was Mule Skinner.

975
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:04,580
I don't know.

976
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:04,940
Yeah.

977
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,860
Maybe it was Rabbit Skinner.

978
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,500
Yeah.

979
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,900
You ever skin a rabbit, Dave?

980
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,720
No.

981
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,180
I've argued with one, though.

982
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,020
But I got six months in...

983
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,280
I think it was 11...

984
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,100
No, I got 12 months in...

985
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,140
Sing Sing?

986
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:21,820
No.

987
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,400
Alcatraz?

988
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:22,920
No.

989
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,360
It starts with...

990
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,060
Oh, in my house.

991
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:27,520
Oh.

992
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,380
Ha ha ha.

993
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,860
But that still doesn't answer the problem.

994
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:42,020
And men and women, humankind, will be forced to seek these solutions for many, many, many, many years to come, I think.

995
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,040
Don't you?

996
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,860
I'm just looking for, you know, someone to agree with me.

997
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,580
Aren't we all...

998
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:56,120
Aren't we all just seeking someone to agree with us and touch us down there?

999
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,840
In the right places.

1000
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,720
A message of hope.

1001
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,840
Just a little glimmering of...

1002
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,380
Just the slightest tickle, that's all we ask.

1003
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,500
Have you ever seen...

1004
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,780
A warm hand resting in the right place could mean so much.

1005
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,120
You can tell Princess Wee's out of town.

1006
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,840
Crawling the walls, huh?

1007
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,300
Looking for something to, you know...

1008
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,380
Actually, I've spent...

1009
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,240
I spent yesterday fighting...

1010
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:27,480
Fighting...

1011
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,360
Fighting...

1012
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:28,360


1013
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:28,360


1014
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,160
For a distant computer program.

1015
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,400
The one that puts this show on a podcast, in fact.

1016
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,240
Did you actually have fisticuffs with the people who run the lobotomy area, or...

1017
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,400
So far, I've managed to be polite to them, but that's only because I...

1018
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,760
Their forum doesn't recognize any of my user login names.

1019
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:57,440
Well, you should wear a toga then and pretend to be a Sophocles or somebody, you know.

1020
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,300
If the forum doesn't...

1021
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,220
want to accept you, you could say, look, I don't accept you. Let's go and fight

1022
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,400
the Persians, you know. These internet forums aren't like the ancient Greek forum

1023
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,160
though. They're not so civilized.

1024
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,020
The ancient Greek forums weren't perpetual flame

1025
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:18,280
wars, were they? Well, no, but you do get an image

1026
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,960
in your mind often of those two weird masks, the one that's

1027
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,500
frowning and the one that's smiling.

1028
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,020
Oh, the happy Bob and the angry Bob?

1029
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,200
Yeah. I guess they're in Japanese art too.

1030
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,980
The hugumu. I forget what they're called.

1031
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,040
There's good Bob and there's bad Bob. There's real Bob

1032
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,220
and there's a suit of Bob. There's a real suit of Bob and there's a bad Bob

1033
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,440
and a real Bob. There's Bob the Bob and a Nick Bob

1034
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,920
and a Sally Bob.

1035
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,800
Smelly, smelly Bob.

1036
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,940
Praise the, praise the hub.

1037
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,320
We're getting, finally, we're getting religious again on this religious radio

1038
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,080
broadcast, the hour of slack, which like the planet Earth and its

1039
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,420
biosphere is swiftly coming to an end.

1040
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,760
Need you to wake up and smell the funeral flowers.

1041
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,020
It's time to say goodbye and

1042
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:22,080
hear from planet Earth. I'm Tim Smores. This is speaking

1043
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,060
with the Reverend.

1044
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:28,440
Ovens over snakes of the Church of the disgruntled person.

1045
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,680
And now it says here in the

1046
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,600
dis and the the oomph page I have in front of my

1047
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,920
did you on the night of June 24th, 2007

1048
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,980
say to an AP photographer

1049
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,220
that you needed your eyebrows plucked?

1050
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,700
No, I said I needed my eye socket.

1051
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,220
Well, it sounds like plucked, but I couldn't.

1052
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:53,700
I can't.

1053
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,740
It rhymes with plucked.

1054
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,560
Oh, no, I needed my eye.

1055
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,680
I needed the I had to remove the glass.

1056
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,860
I lube up the let's just leave it at that.

1057
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,940
And we must leave this show at that.

1058
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,420
I have to put on some sort of music.

1059
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,500
Earlier we were talking about the evolution of man that Jonathan

1060
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,580
Colton song was about the evolving.

1061
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,520
And I've got a Rudy Schwartz project

1062
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,100
tune here, which I think can.

1063
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:23,920
Carry us out

1064
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,520
and carry us away.

1065
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,940
Yes, yes.

1066
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,480
Called a career in real estate.

1067
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,560
Well, and it's a nightmarish song, actually.

1068
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,500
I'm on my way to go for it right now.

1069
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,040
And so, Dave, thank you.

1070
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,660
So staying. Thank you.

1071
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,080
Thank you. And thank you.

1072
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,540
And thank you once again.

1073
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,080
Remember, the future is in

1074
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,780
future is now.

1075
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
The future is in.

1076
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,600
The future is in gold.

1077
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,660
It's in real estate.

1078
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,120
Man, it's in a golf properties.

1079
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,280
The future is in poison.

1080
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,580
Uruguay and armpits.

1081
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,800
Oh, I can't remember what the future is.

1082
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,040
And that is all.

1083
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,800
So you see, Mr. Wilson, not only is it a beautiful home,

1084
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,480
but when you consider the tax advantage of owning your own home,

1085
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,580
it just makes economic sense to buy as soon as you can afford to get the better.

1086
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,080
Oh, I guess you're right.

1087
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,420
Sure. It's paying rent.

1088
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,440
This now building equity instead of just throwing money away.

1089
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,240
You'll really be happy when you see that you're getting something back on your investment instead of giving mine to your landlord.

1090
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,260
Sounds great. But let me go home and talk about with my wife before I decide.

1091
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,180
OK, but I can't guarantee it'll be around much longer.

1092
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,020
I had another couple here looking at it just this morning.

1093
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,400
They seem very interested.

1094
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,840
Let me have a little more grease.

1095
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,540
I'll let you know first thing in the morning.

1096
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,940
Did you get a contract written by her?

1097
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,280
Sure thing.

1098
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,200
Now, then, let's talk about it.

1099
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,860
Let's talk about financing.

1100
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,520
I'd like to recommend that you make the purchase through our mortgage company.

1101
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,520
Oh, sorry, Torsten's clean.

1102
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,100
I can assure you that they're extremely reputable.

1103
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,080
That's fine, but we'd like to keep our payments as low as possible.

1104
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,040
Well, in that case, we can set you up with a negative amortization loan.

1105
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,880
So take the initial insertion of the payments at a bare minimum.

1106
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,020
That'll be fine.

1107
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,500
I'd also like to make sure the plumbing's fixed before we move in.

1108
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:23,680
Don't worry.

1109
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,860
You have my personal assurance that all repairs will be completed by closing time.

1110
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,700
Why don't you pull up your trousers and we'll drop all the necessary forms.

1111
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,800
Thanks for watching.

1112
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,860
I'll see you next time.

1113
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:36,980


1114
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:36,980


1115
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,520
Bye.

1116
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:38,520
Bye.

1117
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,360
Bye.

1118
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:40,840
Bye.

1119
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:40,840


1120
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,280
Bye.

1121
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:41,280


1122
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:41,280


1123
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,160
Bye.

1124
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:42,180


1125
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:42,560
Bye.

1126
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,900
Bye.

1127
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:44,120
Bye.

1128
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,120


1129
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,280
Bye.

1130
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:44,800
Bye.

1131
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,780
Bye.

1132
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:47,780


1133
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:47,780


1134
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:47,780


1135
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:47,780


1136
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:47,780


1137
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:47,860
Bye.
