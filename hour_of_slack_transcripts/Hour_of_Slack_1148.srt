1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm being punished for speaking out against authorities.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,040
Barack Obama and John McCain are false.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,760
John McCain at a rally in Columbus, Ohio.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,300
Obama in Hawaii.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,740
Hillary Clinton on March 4th.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,320
President Bush in Africa.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,980
Mr. Bush in Africa is not the same as a military base.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,740
We contemplate adding new bases.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,300
In other words, this is baloney.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,220
Or as we say in Texas, that's a big military base.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,640
Mr. Bush visits Liberia with the exception of Liberia.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
The opposition in Kenya was up a bigger than expected four-tenths of one percent last month,

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,420
reflecting increases in the cost of food, health care, and PR news.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,120
In Iraq, a powerful Shiite cleric says he may expire as soon as this weekend.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,060
Vasily Alexanyan, tax fraud, AIDS, and cancer, blind and needs life.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,100
His lawyers chained to a toilet.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,660
Lawyers being treated like dismantled animals and denied proper PR news.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,540
Moscow.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,320
The Labor Department says this is PR news.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
From Washington.

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,200
PR Today.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,240
It is the subgeneration of slack.

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:20,980
Order!

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,020
Order!

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,540
Order!

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,060
Now!

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,420
I will not accept aהоль,심 Mot'rára'rán that has nothing to offer to toughen up the

28
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,420


29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
We respect it.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,240
Hence we have ghosted a woman with eye drops.

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,820
We hated her for receiving refused grants until today, on November 3rd.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,760
And we couldn't gather the original本 under the personellense mandate.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,260
Ms.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:56,160
veya η twiceâte班 yay'h.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,880
and, oh no, one religious fanatic. Constable Visit saluted.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,760
Permission to speak, sir? Go ahead, mumbled Vimes. I'm pleased to tell you, sir, that our mission is

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,900
clearly divinely approved of, sir. I refer to the rain of sardines which sustained us in our

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,740
extremity, sir. We were a little hungry. I wouldn't say we were in extremity.

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,540
With respect, sir, said Constable Visit firmly, the pattern is firmly established, sir.

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,300
Yes, indeed. The psychulites, when being pursued in the wilderness by the forces of

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:38,160
Oflarian mytholites, sir, were sustained by a rain of celestial biscuits, sir. Chocolate ones, sir.

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,400
Perfectly normal phenomenon, muttered Constable Shue, probably swept up by the wind,

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,940
passing a baker's shop. Visit glared at him and went on, and the Murmurians,

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,020
when driven into the mountains by the tribes of Mishmik,

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,420
would not have survived.

46
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,160
But for a magical rain of elephants, sir.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,320
Elephants? Well, one elephant, sir, Visit conceded, but it splashed.

48
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,860
Perfectly normal phenomenon, said Constable Shue. Probably an elephant was picked up by a freak.

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,400
And when they were thirsty in the desert, sir, the four tribes of Canli were suckered

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,180
by a sudden and supernatural rain of rain, sir.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,380
A rain of rain, said Vimes, almost mesmerized by,

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:55,400
That was from the audiobook of Terry Pratchett's wonderful novel, Jenga. This Hour of Slack has a general theme of religion, my friends.

54
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,720
And so we'll hear the appropriate clips from recent shows, such as the Winter Star Symposium preaching,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,740
Season in Hell from San Francisco,

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,540
superb Limeur cut-ups, as heard at the start,

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,700
and Aurelian collages to follow,

58
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,100
and the puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley,

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,700
where at first, even Dr. Howell was at a loss.

60
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,900
Oh my, well, I really don't know what to do now.

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm, uh, I'm probably, uh...

62
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,760
That music's too loud, puzzling evidence.

63
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,860
It is?

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,300
I can't hear Dr. Howell properly over that sappy music.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,320
That's...

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Think of the deaf.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,440
Doesn't anyone ever think of the deaf?

68
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,980
We do, on this show.

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,720
We have a certain portion of our show content is directed at deaf people.

70
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,240
Can you guys imagine how hard it is for me to do a radio show

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,660
when we're having total deafness now?

72
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,880
We can imagine how hard it is for me to do a radio show.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,460
Is that increasing, like Beethoven's, uh...

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,900
Getting more and more hard-o'-hearing?

75
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,060
Luckily, on this show, it doesn't make...

76
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,820
It don't make... No, never mind.

77
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,900
It would be a show idea.

78
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,500
Don't make one damn bit of difference.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
...they're all crazy.

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,380
It's there for me.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
Face me.

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,440
You can be me.

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Make the world we never know.

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Don't move it up.

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,440
Stand on the internet.

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:24,920
WTF?

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,140
What the fuck?

88
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,320
What the fuck?

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,400
What the fuck?

90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,760
What the fuck?

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:26,760


92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:26,880
What the fuck?

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:26,900
What the fuck?

94
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:26,900


95
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:26,900


96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:26,900


97
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:26,900


98
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,680
You can't imagine how many times I've had to remove or reverse you guys saying that.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,360
And you're listening to Puzzling Evidence.

100
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,440
Really?

101
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,060
We don't say it very often.

102
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,220
And you will be listening to the hour of slack.

103
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,340
Yes, you will.

104
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,800
If you'd like to be a part of us, of our broadcast right now,

105
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,320
give us a call at...

106
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,880
Unless you're driving.

107
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,520
If you're driving, just crawl in the backseat and relax.

108
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,940
That's...

109
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
For sure.

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,840
For sure.

111
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:54,860
For sure.

112
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,180
We'll take care of itself, much like you're driving.

113
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,360
First dial a one and a five and a one and a oh and then eight and then four and then eight

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
and then four and then four and then...

115
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,820
Where's this going?

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah, what is that theme?

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
We were going to do a theme, right?

118
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,720
There was going to be a theme or a skit or a sketch or a plan or a script or a note.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,380
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,700
Oh, yeah.

121
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,520
Okay, here's your script, baby.

122
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,040
Here we are driving in a car.

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,160
Driving into each other.

124
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,100
That's what we caused here on...

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
94.3.

126
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,640
Into a big hole.

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,940
If you're in one of those cars, we're sorry.

128
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,280
Simple 19th century...

129
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
Hey, man, we've got listeners in Algeria tonight.

130
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,620
Wow.

131
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:40,880
What?

132
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,320
The Moroccan...

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,300
Moroccan roll, man.

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm going to go over to the highway.

135
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,440
Oh, I know who that is.

136
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,160
I know who that is.

137
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,640
That would be the worst day ever guy.

138
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,340
Stop ex-torturing me.

139
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,340
Oh.

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,400
I used to call him...

141
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,960
Akbar because I didn't want to give away his real name.

142
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,980
Yeah.

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,800
Yeah, we get interesting e-mails at the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated headquarters.

144
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,140
However, you know, I did bring a script.

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:19,440
What I have here is the program book for last Sunday's Mission Peak Unitarian Universalist Congregation.

146
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,100
Well, I'm drilling down onto this site right now.

147
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,220
I made notes.

148
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,520
Whatever.

149
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,600
Drill down.

150
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,080
I made notes.

151
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,780
They did an inspirational show without mentioning Jesus or Jehovah.

152
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,760
Well, that in itself is inspiration.

153
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,640
And here was my comment on the Unitarian Congregation.

154
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,080
Did they wear unitards?

155
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Yeah, whatever.

156
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,360
Here's my review.

157
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,680
The word nice.

158
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,460
Nice.

159
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,340
That's nice.

160
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,920
Like Captain Nice.

161
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,640
See this gorgeous cover?

162
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,480
Actually, this listener...

163
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,080
Shot in the dark.

164
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,180
Track 14 is...

165
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,800
Brewer, Cleve, and his lush orchestra.

166
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,640
Really?

167
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,320
We have a lot of interesting people in here.

168
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,060
There's somebody else in there.

169
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,760
Oh, Mr. Lucky.

170
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,660
No, that's the same.

171
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,000
This is right outside of...

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,920
It's in Morocco, outside of Dar el-Baeda.

173
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,840
It's a neighborhood called Setat, it looks like.

174
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,660
And we have a listener in Setat tonight.

175
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,220
In Selak?

176
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,660
Hello.

177
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,300
Hello.

178
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:21,880


179
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,620
My goodness, a caller.

180
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,000
The right place to be in today's world.

181
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,360
Hello, you're on the air.

182
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,760
I zoomed in on you from a satellite view.

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,400
It was great.

184
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,520
It really felt good.

185
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,660
And if we push this one button, we can wipe you out like George Clooney, man.

186
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,660
George Clooney, man.

187
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,660
Let's not make any threats.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,840
After all, we're all...

189
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,760
Actually, it's a download going on in Setat.

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,840
You know, some...

191
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Some...

192
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,600
Ten and eight.

193
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,040
Trouble.

194
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,300
It reached a point.

195
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
It had reached a point.

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,120
Problems.

197
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,660
Ten and eight.

198
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,200
Ten and eight.

199
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,100
Didn't know what to do.

200
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,840
Didn't know what to do.

201
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,940
They went in to see the minister, and the minister said he wanted to talk to the boys by themselves.

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,180
The minister said that he wanted the eight-year-old into his office first.

203
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:12,780
He called the eight-year-old into his office, and he sat him down in a chair, and he looked at him, and he said to this eight-year-old little boy, he said,

204
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,360
Where is...

205
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,780
Where is...

206
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,200
Where is...

207
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,720
Where is...

208
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,340
And he goes into the restroom, he goes...

209
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,360
And he goes into the restroom, he goes...

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,820
Now, we're, you know, if you think about it, we're in a cult...

211
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,360
A cult...

212
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,860
A cult...

213
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,780
A cult...

214
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,880
Where is...

215
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,040
Where is...

216
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Dumber...

217
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,460
Drive-by...

218
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,040
Drive-by...

219
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,540
Stalking...

220
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,080
Stalking...

221
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,740
There...

222
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,480
Is...

223
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,060
There...

224
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,340
There...

225
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,940
There...

226
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,820
Stink...

227
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,180
Stink...

228
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,200
Um, watch this.

229
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,220
Here at the top...

230
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,480
What...

231
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:41,920
What...

232
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,280
What...

233
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,680
Mental...

234
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,100
Mental...

235
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,440
Go...

236
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,800
Go...

237
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,280

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,680
Check out...

239
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,140
Nah...

240
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,760
Big deal.

241
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
How can we really know?

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Think about it.

243
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,880
Come together.

244
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,680
Stink...

245
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:51,980
Stink...

246
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,680
Who did this?

247
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,320
Stink...

248
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,620
Stink...

249
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,260
Drive-by...

250
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,860
Drive-by...

251
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,240
Word...

252
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,800
You're gonna be...

253
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,320
Coming...

254
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,660
Coming...

255
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,000
Coming...

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,420
Nah...

257
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,720
Dumb...

258
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,780
Pretty outrageous...

259
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,900
Absurd...

260
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,420
Live...

261
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,880
Live...

262
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,560
After...

263
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,140
I wanna...

264
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,400
Be...

265
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Really...

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,780
Really high...

267
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,980
Check this out...

268
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,140
Two plus two...

269
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,100
Equals...

270
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,780
Two...

271
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,800
Two...

272
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,160
Three...

273
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Jump off...

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
I'll go down...

275
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:11,800
Yep...

276
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,620
I went down...

277
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,140
Um...

278
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,320
I went down...

279
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
When I went down, it didn't surprise any of you...

280
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,360
I went down...

281
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
I'll go down...

282
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,660
Every time...

283
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,380
Touch him...

284
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,100
Check that out...

285
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,860
I want to have a relationship...

286
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,440
I want...

287
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,000
You...

288
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,480
You...

289
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,920
You...

290
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,360
I want...

291
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,060
Me...

292
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,680
Me...

293
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,260
Me...

294
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,480
Me...

295
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,940
Me...

296
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,060
So, um...

297
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,620
Another thing that the Church of the Subgenius functions as...

298
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,020
And this is purely out of our own cruelty...

299
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:34,980
Is...

300
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,140
As a sort of...

301
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,720
Kook...

302
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,440
Flypaper...

303
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,080
Not so much the church itself...

304
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,940
But, um...

305
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,380
The internet part of the church...

306
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,100
If you ever look at our...

307
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,280
News group...

308
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,740
It's called...

309
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,000
Alt.

310
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,800
Slack...

311
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,240
It's one of the oldest news groups on the internet...

312
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,420
Because...

313
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,040
It's a church for geeks...

314
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,440
And...

315
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,800
And...

316
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,380
Among other things...

317
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,480
But it was...

318
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Really...

319
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,880
You know...

320
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,200
The spaz church of macho irony...

321
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,840
That appealed to the people who invented the computers...

322
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,140
And invent...

323
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,620
Were inventing the internet...

324
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,740
About the same time that Bob was inventing his church...

325
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,280
And, um...

326
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,820
There's this forum...

327
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,280
You can...

328
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,860
Get to using Google...

329
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,820
On your browser...

330
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,560
Just type in...

331
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:15,800
Alt.

332
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,760
Slack...

333
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,040
You'd never know that it's been there for...

334
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,280
30 years...

335
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,540
And...

336
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,180
Man...

337
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,100
It is like...

338
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,680
This...

339
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,400
You know...

340
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,600
You know how unpleasant flame wars are...

341
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
This is...

342
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,100
The flame war that never ends...

343
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,820
Because we attract...

344
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,640
The...

345
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,560
As you might...

346
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,420
Guess...

347
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,540
We attract...

348
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,220
All kinds...

349
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,020
In...

350
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,860
Uh...

351
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,100
Uh...

352
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:39,700
Uh...

353
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,940
The differently...

354
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,680
Sane...

355
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,140
We like to call it...

356
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,640
You know...

357
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
I wouldn't want to be...

358
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,920
Rude...

359
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,220
Or...

360
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Uh...

361
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,500
And, you know...

362
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,740
Why do you think they call it...

363
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,340
Sub...

364
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,180
Genius...

365
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,620
Uh...

366
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,080
So...

367
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,860
So there's a lot of...

368
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,680
What you might call...

369
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,060
Tom...

370
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,680
Cookery...

371
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,520
Going on...

372
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,400
But...

373
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,740
Uh...

374
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,260
And it's fun...

375
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,020
It's really fun...

376
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,260
To...

377
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,520

378
00:11:59,520 --> 00:11:59,940
Get...

379
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,780
To attract...

380
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,280
They...

381
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,260
My favorite...

382
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,760
Ones...

383
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,300
Are the ones that call us...

384
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,660
Satanic...

385
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,940
Masonic...

386
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,720
Jewish...

387
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,040
Conspiracy...

388
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,180
And, you know...

389
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,720
Those...

390
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,120
The...

391
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,400
The...

392
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,600
The...

393
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,560
Satan...

394
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,800
Jewish...

395
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,840
And Masonic...

396
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
Don't usually...

397
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,980
Just automatically...

398
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,120
Fall into place...

399
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,140
Except for a certain type of person...

400
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,720
And to them...

401
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
It's all the same...

402
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,580
And...

403
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:26,760
And...

404
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,060
And...

405
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,420
You know...

406
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,900
It's still just terribly obvious...

407
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,180
So...

408
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,700
The church is...

409
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Helping to...

410
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,100
Helping crazy people...

411
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,640
Make asses of themselves...

412
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,320
No...

413
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,740
Let me...

414
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,780
Let me do this right...

415
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,540
Let me do this right...

416
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,060
The church is...

417
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,160
To...

418
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,460
Crazy people...

419
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,180
Making asses of themselves...

420
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,540
What bug zappers are to bugs...

421
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,760
What matadors are to bulls...

422
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,620
And what...

423
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,160
Lucy Van Pelt...

424
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,040
With her football...

425
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,500
Was to Charlie Brown...

426
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,000
That's...

427
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,220
What we're...

428
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,860
Here for...

429
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,420
That's a nice description...

430
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,080
Don't you think...

431
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,140
Of the church...

432
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,040
Not original to me...

433
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,960
I got that from our...

434
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
Cook fly paper...

435
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,700
And...

436
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,280
Another important point about...

437
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,040
This particular religion...

438
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,660
Is unlike most of them...

439
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
And unlike...

440
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,840
Most of our fellow...

441
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,260
Cooks and crackpots...

442
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,800
We admit...

443
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,880
That we don't know everything...

444
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,980
Can you imagine that?

445
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
I mean that's really...

446
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,880
That's not much of a religion...

447
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Because part of a real religion is...

448
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
You get to feel like you know everything...

449
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Like you are so special...

450
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
That you deserve to know...

451
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,200
Why the universe is here...

452
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,400
You deserve to know what...

453
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,060
God meant for you personally...

454
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,600
Because you're so special...

455
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,580
And to God you probably are...

456
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,180
I can't...

457
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,180
I'm not gonna pretend to speak...

458
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,320
For God...

459
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,020
Because lots of people are already doing that...

460
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,600
I've noticed...

461
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,900
People feel like...

462
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,380
Poor old God can't handle his own problems...

463
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,500
They gotta take care of it themselves...

464
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,060
You know...

465
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,100
So oh my gosh...

466
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,560
Look at that...

467
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,480
Those people...

468
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,580
They're in the wrong religion...

469
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,640
And they're raising a child...

470
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,200
We better take that child away from them...

471
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,840
Because God isn't powerful enough to do it...

472
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:07,820
You know...

473
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
Just me...

474
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,580
The great New York family judge...

475
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,260
However...

476
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,800
Can help God out...

477
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,180
And we've seen...

478
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,680
By the way...

479
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,180
Speaking of the infamous...

480
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,060
Subgenius child custody case...

481
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,900
They lost...

482
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,080
They lost...

483
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,120
And then...

484
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,960
The biological dad...

485
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,840
Screwed up so much...

486
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,860
That they won the kid back...

487
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,300
So the Bevilacqua family...

488
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,020
Of Jesus, Magdalene, Conbo...

489
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,320
And their new child...

490
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
Reverend Bonecracker...

491
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,260
They are all together...

492
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,440
Magdalene had a new child...

493
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,660
With Jesus...

494
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,620
Who was such a powerful little subgenius...

495
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,240
That on his exit...

496
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,220
Into the world...

497
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,460
He broke her coccyx...

498
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,180
And thus...

499
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,140
Although we won't reveal his real name...

500
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,020
His subgenius...

501
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,560
Or his slave name rather...

502
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,340
His subgenius true name is...

503
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,760
Reverend Bonecracker...

504
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,040
Tough little devil...

505
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,640
So yeah...

506
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:06,980
You know...

507
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,460
What rule book is it...

508
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,960
That says we have to know...

509
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,220
Why the universe exists...

510
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,200
Or even if it exists...

511
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,720
That's the real...

512
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Mystical stuff...

513
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,880
You know...

514
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,360
Personally I feel...

515
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,480
Like I am the poor blinded...

516
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,620
Cyclops...

517
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,200
Stumbling ever towards...

518
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,440
What I think might be light...

519
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,400
And it always turns out to be...

520
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,420
One of those damn Dobbs heads...

521
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,480
But it still looks friendly to me...

522
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,020
After all these years...

523
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,360
Some religions may...

524
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,500
Represent themselves with a cosmic diagram...

525
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,260
And those are good...

526
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,320
We have plenty of those...

527
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,240
Some religions represent themselves with...

528
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,040
Pornography of a naked guy being tortured...

529
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,080
That's fine...

530
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,680
We've got lots of that in our videos...

531
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,440
Over there...

532
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,360
Boys and girls...

533
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,460
But we are religion...

534
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,500
Is represented by a smiling guy...

535
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,400
He does have a pipe...

536
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,560
And some people think that...

537
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,860
Is unhealthy...

538
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,620
And then they're always going...

539
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,460
Bob's smoking in his pipe now...

540
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
He's smoking...

541
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,400
Actually...

542
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,300
If you study this illustration...

543
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,260
On my chest...

544
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,620
Which I'll show off to the video cameras...

545
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,740
As best I can...

546
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,180
Bob is...

547
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,360
There's a brain here...

548
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,920
And there's fire up here...

549
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
That brain is you...

550
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,560
You're smoking...

551
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,400
Bob's brain...

552
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,340
Using Bob as a pipe...

553
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,340
And the bowl of his pipe as the stem...

554
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,080
In other words...

555
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,400
Look...

556
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,280
This isn't the crime...

557
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,280


558
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,280


559
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,180
This is the crutch of the subgenius...

560
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,260
Bob...

561
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,160
We don't want you using Bob as a crutch...

562
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,180
It would look like a dog pile...

563
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,860
But you let Bob use you as a crutch...

564
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,520
You don't ask Bob what he's smoking...

565
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,960
You jump in his pipe and let him smoke you, baby!

566
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,980
That's what this is about...

567
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,840
Let Bob smoke you!

568
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,000
And I...

569
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,420
You know...

570
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,160
To tell the truth...

571
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,240
I have no idea...

572
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,660
What happens after that...

573
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,240
But...

574
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,380
That's the thing about religion...

575
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,440
You don't question that kind of stuff...

576
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,980
You don't...

577
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,920
As Bob said...

578
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,580
You don't use your mind...

579
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,240
You don't use your mind...

580
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,900
To think about your religion...

581
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,500
Because that just wrecks everything...

582
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,680
It's pointless...

583
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,420
It's based on faith...

584
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,320
Or a face in this case...

585
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,040
This is a face-based religion...

586
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,280
That's all we need...

587
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,520
Is that face...

588
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,520
And I'll tell you...

589
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,180
I'll tell you...

590
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,500
Something that's not even a very big secret...

591
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,720
We stole that particular picture of Bob...

592
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,440
From an old Yellow Pages clip art catalog...

593
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
That wasn't copyrighted...

594
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,540
We used it across state lines in commerce...

595
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,360
For two years...

596
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,440
And it became our trademark...

597
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Then Jesus screwed up...

598
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,500
And we lost the trademark...

599
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,440
But before anybody noticed...

600
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,600
We got it back...

601
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,920
Don't you wish you'd known...

602
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,600
That brief period of time...

603
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,300
You could have taken over the church...

604
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
By asking your parents...

605
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,240
...you're escaped away from church...

606
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,560
From...

607
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,280
...faith...

608
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,720
You're still...

609
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:26,720


610
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:26,840
Toique!

611
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,060
Who's Nice...

612
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:43,220
I'm Isabelle Lemut!

613
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,380
Aaaand...

614
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,500
heps bam...

615
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:44,660
Siggle!!!

616
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


617
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,960
Nope.

618
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:44,960


619
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Silenced.

620
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,900
Christ and the Bible, or ludicrous

621
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,160
matter, free speech

622
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,020
should take preeminence in today's world.

623
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,000
Deny the existence of

624
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,840
God, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,

625
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,700
what you say, what you say, God,

626
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Jesus Christ and the Bible,

627
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,000
depraving public morality, holding us

628
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,820
as, as, as, shake it, shake it, as, attack

629
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,460
or insult religious beliefs.

630
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,120
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it,

631
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,460
shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it,

632
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,260
shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it.

633
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,620
Little callers, I should point out that

634
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,940
on tonight's show,

635
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,460
we've got, uh, Hal.

636
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,400
Hal. Philo.

637
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Philo. Ivan.

638
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,760
Ivan. Cardhouse robot.

639
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,940
Nope, that's Cardboard Bob. Nope, that's

640
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,060
Cardhouse. I thought you said Cardboard Bob.

641
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,660
Robot Cardhouse. So we should go on, uh,

642
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,120
on his, on his

643
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,860
show, don't you think? Who, Cowboy Bob?

644
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,220
Or, or who?

645
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,780
Copy Bob. Copy Bob.

646
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,140
Oh, yes. Yeah, we're, what happened to Copy Bob

647
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,920
the other night? He left and we never got a

648
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,800
chance to really get anything arranged.

649
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,920
He actually went down the entire line of subways.

650
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,800
Subgub DBs.

651
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,140
And got to me. Subgum Chowdini.

652
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
And was, you know, as his usual polite self,

653
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,320
but then he wandered off saying, I'm drunk, I'm drunk.

654
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,420
But I felt so sorry for him because I thought, yeah.

655
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,580
Drunk is a stupid thing.

656
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,660
But we believed that every one of those guys was really us.

657
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,140
Wine is a mother.

658
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,000
I was, it was so funny to stand on top of the building

659
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,260
watching our doubles talk to that guy.

660
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,440
Now, tomorrow or later,

661
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,300
I hope Copy Bob calls tonight.

662
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,040
Did I go to the same concert you did?

663
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,660
I saw, like, UFOs

664
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,700
that made this guy black.

665
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,880
There were so many of them.

666
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,260
Wow.

667
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,740
That's where I was? At the roundhouse?

668
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,280
I thought it was at Calumet.

669
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,140
Yeah, that's where they

670
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,880
turn locomotives around

671
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,980
so they can actually

672
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,840
go back the other way

673
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,040
on the same piece of track.

674
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,700
X-Day is just around the world from us now.

675
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,740
It always is, and that's why we can escape

676
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,880
its wrath as the heat ray

677
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,460
moves towards us each year.

678
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,500
Okay, so let's do the little,

679
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,820
I'm doing a little Flash movie here of what the end of the world

680
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,640
looks like. Flash!

681
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,100
It's kind of hard to make out.

682
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,180
Okay, vary your delivery style, alright?

683
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,700
Would you please provide variation

684
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,020
in your delivery style?

685
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,600
I'm sorry.

686
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,060
Surely you got the software upgrade.

687
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,820
This is in excess of the...

688
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,720
Reintroduce the show after each

689
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,500
show break.

690
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,280
Uh-oh. Show break.

691
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,380
I'll tell you when Peter and John

692
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,500
come down there and begin to

693
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,660
preach about the Holy Ghost talking in tongues,

694
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,260
he come...

695
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,300
Yes, I'm dying.

696
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,280
These wicked Israelites shall

697
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,360
slide in...

698
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,440
That's just dumb.

699
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,600
That's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

700
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,760
What you just said is stupid.

701
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,800
It's just stupid.

702
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,380
That's just dumb.

703
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,300
And God says,

704
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,280
stand in shock

705
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
to have your hair stand on its ends.

706
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,500
And maybe you drunk.

707
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,960
God says,

708
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,560
shock him.

709
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,940
That makes his hair stand on end.

710
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,940
So, nothing.

711
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,960
Nothing.

712
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,720
Well, I was praying last night

713
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,240
when an angel broke the lines.

714
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,720
He said, I'm gonna have to put you on hold

715
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,920
for a time.

716
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,100
I said, hold like hell.

717
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,680
Let me talk to the boss.

718
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,000
He said, I'm sorry.

719
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,620
Sinner is the boss's day off.

720
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,000
And I realized

721
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,120
that the wages are same.

722
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,980
Plus two bucks an hour

723
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,720
and work a weekend.

724
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,060
And I wish,

725
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,240
I wish I could have a good day.

726
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,240


727
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,020
back to the closet.

728
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,500
God,

729
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,220
did, did, did

730
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,040
this son of a bitch

731
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,780
all I said I would

732
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,060
if I could?

733
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
I can't, so I won't.

734
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,460
Well, I wouldn't want you

735
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,260
dancing your hair with some gold.

736
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,780
And I realized

737
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,680
then that the way is the same.

738
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,260
Cause all the lumber

739
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,420
you can carry,

740
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,700
all the nails you can get,

741
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,900
and the wages are seen.

742
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,460
Though he wore a clear

743
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,160
moody and fretless

744
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,780
second to me.

745
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,620
Damn him and his feelings.

746
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,640
No sexy, no show.

747
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
And I'm not sure

748
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,520
that I really want to go.

749
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

750
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

751
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,380


752
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

753
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

754
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

755
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

756
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

757
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:10,460


758
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,480


759
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

760
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

761
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

762
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

763
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

764
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

765
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,360


766
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,360


767
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,360


768
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

769
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,480


770
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,480


771
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,500
Yeah, you been

772
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,680
missing him and saying

773
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
the price that you'd pay

774
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,920
is now obligating

775
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,500
but I'm never saying

776
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,080
think.

777
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,320
To the church, to the stage

778
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,420
you gotta cut your cap,

779
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:40,460
atus, and the Bronx,

780
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,780
Thank you.

781
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
Thank you.

782
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,940
Thank you.

783
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,620
Must be great drumming.

784
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,560
You and Norm have a good time

785
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:52,900
in Chicago.

786
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,280
It'll be warmer

787
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,620
in here.

788
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,140
I'll stay here. I'll stay here

789
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
when the wind blows.

790
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh yeah, we're waiting to see

791
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,660
Yeah, we're waiting to see

792
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,240
That's it

793
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,340
I feel like I'm running

794
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,780
I feel like I'm running

795
00:25:40,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I feel like I'm running

796
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:18,400
I feel like I'm running

797
00:26:51,180 --> 00:27:02,760
I feel like I'm running

798
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,240
I don't know

799
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,700
How do we be supposed to know about these nut religions

800
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,200
and occult kooks out there?

801
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,360
You've never heard of Alistair Crowbar?

802
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,640
That charlatan, that poser, that charlatan

803
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,660
why he went on a mountain climbing expedition

804
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,600
and caused his good friends

805
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,260
to fall off a rocky rock

806
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,700
and get morass

807
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,980
and impasse

808
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,600
You can tell what kind of a magician

809
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,900
somebody is from the way he behaves out in the bush

810
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,320
Hey look man

811
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,680
I

812
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm not responsible for that

813
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,240
I am a consecrated magician

814
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,620
of O.T.O.

815
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,420
and I will not

816
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,720
brook to hearing

817
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,440
point one

818
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,060
Well what are you going to do about it buddy?

819
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,380
This is a subgenius hour

820
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:41,580
Hey listen

821
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,260
Hey listen pink boy

822
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,600
These

823
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,700
These may be subgenies

824
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,280
but they're

825
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,620
they're sanctioned by yours truly

829
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,160
higher mysteries

830
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,660
than anyone in the O.T.O.

831
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,700
can possibly claim

832
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,240
so

833
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,800
watch your car

834
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,160
and let's go

835
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,300
Be careful

836
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,260
I'm not here to

837
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,940
We're scared

838
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,760
We're scared

839
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,100
We're scared

840
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,120
and we got this transmitter

841
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
and we don't know what to do with it

842
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,220
Please

843
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,680
That's right

844
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,640
Don't subliminate me

Stationers who attend our writing workshops

know that 20 kilofiles

854
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,680
and 90 ounces of air

855
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,160

856
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,380
You're an addict to pornographic movies

857

You're an addict to pornographic movies

unseemly

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,140
It's happening here

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,880

No

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,260
Why?

877
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,620
It'll shock you

878
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,280
It's happening here

It's happening everywhere

880
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,540
And the problem is this

881
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,020
We have not said

882
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,380
That Kinky Friedman

883
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,180
Was the only way to heaven

884
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,480
You never did

885
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,100
Need I go on?

886
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,120
No

887
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,220
Why?

888
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,260
There's gonna come a day

889
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,180
If it hadn't already happened

890
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,040
Where Kinky Friedman

891
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,820
Reveals the root

892
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,600
Need I go on?

893
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,600
No

894
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,740
Why?

895
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,980
The fruit reveals the root

896
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,220
But yet we've become a society

897
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,380
Where we're not

898
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,380


899
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,380

906
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,740
That just embraces

907
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,040
Kinky Friedman

908
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,140
There is

00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,640
No

910
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,320

911
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,980
Way

912
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,680
Need I go on?

913
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,620
No

914
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,740
Why?

915
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,520
Honey buns

916
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:43,880
Sauerkraut

917
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,340
And donuts

918
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,440
Horseradish

919
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,300
And cakes

920
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,780
You say well I know that

921
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,660
They taught me that in school

922
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,160
Yeah I know they taught you that in school

923
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,060
What they didn't teach you

924
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,880
Was don't forget relish

925
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,520
Need I go on?

926
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,520
No

927
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,640
Why?

928
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,360
One Bob buried his wife

929
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,360


930
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,780
in Canada

931
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,100
One Bob alive in Canada

932
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,460
Don't even mention that pink Canuck

933
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,840
That's an evil counterfeit Bob

934
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,900
As we all know

935
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,180
Who espouses the political philosophy

936
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,500
Of Lyndon LaRouche

937
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,580
And commits idolatry

938
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,640
At the altar of all people

939
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,360
Marshall McLuhan

940
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,540
Oh lord

941
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,500
And with his rich friend

942
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,980
Give him helicopter rides

943
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,560
He seems to have some ability

944
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,380
To convince the unwary

945
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,340
That he is

946
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,420
He himself is Bob Dobbs though

947
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,820
Politely asked to cease and desist

948
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,220
His messianic zeal

949
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,960
Has not permitted this to take place

950
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,640
What happens when somebody

951
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,480
Says they're Bob

952
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,700
It's obvious they're not

953
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,540
And they post themselves on places like

954
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,340
You know MySpace

955
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,360
Does Bob ever say

956
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm Bob

957
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,860
No one makes that claim except

958
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,120
The one who has to commit

959
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,540
The crime of falsehood

960
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,940
What do they put quotes around it?

961
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,060
Just as no one who says

962
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,820
I'm just as good as you

963
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,140
Is ever as good as the person

964
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,280
That he's saying it to

965
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,820
Because otherwise why say it?

966
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,120
Maybe they are

967
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,340
Well but then

968
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,800
You know maybe really

969
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,960
Maybe they really are

970
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,640
But have an inferiority complex

971
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,060
However in that

972
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
So therefore they're not

973
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,560
Right there

974
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,620
They are defective

975
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,500
Just for that alone

976
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,660
Remember we must be as harsh as truth

977
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,960
And as uncompromising as justice

978
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,920
Praise Bob

979
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,800
Praise Bob

980
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,620
Praise Bob

981
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,580
Oh I thought of the phrase

982
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,080
I was trying to explain to somebody earlier today

983
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,000
That our church is a self validating philosophy

984
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,940
And all the really great like Scientology

985
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,880
The Mormons and so forth

986
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,240
They're self validating

987
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,200
Because they have worked into their philosophy

988
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,140
Something that discounts anything against the philosophy

989
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,900
In other words it's like

990
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,260
A perfect recipe for eternal stupidity

991
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,760
But who cares if you get slack?

992
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,640
When was the last time being smart got you a date?

993
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,400
Actually in the case of a lot of us

994
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,140
That's probably about the only way we ever got dates

995
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,180
But you know what I'm saying

996
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,640
In the normal world it's

997
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,300
As Bob said act like a dumb shit

998
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,620
And they'll treat you like an equal

999
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,760
Sad but true

1000
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,480
And we learn that on the job almost every day don't we?

1001
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,680
I had to because of one of the many I'm a Bobs

1002
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,560
That we have to deal with

1003
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,460
People get as crazy as all this sounds

1004
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,420
We actually have people that get so into it

1005
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,100
That we have to deprogram them

1006
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,220
We have to deprogram our own zombies

1007
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,060
And some of them you can't deprogram them

1008
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,540
You can extremely

1009
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,980
You can cross your fingers and tell them all kinds of stuff

1010
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,520
Oh it's just a piece of clip art

1011
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,880
We're just making fun of religion

1012
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
You can go away now

1013
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,220
No no I'm not going to pass miracles

1014
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,980
Please please

1015
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,240
And we had to explain to someone

1016
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
The term solipsism

1017
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:18,940
Solipsism

1018
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:19,680
Noun

1019
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,600
Number one

1020
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,200
Philosophy

1021
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,880
The theory that only the self exists

1022
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,560
Or can be proved to exist

1023
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,020
Two

1024
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,220
Extreme preoccupation with and indulgence of one's feelings

1025
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,940
Desires

1026
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,920
Etc

1027
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,820
Egoistic self-absorption

1028
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,020
Wait a minute

1029
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,460
That's the new age

1030
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,320
And the church of the subgenius

1031
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,700
Forget what I just said friends

1032
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,300
Is there really a place called hell?

1033
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,420
No

1034
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:46,820
Yes

1035
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,220
There is subgenius heaven

1036
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,260
Or wait no subgenius

1037
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,100
Is hell better than Christian heaven?

1038
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,000
There is a place called hell

1039
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
You didn't ask Dr. Hell

1040
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,220
At Revelation X

1041
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,080
But don't confuse that with ask brother Hal

1042
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,680
Which is on pirate cat radio

1043
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,760
I just don't believe there is such a place as hell

1044
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,700
But there is

1045
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:07,840
No how

1046
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,080
It's a character in a movie

1047
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,300
If you believe the Bible

1048
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,900
See that's what's happened

1049
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,360
Movies have influenced so strongly

1050
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,680
That everybody thinks they're real

1051
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,020
Hell is speaking into the microphone

1052
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,060
Oh hell exists friends

1053
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,460
There is a place of eternal darkness

1054
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,660
Where in leaping flames

1055
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,920
Leering demons

1056
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,500
Plunge sizzling pitchforks

1057
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,500
Into the quivering buttocks

1058
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,680
Of uh

1059
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,960
Sordid sinners

1060
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,420
I'm telling you

1061
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,420
I've seen the imps of Satan

1062
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,780
Leaping in the flames

1063
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,600
Yes yes I have

1064
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,580
Dr. Hal

1065
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,580
And uh the monsters too of hell

1066
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,900
Gorgons

1067
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,720
Hydras

1068
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,680
And Chimeras

1069
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,740
But aren't there a lot of naked chicks in hell?

1070
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,280
All the pictures I ever saw

1071
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,840
Yes there are

1072
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,360
Uh didn't I show you that 15 minutes of footage I got from hell?

1073
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,700
You really should see that

1074
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,580
Maybe I could bring it over the files

1075
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,600
Oh the 1930s movie?

1076
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,680
Uh or Dante's Inferno?

1077
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,040
Yeah

1078
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:01,640
Yeah

1079
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,240
I would love to have

1080
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,740
Yeah I have seen that uh that footage

1081
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,180
And it is some hot stuff

1082
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,960
In more ways than one

1083
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,980
And what are you talking about?

1084
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,760
There's a Hollywood movie about hell that involved

1085
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,020
I would have loved to have been on that set

1086
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:18,780
Yes

1087
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,580
It would have been like being on the set of Prospero's books

1088
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,960
Shows all these nude babes being tortured in hell

1089
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,900
You know that's a

1090
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:26,640
Um

1091
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,580
They could get away with it because it was religious

1092
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,120
What was the name of the movie?

1093
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,640
Dante's Inferno

1094
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,720
Yeah it was based on an old children's book

1095
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,960
You've probably heard of it

1096
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,880
It was

1097
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,780
I want you to catch that for a moment

1098
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,320
God has never intended for one person to go to hell

1099
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,540
With Spencer Tracy

1100
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,720
Hell was created not for man

1101
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,840
It's Jimmy Swagger

1102
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,760
God has done everything he can to keep man from going there

1103
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,660
Despite the fact that almost all

1104
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,780
I don't hear any fart sounds

1105
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,880
Have I got the right channel?

1106
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,040
Has gone

1107
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,440
Well you know I thought that was Michael Pepe

1108
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,160
But I guess it's

1109
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,820
If you go to hell it's kind of like being in Beetlejuice

1110
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,060
But hell is

1111
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,900
Well everyone knows

1112
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,880
Everywhere you look are

1113
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,460
Sites of

1114
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,440
Horror

1115
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,260
Um

1116
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,420
If you listen closely to the Beetlejuice soundtrack

1117
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,100
Danny Elfman threw in a little tip of the hat

1118
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,400
To the Godzilla theme

1119
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,040
Do you remember which uh

1120
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,460
Any track specifically?

1121
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,220
No

1122
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,980
But somewhere in there there's that little

1123
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,380
Tiny tanks tiny tanks lots of little tiny tanks

1124
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,860
Oh right right

1125
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,180
I don't remember what that is either

1126
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,540
I just

1127
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,960
I just kind of scratched the part that's got

1128
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,700
Dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan

1129
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,940
They had a picture of you in this thing

1130
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,540
It gets ya it really gets to ya after a while

1131
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,660
It got to me Philo and

1132
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,600
Look what happened

1133
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,460
There's some puzzling evidence show there

1134
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,620
And now two musical interludes

1135
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,400
The first by the classical composer Fernande Nande-Limure

1136
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,480
And the next by the jazz master Norell Preff

1137
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,120
And now the finale

1138
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:37,960
No

1139
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,440
No

1140
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,600
Yeah

1141
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,900
I

1142
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,800
I

1143
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
I

1144
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
I

1145
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,160


1146
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,720
I

1147
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,760
I

1148
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:48,760


1149
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,120
I

1150
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,120


1151
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,300
Thank you.

1152
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,220
Thank you.

1153
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,320
Thank you.

1154
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,180
Hopefully the first of many.

1155
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,680
Can you see the future ones also being a subgenius-themed night?

1156
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,580
Yes, yes.

1157
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,680
We'll try to get all the subgeniuses on board and take them up north.

1158
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:37,420
And when's the last time that there was a gathering of such subgeniuses in the San Francisco area coming together for one event, one night?

1159
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,240
Last January.

1160
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,080
And then next February again.

1161
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,040
Oh, wait.

1162
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,760
February, oh, wait.

1163
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,120
February, yeah.

1164
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,120
What's the event?

1165
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,760
Mongo is putting out another one of these things.

1166
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,060
And that's the name of it, right?

1167
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,740
Yeah.

1168
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,780
He doesn't even know about it.

1169
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,620
Yeah, we'll come up with it.

1170
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,600
We didn't tell you yet, sorry.

1171
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
We'll make it up next time.

1172
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,720
But I was saying, Stan will be back here in February, so that's when you have to do that.

1173
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,420
Yeah, but that's for my nephew's Bob Mitzvah.

1174
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,440
The Bob Mitzvah.

1175
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,920
Yes, we'll have to work this through.

1176
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,880
And I understand puzzling evidence will be circumcising.

1177
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,360
Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,580
Is it a Bob-er-is?

1179
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,200
A Bob-er-is, a Bob-er-is.

1180
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,400
Squaring the circle.

1181
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,700
A Bob-er-is.

1182
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,780
Are there any...

1183
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,880
December holidays in the subgenius calendar?

1184
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,160
Yes, Existlessnessmas.

1185
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,680
And what's the date?

1186
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
Which corresponds with the pagan Christmas and the Christian Christmas.

1187
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,860
So right the same day.

1188
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,880
It occurs on the 25th of December.

1189
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,200
Susie the Flusie calls it Slaternalia.

1190
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,640
Oh, very good.

1191
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,520
The holiday of Slaternalia or Existlessnessmas.

1192
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,200
And what kind of symbols are popular with this holiday?

1193
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,380
What kind of?

1194
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,760
What kind of?

1195
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,840
It's like with every culture.

1196
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,540
Well, winged eyeballs.

1197
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,020
Yeah, you spend a lot of money and get real drunk.

1198
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,620
So no tree, no candelabra of a special resort.

1199
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,020
Instead of giving gifts to your loved ones, you're supposed to steal something from all your loved ones.

1200
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,660
Very nice.

1201
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,820
Well, then there are the angels here.

1202
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,800
What didn't they get for their holiday?

1203
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,220
Well, there are many things.

1204
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,480
Definitely Bob.

1205
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,540
Very good.

1206
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:18,540
Are there any other holidays within the calendar that correspond with the pagan Christian calendar?

1207
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,980
Actually, the other name for the Christmas holiday was Turnover.

1208
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,340
You know, it's sad.

1209
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,260
That's all in Book of the Subgenius, but I haven't been reading my prescriptions all that well lately.

1210
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,300
I need to go through that section.

1211
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,120
That's chapter 11, I believe.

1212
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,440
Or is it chapter 9?

1213
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:41,920
Thank you.

1214
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,180
Thank you.

1215
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,900
Thank you.

1216
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,980
Thank you.

1217
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,060
Thank you.

1218
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,140


1219
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,400
Thank you.

1220
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,660
Thank you.

1221
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:48,660


1222
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:48,720


1223
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:48,800


1224
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:48,900


1225
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,100


1226
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,100


1227
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,100


1228
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,100


1229
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,100


1230
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,280
Thank you.

1231
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,320
to subdivisions. Butters, Butters, there you are.

1232
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:28,180
Uh, uh, uh, I'd like to go ahead. Uh, I, uh, feces. Uh, so what?

1233
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,520
Butters, Butters, I have a lot of special feelings.

1234
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,760
Mantle, Mantle.

1235
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,640
Butters, Butters, Butters, Butters.

1236
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,500
Child pornography.

1237
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,160
Butters, Butters, Butters, Butters.

1238
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,520
Senator Butters.

1239
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,520
Knowingly views child pornography. And I would move.

1240
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,120
Butters, Butters.

1241
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,380
Butters.

1242
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,820
Uh, sexual.

1243
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,780
Butters.

1244
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,520
Hi, hi.

1245
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,360
Butter, Butter.

1246
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,220
Penis, Penis.

1247
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,540
Butter.

1248
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,240
Butter, Butter.

1249
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,520
I have passed out.

1250
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,960
The homo, they came together in a compromise.

1251
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:02,940
Butter.

1252
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,200
Yeah, isn't it great?

1253
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,680
That was me at DocStock2.

1254
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,840
Get a little shot.

1255
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,140
This show really is hurting.

1256
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,880
My back.

1257
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,140
It hurts my head.

1258
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,340
Normally it hurts my ears and my, and it is true that there is a pain between my ears.

1259
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,460
A dungeon.

1260
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,860
But my back hurts this time.

1261
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,480
That pain between your ears is called your brain.

1262
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,240
As one great furnace flames.

1263
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,660
Well, thanks for informing me.

1264
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,720
Yet from those flames, no light.

1265
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,040
Okay, get on the elevator now.

1266
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,440
Go ahead.

1267
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,480
Darkness visible.

1268
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,900
I hate following you guys around the studio.

1269
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,120
Served only to discover sites of woe, regions of sorrow.

1270
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,520
You're all just stepping on somebody's heels.

1271
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,680
Doleful shades wet my face.

1272
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,360
You're stepping on my face.

1273
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,900
My heels, I'm stepping on your heels.

1274
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,300
Rest can never dwell.

1275
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,680
Hope never comes.

1276
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,220
We gotta make some copies.

1277
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,060
Don't forget we gotta make some copies.

1278
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,720
But torch without end still urges, and a fiery deluge fed with ever burning sulfur, unconsumed.

1279
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,420
What happened to Copy Bob?

1280
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:11,180
Oh, he went off to get some coffee, and then he fell into the coffee machine and was consumed.

1281
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,260
And it could happen to you.

1282
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,060
Subgenius listeners.

1283
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,680
Are you the next Copy Bob?

1284
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,480
Are you Copy Copy Bob?

1285
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,900
Or are you an original, ready for others to copy you in the endless matrix?

1286
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,960
The evolution of subgeniuses happens like this.

1287
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:38,380
If you copy the same thing over and over again on a Xerox machine, each copy will be only

1288
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,560
slightly different, but the one at the end will be quite different from the one you started.

1289
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:52,560
It is a perfect example of evolution, a window into God's methods.

1290
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,460
And then it hit me.

1291
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,620
For God, there is no zero.

1292
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:08,140
Even though I was a tiny, runt-like midget, all God's creation was still large and glorious,

1293
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,540
which was a great soothing comfort considering I was about to be sucked into the abyss.

1294
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1295
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,540


1296
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,760
I was sucked up by a bacterium twice my size.

1297
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,860
I still exist for the time being, which gets increasingly smaller, because as I get smaller,

1298
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,480
time goes super fast.

1299
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,240
Oh, is this the director's cut of Incredible Shrinking Man?

1300
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,560
Yes.

1301
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,800
You know, they should redo that one since they're redoing I Am Legend and all these

1302
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,300
other things.

1303
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,560
I've actually been surprised that that one hasn't been redone.

1304
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,360
What, Galaxy Quest?

1305
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,320
No, the Incredible Shrinking Man.

1306
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,140
No, the Incredible Shrinking Man.

1307
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,680
It's the coolest, man.

1308
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,540
It's got little buttons.

1309
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:44,540


1310
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,100
It's got little monsters and they go to Utah to film in Little Pumpkin State Park or wherever

1311
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,380
it is.

1312
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,840
What are you talking about?

1313
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,080
The little evil baby planet.

1314
00:45:51,220 --> 00:46:00,140
Of course, the second Omega Man, you know, the second one did have Charlton Heston.

1315
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,080
It also had Woodstock.

1316
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,660
It had Whitey Gravy in it.

1317
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,560
Yes, Charlton Heston would go to a movie theater.

1318
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,500
He's the last man on Earth, so he'd go to a movie theater and he'd cue up Woodstock

1319
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,540
and watch it and go, you beautiful, crazy kids.

1320
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:14,540


1321
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,680
He's sitting in the audience watching Woodstock.

1322
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,800
Damn it, they blew it all to hell.

1323
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,720
Go, go, you wonderful, crazy, beautiful monsters.

1324
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,400
Just some old guy watching movies.

1325
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,340
That's it, kids.

1326
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,140
Make love, not war.

1327
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,760
We frequently went to church together on Sunday evenings at St. Stephen's.

1328
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,520
And one Sunday evening after service, I asked him up to my apartment.

1329
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:44,520


1330
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,480
And as we walked along, we talked.

1331
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,600
Dr. Branson, it's midnight.

1332
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,780
I wonder why.

1333
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,220
Now I shall look up and say...

1334
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,080
Money.

1335
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:01,620
Exactly.

1336
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,120
Five thousand dollars.

1337
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,160
That's the same thing they told me.

1338
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,720
So if you will take these rubber gloves, put them on, please.

1339
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,600
All right.

1340
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,120
But what about next time?

1341
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,400
And the next?

1342
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:13,620
I don't know.

1343
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,040
I don't know.

1344
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,220
I don't know.

1345
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:15,840


1346
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:18,900
Well, time is moving on.

1347
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,820
No one would've believed that humans were intelligences greater than man's...

1348
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,900
Looked across space searching for Uranus...

1349
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Surrounded by an unbreathable atmosphere of methane gas.

1350
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,660
If they start anything, we can blast them right off the Earth.

1351
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,780
Better than a lion farm or a snake pit.

1352
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,540
Thank you, sir.

1353
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,760
From P.R. News in Washington, I'm plunged into chaos because of alleged corruption.

1354
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,360
Atlantis has undocked from the International Slaughterhouse. The crew has been trying to

1355
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,940
determine if any beef they served in their cafeteria could pose a danger on reentry.

1356
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,840
The shuttle has completed a nine-day mission in which astronauts made a public call for

1357
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,620
the beef grains on Wednesday. Former First Lady Nancy Reagan is likely to be going into

1358
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:11,640
the food supply. PR News is bad. PR is bad. More than 50 top former Philippine government

1359
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,820
officials recognized today that this is PR News in Washington.

1360
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:22,360
Thanks to Lemur, this is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius. For more

1363
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,280
Kent from his CD.

1364
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,280
Oil and water. And now, an important message.

1365
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,660
We live in a country in which a person cannot get elected president if he openly doubts

1366
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:06,460
the existence of heaven and hell. This is truly remarkable. Given that there is no other

1367
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,220
body of knowledge that we require our political leaders to master.

1368
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,140
Even a hair stylist must pass a licensing exam before applying his trade in the United

1369
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,740
States. And yet, those given the power to make war and national policy, those whose

1370
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:30,460
decisions will inevitably affect human life for generations are not expected to know anything

1371
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:36,820
in particular before starting to work. They do not have to be political scientists, economists,

1372
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,620
or even lawyers. They need not have studied information and know that they are not the

1373
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:41,620


1374
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:41,620


1375
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:50,440
relations, military history, resource management, civil engineering, or any other field of knowledge

1376
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,300
that might be brought to bear in the governance of a modern superpower.

1377
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:04,380
They need only be expert fundraisers, comport themselves well on television, and be indulgent

1378
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,580
of certain myths.

1379
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:12,600
Our president regularly speaks in phrases appropriate to the 14th century, and no one

1380
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:20,620
seems inclined to find out what words like God and crusade and wonder-working power mean

1381
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,020
to him.

1382
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,580
Not only do we still eat the awful of the ancient world, we are positively smug about

1383
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:28,780
it.

1384
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,480
Gary Wills has noted that the Bush White House is currently honeycombed.

1385
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:43,540
It does not seem out of place to wonder whether the myths that now saturate our discourse

1386
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:49,120
will wind up killing many of us, as the myths of others already have.

1387
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,660
It seems extraordinarily likely that our descendants will look upon many of our beliefs as both

1388
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,800
impossibly quaint and suicidally stupid.

1389
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,560
It is time we admitted, from kings and presidents on down, that we are not just a bunch of fools

1390
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,560


1391
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,560


1392
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,560

of civilizing insights that the human mind has only just begun to inscribe upon itself

1416
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,060
through secular politics and scientific culture.

1417
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:50,140
We will see that the greatest problem confronting civilization is not merely religious extremism.

1418
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,620
Rather, it is the larger set of cultural and intellectual accommodations we have made to

1419
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,240
faith itself.

1420
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:04,020
Self-religious moderates are in large part responsible for the religious conflict in

1421
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,700
our world, because their beliefs provide the context in which scriptural literalism and

1422
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,420
religious violence can never be adequately opposed.

1423
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:23,760
Every sphere of genuine discourse must, at a minimum, admit of discourse, and hence the

1424
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,220
possibility that those standing on its fringe can come to understand the truth of the world.

1425
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,220
Understand the truths that it strives to articulate.

1426
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:36,720
This is why any sustained exercise of reason must necessarily transcend national, religious,

1427
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,960
and ethnic boundaries.

1428
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:46,920
There is, after all, no such thing as an inherently American, or Christian, or Caucasian, physics.

1429
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,100
Twenty minutes of show.

1430
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,240
An hour of midnight here on the West Coast.

1431
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,220
Your list.

1432
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,000
Listening to the slack-stuffed final moments of A Season in Hell.

1433
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,540
This time, the show was infested with subgeniuses.

1434
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,940
You are lucky enough to be tuning in right now, even if it is later.

1435
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,940
You have the opportunity still to call us.

1436
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,800
Where is the...

1437
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,560
Reverend Ivan Stang is in the studio this evening.

1438
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,480
Dr. Hal Lloyd-Mongoloid puzzling evidence.

1439
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,000
K-Rob.

1440
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,560
And myself, John.

1441
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:37,780
Yes, we are all here hashing out some of the finer points of subgenius doctrine and history.

1442
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:46,920
The latter being the reminiscence of old cronies, old coots and doddering gray-bearded moons,

1443
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,140
trying to recall in their shattered minds.

1444
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,420
What is, uh...

1445
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,960
From the dust heap of history.

1446
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,600
What is Bob's stance on cronyism?

1447
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,020
Well.

1448
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,960
We're all the cronies of Bob.

1449
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,240
We're a lodge.

1450
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:06,460
A friendly, back-slapping, towel-snapping lodge of like-minded individuals.

1451
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,800
Well, that makes me feel better already.

1452
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,100
Because you're included.

1453
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,800
Oh, thank you.

1454
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,620
But, uh...

1455
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,860
Bob also said...

1456
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,640
That music in the background is by Mark Mothersbaugh.

1457
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,040
Believe me out of it.

1458
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,620
Believe me out of it.

1459
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,280
Next, friends.

1460
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,680
We shall die.

1461
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:32,800
At first, with a clip from Anthony Hopkins' great movie, Slipstream.

1462
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,160
You may have noticed I really like that movie, Slipstream.

1463
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,480
And finally, with the late Professor Chaz Smith, covering a Bob Dylan song.

1464
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,620
One of the very last recordings Chaz made.

1465
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,480
You know, he was falling all over the place.

1466
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,380
He was perspiring.

1467
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:52,880
And I don't know.

1468
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,900
His gun fell from his hand.

1469
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,260
And then the next thing he saw, he was like, oh, my God.

1470
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:56,260


1471
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:56,660
He collapsed.

1472
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,400
He collapsed.

1473
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,340
And so that was, you know, I don't know.

1474
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,820
That was it.

1475
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,440
You know, the actor died.

1476
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,280
And we were left high and dry.

1477
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,000
Literally.

1478
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,440
Wow.

1479
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,420
Yeah, wow.

1480
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,740
But the spooky thing was...

1481
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,400
What?

1482
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,180
Oh, I don't know how to describe it.

1483
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,620
It's like...

1484
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,520
It's like we're...

1485
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,040
We have no control over anything.

1486
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:17,760
It's like we're...

1487
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,080
Like we're being pushed about by something.

1488
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,120
Everybody on the set felt it.

1489
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,200
It was like a big joke.

1490
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,260
A joke?

1491
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,040
Yeah.

1492
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,240
I mean, it was like a big joke.

1493
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,240


1494
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,240


1495
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,240


1496
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,240


1497
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,240


1498
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,860
It was really strange.

1499
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,580
How?

1500
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,100
Well, the guy who wrote it, he did it for a laugh.

1501
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,580
That's what we heard anyway.

1502
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,780
Who wrote it, Kevin?

1503
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,640
I don't know.

1504
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,720
Nobody knows, really.

1505
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,300
Nobody knows who he is or where he came from.

1506
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,340
It's kind of scary.

1507
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,360
How do you mean scary?

1508
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,600
Like when you're a little kid and it's dark.

1509
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,220
Keep thinking that you see somebody you don't know looking at you through a window.

1510
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1511
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1512
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1513
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1514
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1515
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1516
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1517
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1518
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1519
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1520
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1521
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1522
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,220


1523
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,020
It's kind of like a dream.

1524
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,440


1525
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,860
Yeah.

1526
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,180
Yeah.

1527
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,740
Yeah.

1528
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,920
Yeah.

1529
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,060
Yeah.

1530
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,720
Alex is a good DJ.

1531
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:36,860
Yes, he's a good DJ.

1532
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:36,900
Oh, yeah?

1533
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:36,900


1534
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:36,900


1535
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:36,900


1536
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:36,900


1537
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:36,900


1538
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:36,900


1539
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,580
I see it too.

1540
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,760
And he really likes music.

1541
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:41,760


1542
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,260
He's right.

1543
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:42,840
He's very rich.

1544
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:42,840


1545
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:42,840


1546
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,540
Stay with me over Christmas.

1547
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:44,720


1548
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:45,660
Yeah.

1549
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,000
I've got to go.

1550
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,900
And, thank you.

1551
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,220
Isn't that a KC thing?

1552
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,140
Yeah.

1553
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,680
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1554
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,080
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1555
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,240
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1556
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,820
Mama put my guns in the ground

1557
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,140
I can't shoot them anymore

1558
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,160
The cold black cloud is comin' down

1559
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,580
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

1560
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,800
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1561
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,640
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1562
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,360
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1563
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,740
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1564
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

1565
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,540
Oh yeah, I'm knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

1566
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,700
I'm knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

1567
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:59,200
I'm knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

1568
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:38,940
I'm knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
