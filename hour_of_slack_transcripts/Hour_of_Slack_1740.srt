1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I see no reason for violence.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,260
Sex.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,000
If, however, you are confronted, you may result in...

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,900
So genius.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,360
Bug sex.

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,180
So now we can hug our fleas and ticks, too.

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,780
Yes.

8
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,420
Yes.

9
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,020
Yes.

10
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,400
Yes.

11
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,160
American tits.

12
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,480
Sex.

13
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,780
Don't kill flies with our nostrils.

14
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,160
Sex.

15
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm drifting lower on Twitter.

16
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:29,140
Two of President Trump's cabinet secretaries burned more than 200,000 acres and left seven people dead today on Twitter.

17
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,560
The U.S. Forest Service is part of the Department of Press Conference.

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
The Cal Fire has the Car Fire and stressed the importance of PR News in Montana.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,680
The president has been attacking PR's reports on federal Twitter.

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,680
He's charged with tax fraud not related to his work on Twitter.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,980
The Dow is 5-7.

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,560
Officials say they don't know yet whether they're attacking PR News on Twitter, accidentally or on purpose, today.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,120
Afghan officials say hundreds of people have been killed.

24
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:07,720
In four days of federal tweeting in the city of Seattle, officials say 30 civilians were also killed with the help of U.S. tweet strikes.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,880
The Trump is getting cheated by shady lending practices.

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,320
PR reports.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,680
The White House appears predatory and people can get PR news.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,780
The West Virginia House of Delegates agreed to plead guilty to using state-owned PR News for personal use today.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,000
One, two, three, four.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,500
Four.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:27,680
Four.

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:27,900
Four.

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,200
Four.

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,620
Four.

35
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,900
Four.

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,440
clumsy

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,340
Bobb.

38
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,180
Four, three, two, one.

You're a c-c-d-e-a-c-t-g-a-a-c

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,100
We're going nuts with my c-c-t-g-a-t-a-t

In a sapiosexual way

64
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,960
I said let's get it down today

65
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,920
In a sapiosexual way

66
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,580
Bob?

67
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,960
Oh my!

68
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Bob?

69
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,860
Oh my!

70
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll tell him!

71
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,400
Bob?

72
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,000
Of course!

73
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,900
Don't, don't, don't!

74
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,620
Bob?

75
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,240
Gosh!

76
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,140
Yeah, that's it!

77
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,460
Oh!

78
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,800

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,500

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,180
Bob?

82
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,560
Father!

83
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,240
He is a very fast man

84
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,000
I can run right through his wall

85
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,940
They'll laugh when I see

86
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,920
I can fly through his wall

87
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,580
Oh!

88
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,420
Maybe if I vibrate fast enough

89
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,180
Yeah

90
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,540
I can catch his flow

91
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,920
On their city

92
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,880
Why are you so weird?

93
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,320
Oh!

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,440
They say

95
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,560
Why are you so weird?

96
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,240
And they say

97
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,780
Why am I easy?

98
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,960
Yes, they say

99
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Why are you so weird?

100
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,200
Oh!

101
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,420
And they say

102
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,160
Why do you talk that way?

103
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
I don't know

104
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,980
Why am I so weird?

105
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,980
I don't know

106
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
This'll no longer be

107
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,640
The way to the hopeless

108
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,140
When she comes back to me

109
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,720
Oh!

110
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,920
And they say

111
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,580
Why are you so weird?

112
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:31,980
Oh!

113
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,080
They say

114
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Why are you so weird?

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,920
They wanna know

116
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,700
Why do I believe that she could

117
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,200
Be brought back to me?

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
They say

119
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,840
Don't you know she's dead?

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,700
Yes, I know

121
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,400
I know it in my head

122
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,920
But I don't

123
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't feel it in my head

124
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,120


125
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,800
Because I don't believe in it

126
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,140
I don't believe in loose

127
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,420
I don't feel it

128
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,960
I don't think I expressed it

129
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,100
I don't even know where she Cc

130
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
I'm 20 years old

131
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,900


132
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,900


133
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,900


134
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,900


135
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,980
No way

136
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,480
At that fee claim

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,420
I don't feel it

138
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,380
I don't know how to commit

139
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,740
I just, you know

140
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,120
Because we're friends

141
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,180
Thank you.

142
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,240
Thank you.

Thank you.

151
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,520
Thank you.

152
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,140
Thank you.

153
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:07,940
Thank you.

154
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,800
Thank you.

155
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,900
I felt that he had just a little too much pizzicato!

156
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,580
In the enghante...

157
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,160
Didn't you?

158
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,080
No...

159
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,180
Get up out of bed.

160
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,240
Sour on my head.

161
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
Drinking down a cup.

162
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,020
Trying to wake up

163
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,480
Driving across town

164
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,660
Feeling like a clown

165
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,100
Some guy's in my lane

166
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,120
Put a bullet through his window pane

167
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,500
Pull into the lot

168
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,640
Got them horses, got my favorite spot

169
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,780
Greeting everyone

170
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,380
Trying to act, trying to act dumb

171
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,560
I don't belong here

172
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,860
But then of course the question is then where?

173
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm plagued by one great doubt

174
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,280
It's become what my life's all about

175
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,740
If I had done that

176
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,200
I wouldn't have to do this

177
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,980
If I had done that

178
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,240
I wouldn't have to do this

179
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,020
If I had done that

180
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,360
Get up out of bed

181
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,540
Shower on my head

182
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
Throwing back a cup

183
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,280
Trying to wake up

184
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,440
Slapping across town

185
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,680
Feeling like a clown

186
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,080
Some guy's in my lane

187
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,140
Put a bullet through his window pane

188
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,000
Put a bullet through his window pane

189
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm plagued by one great doubt

190
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,540
It's become what my life's all about

191
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:06,920
It's become what my life's all about

192
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,140
If I had done that

193
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,320
I wouldn't have to do this

194
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,340
If I had done that

195
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,480
I wouldn't have to do this

196

No, I don't want to drop him.

391
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,160
Hello? Test, test, Dave.

392
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,880
Test, test, test, test.

393
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,740
There, there, okay.

394
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:21,980
There you go.

395
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,980
Monsonaris time.

396
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,580
Once again, the old land of the Monsonaris diseases.

397
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,900
I've got this sneaking suspicion

398
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,980
that we're pretty soon in this decade,

399
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,220
we're not going to be able to make fun of religion anymore.

400
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,320
You're going to be out of work, Stang.

401
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,360
Well, I'm not making fun of religion.

402
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,580
Who's making fun of religion?

403
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm promoting, I'm promoting a religion

404
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,220
that can encompass all other religions.

405
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,180
Do you get checked from the NRA?

406
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,440
Because we're a bunch of subgeniuses,

407
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
so we'll believe anything.

408
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,360
Yeah.

409
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,540
Yeah, I mean, no, wait.

410
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,240
Do you get checked from the NRA

411
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,820
or any other people like that?

412
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,880
Uh...

413
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,220
Come on now, wake up, bro.

414
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,980
You know it's true.

415
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,200
You know it's true.

416
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,160
Not big enough to report, no.

417
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,080
No.

418
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,440
No.

419
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,520
Well, that's what many have said

420
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,040
about your sexual Monsonaris,

421
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,660
it's not too big to report.

422
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,380
And that's why everybody in every small town

423
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,360
knew how large or enormously small I was.

424
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,700
And it's not right.

425
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,500
That is not right.

426
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,140
You know what I mean?

427
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,540
No, that's not right at all.

428
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,300
I mean, I don't know, it's a very small town,

429
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,300
but I don't know everybody I see.

430
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,520
People smirk at me and stuff.

431
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,720
I don't even know who they are.

432
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,160
That's not right.

433
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,580
Well, they probably don't know who you are either, Dave.

434
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,560
Oh, I don't know who I are either, Dave.

435
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, you know, Dave,

436
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,740
we're just unlearning oppressive behaviors

437
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,260
and decolonizing our minds.

438
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,660
Because, you know, we reek of privilege.

439
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm sorry.

440
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,580
I need to stay in my lane.

441
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,040
Yeah.

442
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,500
It's true.

443
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,860
If I say anything on this show,

444
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,260
if it's stepping out of place,

445
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,200
let me know so I can make apologies and erase it.

446
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,720
That's the problem, though, that you won't,

447
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,880
because you are going to be,

448
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,040
you will be attempted to at least stop you

449
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,680
from doing these things as long as they can right now,

450
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,780
you know, in real time.

451
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,300
But you see, Dave,

452
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,920
my ignorance has caused harm in the past.

453
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,480
If I don't call out my friends today, who will?

454
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,720
That's true.

455
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,920
Makes you kind of wonder.

456
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,740
Well, you know,

457
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,600
it's because realizing the extent of my own privilege

458
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,860
is a conscious excavation.

459
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,300
I'm inherently violent.

460
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,520
Acknowledging the harm I've caused is a painful,

461
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,140
it's a painful experience, Dave.

462
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,460
You're ultra-violent, you're purple,

463
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,600
or you're ultra-violent like in Clockwork Orange,

464
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,180
or you're what?

465
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,020
Well, you know,

466
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,820
I don't know.

467
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,460
I don't think we really make ourselves feel better

468
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,380
by putting on safety pins and announcing that we're allies.

469
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,240
Well, I'm afraid you're right.

470
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,860
I shouldn't be in charge of anything.

471
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,300
God, if you ever said anything,

472
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,960
it's definitely so much sense to me.

473
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,140
I'm the worst.

474
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,580
You are.

475
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,080
My parents made a moral error when they conceived me.

476
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,280
He has his father's eyes.

477
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Just my identity causes violence.

478
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,900
You mean like if you walk into a room

479
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,220
and they're eating pan-fried Texas-style steaks,

480
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,480
they're ultra-rare on every side and everything like that,

481
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,940
and you announce to the world you're coming in,

482
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,200
you got six guns, one on each blazing hip,

483
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,800
for the other...

484
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,800
Well...

485
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,500
What happens then?

486
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,160
Then I renounce my masculinity

487
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,800
because it's an unhealable illness.

488
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:02,960
No.

489
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,420
You're supposed to renounce Satan.

490
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,700
Renounce Satan.

491
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,800
I was infected with racism at birth,

492
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,520
and it's gonna take me the rest of my life to get over it.

493
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,940
I'm sorry for my unkind.

494
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,600
You're not a very kind person to be...

495
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,800
I don't know what you're basically talking about,

496
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,180
but in the clouds, I do wonder and do kind of spread asunder

497
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,780
and do believe you're onto something real deep, man.

498
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,940
Well, I'm not a very kind person.

499
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:32,940


500
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,460
Well, you know, this is just one example

501
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,420
of a long history of violence and erasure

502
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,860
and appropriation and shaming and hatred.

503
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm so sorry.

504
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,160
I'm a plague on society.

505
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,580
And even my tears are a form of emotional and psychological violence.

506
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,620
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,940
Well, I shouldn't do...

508
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,540
You...

509
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,260
I've learned of things I shouldn't have done,

510
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,680
and I just didn't realize.

511
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,720
It's been an amazing learning experience,

512
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,820
and I'm sorry.

513
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,760
But what kind of a political spectrum do you represent?

514
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,680
Because I'm getting those weird-looking, like,

515
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,760
flashes over the phone that, like, somebody's not listening.

516
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,000
I don't know what you would call it.

517
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,560
Can you hear me?

518
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,580
I self-identify as a puppy.

519
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,480
You self-identify as a...

520
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,520
You self-identify as a...

521
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,180
...self-identify as a puppy?

522
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,600
Yeah.

523
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,860
And who cleans up your poo-poo?

524
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,140
A sad puppy.

525
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,560
Who cleans up your sad poo-poo, sad puppy?

526
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,880
I'm...

527
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm inherently violent.

528
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,120
No one.

529
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,340
David, if any of that...

530
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,300
The church hierarchy...

531
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,500
...didn't sound exactly like Reverend Stang.

532
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:50,960
It was...

533
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:51,920
He was...

534
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,000
He was copping lines from social justice puppies.

535
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,360
I'm outing you.

536
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,160
Oh.

537
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,820
No, I forget the name of the guy that wrote this.

538
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,220
You're out.

539
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,940
Yeah.

540
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm outing you.

541
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,600
I'm an outie.

542
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,240
I'm an outie.

543
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,620
No, man.

544
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,820
I'm actually an innie.

545
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm in with the in crowd.

546
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,020
Well, keep eating those pork chops and fried chicken and you'll be...

547
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,380
You'll...

548
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,580
The in crowd at the Stumble Inn is my favorite one.

549
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,720
Is that a real place that we've been before?

550
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,380
In Dallas.

551
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah.

552
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,900
This is real.

553
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,700
It was a real place in Dallas.

554
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
But, yeah.

555
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,140
I'm sorry, Dave.

556
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,520
I'm sorry, Dave.

557
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,520


558
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,520


559
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,020
I don't know if any of the listeners in the Cleveland area remember the Big Egg.

560
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,560
The Big Egg?

561
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,240
You remember the Big Egg?

562
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,800
I remember the Big Egg, of course.

563
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,540
Right down the street from...

564
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,080
The breakfast place?

565
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes.

566
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,220
Wasn't he a Spider-Man villain?

567
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:47,980
The Big Egg.

568
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,020
Yeah, the Big Egg.

569
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,020


570
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,560
Yeah, he used to hang out at the Public Theater Annex.

571
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,880
Right by Cleveland Public Theater.

572
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,880
Across from Anon.

573
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,140
Right by the Annex there.

574
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:56,640
Yeah.

575
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,400
And there were like four or five women that weighed well over 300 pounds.

576
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:01,500
Yeah.

577
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,500


578
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,500


579
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,500


580
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,500


581
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,180
which was really, really, really weird.

582
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,400
Yes.

583
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,380
Firstly, they could, like, load up plates of trays on their armpits.

584
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,020
Yes.

585
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,500
Like, they were walking like they were jocular,

586
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,460
dancing around some kind of ancient dance, you know?

587
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,080
He speaks truth.

588
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,060
This was a topless restaurant, right?

589
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,700
Well, it was like a headless horse restaurant.

590
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,540
Oh, man, if it was topless, that would be like a really bad dream.

591
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,580
They don't even have heads.

592
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,480
Yeah, especially if somebody was in the mammalian stupor,

593
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,940
whatever you call it, when you're giving milk, you know?

594
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,800
I haven't donated my sperm species in five weeks,

595
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,420
so I'm clean, I'm good to go.

596
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,940
I meet all the criteria, all the stamps are passed up and standardized.

597
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,940
You listening, ladies?

598
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,540
Yeah.

599
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,620
Dave's ready to make a deposit any time.

600
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm not sure of what.

601
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,500
What do you mean you're not sure of what?

602
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,800
I taste the nervous agony and the psychological disunity in your voice there.

603
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,460
I see what you're trying to say.

604
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,780
You're saying that I don't have no sperms, right?

605
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,160
No.

606
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,500
No, no, not at all.

607
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,760
We were advertising the fact that you had finally built up some

608
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,160
and were ready to let go, you know, and man up.

609
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm ready to come back.

610
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,700
I'm ready to colonize and repopulate your computer.

611
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,820
I'm going to stand up and sit down and shut up again because I can't get started.

612
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,580
But believe you me, I'm going to...

613
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,440
Haven't you heard of eugenics, man?

614
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,960
Sure.

615
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,280
Yeah.

616
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,580
Sure, that's sort of like...

617
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,720
Look like me, talk like me, smell like me, and all that stuff.

618
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
So you want to make more little Daves?

619
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,840
Yeah.

620
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,100
I need protections.

621
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,540
Well, ladies...

622
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,320
Ladies, get on down to the Dunsome Lowboy Cave in Ashtabula,

623
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,940
and there you'll find Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

624
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,920
Hey, how'd you like that name for your hotel, Dunsome Lowboy Cave?

625
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,360
Yeah, I like that.

626
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,680
Oh, I like that. It's a good name, yeah.

627
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,280
Yeah.

628
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,860
It kind of describes what's going on, but it's more illusionary, A-L-L-usionary,

629
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,960
not I-L-L-U-A-sionary.

630
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,820
You know, crazy.

631
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,420
Creates an illusion.

632
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,740
It's a cave where they've done some lowboy.

633
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,120
Yeah, and there's chicken spread there, too, and they had a whole bunch of topical ointments.

634
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,360
I remember they were selling...

635
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,220
There were a lot of stands that cost too much money, you know what I mean?

636
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,620
Yeah.

637
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,660
A lot of people just couldn't afford to have a space this year at the fair.

638
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,320
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

639
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,220
No.

640
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,380
I don't either.

641
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
You got me totally lost, Dave.

642
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,820
Why not?

643
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,820
Don't ask me why we don't understand what you're saying.

644
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,060
I was trying so hard.

645
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm sorry, man.

646
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,980
I'm inherently violent.

647
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,560
That's right.

648
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,260
I forgot.

649
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,760
A reek of privilege, man.

650
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,240
Hey, who's that?

652
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,520
The president of SIAM or somebody originally from Ashtabula?

653
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,560
What?

654
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,420
What?

655
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,480
The president of SIAM.

656
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,880
Now, is that the one they call Thailand now?

657
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:44,480
Thailand has finally agreed to have medicinal marijuana and get away from its...

658
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:52,380
Back to its old, old, old Chinese medicine style medicine and get away from the DEA-enforced

659
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:58,100
American view of getting rid of marijuana and said now they're going to get back into

660
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,520
research.

661
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,080
All they have to do is just...

662
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,320
Well, what's up before the French and the British and the Americans came over there

663
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,160
and ruined everything?

664
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
That's my opinion.

665
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,600
You know, Dave, actually, it's funny.

666
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:21,200
I worked in China for six weeks in Beijing in the 80s, and these college students that

667
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,340
were traveling around China on a bus told me that they'd looked out the window along

668
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,060
the highway and saw these endless fields of...

669
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,960
Marijuana growing.

670
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,820
Now, I guess we might call that hemp, but they made the bus driver stop and they ran

671
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,780
over and gathered a whole bunch of it.

672
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,840
They were so excited.

673
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:47,180
Now, probably what they were gathering was what we might call highway dirt weed.

674
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:55,160
But when I was walking down the street, I suddenly knew somehow that there was somebody

675
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,620
smoking hashish right around me.

676
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,060
And I looked down and there was a...

677
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,060


678
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,820
There was a little man who didn't look like a Han Chinese.

679
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,940
He looked ethnical, like a Tibetan or something.

680
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,300
And he was sitting there crouched and smoking on a little pipe.

681
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,160
And it was full of marijuana.

682
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,640
Wow.

683
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,960
I thought, well, they were supposedly...

684
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,920
See, if you got caught with marijuana in China in those days, they'd shoot you in a stadium

685
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,980
and then charge your...

686
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,180
And they'd charge your family for the bullet.

687
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,460
But I guess it was okay if it was a Tibetan just smoking guangua or whatever he happened

688
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,080
to call it.

689
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,680
Is that why they hate Tibetans?

690
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,020
Well, I don't know.

691
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,260
So they were getting away with murder.

692
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:54,620
And I heard that they legalized hemp growing in Ohio and also Texas, which means they

693
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:59,560
have to test everything because what you're smoking or carrying in your car might just

694
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,500
be legal hemp.

695
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,520
Plain old ordinary hemp.

696
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,400
Plus more states now have legalized legislations.

697
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,200
This is Arizona.

698
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,900
In Arizona, there's a fly trap of...

699
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,820
I'm sorry, go right.

700
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,520
Yeah.

701
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:15,940
Yeah.

702
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:25,240
You wouldn't believe some of the deals that we're making for branding CBD out of...

703
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,540
Well, a certain subgenius who lives in the legalizing state of New York.

704
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:29,540


705
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:29,540


706
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:39,040
Nevada is planning to use a brand name that I own for one of those products.

707
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,780
Yeah.

708
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,940
Yeah.

709
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,700
And we should even get sort of paid for it.

710
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,220
But the important thing is, Dave, I renounced drugs a long, long, long time ago.

711
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,320
Yeah, like three weeks ago.

712
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,120
No, no.

713
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,420
I mean, when I was like five, six years old, I said, no, I'm just not going to do any more

714
00:44:59,420 --> 00:44:59,520
than that.

715
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,840
I'm not going to take a big old hefty puff of that, even though I'm three and a half

716
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,940
years old and I got my...

717
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,220
It was weird, like sailor pants and everything.

718
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:06,780
Right.

719
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,440
And the cute little hat.

720
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,360
Cute little hat.

721
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:09,740
Well, yeah.

722
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:10,880
Yeah.

723
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,100
All the other kids were, but I...

724
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,100
My mama used to dress you up as a monkey because you would stop teasing the other kids and

725
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,980
radicalize them.

726
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,500
Sometimes you dress up like Lenine, the famed Russian revolutionary.

727
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,740
You know, they have a little goatee and everything and you give speeches.

728
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,800
I don't know.

729
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,700
They used to call me Little Lord Fropleroy.

730
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,060
But then when I was, like I say, when I was about five, I decided to swear off that stuff

731
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,560
and I quit.

732
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,480
But Dave, I have to confess something to you.

733
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,600
No, you don't.

734
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:40,720
Okay.

735
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,740
But I'm going to anyway.

736
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,040
I'm messed up on...

737
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,880
I'm messed up tonight.

738
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,900
I came in to the station.

739
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,620
It's against the rules, but I came into the station under the influence of...

740
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,820
Well, I'm messed up on apps.

741
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,820
Man, I'm messed up on apps.

742
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,140
He can't stop, man.

743
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,000
He's hooked.

744
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,480
He's hooked.

745
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,340
His brain is cooked.

746
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,840
He can't stop.

747
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,400
Yeah.

748
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,400
I've actually...

749
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Yeah, it is the worst thing you can do, actually, man.

750
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,420
I was...

751
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,520
I've been apped up all weekend.

752
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,060
I know it's an appdiction, I guess you could say.

753
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,160
You know, Dave, it's like in that book, Neighbor World.

754
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,860
Who wrote that?

755
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,700
Was it Kurt Vonnegut or somebody?

756
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,060
Oh, that's really a piece of futuristic literature.

757
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:21,960
Yeah.

758
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,140
Neighbor World, the novel by Kurt Vonnegut.

759
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,980
Is it Kurt Vonnegut?

760
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,800
Joseph Heller?

761
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,420
Thomas Pynchon?

762
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,200
One of those guys.

763
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,260
Some huge name in weirdo literature.

764
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,760
Won't your cowboy Dave meet?

765
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,480
William Burroughs?

766
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,580
No, Anthony Burgess wrote Neighbor World.

767
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:40,900
It's me.

768
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,420
Anyway, well, anyway, this one weird book...

769
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,320
Listen to this penguin on the back of the train.

770
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,820
People in it get high off of these light patterns.

771
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,680
They call it looming.

772
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,100
They get loomed in this book.

773
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,660
And...

774
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:05,320
I think I understand exactly what that's like because I've gotten to where I can't

775
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:12,800
stop getting these new little apps that when I push buttons on them, they make these colors

776
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,820
and these images and stuff.

777
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,940
And I just, you know, I can't stop.

778
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,160
I use up all the...

779
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,480
It's not just a dream, it's ugly reality, which have encroached in all of our synapses

780
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,440
together.

781
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,180
At one time, they just got in there and just co-opted everything to the point where there

782
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,340
is now a stem sublim and you can get loomed.

783
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,800
Why smoke a joint or drink a beer if you can just go and look, stare at a light pattern

784
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,640
for about five seconds and the next thing you know, you're...

785
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:53,400
Well, so far, I haven't like just put it on automatic where it just totally automatically

786
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,380
generates images.

787
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:55,940
I...

788
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,800
You don't want to do that anyway.

789
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,700
I still have some control over it.

790
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,740
I can pick the base image and, you know, but I...

791
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:11,620
It's like I use up all the tricks in hyperspective and then you have to get a new app or pay for

792
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,020
more hyperspective.

793
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:13,700
It is.

794
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,960
And then you got...

795
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,620
Then it was like, well, this isn't enough.

796
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,900
Now I need pixel loop.

797
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,800
And so you get really, really pixel looped.

798
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,940
But you use up all the images...

799
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:24,940
All the filters.

800
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:25,920
Yeah.

801
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,220
And the filters and things in that, the generators in it, and you have to spend money to get

802
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:32,860
new ones.

803
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,300
So the next thing you know, you're just, you know, you're robbing convenience stores to

804
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,420
pay for your new app.

805
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:49,940
Plus they also, in each of these newly released apps, they create commands for you to go out

806
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,900
and shoot people and stuff.

807
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,540
Things like that.

808
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,120
Oh, I didn't know about that.

809
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,280
Yeah.

810
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,060
All they ever made me want to do is...

811
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,060


812
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,120
You don't know because they haven't called you.

813
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,740
They haven't...

814
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,940
Go 645-4789.

815
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,400
You can call Stang anytime.

816
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,460
And then they do that a couple of times and they dance around and look real sissy, man.

817
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,960
And then you're like an Ashtabulean candidate.

818
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,200
You've been programmed, right?

819
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,300
Yeah.

820
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,100
So they'll tell you...

821
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:22,940
The messages in the looms tell you to go to the Walmart with a assault rifle.

822
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,740
And then you're like, you know, you're a real asshole.

823
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


824
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


825
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


826
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


827
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


828
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


829
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,740


830
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,060
And walk around looking like a big tough man.

831
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:36,320
Dave, Reverend Stang has been doing this app thing and becoming so hap, app happy that

832
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,200
he's starting to become this sort of a glowing orange color.

833
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,800
He's actually turning into an app-ricot.

834
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,560
No, that...

835
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,460
No, no.

836
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,440
Princess, wait.

837
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,780
That's...

838
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,880
It's called augmented...

839
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,940
I like that phrase, man.

840
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,320
It's called augmented reality.

841
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:52,960
Do you like apricot?

842
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,740
Augmented reality.

843
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,380
Augmented reality.

844
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,300
Oh, yeah.

845
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:55,900
I see.

846
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,040
But you can augment your reality in a customized way.

847
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:07,840
You know, I saw an app today, I don't have it yet, but that you can build little things

848
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,240
that you add to your reality that you see through your phone.

849
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:11,960
Oh.

850
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,480
So for instance, I could program it to where everybody that I looked at had Bob's face.

851
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,560
Or one of those skull faces.

852
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:22,940
Or one of those...

853
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,160
Like in They Live.

854
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,120
Wasn't...

855
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,640
Those Republican skull faces in They Live.

856
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,400
Remember those?

857
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,180
Yes.

858
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:29,520
Yeah.

859
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,040
I thought Puzzling Evidence was doing that quite a long time ago.

860
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,120
What, giving commands?

861
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,980
Programming things into his phone that would come into every picture he took, like spaceships

862
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,440
and...

863
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,520
No, actually, I used to do that a long time ago.

864
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,160
Oh.

865
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,200
On a video camera.

866
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:50,880
Yeah, you could take a picture of a dog's head, but it didn't automatically map onto

867
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,360
anything.

868
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:51,960
Oh.

869
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,900
Your thing...

870
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:52,940
Your thing...

871
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


872
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


873
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


874
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


875
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


876
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


877
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:52,940


878
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,420
Trademark G did that.

879
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:06,320
He used a Kinect camera, or one of those video game systems that follows your motion.

880
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,060
And he used that.

881
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,100
He set it up at X Day at the campground.

882
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,000
Everyone who walked in front of his camera could see a mirror, a giant image of themselves

883
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,960
on the screen.

884
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,920
But with the dog's head.

885
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,480
Only they all had Bob's head.

886
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,640
There'd be five or six people standing there dancing.

887
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:22,920
Wow.

888
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:22,920


889
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,960
And they'd all have Bob's head, and he was always looking at you.

890
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,380
So if you turned around, his head remained like an owl.

891
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,520
It could swivel all the way around.

892
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,280
It was creepy.

893
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,120
Yeah.

894
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,300
And fun.

895
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:42,380
Well, thank goodness for articles of faith like that to keep us, our minds, unencumbered

896
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,460
and clearly on the prize, whatever it might be, like maybe third prize, hopefully.

897
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,280
Yeah.

898
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,360
Well, you know, we send out...

899
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,700
We add subliminal messages to our...

900
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:59,460
Oh, there's music in the background is the Flyin' Ryan Brothers, and it's packed with

901
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,700
subliminals too.

902
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,800
But they're pretty...

903
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,880
They're actually not real harmful ones.

904
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,760
They're subliminals that make you want to do things like pick up trash on the highway

905
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,320
and plant trees and admit that you're inherently violent and that kind of thing.

906
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,580
You know?

907
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,200
Yeah.

908
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,260
And this show, of course, is constantly programming all of its listeners to...

909
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,500
Well, it's a dog whistle, basically.

910
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,220
Yeah, it is in there, and right here as well.

911
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,060
The believers know what we're saying.

912
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,980
Well, that's why I was asking if you think it's going to be a great crime or problem

913
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,860
to tease or poke religion at fun at.

914
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:52,200
I believe that the administration is trying to push through a...

915
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,440
some sort of bill or law that would make...

916
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,480
make it illegal to criticize conservatives or...

917
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,520
because that's censorship, you know?

918
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:11,040
Or repeating what they say or talking about them in any way except as gods.

919
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,400
That's going to be illegal on the internet.

920
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,360
Well, did you know that the crimes...

921
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,180
It's to prevent, you know, it's to prevent the liberal media from lying about it.

922
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,320
Well, it's to prevent them from lying about it.

923
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,200
Well, you know, liberals are very much into making and distorting everything.

924
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:29,540
It's like basically you won't be able to say anything that's liberal or scientific.

925
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:37,340
Well, you know, liberals give you commands to go into restaurant districts and start shooting randomly at your family and stuff.

926
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,900
Yeah, but with a camera.

927
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:39,900
And they just call that left wing.

928
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,380
Yeah, but no, they teach...

929
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,420
They're programming you to shoot selfies with their cameras.

930
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,720
You see, that's different.

931
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,120
Well, that's what they want you to do.

932
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,860
Can't you see what's happened?

933
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,660
Can't you see what they've done?

934
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,020
They've inserted the wrong quagmire.

935
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,380
Oh, you mean...

936
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,860
Not the wrong quagmire, please.

937
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,200
Well, it's like...

938
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:07,720
Well, you mean they're kind of like somebody changed the program from to use your iPhone to use your rifle with a scope and a bump stock?

939
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,280
Yeah.

940
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,540
And a bazooka and a pitchfork on the end that shoots knives?

941
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,220
Radioactive poison knives?

942
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,160
With quantum entanglement that turns everybody into walking dead zombies?

943
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,360
And werewolves, too.

944
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,820
Werewolf zombie walking deads?

945
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,120
Yeah, man.

946
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,640
That's what they're programming.

947
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,020
That's the way I want to go out.

948
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,320
That's what we just programmed.

949
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:47,700
Any listener kind of roughly under the age of 25 or so, and anyone with dementia or Alzheimer's, which is about the same thing as being under 25.

950
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,520
Which could be 250 years old as far as we know, you know?

951
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,360
Some of those Brazilian native people are like that.

952
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,300
Yeah.

953
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,020
They just get old forever.

954
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,040
Right.

955
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:05,300
And they go further into the Amazon jungle when Grandpa, that's not Grandpa, that's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandpa, and he's waving goodbye.

956
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,140
And they still bend these...

957
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,580
And they go play with the monkeys.

958
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:16,460
Yeah, they live to be 190 and they still smoke and drink and play with monkeys and do a lot of...

959
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,180
And isn't that...

960
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,680
That means...

961
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,920
But they also don't drive cars and they're kind of physically active all the time.

962
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,700
Well, the monkey drivers are just like golf carts and they just go in that one little area there.

963
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:38,720
Well, that's why you see so many obese monkeys that can't walk anymore because they're so used to driving those stupid little carts around.

964
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
They started out perfectly healthy.

965
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,000
Now look at them.

966
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,200
They look like Walmart shoppers.

967
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,680
Yeah.

968
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,640
No offense, folks.

969
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,680
I have spent lots of money at Walmart.

970
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:54,840
Right.

971
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,360
You got the walker out yourself quite a few times.

972
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:58,460
Yeah.

973
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,440
I bought a lot of walkers at Walmart.

974
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,380
I have to get a new one every three months.

975
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,580
They wear out so fast the way I use them.

976
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,260
I got to buy the cheap ones, you know, the really, really cheap.

977
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,540
Well, they're all cheap now, but there's a bunch of new lines on the market.

978
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,400
That doesn't mean there's any different kind of products.

979
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,000
It just means there's lines in the market, whatever the hell that is.

980
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,360
But there's new lines in the market and some of them are even dangerous to behold.

981
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,180
Oh, Dave, Dave, I have something I wanted to play for you.

982
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,260
Oh, okay.

983
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,720
I can hardly wait.

984
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,320
While you could hear it on the phone.

985
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,360
Well, first, okay, let me see.

986
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,000
First, I'm going to play the last Lemur thing.

987
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,680
I think.

988
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,480
Is there a drum in it?

989
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,540
Here we go.

990
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,760
First, it's a little, oh, it's a restaurant song.

991
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,400
It's only 23 minutes long.

992
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,460
But then after that, wait until you hear the song I'm going to play.

993
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,300
It's by my dog, Claudia.

994
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,460
Claudia Gabriel Tire Biter St. Clair.

995
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,300
But first, the restaurant song.

996
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,000
Let's go to a restaurant.

997
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,140
In them, they're all cotton fields at home.

998
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,480
We're the man love restaurant.

999
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,640
Strangers in the restaurant make the day complete.

1000
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,820
Now give me my pills.

1001
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,880
Down, Claudia.

1002
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,780
Down, Claudia.

1003
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,860
Now we're not going for a walk.

1004
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,300
Right now.

1005
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,940
No, we're not going for a walk right now.

1006
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,960
Geez, how can she do that?

1007
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,060
That is just amazing, isn't it?

1008
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,620
That's my little girl.

1009
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,180
All right.

1010
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,100
Okay.

1011
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,520
So there you go, Dave.

1012
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,460
What do you think about that?

1013
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,020
Are you talking to me in real time?

1014
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,440
Are you talking to me in reality time?

1015
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,780
I'm talking to you in real augmented reality time on the radio.

1016
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,920
As a squire or as one of us commoners?

1017
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,200
Why not both?

1018
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,520
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1019
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,200
This is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1020
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,660
And why not all?

1021
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,940
And Princess Wee Ardo, queen of all the UFOs.

1022
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,160
And it's the hour of slack.

1023
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,000
And if you want to know more about the Church of the Subgenius or any of the other things,

1024
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,160
you can go to the radio section of the radio.

1025
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,120
And you can find the stuff we were playing while you just look online at subgenius.com.

1026
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:56,180
And on the radio section, it has text logs and lists of everything we play.

1027
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,560
So you can Google them using the right spelling.

1028
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:05,920
And that way you can find Neighbor World and other things at subgenius.com.

1029
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:06,920
Yeah.

1030
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,820
And watch out for don't get messed up on apps, you kids.

1031
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,500
No, don't get messed up on apps.

1032
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,220
Well, I guess I won't tell you one thing.

1033
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,060
Tell us.

1034
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,560
Go ahead.

1035
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:20,200
Don't tell me.

1036
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,120
I forgot what I was going to say.

1037
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,300
And it was kind of like on the humorous side, hopefully.

1038
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:30,440
I was going to tickle some ribs out there somehow and lay a few plops on the old milkshake

1039
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,320
and bring things back where they shouldn't be.

1040
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,340
Well, speaking of things where they shouldn't be, where's Dr. Sinister?

1041
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,400
Dr. Sinister is here.

1042
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,960
He's here.

1043
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:40,800
I'm here.

1044
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:40,800


1045
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:40,800


1046
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:40,800


1047
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,880
I let him in the door.

1048
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,260
Doctor, doctor.

1049
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,660
Remotely, I walked over and I pushed the button and let him in.

1050
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,980
So he's in the building.

1051
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,560
I think he's picking out some jams to rock out on.

1052
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,220
And then Brother Love went and let him in the door.

1053
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,680
I think he's picking out some jams.

1054
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,040
Sounds like he's kicking out the clams, if you know what I'm saying.

1055
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,900
So he's not picking his toe jams.

1056
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,940
Well, what about Wahira El-Santayami?

1057
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,040
Everything he's had.

1058
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,060
Parabarabai-larabarabai-kansar.

1059
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,100
Wahiro El-Santayama.

1060
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,280
El-Santayama.

1061
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,140
That means Wahiro the sound calls you to dance, to sing.

1062
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,740
Well, look, man, we got to get out of here.

1063
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,520
It's after, the hour's been more than up.

1064
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,160
And I've got apps to play with.

1065
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,600
It's over an hour of slack now.

1066
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,400
Yeah, man.

1067
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,040
It's an hour and three minutes of slack.

1068
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,020
It's an hour and three minutes of slack.

1069
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah, man.

1070
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,160
It's the slag.

1071
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,360
And the hours of slag just go on for hours and hours.

1072
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,120
Little Claudia's trilling at home wondering where we are.

1073
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:54,620
Right.

1074
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,540
Maybe he went there into the bathroom and didn't come out.

1075
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,980
Maybe somebody should go bang on one of the stalls and say, hey, could you please hurry

1076
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,240
up?

1077
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:08,320
Claudia's at home and they're just, she doesn't have any.

1078
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,900
She's going, meeeel.

1079
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,020
Oh, my God.

1080
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1081
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1082
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1083
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1084
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1085
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1086
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1087
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1088
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1089
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1090
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1091
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1092
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1093
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,020


1094
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,740
Oh, my God.

1095
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,580
Oh, my God.

1096
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:15,660
Oh, my God.

1097
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,860
I'm coming, man.

1098
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,100
That is a talkative dog.

1099
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,720
That was a pretty good romance, Dave.

1100
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:20,560
Okay.

1101
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,520
Okay, man, we got to get out of here.

1102
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:23,720
I'm going to kill you, Dave.

1103
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:31,460
Okay, see you, see you, Pilton.

1104
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,340
Don't kill Dave.

1105
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,160
Dave, thanks for calling in, by the way.

1106
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,380
Yeah.

1107
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,280
Okay, well, um, and, uh, now this.

1108
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,560
Well, we've certainly missed you, Dave.

1109
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1110
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1111
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1112
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1113
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1114
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1115
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1116
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1117
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:45,560


1118
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,060
enjoyed this

1119
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,420
edition of the

1120
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,260
Hour of Whatever It Is

1121
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,940
on radio, whatchamacallit.

1122
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,660
And we hope

1123
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,240
that you'll

1124
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,460
remember what you heard.

1125
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,540
You will remember that thing

1126
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,880
you can't remember. It's that whatchamacallit,

1127
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,060
that thing that...

1128
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,700
That thing that you do, that hoodoo

1129
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,520
that you do so well, that

1130
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,440
the thing...

1131
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,240
The voodoo book you find in the dark alley.

1132
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,560
The synthesis of

1133
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,400
hour of slack and...

1134
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,440
The thing's next six exits.
