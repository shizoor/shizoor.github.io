1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
Oh, we're in the middle of a slag.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,660
Yeah, I'm chasing you.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,900
Here they come now.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,940
I surrendered.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,340
Blow your speakers out.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,260
It's the Buzzly Evidence Show.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,740
Welcome to the show.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,040
Come on down, Buzzly Evidence.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,620
Come on down, Dr. Al.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,360
Come on down, Milo Drummer.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,360
And our special guest star, I would say.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,400
Come on down, Caller 1, Caller 2, Caller 3.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,900
Oh, wait, no, Caller.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,640
I just want to say I love what you crazy, wonderful, beautiful kids are doing.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,780
I'm behind you all the way.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,080
When those women in those tube tops run down the aisle, it's just crazy.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,100
From PR News in Washington, I'm positive but pleading not guilty.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,600
President Obama is responding to disappointing news.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,520
If we're going to, and if we're going to, then we're going to have to do more.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,960
PR's concern.

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,160
Hugh Johnson describes PR News this way.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,920
No matter how you look at it, very, very weak, despite the fact we got.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,600
But Johnson says that's because.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,860
Some folks are becoming discouraged.

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,820
For six months or longer.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,420
PR News, Washington.

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,440
The BP oil spill is guilty.

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,200
PR reports the oil giant was arrested for obstruction of justice.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,400
A federal grand jury indictment says.

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,980
BP deleted an investigation of the spill.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,960
Meanwhile, a New Orleans federal judge set a January date for the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,380
Some 200 million gallons of oil gushed into PR News.

33
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,700
The latest from Wall Street.

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,120
157.

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,420
You're listening to PR News.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,180
The race for the White House and the world of NASCAR will cross paths this weekend in Talladega.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,620
NASCAR fans never vote in presidential elections.

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,800
If they don't like where we're headed as a country.

39
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,020
They want to see things take a different path.

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,160
They don't have the ability to do that.

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,680
Your news, Tuscaloosa.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,480
Canada has submitted a new application by way of Western Canada.

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,540
A move that drew scathing criticism from Republicans.

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,820
At last, check on Wall Street.

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,600
13,054.

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,500
2,963.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,980
513.71.

48
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,480
This is PR.

49
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,120
Just came out.

50
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,960
What city now?

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
I don't know what city.

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,520
Yeah, the other caller is trying to get in your brain.

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,240
Like a little collar wormhole.

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,020
And the collar worms, though, are pretty good.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,720
You pull them out of the caller's ears and the callers can actually hear again.

56
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,060
And you can eat the worms and share them with me.

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,720
Golf.

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,640
Now go, you're done.

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,300
I ate a worm once.

60
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,080
But if you hippos will not eat a worm.

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,540
I ate a worm once.

62
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,860
You were a worm once.

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,140
We were all worms once.

64
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,720
And to wormhood we will go again.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,780
Because the great circle of life.

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,280
We hope.

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,940
From the worm.

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,620
So cosmic.

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,640
To the worm.

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,180
We'll be back to the diet of worms.

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,540
So, are you guys all coming to the party at the Gavrofam house?

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,180
Yay.

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,760
Is that where the party is?

74
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,940
Because we had to.

75
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,740
We were trying to figure out where and when the party was.

76
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,340
Well, it's French toast, pancakes.

77
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,360
It's in my pants.

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,000
Bacon.

79
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,020
No, I didn't say that.

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,800
That wasn't me.

81
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,000
I know that was something I normally would have said.

82
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,260
But I didn't say it that time.

83
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Tell the world.

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,440
Breakfast.

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,120
Breakfast.

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm not a wimp.

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,420
I've gotten to where I can now vocally imitate every other radio subgenius.

88
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,080
I'm not a wimp.

89
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,240
And I've been, yeah, this has been me about half of the voices on this show.

90
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,860
I know, because I've been a sloop back here.

91
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,540
Want to hear me do Dr. Le Guin?

92
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,040
Trading favors.

93
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,340
How about Papa Joe Mama?

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
What about Papa Joe?

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
Papa Joe's been doing great.

96
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,820
I've talked to him now and then.

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,960
He's running that spook show in Tallahassee.

98
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,820
And he was.

99
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,680
Well, you saw him last X-Day.

100
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,920
We did show together last July.

101
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,740
He suddenly showed up looking fit as a fiddle.

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,440
Ten years younger than the rest of us because he is at least that much younger.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,600
And same old Papa Joe.

104
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
I've been running reruns because we're traveling.

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,580
And old Papa Joe rants surface a lot in those.

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,100
And other.

107
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,480
And recordings of this show.

108
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,740
Back when it was, you know.

109
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,660
Back before we did so much, you know.

110
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,960
Oh, yeah.

111
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,300
Show sauce.

112
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,980
So if you would like to call us, here are the phone numbers.

113
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,660
First, first, first time callers.

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
First time callers at area code, code, code.

130
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,740
East of the Rockies is

131
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,420
Toll free

132
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,300

03

145
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,660
We'll be right back.

146
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,880
Say, Philo, should we let these other guys know that we made some new rules for the show?

147
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,220
New rules? That's Bill Maher's game.

148
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,780
Yeah, because Philo and I made...

149
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,260
Exactly.

150
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,320
Well, I'm afraid that by the introduction of the rules, we may violate some of the rules.

151
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
You'll violate the rules in committee.

152
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,700
Oh, you're right.

153
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,620
And we'll see even less what we can't discuss.

154
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,320
Share tables.

155
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,900
Emotion.

156
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,800
We would be bringing it up.

157
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,320
Correct.

158
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,800
And that, by its own definition, would be wrong.

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,840
We have a list of what can be discussed.

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,560
The bench arguing with the cabinet, but the floor prevailed.

161
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,440
And a list of what must be discussed.

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,160
What cannot be discussed versus what must be discussed.

163
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm disgusted with certain things.

164
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,600
With the whole aspect of discussing.

165
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,180
Yes, me too.

166
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,840
But this show, Philo and I have jointly decided.

167
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,720
In a rebellion.

168
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,520
Shame.

169
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,720
Uh, ban subject matters are, will include.

170
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,060
Like ban practice?

171
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,860
Uh, movies.

172
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,620
Burning Man.

173
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,680
Wait a minute.

174
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,180
YouTube.

175
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,460
What are we going to talk about?

176
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,240
Catalog.

177
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,220
No catalog readings.

178
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:08,900
No cat...

179
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,580
But, but, but no catalog.

180
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,600
No, I wasn't completely settled on the catalog.

181
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,140
No memes or meme worms or brain worms.

182
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,020
We can't say rat in a box.

183
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,280
Yeah, that was a brain worm.

184
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,740
I never eat there.

185
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,080
Rat in a box was a bad brain worm and you shouldn't talk about that.

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,720
Yeah, rat in a box.

187
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,660
What we have to do is stick to YBSC.

188
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,060
The YBSC.

189
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,800
Now, I hope I don't have to do the Y part too much.

190
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,400
Why?

191
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,280
Yeah, well all you gotta remember is YBSC.

192
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,300
That's the key, the formula to success.

193
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,600
That's what we're gonna do on this show.

194
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,500
Number one, why?

195
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,300
Yelling.

196
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,300
Yelling.

197
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,740
When the background music goes loud, yelling.

198
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,620
Yelling and hell belling and shouting.

199
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,700
That's what we do.

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
Yelling and the name of the Lord in B.

201
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,500
We have to yell.

202
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,280
What is the B for?

203
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,940
I think some of you can guess.

204
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
And I'll put a, I'll give you a hint.

205
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,940
It's got a quote before the B.

206
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,120
Busy buddy blue bottle buzzcocks.

207
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,220
It's got a double quote sign before the B.

208
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,480
Oh, the double quote sign.

209
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,940
It's just to give you a little bit of a hint.

210
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
The B word starts with J-R.

211
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,320
Yeah.

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,500
And it's a three letter word.

213
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,180
Exactly.

214
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,000
That ends in B and has an O in the middle.

215
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,320
All the infidels leave the quotes out there.

216
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,360
It's a five letter word if you count the quotes.

217
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,740
Yeah, you have to count the quotes.

218
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,680
Okay, okay, friends, we'll let you in on it.

219
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,400
We're talking about Bob.

220
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,520
That guy, the man, that one guy, the guy with the pipe in the sky.

221
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,460
He, Bob has a pipe.

222
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,360
He's got dots.

223
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
He's got dots on his face.

224
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,740
You got Y-B-S-C.

225
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
What is the S for, Dr. Drummond?

226
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,100
Why, what could the S be but for slack?

227
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,020
Didn't there's something to be killed with?

228
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,200
Which is what every subgenius needs, wants, and must have to continue his existence on

229
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,660
this mortal plane.

230
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:43,920


231
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,440
Slack is the luminous cloud.

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,780
Me and ourselves, we just.

233
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,240
As Chaos be said, we must slackupy everything.

234
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,380
Slack is the soft voice.

235
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,380


236
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,380


237
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,380


238
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,380


239
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,380


240
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,780
Slackupy everything.

241
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,200
Slackupy time.

242
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,340
Slackupy your brain.

243
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
Slack is the soft voice.

244
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,180
And may slack food.

245
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,180
Slackupy.

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,840
Slackupy the bathroom.

247
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,140
But don't completely dominate the bathroom.

248
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,440
There's other family members that need to get in there.

249
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,900
Now, there's nothing metal in my headphones.

250
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,300
That's just poor taste.

251
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,420
Central, do you copy?

252
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,300
Just rude.

253
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,240
We must take this for opportunity to quote Chaos-mic moment.

254
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,360
It's not a joke.

255
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


256
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


257
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


258
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


260
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


261
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


263
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


265
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,360


266
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
cat as much as possible.

267
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,180
She may be eavesdropping

268
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,320
upon us.

269
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,000
She's probably eavesdropping right now.

270
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,560
We shall

271
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,900
slackify as best we can.

272
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,260
Nomsane? Slackify me now, Bob.

273
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,640
Slackify me now.

274
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,020
Notch? Nome?

275
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,100
This is painful. My earphones are causing an

276
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,760
ed-age.

277
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,720
We've abbreviated

278
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,920
Nome down to its

279
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,940
lowest components.

280
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,120
Other subject

281
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
matters that may be discussed

282
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,940
are being on

283
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,080
crutches and being bald.

284
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Yes.

285
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,500
Or balding.

286
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,100
If you're bald or balding, we figure that most of you guys

287
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,160
would be into that.

288
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,860
A lot of guys are into that these days.

289
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,040
This whole bald movement

290
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,140
thing, people cutting their hair

291
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,860
off to make them look like they're bald.

292
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,660
Oh, I thought you were talking about

293
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,600
the trend of one bald.

294
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,340
People

295
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,540
having surgery so that

296
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,420
they would be one bald like

297
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,020
their hero.

298
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,460
Hitler has only got one

299
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,080
bald.

300
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,600
Gering has two but very small.

301
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,900
Himmler

302
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,540
is somewhat similar.

303
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,540
And Dr. Goebbels has no balls

304
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,060
at all.

305
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,380
Now that's an old

306
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,160
old song.

307
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,440
I just learned it last

308
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,680
year. Dr. Howe taught me

309
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,080
that song.

310
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,100
I won't say why.

311
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,320
As long as they sing that

312
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,220
song, World War II will

313
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,280
not truly be awful.

314
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,340
Actually,

315
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,180
you know, I hate to say it, but I've met people

316
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
not that much younger than me who said

317
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,800
and I quote,

318
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,700
there was a World War I?

319
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,340
Yeah, like the

320
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,880
two was not preceded.

321
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,440
There was a one that was

322
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,400
preceded by a one. They never heard of the Great War

323
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,380
for Civilization.

324
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,180
They never heard of World War Zero then, I guess.

325
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

326
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,720
Neither, huh?

327
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,000
World War Zero

328
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,260
was fought with

329
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,280
atomic bombs.

330
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,280
World War Zero and a half was fought

331
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,400
with sticks and stones.

332
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,360
Then 500,000

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,420
years passed and World War I and II

334
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,820
were fought.

335
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,760
World War III

336
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,920
was fought with

337
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,500
head cones.

338
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,700
World War I hit the hat one ball.

339
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,800
And I didn't know what to put.

340
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,040
It's a biological germ

341
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,620
wolf.

342
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,680
World War III will be fought with

343
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,340
rocks by Capitola Beach.

344
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,100
There was this one rock

345
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,940
that's been following me around this whole trip.

346
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,340
It's the rock that makes you sprain your ankle.

347
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,860
And I, it was fast.

348
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,800
It was always ahead of us.

349
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,740
Just ahead of us.

350
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,260
And I defeated it

351
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,440
for weeks.

352
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,060
But it finally caught up to me that

353
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,160
fateful day at Capitola Beach.

354
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,620
The rock that wants you

355
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,480
to sprain your ankle. It got me.

356
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,260
So here I've said,

357
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,420
shaking this can

358
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,280
made me like you a wee bit.

359
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm shaking the can. Do you hear any money in it?

360
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,740
Nope. That's because you need to help out an old

361
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,360
feller who's, you know,

362
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,000
an old handicapped feller.

363
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Now, easy old timer.

364
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,160
Just sit you down here.

365
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,920
I think if these people want to give you money,

366
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
well, they would have all.

367
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,740
I ain't got no teeth, so I'm good for certain sexual

368
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,580
activities. Well, let's keep that

369
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,020
sub rosa,

370
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,700
Commander.

371
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,920
And there are other

372
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,960
portions of this show which

373
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,760
we call the credits

374
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,640
because they're part of Hour of Slack

375
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,880
and not that show, which is

376
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,140
the puzzling evidence show from KPFA

377
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,280
Berkeley from February 10th

378
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,140
con year 2012.

379
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,460
This Hour of Slack

380
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,200
number 1364

381
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
is mostly that show

382
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,980
because X Day's coming up fast

383
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,240
and I, Stang,

384
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,640
have to crank out many

385
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,780
canned and live shows

386
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,960
in advance. There might even be

387
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
reruns. That show was

388
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,840
the first one I attended after

389
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,980
the rock that wants you to

390
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
sprain your ankle finally

391
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,000
got to me. I was

392
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,700
on crutches. Anyway,

393
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,620
Reverend Cosmic Debris did

394
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,140
PR News. Ministry of

395
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,760
Slack did most everything else

396
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,740
except for this song coming up,

397
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,620
The Swingin' Love Corpses,

398
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,760
performing their 18th biggest hit,

399
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,760
The Dance of a Million

400
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,860
Dwarves.

401
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,800
Look at this.

402
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,320
Tiny short people, everyone.

403
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,040
I'm so happy for you.

404
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm so happy for me.

405
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,900
Have a stand,

406
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,420
some shit.

407
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Put a shit down,

408
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:16,940
put a shit down.

409
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:46,920
Put a shit down.

410
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:58,260
Put a shit down.

411
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:46,940
Put a shit down.

412
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,600
Put a shit down.

413
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:46,920
Put a shit down.

414
00:16:46,960 --> 00:17:15,760
Put a shit down.

415
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:46,920
Put a shit down.

416
00:17:46,960 --> 00:18:04,240
Put a shit down.

417
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,300
Put a shit down.

418
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


419
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


420
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


421
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


422
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


423
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


424
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,300


425
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,580
You know, we do have a special room

426
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,060
for that.

427
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,400
We'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

428
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,960
We will trust but verify.

429
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,120
Oh, that's so good.

430
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,780
But verify.

431
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,500
I don't know if we necessarily need to do that now.

432
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,380
That's kind of like something.

433
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,440
We'll get a medicated headshot.

434
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,000
...after the horses escape the barn,

435
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,100
if you know what I mean.

436
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,860
Press it on up there.

437
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,280
Oh, boy.

438
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,780
If you'll look down there,

439
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,260
those are horses.

440
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,360
Subgenius Sweat Lodge.

441
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
We'll pack 50 people in here

442
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,800
and charge them $10,000 a piece,

443
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,220
and when they die, we'll be famous.

444
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,120
And what will we do with the sweat?

445
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,500
Well, we'll sell that to the aliens.

446
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,400
That's what runs that in cattle tons

447
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,420
is what runs this.

448
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,000
They call it soul juice.

449
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,360
I think you can back off on that.

450
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,680
There you go.

451
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,760
Much better, much better.

452
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
These cow tongues are great.

453
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,940
It's so peaceful under these cow tongues.

454
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,380
I used to eat them all the time.

455
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,220
It's been some time since I...

456
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,480
When you get a big enough pile,

457
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,420
it's so...

458
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,280
They really dampen the sound.

459
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,320
I was really surprised.

460
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,980
But they can make sounds of their own.

461
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a deep, resonant bellow.

462
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,920
Kind of a slapping, flopping sound

463
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,260
when they've been removed

464
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,440
from their former domicile.

465
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,660
Washing in on the shore like they do.

466
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,860
The waves.

467
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,900
Waves slapping.

468
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,200
The tide is coming in.

469
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,620
Flapping.

470
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,020
Pebbles that the waves

471
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,180
chopped off.

472
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,840
Chopped off.

473
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,420
Keep washing up.

474
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,260
At their return.

475
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,660
On the shores of Canada.

476
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,440
There he is.

477
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,180
Every time he gets that ankle caught,

478
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,820
he cries like a little baby.

479
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,180
Up to high stand.

480
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,840
Begin and see.

481
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,520
This is something that you'll learn about

482
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,440
in the fourth step of Dr. Drummond's

483
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,160
patented 13th step.

484
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,460
Hey, hey, that was one of the things

485
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,740
we weren't going to talk about.

486
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,580
This was a movie.

487
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,420
No, no, no.

488
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,680
The 13th step is on the no-no list,

489
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Dr. Drummond.

490
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's a religious thing.

491
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,860
I get all caught up in 12 steps.

492
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,240
12 disciples.

493
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,760
Well, we have to remind people

494
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,680
that there's 8% more steps.

495
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
We can talk about being bald

496
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,120
and we can talk about getting,

497
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,060
being on crutches,

498
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,540
but we can't talk about

499
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,400
brain worms or memes

500
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,380
or meme worms.

501
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,080
Brain worms?

502
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,580
I should think not.

503
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
You mean like rad in a box?

504
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,460
Or 13 or 12 step programs.

505
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,320
Rad.

506
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
Or my vacation.

507
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,480
Oh, no, we can't talk all horrible.

508
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,460
I can't advertise my 12 module course

509
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,160
in success in sex and real estate

510
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,960
on this program?

511
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,280
I can't.

512
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,020
This has been withdrawn from me.

513
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,240
Well, you can.

514
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,380
It's a sad thing.

515
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,960
I was going to compare the percentage of steps

516
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,100
to remind Dr. Howe that his course only has

517
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,140
94% of the steps that Dr. Drummond's course has.

518
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,320
Yelling Bob Slack conspiracy.

519
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
Yelling Bob Slack conspiracy.

520
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,480
No more of this catalog reading.

521
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,200
No more of these 13 steps.

522
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm a sacred.

523
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,460
Correct.

524
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,360
I'm a sacred.

525
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,300
I'm a sacred.

526
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,300


527
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,300


528
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,540
Let me ask you something, Reverend Stein.

529
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,060
What would Al do?

530
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,140
That's what I'm going to ask myself.

531
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,200
What would Al swear to do?

532
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Let me ask you something, Reverend Stein.

533
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,780
He'd have you killed.

534
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,340
How many steps would you have in a program?

535
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,720
To make the program able to be spoken about,

536
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,880
how many steps would you have?

537
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,160
As many as you want,

538
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,800
but you've got to pay me a percentage

539
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,280
for one-third of the steps.

540
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,960
But there, that is the...

541
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,140
No, that's some circus thing with a zebra.

542
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,900
You should get paid by the staff.

543
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,300
One-third of the steps.

544
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,040
that's fine. I can be more close.

545
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm attempting.

546
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,940
The more steps you accomplish.

547
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,240
And not an accurate

548
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,220
or realistic one. I'll give it to Bob.

549
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,660
I'm not going to. I'm not greedy.

550
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,080
I noticed that when Reverend Stang gets the

551
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,880
first step pricing plan,

552
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,060
he changes his tune

553
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,900
rather quickly. In fact, that

554
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,980
particular one may not. He's obviously

555
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,960
been able to decipher the revenue

556
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,020
sharing opportunities.

557
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,300
It all depends on where you're from.

558
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,880
This revenue sharing opportunity is something

559
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,240
that's open to everyone.

560
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,960
This sounds like a shopping channel.

561
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,640
On this side.

562
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,780
With Batman. With the Kim Community

563
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,680
Foundation at large.

564
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,140
Here in the East Bay.

565
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,240
We've got large.

566
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,500
We've got a large, hefty-sized

567
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,720
community outreach program.

568
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,900
With our hefty bags.

569
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,940
Sad brethren.

570
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
Our sad, hefty bags.

571
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,400
With hefty mental problems.

572
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,920
Yeah, yeah.

573
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,540
Over there. Yeah.

574
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,860
Yeah, I just

575
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,040
got a question for you.

576
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,480
I saw you smoking and

577
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,000
I was just wondering

578
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,920
uh

579
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,840
that ain't FROP now

580
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,740
is it?

581
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,600
It is?

582
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:53,960
Oh!

583
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,140
Hot damn!

584
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,660
Man, this is some

585
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,800
I've never

586
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,080
seen FROP before.

587
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,140
I mean,

588
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,100
I've never tried it or anything.

589
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,740
You know.

590
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,060
Of course, I'd really like to try it, you know.

591
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,660
You know, just a little bit.

592
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,500
Just to see what it's like.

593
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,540
You know, maybe compare it to

594
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,260
something like marijuana

595
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,180
or tobacco

596
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,380
or banana peels.

597
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,440
You know, whatever.

598
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,480
But, you know, just

599
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,480
take a little bit.

600
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,500
You know, not a whole lot

601
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,020
or anything like that.

602
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,000
You know, just enough

603
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,460
to

604
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,180
give me a hit.

605
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
You know, not enough to fill up my lungs

606
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,880
or anything.

607
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,620
Just

608
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,860
for me?

609
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,060
I can try it? Really?

610
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,960
Huh! Oh, wow, man.

611
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,980
That's really

612
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,400
generous of you, man.

613
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,160
I think I will.

614
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,640
Thank you.

615
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,640
Okay.

616
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,060
Alright, I'm gonna do it.

617
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm gonna do it.

618
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,600
Oh, man.

619
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,180
I'm just really nervous here, you know.

620
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,200
I've never

621
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,040
tried F.R.O.P.

622
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,920
before, you know.

623
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,460
I don't know what it's gonna do or anything.

624
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,040
You know.

625
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,020
Okay. Alright.

626
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm really gonna

627
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
try it now.

628
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,580
It's not lit.

629
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,440
Oh, it makes it sound like it's lit.

630
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,780
It's on fumes. Okay. Alright.

631
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,160
You know, you don't have to light it for anything.

632
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,260
No, you just suck on it.

633
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,180
Alright.

634
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,880
Okay. We'll give this one a try, then.

635
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:48,980
Alright.

636
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,420
Here goes nothing.

637
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,820
Alright. I'm gonna do it.

638
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,100
...

639
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,720
...

640
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:01,980
...

641
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,040
...

642
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,540
...

643
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:03,540


644
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:03,540


645
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:03,540


646
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:03,540


647
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:12,840
...

648
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,840
...

649
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:18,840


650
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:18,840


651
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,120
...

652
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,140
...

653
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,140


654
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,140


655
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,180
...

656
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,180


657
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,180


658
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,180


659
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,280
...

660
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,280


661
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,280


662
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,620
I'm tired of me, man.

663
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,320
Can I have some more?

664
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,300
Okay, everybody.

665
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,480
We're going to be really quiet and respectful now.

666
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,480
We've got one caller.

667
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,640
One.

668
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,800
Okay, hello, one caller.

669
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Hail, one.

670
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,560
Am I the first caller?

671
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,000
Hey, part of the rule was no callers.

672
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,780
Did I mention that?

673
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,620
No, you didn't mention that.

674
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,620
And this one got through.

675
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,440
This is the exception that proves you're right.

676
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm number one caller.

677
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,100
What do I win?

678
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,380
You win a few moments more in this grubby continuity.

679
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,260
You are pleased to call life.

680
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm pleased to call life?

681
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,100
Life.

682
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:43,320
Life magazine can be yours every week for only $9.95 a minute.

683
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,500
That's $9.95.

684
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,200
Okay.

685
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,260
Now, what about...

686
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,140
I'd like the donuts.

687
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,400
Donuts and Twinkies and...

688
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,040
Donut forsake me, oh my darling.

689
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,000
Boom.

690
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,120
Tomorrow is your wedding day.

691
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,680
Hey, remember that commercial?

692
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,420
But for this zealous...

693
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,160
Well, you know, we've got things to do, caller.

694
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,320
We've got to just get on here.

695
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,300
We've got life to live, people to see.

696
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,540
And listen, you have your own show.

697
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,220
This caller has his own show.

698
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,320
Thank you.

699
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,180
Say, this slide show I'm looking at, Postling,

700
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,800
with this beautiful music,

701
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,440
music in the background.

702
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,780
Where did you say this is?

703
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,220
This was last Sunday.

704
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,880
This is Monday.

705
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,000
This is Monday this week.

706
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,800
Not when, but where.

707
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,220
Oh, I had to...

708
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,520
I couldn't read off the smudge Xerox of a script.

709
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,480
It is...

710
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,900
It's right outside Lucerne Valley, California.

711
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,180
Hey, they make yogurt too.

712
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,500
Which highway is that one on?

713
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,320
15.

714
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,020
And you're going from...

715
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,280
You're going east...

716
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,840
You're going west to east down south.

717
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,760
Go west, young man.

718
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,980
Toward Riverside.

719
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,520
I'll show you.

720
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,780
Riverside.

721
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:48,780


722
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,720
Riverside Amusement Park?

723
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,520
It's the Johnson Recreational Area.

724
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,080
It's...

725
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,540
We are...

726
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,460
Johnson is right.

727
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,480
I'm looking at photos of a huge Johnson.

728
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,860
Now, folks, if you've got a DVD of Valkyrie,

729
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,400
what you want to do is pull that out

730
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,860
and go to chapter two, I think.

731
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,020
Verse than ever.

732
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,700
In the scene where Tom Cruise, as...

733
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,600
What's his name?

734
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,800
Gets all shot up by a nice American aircraft.

735
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,140
Colonel Stauffenberg.

736
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,340
Von Stauffenberg.

737
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,500
And this shows the scene where he's wounded in Egypt.

738
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,520
And it's actually the Johnson Recreational Area.

739
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,520
Big bear in the background.

740
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,660
Wounded in his Johnson Recreational Area, you say?

741
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,880
Yeah, they got all shot up and he came back and he...

742
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,180
And he had an eye patch and...

743
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah.

744
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,580
People liked him because he was a war hero now.

745
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,900
He was full of shrapnel.

746
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,320
Well, don't that beat it all up.

747
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,060
Is that that funny or something?

748
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,760
That's one for Ripley.

749
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,020
Ripley.

750
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,720
So, yeah, we were out...

751
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,220
This is...

752
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,200
My old friend has a little ranch out there.

753
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,520
Serving hearty, oversized portions of Italian-American dishes.

754
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,740
Lambies.

755
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,240
I want to go there and hike, but...

756
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,920
I can't.

757
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,900
I can't.

758
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,360
You know, it's the worst thing when the immortal envelope...

759
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,740
I want to go there and limp.

760
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,900
Over the years.

761
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,880
I want to go there and hobble around.

762
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,840
The neighborhood around it is crumbling.

763
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,200
It's the kind of place where you can just sit and just find it.

764
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,160
Better known for crack rocks.

765
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:10,600
Aren't there lots of privacy areas where you can get away with your loved one to do your private thing?

766
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,520
Yeah.

767
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,600
A private function.

768
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,760
Lots and lots.

769
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,380
I'm in Vasquez, Roxburgh.

770
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,300
They reported us.

771
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,580
Reviewing our private thing.

772
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah.

773
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
No, nobody's out here.

774
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,720
And the road gets rough.

775
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,080
There's Bob's down there, and he's doing something with that pretty blonde girl.

776
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,260
And I don't know what it is, but I know it's not right.

777
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,140
They don't like...

778
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,520
Whatever it is, I know they don't allow that in state parks.

779
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:32,980
Hmm.

780
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,720
Well, it's quite an adventure out in the state park.

781
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,040
Yep.

782
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,940
And you do a four-wheel drive to Little Unknown Plies.

783
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,820
And shoot guns.

784
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,460
And wave goodbye as the two children disappear down the forest path.

785
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,200
And it's where Ben had...

786
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,980
Around a bend.

787
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,480
And in the fall.

788
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,660
Who was a super, super, super, super alcoholic.

789
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,740
To write, I think, Ben Hur.

790
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Of course, alcoholic.

791
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,840
The producer locked him in a hotel room in Victorville nearby.

792
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,420
He would like to read.

793
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Which in 1940 was in the middle of nowhere.

794
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,120
But Bobby wants him to go on.

795
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,060
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

796
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,020
Now he has to follow him.

797
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,820
Until he wrote the script.

798
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,960
Whether or not he was...

799
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,300
Look, this is it right here.

800
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,760
The script says not to talk about movies.

801
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,600
The script says no talking about Burning Man.

802
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,300
See, you guys have all your rules.

803
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,360
These religions.

804
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,480
Well, with somebody...

805
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,900
Bums me down.

806
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,600
You're bumming me out with your rules, man.

807
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,900
Sign, sign, sign.

808
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,260
Yeah.

809
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,040
Is that you, Reverend Stans?

810
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,480
That was a Reverend Stans over there.

811
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,520
Burning my face off.

812
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,640
Hurting my mind.

813
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,060
I forget how that goes.

814
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,780
Yeah, me too.

815
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,000
I stuck my hair under my head.

816
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,700
So, I guess you're never going to leave, right?

817
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,200
No, it looks like I'm held hostage by the Drummonds.

818
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,500
Pretty much indefinitely.

819
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,580
I knew there was something abusive.

820
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,620
They use me.

821
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,220
They make me say things.

822
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,480
They make me do things.

823
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,920
Yes, that was no fake recording.

824
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,580
Please.

825
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,960
I have a mind.

826
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,620
I can think.

827
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,360
I just saw today for sale the other four monsters from the Rebell kit.

828
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:06,000
Because I just saw and really wanted to buy the Overman and Bob coming out of the grave kit.

829
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,940
I didn't have enough money for that.

830
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,260
Yeah, they're like 45 bucks.

831
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,000
So, I just found the other four original guys that we were talking about.

832
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Frankenstein, Mummy.

833
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,080
I can track Dracula.

834
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,620
And Creature.

835
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,600
And they're all painted really nicely.

836
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,420
They're in a model shop over in San Francisco.

837
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,220
And I thought, just for a moment, what do we need to have?

838
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,340
But then I thought, no, I'm not 14 anymore.

839
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,440
And I don't have any firecrackers to blow them up.

840
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,960
Somebody worked really hard to make them gorgeous.

841
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,340
They should be blown up now.

842
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,160
I had at least four each of those Aurora monster models over the years.

843
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,840
And I discovered that if you held a sun gun movie light up to the face, they would droop.

844
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,520
They'd slowly.

845
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,720
And you could, like.

846
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,680
Push things.

847
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,220
Yeah, you could shape them.

848
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,900
Very slightly, yeah.

849
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,500
You could change the position of their arms.

850
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,780
Bend their fingers.

851
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,980
And make the Phantom of the Opera more phantomly and deformed.

852
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,580
I used to send you, years ago, you can do that with a cassette tape.

853
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,840
You can take a sun gun and make the exterior plastic shrink.

854
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,100
But the interior doesn't.

855
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,260
So, it kind of wraps itself around the reels.

856
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,200
I'd send those tapes and then you just can't listen to them.

857
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,220
So, you go back to sleep.

858
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,940
I had the Herkimer Battle Chitney.

859
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,980
And, uh.

860
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,620
Yeah.

861
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,060
With the ankle slicing, uh, you know those wheels?

862
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,800
I've been on those Battle Chitneys.

863
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,580
Hmm.

864
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,460
I thought he said Battle Kidney.

865
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,420
The Battle Kidneys, that's different.

866
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,300
Well, you could kid me.

867
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,000
But I don't know.

868
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,840
What he said, maybe.

869
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,500
No kidding.

870
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,540
I'm actually riding in my Battle Kidney now.

871
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,840
He's in his Battle Kidney, which is not.

872
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,820
Wait, my address.

873
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,240
A Chitney.

874
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,580
Among the new rules for the show.

875
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:44,920
Oh.

876
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,520
No kidding.

877
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,240
No kidding.

878
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,140
That's Bill Myers.

879
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,520
No kidding around you guys.

880
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,240
Now, let's not have anymore of this show.

881
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,040
Would I kid?

882
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,280
No, because you're not on the show.

883
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,260
You're the caller.

884
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:54,960
Nah.

885
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,780
You wouldn't.

886
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
No Kidney?

887
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,900
No Kidney.

888
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,260
Sorry.

889
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,720
A man of a different Kidney.

890
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,320
No Kidney.

891
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,920
No Kidney.

892
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,520
No Kidney.

893
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,260
No Kidney.

894
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,260


895
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,520
Kidney.

896
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:03,860
Kidney.

897
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,260
Kidney.

898
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,360
Kidney.

899
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,540
Kidney.

900
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,020
Kidney.

901
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,180


902
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,460
Kidney.

903
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:08,600
Kidney.

904
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,860
Kidney.

905
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,300


906
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,260
Kidney.

907
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


908
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


909
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


910
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


911
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


912
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


913
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


914
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


915
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,260


916
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,640
I love him too.

917
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:12,900
What?

918
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,900
Why release me?

919
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,720
What did he say?

920
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,760
Who Murdotnick say?

921
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:26,700
I said, Ken 170 the Modest Outlander is on the stage tomorrow.

922
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,180
This class could not pull anything in the next act, because he had no time.

923
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,860
Ken said that now.

924
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,500
But that doesn't mean he hasn't got another will.

925
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,220
In fact, that's our list now.

926
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,520
If he knows we miss.

927
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,100
But first, of all, hold on.

928
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,920
these decks.

929
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,440
But they'd heard their parents ranting

930
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,120
and they thought that was the true blue thing to do.

931
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,360
I got to see the whole base shut down. I went over to my dad's office

932
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,780
and shut down an air force.

933
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,020
Where were you the day Bob was shot?

934
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
Yeah, that's a horrible

935
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,660
monster puzzle.

936
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,560
Bob's been shot. It's a party down here in big San Francisco

937
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,520
as Bob's body is carried around

938
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,300
and down the mission area.

939
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,760
This is the alternate history version.

940
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,140
Lawrence Green, who died Saturday

941
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,920
at age 110 in

942
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,600
Kingsland, eastern England.

943
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,260
The last known

944
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,180
surviving veteran of World War I.

945
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,580
And old Bob is being

946
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,500
dumped into the stairs now.

947
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,500
She served with the

948
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,940
Women's Royal Air Force

949
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,260
as a waitress at an air base in

950
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,160
eastern England.

951
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,260
When the guns fell on November

952
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,960
11, 1918.

953
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,120
Armistice Day.

954
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,160
And then Bob falls into the

955
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,120
bar tracks.

956
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,280
Royal Navy veteran

957
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,620
died in Australia

958
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,120
in May.

959
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,960
I'll say, I just noticed this new rule.

960
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,180
It says no reading news articles.

961
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,500
No playing background music.

962
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,680
No kidding.

963
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,360
This is like becoming the monitors.

964
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,180
Did you ever see that one?

965
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,900
Actually, no, I haven't.

966
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,980
But I've heard all the good clips

967
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,440
from it.

968
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,180
Yeah, I have played those endlessly

969
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,940
because they have lists and lists and lists

970
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,180
of all the bad things that humans are not

971
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
allowed to do anymore.

972
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,840
Which I'm assuming of alcohol

973
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,620
will be unhealthy.

974
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,520
I'll have to report you

975
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,340
to your friendly

976
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,240
monitor.

977
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,900
And here's Stan getting off the airplane

978
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,800
in sunny San Francisco, avoiding all the

979
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,460
Detroit snow.

980
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,760
If you see a fellow park

981
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,120
inhabitant smoking, call this

982
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,580
number.

983
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
Meanwhile in Washington, D.C.,

984
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,460
Congressional Republicans denounced

985
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,980
President Obama for firing a marshmallow

986
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,120
gun at the White House as part

987
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,580
of a science celebration.

988
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,400
As Joey Hoody,

989
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,200
at 14,

990
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,520
demonstrated his extreme marshmallow

991
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,000
campaign.

992
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,760
Hello, caller.

993
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,120
What are you doing on the show?

994
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,620
Joey and other students to the White House

995
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,660
to promote science.

996
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,400
Now, if I am elected in 2012...

997
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,040
It's Pat Paulson.

998
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,340
Yeah, and he's moving really slowly.

999
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,880
All corporations will be stripped of all rights

1000
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,840
and their charters returned only when

1001
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,620
they have proven they're willing to pay it.

1002
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,760
Yeah, that's not quite an office

1003
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,680
given to the president.

1004
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
Man, I'm going to be out of...

1005
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,700
job if that happens.

1006
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,880
Not since Jackson has...

1007
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,500
Jobs? Jobs?

1008
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,060
Actually, we have Jackson to thank

1009
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,220
for the very idea that a common man

1010
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,500
has anything to do with politics.

1011
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,760
These people talk about jobs so much.

1012
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,060
And he died.

1013
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,680
He's dead.

1014
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,580
He was such a great man.

1015
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,380
He died already.

1016
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,340
Leave him alone.

1017
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,320
Leave Steve Jobs alone.

1018
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,880
Calm yourself.

1019
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,500
My dear fellow, calm yourself.

1020
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,960
He didn't mean anything by it.

1021
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,560
Death?

1022
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,240
Must?

1023
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,460
It's the law.

1024
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:36,900
True.

1025
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,280
I want to die.

1026
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,640
Yeah.

1027
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,500
Yes, it's...

1028
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,440
He's puzzling evidence alone.

1029
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,540
In the midst of life, we are in death.

1030
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,280
So ask not for whom the bell tolls.

1031
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,820
It tolls for thee.

1032
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,760
Ah, there it is.

1033
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,580
It's tolling away, but you can't hear it

1034
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,700
because there's big cotton

1035
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,480
stuffed inside of it.

1036
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,180
My dear, it's so good for you.

1037
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,720
I can't...

1038
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,400
I can't speak what is in my heart.

1039
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,680
I can't speak what is in my heart.

1040
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,980
I can't speak what is in my heart.

1041
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,580
I can't speak what is in my heart.

1042
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:19,580


1043
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,720
The following excerpts are from a book called

1044
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,380
Disorder in the American Courts

1045
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,560
and are things people actually said in court

1046
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,280
word for word taken down

1047
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,740
and now published by court reporters

1048
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,820
that had the torment of staying calm

1049
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,700
while these exchanges were actually taken care of.

1050
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,800
The names have been changed to protect the stupid.

1051
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,140
Why we would want to protect the stupid,

1052
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,220
I don't know,

1053
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,780
but when you make fun of lawyers,

1054
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,380
it's always best to play safe.

1055
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,940
Mr. Witness,

1056
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,800
what year were you in

1057
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,080
at the moment of the automobile's impact?

1058
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,960
Goosey sweats and Reeboks.

1059
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,340
Mrs. Witness,

1060
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,600
what was the first thing you heard?

1061
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,320
What did your husband say to you that morning?

1062
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,760
He said, where am I, Kathy?

1063
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
And why did that upset you?

1064
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,460
My name is Susan.

1065
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,300
Mr. Witness,

1066
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,980
this myasthenia gravis,

1067
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,700
does it affect your memory at all?

1068
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,500
Yes.

1069
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,260
And in what ways does it affect your memory?

1070
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,340
I forget.

1071
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,820
You forget?

1072
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,340
Can you give us an example of something you forgot?

1073
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,440
Are you shitting me?

1074
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,460
Mrs. Witness,

1075
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,180
are you sexually active?

1076
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,120
No, I just lie there.

1077
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,680
Mr. Witness,

1078
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,500
do you know if your daughter

1079
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,080
has ever been involved in voodoo?

1080
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
We both do.

1081
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,060
Voodoo?

1082
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,820
We do.

1083
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,520
You do?

1084
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,760
Yes, voodoo.

1085
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,920
Mr. Dr. Witness,

1086
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,060
now, doctor,

1087
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,040
isn't it true that when a person dies

1088
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,880
in his sleep,

1089
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,800
he doesn't know about it until the next morning?

1090
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,220
Did you actually pass the bar exam?

1091
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,660
Mr. Witness,

1092
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,600
the youngest son,

1093
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,120
the 20-year-old,

1094
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,840
how old is he?

1095
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,440
He's 20.

1096
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,580
Much like your IQ.

1097
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,700
Mr. Witness,

1098
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,920
were you present when your picture was taken?

1099
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,440
Are you shitting me?

1100
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,020
Mr. Witness,

1101
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,960
so the date of conception of the baby was August 8th?

1102
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,420
Yes.

1103
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,260
And what were you doing at that time?

1104
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,400
Getting laid.

1105
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,540
Mr. Witness,

1106
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,660
she had three children, right?

1107
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:52,920
Yes!

1108
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,540
And how many were boys?

1109
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:56,660
None.

1110
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,740
Were there any girls?

1111
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,560
Your Honor,

1112
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,260
I think I need a different attorney.

1113
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,380
Can I get a different attorney?

1114
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,360
Mr. Witness,

1115
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,020
how was your first marriage terminated?

1116
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,300
By death.

1117
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,080
And by whose death was it terminated?

1118
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,740
Take a guess.

1119
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,580
Mr. Witness,

1120
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,300
can you describe the individual?

1121
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,180
It was about medium height and had a beard.

1122
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,680
And was this a male or a female?

1123
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,240
Well, unless the subject is male,

1124
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
the circus was in town.

1125
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,880
I'm going with male.

1126
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,640
Mr. Witness,

1127
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,500
is your appearance here pursuant to a deposition

1128
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,040
which I sent to your attorney?

1129
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,180
No, this is how I dress when I go to work.

1130
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,660
Mr. Doctor Witness,

1131
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,360
how many of your autopsies have you performed on dead people?

1132
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,780
All of them.

1133
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,700
The live ones put up too much of a fight.

1134
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,480
Mr. Witness,

1135
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,900
may I remind you that all of your responses must be oral.

1136
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,900
What school did you go to?

1137
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:12,700
Oral.

1138
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,800
Mr. Doctor Witness,

1139
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,480
do you recall the time that you examined the body?

1140
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,020
The autopsy started around 1.30 PM.

1141
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,560
And Mr. Denton was dead at the time?

1142
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,200
If not, he was about a time.

1143
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,340
I was finished.

1144
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,140
Mr. Witness,

1145
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,680
are you qualified to give a urine sample?

1146
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,320
Are you qualified to ask that question?

1147
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,980
Mr. Doctor Witness,

1148
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,780
before you performed the autopsy,

1149
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,080
did you check for a pulse?

1150
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,360
No.

1151
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,240
Did you check for blood pressure?

1152
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,740
No.

1153
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,740
Did you check for breathing?

1154
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:57,580
No.

1155
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:57,900
Did you check for blood pressure?

1156
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:57,900


1157
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,520
So then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?

1158
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,120
No.

1159
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,400
How can you be so sure, Doctor?

1160
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,220
Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.

1161
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,920
I see.

1162
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,860
But could the patient still have been alive nevertheless?

1163
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law.

1164
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,540
I'm not going to tolerate that kind of stuff anymore.

1165
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,640
A little more on his last area of the interview.

1166
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,440
II did들을 in thestadio venere.

1167
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,840
Do you think he's living all the time?

1168
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,860
To be banking your notes?

1169
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,180
I'm afraid I don't know.

1170
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,380
I think you are.

1171
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:53,260
You're supposed to be a doctor and I'm doubting it.

1172
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:53,760
Do you think you are?

1173
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,060
I don't see it as a possibility.

1174
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,360
Your friend Venして gone away?

1175
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,520


1176
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,520


1177
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,560
What was Felke to think of you again?

1178
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,840
Yes, it's fluctuating.

1179
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,120
There are three rules being broken simultaneously right now.

1180
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,680
I'm knocking all of this.

1181
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,880
I'm going to report this.

1182
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,080
I'm going to report it to...

1183
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,520
I'm going to report it to Dobson.

1184
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,200
Background music, caller, reading of news, all simultaneously.

1185
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,480
Leading a life.

1186
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,580
Perhaps you've caught one of the latter yourself while casting your line at the cottage.

1187
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:34,540
I cast my lines to catch fish in my sneers and haul them...

1188
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,580
Casting lines before pearls.

1189
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,920
Kids, don't do it.

1190
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,800
And get prompt medical attention.

1191
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,260
If pain or swelling increases or redness appears around the ears while listening to the show,

1192
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,560
if the brain becomes cold, blue, numb, or tingly, re-insure your anger.

1193
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,460
Background music, caller, reading of news, all simultaneously.

1194
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,620
Well, you don't have your ankyl in a cast, though, or anything like that.

1195
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:04,800
Do you now?

1196
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,260
Is it in a brace, then?

1197
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,240
It's in an air brace, which is a new age thing where the insurance company is paid thousands

1198
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,880
for this doctor moving his hands around your injured body as if it were a brace.

1199
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,440
And the brace is not actually there.

1200
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,980
It's like an air guitar, only it's an air brace.

1201
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,380
Right.

1202
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,380
It's like a hypnotically implanted brace on my ankle.

1203
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,660
Damn braces.

1204
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,100
Just to supplement it, I also have a large boot.

1205
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,940
One of those...

1206
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,580
I know.

1207
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,200
They're stomping boot back in the...

1208
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,580
Can you say that?

1209
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,760
Can't say stomping boot.

1210
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,440
Ah, yeah.

1211
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,440
That's one of the rules.

1212
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,520
These rules just come on the fly, just like in America.

1213
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,260
Yeah.

1214
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,480
Yeah, that's right.

1215
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,540
The whole rules and laws endlessly smothering you.

1216
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,360
And...

1217
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:54,840
I will...

1218
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,000
I will...

1219
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,560
I will...

1220
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1221
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1222
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1223
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1224
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1225
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1226
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1227
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,560


1228
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,760
I will get you for something sometime anyway.

1229
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,180
We...

1230
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,860
The bottom line is you've got to keep the rules.

1231
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,540
We...

1232
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,040
Man, you've got to keep...

1233
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,620
You know, if you keep the lawyers busy, they make more rules.

1234
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,840
They make a thousand rules.

1235
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,680
I mean laws every year in the state of California.

1236
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,780
Your best bet is to try to distract them for a little while.

1237
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,980
If you can just distract them for 30 minutes.

1238
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,760
If everybody would try to distract a lawyer for 30 minutes, we'd probably have like 10,000

1239
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,420
fewer rules.

1240
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,020
But they won't distract their own lawyer for 30 minutes.

1241
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,420
I think it's everybody's own lawyer.

1242
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,880
You've got to distract somebody else's lawyer.

1243
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,640
Yeah, your own...

1244
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,100
If you distract your own lawyer, it only costs you more money.

1245
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,240
Maybe if everybody said maybe more often, the world would be a better place.

1246
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:35,580
Yeah.

1247
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,620
They said, thank you, man.

1248
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,060
Praise Pope Bob.

1249
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,600
He's a dead guy.

1250
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,000
Pope Bob died five years ago, and the Boing Boing dudes asked me to write up a little

1251
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,360
thing.

1252
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,060
Aw.

1253
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,740
Yeah.

1254
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,060
They sure are timely.

1255
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,220
Because I actually did...

1256
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,080
I had dinner a few times with Pope Bob.

1257
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,560
He was always nice to me.

1258
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,120
Here's a...

1259
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,360
He was just staying racing with...

1260
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,520
He got used to getting drunk.

1261
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,780
Trying to scare him.

1262
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,660
Racing through Dealey Plaza.

1263
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,600
Man, can he go.

1264
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,200
Look at that.

1265
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,860
Faster than...

1266
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,640
File and I tried that, and the car broke down.

1267
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,180
Yeah.

1268
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,620
Yeah.

1269
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,000
It almost broke down.

1270
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,680
In rush hour.

1271
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,420
Unfortunately, love for me only comes in the form of suffocation.

1272
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,000
That's me.

1273
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,800
Only in Suffolk County, I believe.

1274
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,920
So you have to suffocate to actually feel good.

1275
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,440
Suffer the little children to come unto me.

1276
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:20,680
Say it.

1277
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,240
When you suffer, suffer, suffer, suffer, suffocate.

1278
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,060
Oh, yeah.

1279
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,820
Suffocate before it's too late.

1280
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,120
Remember what I was saying?

1281
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,780
Suffocate the little children to come unto me.

1282
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,120
Well, that's...

1283
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,760
Come under me.

1284
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,660
No, no, no, no.

1285
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,860
Dr. John, I'm careful.

1286
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,920
All the little children.

1287
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:40,940
Yes.

1288
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,920
Won't somebody think of the children?

1289
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,480
Oh, my God.

1290
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,840
I just came to the last rule.

1291
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,520
Don't read the rules on the air.

1292
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,680
Foolishness is bound.

1293
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,360
Fabulous.

1294
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,040
Way to go, Stan.

1295
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,680
In the heart of the child.

1296
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,920
They should have put that rule first.

1297
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,080
Smooth move, move, excellent.

1298
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,720
But the rod of correction...

1299
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,400
Do you know about the rule of thumb and where that originated?

1300
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,920
The Padawan, the Indian Federation.

1301
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,780
The king was allowed to use his thumb to gouge out the eyes.

1302
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,820
I know the rule of...

1303
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,700
The queen was in the parlor eating bread and honey.

1304
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,740
But, you know, they said that was a Roman move.

1305
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,020
When they were wrestling, they would try to gouge out each other's eyes.

1306
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,240
And it was said that the emperor Augustus was a successful eye-gouger.

1307
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,020
It seems to be against...

1308
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,060
The common picture of Augustus is being...

1309
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,760
And so that's why they are the peaceful cleric, huh?

1310
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,240
Well, anyway, that's the deal.

1311
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,620
I don't advocate eye-gouging.

1312
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,920
Well, a lot of us have done similar things in our younger days.

1313
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,780
Yes.

1314
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,960
Things we may have regretted later in life, like gouging out our friend's eyes.

1315
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,640
Okay.

1316
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,720
Oh, by the way, no lucky charms.

1317
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,720
Welcome to the price, gouger.

1318
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,880
Did you say that because you thought my accent was getting a little bit too close?

1319
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:52,880


1320
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,220
It was verging.

1321
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,800
It was verging.

1322
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,940
And I go a little bit too close.

1323
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,200
There's no last rule, so you just keep adding rules.

1324
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,400
Yellow floaters.

1325
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,080
Pink pop.

1326
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,520
Actually, friends, in the church of the subgenius, there's only one rule.

1327
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,040
And I think you know what it is.

1328
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,740
And that's...

1329
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,200
Eat them if they can't take a joke.

1330
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,080
Eat them.

1331
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,240
Eat them over and over again.

1332
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,620
Eat them if they can't take a joke.

1333
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,700
How many times...

1334
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,900
If I had to insert that buzz, that wrong answer buzz over a cuss word.

1335
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,720
Well...

1336
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:35,880
How many cuss words must a show editor cover up if he's to sell a show to broadcast?

1337
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,320
How long will thou forget me, O Lord?

1338
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,680
How long must I hide my faith from thee?

1339
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,460
How long, how long?

1340
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,900
Church of the subgenius.

1341
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,520
Money.

1342
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,180
Gave Washington leverage.

1343
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,400
In a pivotal Middle Eastern relation.

1344
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,940
But it's hard to continue.

1345
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,360
Spent on a ruling clique.

1346
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,820
Plays up phony conspiracy theories.

1347
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,680
U.S. educators are behind destructions.

1348
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,400
I see they're adding and putting a new addition to the building here while we're doing the show, Presley.

1349
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,600
The subgenius workers should be free.

1350
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,760
Not used as pawns.

1351
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,460
Oh, yes.

1352
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,600
Wobbly government.

1353
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,200
Yes.

1354
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,000
I mean, shouldn't they have to use their hands as hammers?

1355
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,900
They should be given personal equipment.

1356
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,900
They're using each other's foreheads as hammers and it's just...

1357
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,660
I mean, the insurance is gonna go.

1358
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,240
It's gonna go.

1359
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,660
Oh, there's no insurance for the subgenius workers?

1360
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,580
No, no, no insurance.

1361
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,580
Subgenius worker doesn't get insurance included in his basic program.

1362
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,380
That's an enhancement that requires at least six months worth of continued employment.

1363
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,180
Proof that...

1364
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,060
Unenhanced employment.

1365
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,680
Capable of...

1366
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,060
Making it to work each day.

1367
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,060
Well, I see.

1368
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,980
That is significant.

1369
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,320
And we will examine it in time.

1370
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,440
Now, if you're a Scientologist, do you get...

1371
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,320
Can you get special Scientology insurance from the church?

1372
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,200
Would that include...

1373
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,700
Do they do insurance for their people?

1374
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,600
Well, we...

1375
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,180
Like we do?

1376
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,220
If we're pre-split Scientologists, we do.

1377
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,580
They're pre-split.

1378
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,960
If we have to split them ourselves, then we will definitely require an insurance policy.

1379
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,200
To protect us from the flying parts.

1380
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:26,840
You never know.

1381
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,320
It's a flying Scientologist part.

1382
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,000
Ah, to split a Scientologist again.

1383
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,100
Or a Mooney.

1384
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,000
To split a Mooney.

1385
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,260
From stem to stern.

1386
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,860
From his guggle to his zatch.

1387
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,500
To split a Raelian.

1388
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,220
Split open his sternum.

1389
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,520
Pop open his ribs.

1390
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,240
And have at the tasty sweetmeats with him.

1391
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,360
To split a Discordian.

1392
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,960
I like to say...

1393
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,080
To divide a congregation.

1394
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,620
To take a...

1395
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,980
To have a flying spaghetti monster fan and...

1396
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,940
To fillet...

1397
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,700
Split him...

1398
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,480
And otherwise...

1399
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,580
Split him right down the middle.

1400
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
A controversial...

1401
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,140
You know, they cleave well.

1402
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:05,640
If you hit them properly, right in the top of the cranium, they will cleave perfectly down the middle.

1403
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,980
To cleave...

1404
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,580
It must be a straight cut.

1405
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,200
A straight...

1406
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,700
A hatchet.

1407
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,120
A hatchet job.

1408
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:13,440
From above.

1409
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,400
Otherwise, we suggest that you bury...

1410
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,640
Yeah, otherwise you just shear off a part of that Scientologist.

1411
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:20,880
Shear into...

1412
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,500
Or Mooney.

1413
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:21,980
Or...

1414
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,140
Or...

1415
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,160
Or...

1416
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,520
Or...

1417
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,560
Zappa cultist.

1418
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:24,960
Or whatever.

1419
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,860
You can zap him with a taser.

1420
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,360
Or...

1421
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,320
Whatever you do.

1422
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,460
Don't say...

1423
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,180
That's another rule.

1424
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,480
You can't say Zappa sucks.

1425
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:33,820
Yeah.

1426
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,700
Well, you can't hear.

1427
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,960
No, nobody wants to hear that.

1428
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,900
And another rule is...

1429
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,420
You can't say...

1430
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,560
You can't say...

1431
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,340
You can't say...

1432
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,520
Do you need to go to the hospital?

1433
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,000
Do you need to go to the...

1434
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,600
You can say that.

1435
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:42,940
You can say that.

1436
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,620
Yeah.

1437
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,000
And you can't say...

1438
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,980
Hey, man, could you turn your guitar down?

1439
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,720
No, man.

1440
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,200
I'm in 13 cults.

1441
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,260
13 ghosts.

1442
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,420
I remember a band I was in where it's...

1443
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,200
The band...

1444
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,460
We'd start out at like 6 in the early part of the evening and everybody would be up to

1445
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,840
11 by the end of the evening.

1446
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,100
Philo, I had no idea that you were already spoken for.

1447
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,600
Oh, no.

1448
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,020
Really?

1449
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,120
I'm sorry.

1450
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,240
All that worked for nothing.

1451
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,980
I've been operating under the strange illusion that you were available.

1452
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:20,680
I'm sorry.

1453
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,320
Make sure.

1454
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,660
Well, I was for a while.

1455
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,400
Someone made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

1456
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,160
So I didn't.

1457
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,300
And now I'm happily ensconced.

1458
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,220
Ensconced.

1459
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,480
Is that all you have to say for yourself, Senator Drummond?

1460
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,420
Ensconced.

1461
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,680
I don't think that's what the voters would call it.

1462
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:50,900
Ensconcing.

1463
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,040
Ensconcing.

1464
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,520
Mm-hmm.

1465
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,100
Sure.

1466
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,500
Let me check my ensconce app here.

1467
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,560
I'm sorry.

1468
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,760
We're out of time.

1469
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,620
The senator can't answer any more questions.

1470
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,860
Thanks very much.

1471
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,200
You sound like a real politician when you say that, Dr. Hamm.

1472
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,160
Like you've got a purty mouth.

1473
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,200
I'm simply preparing the way for the explosive, inevitable Rocknar campaign.

1474
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:14,660
I don't know for sure.

1475
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,340
Here's another kid.

1476
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,260
No callers.

1477
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,700
Look, there's Rocknar now.

1478
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,940
He's going to sing a song.

1479
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:19,980
He's going to sing a song.

1480
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,880
He's going to sing a song.

1481
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:20,880


1482
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:20,880


1483
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:20,880


1484
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:20,880


1485
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:20,880


1486
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,960
He is a popular favorite.

1487
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,960
This next song.

1488
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,660
Who's come, as I understand, from nowhere to sweep the convention.

1489
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:35,040
The West Country already has accumulated more than enough delegates to go all the way to Washington.

1490
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,200
And now he's approaching the podium.

1491
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,460
Maybe the commander-in-chief will hear you this time.

1492
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,180
Let's go to that live feed.

1493
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,600
This is Rocknar.

1494
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,920
He's getting ready to address the government.

1495
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,020
Oh, I'm picking up.

1496
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,860
This one's for the SoCal.

1497
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,900
Commander-in-chief.

1498
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,420
Yeah.

1499
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,280
Wherever you are.

1500
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,000
Wherever your heart is.

1501
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:57,320
Go.

1502
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,520
I'm picking out a guitar part with my lead thing.

1503
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:07,420
Dear Mr. President, I want you to know I am deeper than you.

1504
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,640
I'm deeper than you.

1505
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:08,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

1506
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,920
Oh, you said president.

1507
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,160
Yeah, no, he said deeper.

1508
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,120
So he's been buried by an enormous.

1509
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,920
Hey, if you say president and have jet airplanes, sound effects at the same time are going to take you.

1510
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,380
Okay, bad.

1511
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:20,520
Bad.

1512
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:20,780
Thanks.

1513
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:21,840
That's right.

1514
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,340
See, that guy was singing about Mr. President.

1515
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,340
Then he said, bury.

1516
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:32,820
So the computer said, okay, and sent an Air Force wing toward him to bury him under the radio dirt.

1517
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,680
Now we don't want to bother the good folks out there with some of this sordid lowlife.

1518
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,980
Let me hold you, little man, as the parade marches by.

1519
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,820
Let me hold you, little man, and we'll pretend you can fly.

1520
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:50,680
No.

1521
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,720
Flying with a jet plane overhead.

1522
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,660
That was Rocknard's protest song.

1523
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:57,160
Little man, you're crying.

1524
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,520
All the elevator buttons.

1525
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,440
I know why you're blue.

1526
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,400
Someone stole your TV.

1527
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,300
I stand today for the midget.

1528
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,760
Half the size of a regular guy.

1529
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,160
You talking about Bob there?

1530
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,540
Let me hold you, little man.

1531
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,480
What does that mean?

1532
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,700
Everyone passes by.

1533
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,820
The enemy has run.

1534
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,220
Little big man.

1535
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,100
Is that low?

1536
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,620
Talking about holding the movie?

1537
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,040
Cradled in his arms.

1538
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,700
No, I don't think it's that part.

1539
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,160
He's talking about a body part.

1540
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,260
Oh, your God.

1541
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,120
Little man.

1542
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,120
It's like a little elf.

1543
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,980
I'm banging the drum.

1544
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,880
Your big day will come when they re-

1545
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,100
Make the wizard of Oz.

1546
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,960
So let me hold you, midget man.

1547
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,000
You pretend that you're lying in space.

1548
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,740
You let me in.

1549
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,740
You let me in.

1550
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,420
You let me in.

1551
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,520
You let me in.

1552
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:57,540
You let me in.

1553
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:57,540


1554
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,200
So let me talk.

1555
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:58,740
You let me in.

1556
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,100
Because you're supposed to call him the little piece.

1557
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,020
What if he's just singing about the president?

1558
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:03,560
Oh, he's getting close.

1559
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,600
Reverend Sting, did you hear that?

1560
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,640
Yes, Mr. President.

1561
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,020
Did you hear him?

1562
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,160
Yes, I did.

1563
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,140
He already played that part.

1564
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,960
Yeah.

1565
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,940
You're after me, lucky charm.

1566
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,600
Little man.

1567
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,300
All right.

1568
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,340
I thought we weren't going to do the lucky charms.

1569
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,220
Put your hands off my little man.

1570
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:21,840
Very impressive.

1571
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,080
I mean, the honorable voice.

1572
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,720
Please take your hands off my little man.

1573
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,680
That's crazy, Tom.

1574
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,200
Or sexual harassment outside.

1575
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,640
This is what I think of your little man.

1576
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,860
He shot him dead.

1577
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,880
Take your hands off my little man.

1578
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,200
And now we will credit the large.

1579
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,040
Thanks to the large for contributing with the hour of slack.

1580
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,080
The large is Cleopatra's bar.

1581
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,660
Chunks of your money.

1582
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:49,680
Chunks of your money.

1583
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:49,680


1584
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,680
The Buzzling Evidence Show.

1585
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,220
Yeah.

1586
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,640
Ah, Chase.

1587
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,940
Here they come now.

1588
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,080
I surrendered.

1589
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,460
Blow your speakers out.

1590
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,400
It's the Buzzling Evidence Show.

1591
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,860
Welcome to the show.

1592
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,180
Come on down, Buzzling Evidence.

1593
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,880
Come on down, Dr. Howe.

1594
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,480
Come on down, Milo Drummer.

1595
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,480
And our special guest star, I would say.

1596
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,540
Come on down, Caller One, Caller Two, Caller Three.

1597
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,500
Oh, wait.

1598
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,020
Don't call her.

1599
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,280
I just want to say I love what you crazy, wonderful,

1600
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,760
beautiful kids are doing.

1601
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,900
I'm behind you all the way.

1602
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,960
When those women in those tube tops run down the aisle,

1603
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,200
it's just crazy.

1604
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,840
And so the ending recapitulates the beginning.

1605
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,460
Thanks to the Buzzling Evidence Show with Dr. Drummond and Dr. Howe,

1606
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,660
who, like Dr. G. Gordon Gordon,

1607
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,160
will be together again at 50 next day this July,

1608
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,400
along with the amino acids, Fat Man D, Andrew the Impaled,

1609
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,580
the Evolution Control Committee, Reverend Sam Singleton,

1610
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,700
the Atheist Evangelist, the Duke of Ute, DJ Shaver,

1611
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,920
the Mutant Mountain Boys, Dr. Legume, Priestess Pisces,

1612
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,720
Suds, Tommy Amoeba, the Drive-Ins, the Burnings,

1613
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,520
Old Sequa, and we hope Papa Joe Mama.

1614
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,460
I should also mention that Dr. Howe, Reverend John Shirley,

1615
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,600
and I, all three, now have a regular blog called

1616
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,460
Culture Clutch at rawstory.com.

1617
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:16,860
Read all about it at subgenius.com.

1618
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,380
And now, accept.

1619
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,220
For that URL, your mind will be erased.

1620
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,200
Thank you.

1621
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,380
Thank you.
