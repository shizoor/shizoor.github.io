1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,060
And that's where it happened.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,100
When I woke up, it was still raining, and I was lying on top of the mud like a man trying to find the sugar bowl at a restaurant under a grandstand.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,240
The door to my apartment opened, and she sauntered in, moving slowly from side to side like a piece of bubble gum in a set of false teeth.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,700
Her voice was all right, too. It reminded you of a furnace in a basement full of cats.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,640
Good evening.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,180
I stood up like a dirty, wet baby on a floor full of marbles.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,120
Well, well. Talk.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,920
No.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,400
No? No.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,180
Good. See?

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,920
He admits it.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,920
I don't understand.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,940
The rain had washed the makeup off her face, and she looked sharp and quick, like a piece of candy in a bad tooth.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,840
Yes?

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,700
She looked like a stubborn seed in a deep freeze.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,920
Yes?

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,000
She looked like a guy who didn't figure on a leaf in a pool of water.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,800
Yes?

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,160
She looked like a false baby on a furnace in a basement full of tea.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,560
Oh, you take your work too seriously.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't understand it.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,060
Be sure to join us next Sunday evening and every Sunday, same time, same station, for radio's newest show,

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,860
The Subconious Hour of Slack.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,040
There's something about them you'll like.

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,560
Grigger, Dieblock, and Hardip, an old-running Tunican's best watch comedy.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm not talking about purity, I'm just talking about purity.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,920
And that's from PR News.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,340
I'm Bob.

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm Paper Pat.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,820
We're just gonna be.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And the Lost Fire.

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,320
I nearly saw it.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,020
So, a stu-by-siveling.

35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,620
And Celebrating Elvis.

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,880
And I was just staring at God.

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,820
First in news.

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm funded by Western governments, without the congressionally approved murderous criminals.

39
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,900
Speaking is over.

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,500
Sweet cozy bubble cozy.

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,780
Not that seven do looks too much.

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,640
At the boo.

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
At the time.

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,620
At the boo time.

45
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,060
First sweeping cut.

46
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,760
And PR News.

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,380
The Obama administration is detached from reality and another attempt to cling to pure power.

48
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,120
The White House says this is PR News.

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,180
Indian law generally seeks savage gang rape and murder of the victim.

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,820
But that does not comport with the wishes of the family.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,820
Prosecutors, meanwhile, say they have matched DNA to pure news found on the clothes of five accused men.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,860
The U.S. Coast Guard is grounded in Alaska.

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,020
Crews are trying to connect a tow line after PR News hampered their efforts.

54
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,700
In Washington.

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,660
In Washington.

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,860
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, the Ask Dr. Hal show is here.

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
This is radio.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,400
Hello, dear friends.

59
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,540
This is your annoying horror host, Dr. Harlan Dowell.

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,160
Hello.

61
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,320
Here in the great Sonoran desert.

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,440
Tonight, we expect a turbo-philosophy forum.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:22,460
A crowd of sages to make the air redolent of their special aura with their discourse.

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,500
You will hear it.

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,840
And you will be, no doubt, amazed.

66
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,620
Dumbfounded, even.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:44,220
And now, prepare to gird your loins for a journey that lies ahead through realms of endless night and sorrow.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,420
But that's just to get to the good stuff.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,700
Heya Tom, it's Bob from the office down the hall.

70
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,020
It's good to see you, buddy.

71
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,160
How are you?

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,440
How have you been?

73
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,560
Things have been okay for me, except that I'm a zombie now.

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,580
I really wish you'd let us in.

75
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,480
I think I speak for all of us when I say I understand

76
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,700
why you folks might hesitate to submit to our demand.

77
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,000
But here's an FYI.

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,760
You're all gonna die screaming,

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,240
All we wanna do is eat your brains.

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,260
We're not unreasonable.

81
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,520
I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes.

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,240
All we wanna do is eat your brains.

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,020
We're at an impasse here.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,980
Maybe we should compromise.

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,880
If you open up the door.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,400
We'll all come inside and eat your brains.

87
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,720
I don't wanna nitpick, Tom, but is this really your plan?

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,440
Spend your whole life locked inside a mall.

89
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,520
Maybe that's okay for now, but someday you'll be out of food and guns.

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,360
And you'll have to make the call.

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,780
I'm not surprised to see you haven't thought it through enough.

92
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,740
You never had the head for all that bigger picture stuff.

93
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,000
But Tom, that's what I do.

94
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,800
And I plan on eating you slowly.

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,260
All we wanna do is eat your brains.

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,260
We're not unreasonable.

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,520
I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes.

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,260
All we wanna do is eat your brains.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,040
We're at an impasse here.

100
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Maybe we should compromise.

101
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,980
If you open up the door.

102
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,560
We'll all come inside and eat your brains.

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,420
I'd like to help you, Tom, in any way I can.

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,880
I sure appreciate the way you're working.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,640
You're not alone with me.

106
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,140
I'm not a monster, Tom.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,820
Well, technically I am.

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,520
I guess I am.

109
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,320
I ain't no Impermanence.

110
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't know who this Impossible Man is.

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,300
Tell me.

112
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,580
Everything's gonna turn into pure waste.

113
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,060
Talk to me about it, too.

114
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,020
Go.

115
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,380
Talk to me about this Impossible Man.

116
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,460
I've got another meeting, Tom.

117
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,720
Maybe we could wrap it up.

118
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,640
Yeah.

119
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,200
I know we'll get to common ground somehow

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,620
Meanwhile I'll report back to my colleagues

121
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,280
Who were chewing on the doors

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,100
I guess we'll table this for now

123
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm glad to see you take constructive criticism well

124
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,900
Thank you for your time

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,720
I know we're all busy as hell

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,800
And we'll put this thing to bed

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,960
When I bash your head open

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,240
All we wanna do is eat your brains

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
We're not unreasonable

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,520
I mean no one's gonna eat your eyes

131
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,100
All we wanna do is eat your brains

132
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,020
We're at an impasse here

133
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
Maybe we should compromise

134
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,520
Maybe we should compromise

135
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,700
Maybe we should compromise

136
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,200
Open up the doors

137
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,460
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

138
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:44,440
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

139
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:14,440
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

140
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:43,920
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

141
00:09:52,780 --> 00:10:13,880
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

142
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:43,860
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

143
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,720
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

144
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:01,760
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

145
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
Barnyard fowl.

146
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,380
Yes, they drop pellets and pellets.

147
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,220
They drop pellets in the barnyard.

148
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,280
And they're loaded on pellets.

149
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,800
They're loaded on whatever they can scoop up in omnivorous fashion with their reeking beaks.

150
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes.

151
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,220
Now, if we were a pilot of a...

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,300
They'll eat a grasshopper or a caterpillar.

153
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,560
Excuse me.

154
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,780
But if you throw a fried chicken leg in there, they'll eat it too.

155
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,680
Yes.

156
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:35,920
Well, if you are a pilot of pellets of pullets, you certainly should win a pulleter prize.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,900
If only to prize the premium...

158
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,820
Out of my dead gold fingers, yes.

159
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,720
Out of your...

160
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,580
I mean...

161
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,780
I hesitate to use the word...

162
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,400
Three cameras.

163
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
Seven diapers.

164
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,480
Three darts.

165
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,560
Four hours driving.

166
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,660
One new PA.

167
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,640
350 feet water.

168
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,980
80 miles of cake.

169
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,020
Two hosts in need of words.

170
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,480
And my left arm is not working.

171
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,740
I fear nothing anymore.

172
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,820
See you all in hell.

173
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,840
See you all in hell.

174
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:27,940
See you all in hell.

175
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,680
See you all in hell.

176
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,300
See you all in hell.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000


178
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,140
See you all in hell.

179
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,240
See you all in hell.

180
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,100
See you all in hell.

181
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,200
Well, you see...

182
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
We were speaking of the devil in a pejorative way...

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,280
Yes.

184
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,500
And I would like to get beyond that...

185
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:49,740
Yes.

186
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,500
...into a more fair and equitable realm of discussion...

187
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,660
Yes.

188
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:53,820
Well...

189
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,460
...since we are churchmen and in charge...

190
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:56,740
Yes.

191
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,920
...of our own doctrine...

192
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,480
here in the Church of the Subgenius.

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,040
Yes.

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,860
Especially when the head of our order is here in the studio.

195
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,160
One must not commit a theological solacism.

196
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,760
A blasphemy.

197
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,260
Or trip over the skirts of doctrine.

198
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,960
Oh, my God.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,040
I'm in terror whenever I speak before Stang

200
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,120
that I may emit a blasphemy.

201
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,560
We must all speak before Stang sooner or later.

202
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:21,880
Yes.

203
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,260
So many have died and have been tortured.

204
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,360
Oh, sorry.

205
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,160
Suffer not the fashionable fools

206
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,780
for the prices they pretend to give for contemptible works.

207
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,520
Yes.

208
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,000
I won't speak any more of that time in the Church when...

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,100
Well, we've all had to make deals, haven't we?

210
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,400
Yes.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,000
We've all had to sign that watchful bottom line.

212
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,420
And one hesitates to use the word purge or, you know, genocide.

213
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,620
Mm-hmm.

214
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,380
But...

215
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,820
Yes, I heard genocide the other night.

216
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,420
Yes.

217
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,720
Less...

218
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,880
The...

219
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,500
The less said, the better.

220
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,760
Of course, we commit genocide on certain insects,

221
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,600
but we fail.

222
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,560
That's the problem.

223
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,300
Plenty more where they come from.

224
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,800
Exactly.

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,040
You see their dying generations at their song.

226
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,200
Fish, flesh, or fowl commend all summer long

227
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,860
whatever is begotten, born, and dies.

228
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,300
Caught in that sensuous music,

229
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,220
all neglect monuments of subgenius intellect.

230
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,140
Ah.

231
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,820
Was that Tennyson speaking prophetically of the Church?

232
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,000
No, it was Yeats.

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,600
But the...

234
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:27,920
Ah.

235
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,820
But the idea is true.

236
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,120
An early subgenius.

237
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,700
What involved in the business of reproduction and passing along the DNA

238
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,240
will isolate you from all other concerns.

239
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,080
Ah, yes.

240
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,740
Right.

241
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, survival.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,100
You must incubate your clutch of eggs so that...

243
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,660
Yes, that is the only important thing.

244
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,500
The right-hand path will be not wroth with you.

245
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:51,940
Yes.

246
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,320
But the left-hand path does deserve to be given some consideration.

247
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,980
Well, so...

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,300
Certainly it needs to balance the right-hand path and the sinister...

249
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,960
Demonology, or actually demon worship,

250
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,940
simply balances the right-hand path.

251
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,260
Well, yes.

252
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,380
And, of course, all such so-called devil worship is antinomian,

253
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,540
but so is the Church of the Subgenius.

254
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,000
Although we are pretending to be a part of the conspiracy,

255
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,940
we are, of course, completely opposed to it

256
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,420
and only using its special luster and hallmarks for our own purposes.

257
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,140
Yes, feeding on it...

258
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,460
Something which can't be stressed too often.

259
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,160
Yes, feeding on it and killing it from within

260
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,860
in the same way that a virus kills a host...

261
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,320
Like Larry the lovable lamprey...

262
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,080
...uses its own...

263
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,920
Sinking his lance-like teeth into the quivering flesh of the bulbous host.

264
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,340
Yes, fast and bulbous, as Captain Beefheart used to say.

265
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,860
Speaking of which, have you seen this wild Indonesia?

266
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,300
Some of the most beautiful animals in the world.

267
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,320
What are you?

268
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,240
Crawling them out.

269
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,840
Really?

270
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,700
You mean this is like a...

271
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,500
Creatures I've never seen before in a film so rare

272
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,040
that you're not allowed to Facebook it.

273
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,840
Things like the orus and the slug bear and the squealer monkey?

274
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:16,540
Well, various rays, stingrays, of course, the great cuttlefish are well-known,

275
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,880
but a lot of these are much more...

276
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,140
They're well-known, but not until recently documented.

277
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,900
And, but there's creatures, many, many,

278
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,100
that have not been known until the last year or two,

279
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
or three, and they're unbelievable.

280
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,780
They're like the cuttlefish.

281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,580
They're spectacular, very hallucinogenic creatures,

282
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,540
some of which...

283
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,920
There's one...

284
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,720
This may be a ray, a manta ray,

285
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,340
but some kind of a ray which actually walks on the ocean floor,

286
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,080
on little legs,

287
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,480
and, you know, disguises itself as the ocean floor.

288
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,180
I don't know.

289
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,000
I just...

290
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,580
PBS...

291
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,040
Stoned.

292
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,780
And I always want to talk to the great Douglas Long

293
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,240
and ask him questions.

294
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:09,600
I wish we had a veteran zoological PhD that...

295
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,460
You know, Pete Goldie's pretty good for that stuff, too,

296
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,600
but he's decided that a night at the opera with the Marx Brothers

297
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,080
is preferable to being here and the Ask Dr. Howe Murray crew.

298
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,720
How could that be?

299
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,820
A film he's probably seen how many times?

300
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,820
One cannot...

301
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,700
Fathom the tile setter's mind.

302
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,060
Well, this is the incredible coincidence of the two asteroids,

303
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,500
and, you know...

304
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,700
Well, it's not that incredible.

305
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,560
Where there's one, there's likely to be another.

306
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,740
Well, but here's another coincidence,

307
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,000
is that he doesn't show up on the show,

308
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,000
and I'm wondering if he isn't using his astronomical power

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,700
to actually bring the satellite towards the Earth

310
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,080
and crash it in some way.

311
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
To fulfill some grudge of its...

312
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,280
Like the mad inventor of the magnetic telescope

313
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,040
in the Superman, Max Fleischer cartoon?

314
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,880
Exactly.

315
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,360
An evil telescope that somehow causes planets to come to Earth.

316
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:09,980
That's right.

317
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,540
That was probably issue 187.

318
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,040
You know, ladies and gentlemen,

319
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,380
I think all our problems are soon to evaporate

320
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,180
like snow upon the water because K-Rob is in the building.

321
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,680
He'll slice his way through these technical issues.

322
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,420
K-Rob!

323
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,740
And this...

324
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,060
Oh, yeah.

325
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,060


326
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,060


327
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,060


328
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,560
Yes, yes.

329
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,800
As soon as he...

330
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,860
K-Rob!

331
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,520
As soon as he...

332
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,860
May be here.

333
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,160
He may be here.

334
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,740
He is here.

335
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,640
He is here.

336
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,060
But don't you forget it.

337
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,840
Now he's going to the bathroom, of course.

338
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,180
I hope that's what he's doing.

339
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,640
Well...

340
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
He's a music critic.

341
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,300
I hope he goes to the restroom before he does.

342
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
Well, I hope he goes when he does.

343
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,340
Yes, and when he wants, and not...

344
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,960
Will I, nill I.

345
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,920
Well, I don't know about you,

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
but I'm going to move some things out of the way

347
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,980
so he can settle in and...

348
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,320
Okay.

349
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,200
Work his magic.

350
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,680
Yes, it is magic.

351
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,040
Let us not beat around the bush.

352
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,640
That's right, folks.

353
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,720
What he does cannot really be explained

354
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,640
by that thin book we call science.

355
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,720
It's an act of reality imitation

356
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,500
on the spur of the moment

357
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,280
with a sensitivity...

358
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,240
A sensitivity that can't be matched

359
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,260
by the hummingbird hovering in front of the piston

360
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,520
or stamen or whatever the...

361
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
The caterpillar on the leaf

362
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,980
repeats to thee thy mother's grief.

363
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,780
Yes.

364
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,640
Kill not the moth nor the butterfly

365
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,800
for the lost last judgment draweth nigh.

366
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,620
That's right, folks.

367
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,560
So, repent.

368
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,740
Slack off.

369
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,820
Send in your money.

370
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,220
Quit your job for Bob.

371
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,300
Go down your subgenius checklist.

372
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,860
Don't forget, even though we're being very reflective,

373
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
contemplative here,

374
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,160
we do have subgenius royalty,

375
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,060
subgenius founders in the room.

376
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,920
That is true.

377
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,880
By the bucket load.

378
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,440
Let all know,

379
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,120
and let all who hear us now know

380
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,580
that this room contains the cream,

381
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,040
the core of subgenius,

382
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,280
and...

383
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,640
And if anything, may Allah forfend,

384
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,040
occur to those in this room,

385
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,780
the church would flicker and die

386
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,380
like the fitful flame of a candle.

387
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,160
And that's exactly why it's kept a secret from all.

388
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,340
In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate.

389
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,480
Cut into a mountain,

390
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,860
the side of a mountain with a rock in front of the hole,

391
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,080
we conduct our radio transmissions.

392
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,800
Yes, it is necessary to be hidden

393
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,320
for the...

394
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,760
For the sake of this time in our cave redoubt.

395
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,680
Yes, we don't know who will be after us,

396
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,520
but there are many, many who would like to destroy us.

397
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,420
I went out last time.

398
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,420
You go out this time.

399
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,420
Well, I've got to get some pretzels.

400
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,880
Yes, of course.

401
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,500
We must feed the inner mass.

402
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,260
I think I need some...

403
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,640
And so it was written long ago,

404
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,320
even unto these sacred scrolls,

405
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,660
that a deliverer would appear,

406
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,880
riding above the multitudes,

407
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,660
on a special chariot.

408
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,560
And the people said,

409
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,320
but how could...

410
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,800
Could this be?

411
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Who is this man who is to come?

412
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,900
And how is it that a chariot might fly?

413
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,880
What are you doing over there?

414
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,900
The horse was thirsty.

415
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, you see, the special chariot

416
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,500
doesn't actually involve a horse.

417
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,560
I was trying to get to that.

418
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:39,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,340
Yes, there's no horse involved.

420
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,000
A horse of another color, I guess.

421
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,560
Yes.

422
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,500
Maybe the Tartar horse,

423
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,600
the horse of brass on which the Tartar king did ride.

424
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,920
And if all else...

425
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,600
I don't know.

426
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:54,900
I don't know.

427
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:54,900


428
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:54,940
I don't know.

429
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


430
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


431
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


432
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


433
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


434
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


435
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:54,940


436
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,400
I love a Tartar horse.

437
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,020
We used to have those in a cafeteria in third grade.

438
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,500
You may have your Tartar sauce if you want.

439
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,420
Go ahead.

440
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,640
Why did they make that call?

441
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,380
Enjoy your Tartar sauce.

442
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,100
I mean, is it really...

443
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,300
Because it came from the plains of Tartary.

444
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,760
Oh, my God.

445
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,320
Turks used to keep it warm between their thighs and the saddle.

446
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,500
So it's jism from Turks?

447
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,880
I never said so.

448
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,020
You have this...

449
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,800
No, no, no.

450
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,580
No, it's not.

451
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,740
It's a salty sauce.

452
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,300
It's a salty sauce of the Black Sea.

453
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,260
Why is it green?

454
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,300
It could be...

455
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,860
It's not supposed to be green.

456
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,760
Don't you see?

457
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,260
It says refrigerate after opening.

458
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,020
Oh, I see.

459
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,760
I see.

460
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,700
Well, there was nothing like fish...

461
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,060
Don't judge all Tartar sauce by your science project.

462
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,500
Well, in Massachusetts, I remember, we used to call it Tartar sauce.

463
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
You talk about the same thing.

464
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,660
Tartar sauce, right?

465
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:45,900
Yeah.

466
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,480
All right.

467
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,200
Be that way.

468
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,740
Tartar sauce.

469
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,900
Okay.

470
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,820
Tossed salad?

471
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,320
Sure.

472
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:52,740
Yeah.

473
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,580
That's what we had.

474
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,840
Every Friday, I think.

475
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
Fish sticks with Tartar sauce.

476
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,180
And you loved it.

477
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,380
And you crawled 20 miles to get there.

478
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,460
20 miles?

479
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,780
That's right.

480
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,280
Through the snow and the wind at age five after working and milking the cows.

481
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,140
And you liked it.

482
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,700
But then you started to take drugs and you didn't like it.

483
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,240
You learned to take it and like it.

484
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,100
Yeah, you learned you didn't like it anymore.

485
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,540
Well, you weren't taking it in the right way.

486
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,060
Well, I suppose, yes.

487
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,540
You got to...

488
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:24,960
You got to take...

489
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,600
I'll bet you didn't know that tartar sauce, when taken in mass quantities, can be a hallucinogenic substance.

490
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,260
Really?

491
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,500
Oh, my God.

492
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,540
Well...

493
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,860
You just have to eat so much of it that you become physically ill.

494
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,480
Yes.

495
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm being charged as an adult.

496
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,260
Facing up to a million years in prison and $35 in fines.

497
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,100
Saying, quote, now is a time for PR News.

498
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,800
The suspect faces several counts, including attempted PR.

499
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,460
President...

500
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,760
President Obama says not.

501
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,440
Not.

502
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
The president said...

503
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,660
On Wall Street, 181357.

504
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Despite several days of French airstrikes, Germany does plan to combat Canada, Britain, and the U.S.

505
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,700
as it tries to keep Mali's capital.

506
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,600
According to the Chinese embassy in Sudan, this is PR News from Washington.

507
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:24,300
Also in the news, large, unexplained glowing light in skies frightens Russians.

508
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:31,360
In other news, explosive bowel syndrome hits the city in a massive wave.

509
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,640
And to what do you attribute this, Dr. Drummond?

510
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,280
Bad.

511
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,580
People need to wash their hands more often.

512
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,460
Yes, there are those rules in restaurants.

513
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,620
And we can put the cute girl right on that one.

514
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,520
Bad hygiene.

515
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,760
The great spy.

516
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,820
It's funny, I have...

517
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,740
Oh, now we have a run on...

518
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,320
Where are those ladies?

519
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,980
Those ladies at the night.

520
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,700
Pest.

521
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,180
Pest.

522
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:56,680
Hey.

523
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,680
Only because it's nighttime.

524
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,860
All the microphones are working.

525
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,440
Yes.

526
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,300
Hey, Rob, fix them all.

527
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,280
In an instant.

528
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,880
In an instant.

529
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,220
As I predicted.

530
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,900
Shot into space with the speed of a bullet.

531
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,460
I heard several predictions about that.

532
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,920
Shot into space.

533
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,460
And you have your headphones on now?

534
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:12,960
Yes.

535
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,160
So we're all comfortable?

536
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,360
We are all comfy.

537
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,140
Comfy?

538
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,240
I heard that prediction.

539
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,620
Prediction.

540
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,720
I don't know.

541
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,680
Maybe we could get other guests to come.

542
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,780
We've got another mic.

543
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,520
Yes.

544
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,420
One more mic.

545
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,000
Still, we could get that girl.

546
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,080
I think you could persuade...

547
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
We could get that girl.

548
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,500
Get that girl.

549
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Get that girl.

550
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,740
That's right.

551
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,000
That's right.

552
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,120
Hey, you want to...

553
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,660
Bet your bippy?

554
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,160
What do they used to say?

555
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
You bet your bippy.

556
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,600
Can I pick on you?

557
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,640
Man, not...

558
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,820
Don't talk about laughing.

559
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,460
I know.

560
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,920
It gives me...

561
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,780
It causes acid flashbacks.

562
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,400
Yeah, I know.

563
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,300
It gives me bummers.

564
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:54,920
It's bad.

565
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,340
It makes me remember everything that ever happened to me in the past.

566
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,500
It makes me hate nature.

567
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,580
It makes me want to hate...

568
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,080
Because you watched it on acid probably.

569
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,040
It makes me want to hate nature.

570
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,700
It crushed your brain.

571
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,300
Because nature is so mean to humans.

572
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,980
I hate nature.

573
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,260
And I lived it over and over and over again.

574
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,880
It's mean to us.

575
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,520
Yeah.

576
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,500
And then I had to listen to the recordings of it.

577
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,020
Asteroid.

578
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,580
I know.

579
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,200
And then I had to relive listening to the recordings.

580
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,720
I had to be...

581
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,260
You can't count asteroids as nature.

582
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,440
Let me tell you.

583
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,080
Nature was mean to the Russians today.

584
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,180
I had to be in the eighth grade class that put on a laugh in.

585
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,420
Really?

586
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,740
Really?

587
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,900
Assembly class.

588
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,920
Eighth grade assembly class.

589
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,440
Dreary.

590
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,500
We put on laughing.

591
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,680
Rowan and Martin laughing.

592
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,320
Did the girls wear bikinis?

593
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,020
Nobody laughed.

594
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,380
No, it wasn't sexy.

595
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,340
Smiley face.

596
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,700
Yeah, no.

597
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,640
And people didn't laugh, did they?

598
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,660
People weren't sexy then.

599
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,240
Yeah.

600
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,120
There was no goldie on there.

601
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,080
Ten-year-old or 12-year-old girls were not considered sex bombs.

602
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,440
This is like 68.

603
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,800
Maybe by you.

604
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,620
68.

605
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,540
Yeah.

606
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,560
When you're there...

607
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,060
Well, by me, actually, yes.

608
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,760
When you're there...

609
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,260
I thought...

610
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,080
Yeah, me too.

611
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,100
I can see...

612
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,520
I was back then.

613
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,880
Then, at the time...

614
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah.

615
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,480
They don't have the same effect on me now.

616
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,220
I have more of a fatherly approach to all those children.

617
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,860
I should be a Catholic father.

618
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,320
Once again.

619
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,900
I should become a priest since I like children.

620
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,420
I know.

621
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,820
I should be a monk for the amount of, like, restraint that I...

622
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,400
Or you could be a monkey artist or a monkey god.

623
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,060
A monkey.

624
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
A monkey monk.

625
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,980
A monkey.

626
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,880
A monkey god?

627
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,220
Yeah, well, monkeys get some, you know, like the bonobo.

628
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,180
But monkeys are also famously frustrated.

629
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,740
Frustrated.

630
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,380
Bonobos are not monkeys.

631
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,960
Bonobos.

632
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,800
They are apes.

633
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,760
Thank you, Sting.

634
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,860
They are apes.

635
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,460
Apes.

636
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,580
I take that pretty personally when people get that mixed up.

637
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,120
Me too.

638
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,620
Because you don't want to be part of their group.

639
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,060
I will not tolerate it.

640
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,600
I see.

641
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,660
Monkeys are horrible.

642
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,360
As you were saying, apes are noble by comparison.

643
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,620
Yes.

644
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,200
Well, perhaps.

645
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
King Kong died for your sins.

646
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,120
Many monkeys, however, like spider monkeys and rhesus monkeys, are cute.

647
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,600
Only if one is a...

648
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,000
A sickening sentimentalist drenched in the pathetic fallacy.

649
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,720
I'm no kin to the monkey.

650
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,320
The monkey's no kin to me.

651
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
No, you're saying they're not cute.

652
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,300
I put a monkey in your pants.

653
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,520
What about a tarsier's?

654
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,940
Tarsiers are incredibly cute.

655
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,900
The finger monkey.

656
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,480
The squirrel and spider monkey.

657
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,840
The squirrel.

658
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,360
They're cute.

659
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,480
They're tiny and cute.

660
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,060
The bong monkey.

661
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,860
They're still...

662
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,260
Don't forget the bong monkey.

663
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,780
Yes, but they are still cute.

664
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,600
The master bathing monkey of Java is so cute.

665
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,060
Until they do something, and then they're not so cute.

666
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,160
The butt-picking monkey of...

667
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,400
Well...

668
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,040
South Africa.

669
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,460
But picking monkeys is...

670
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,700
That's Pithica.

671
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
The pee-drinking monkey of Borneo.

672
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,180
Of YouTube.

673
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,840
Well, then there's the...

674
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,540
Raving the farmer's field for the peas.

675
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:29,940
Of YouTube.

676
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,140
And then there's the lung-spitting llama.

677
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,260
Yes, that...

678
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,080
They're terribly cute.

679
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,980
That lung-sang rampa.

680
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,000
Especially if you get that green hanging...

681
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,260
The pee-drinking butt-picking monkey of YouTube.

682
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,500
The gigantopithecus is an ape of the...

683
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,760
But, you know, he needs to clean that well.

684
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
...high steps.

685
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,480
It's called the abominable snowman.

686
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,300
But, you know, there are also other primates living in that area.

687
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,020
Yes.

688
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,920
Snow monkeys, we call them.

689
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,540
We get snow monkeys.

690
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,900
Go home, snow monkey.

691
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,180
Oh, no, that's what the Russians call the fins.

692
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,200
There's no monkeys like snow monkeys.

693
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,500
No, I don't know.

694
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,560
And they don't have fins.

695
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,500
I don't know.

696
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,080
I've never heard of racism in the North Pole.

697
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,120
I've never heard of that.

698
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,840
Well, that's because you have to...

699
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,180
Snow monkeys.

700
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,380
...take off your parka before people can see how you are complected.

701
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,140
Exactly.

702
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,600
It's just nylon up there.

703
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,040
Everybody is just nylon and, you know, polyethylene or whatever you put it.

704
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,500
Polyethylene dances.

705
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,060
Parka.

706
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,860
Borodino.

707
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,740
I would never go.

708
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,260
Reb Stang, would you go to the North Pole or the South Pole?

709
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,700
No.

710
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,880
No.

711
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,600
I have no interest in going anywhere but solid ground.

712
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,900
I don't want to go deep.

713
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,620
I don't even want to go deep under solid ground.

714
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:37,900
No.

715
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,200
I don't want to go out in the ocean.

716
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,000
Forget about it.

717
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,700
It's too cold.

718
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,100
It's cold.

719
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,600
Do you want to go on solid ground?

720
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,200
It's cold.

721
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,580
On solid ground.

722
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,880
No dirigible rise?

723
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,580
And not too high above.

724
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,520
Yeah.

725
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,420
It's not falling that I fear, but hitting the ground.

726
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,020
Yeah.

727
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,280
The through.

728
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,260
Do you want to go through?

729
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,320
Falling is probably fun.

730
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,900
Would you go in a canyon?

731
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,880
What about the dirigible?

732
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,600
Back in the day, I probably would have tried anything, but I was so surprised to reach

733
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,940
the age of 45 that I became careful.

734
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,160
Oh, yeah.

735
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,900
One time.

736
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm cautious.

737
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,580
I'm cautious.

738
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,980
It shocks you.

739
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,080
It shocks you.

740
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,180
Especially at 50.

741
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,240
You're just not ready for it because you haven't really planned to live.

742
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,600
Oh, yeah.

743
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,120
Over 40 years.

744
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,900
That would have, that seemed ridiculous.

745
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:17,580
Yeah.

746
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,360
Insane.

747
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,240
Seems ridiculously insane to me.

748
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,740
Control yourself.

749
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:21,920
Control yourself.

750
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,080
But then you get greedy.

751
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,020
After you hit 45, you go, wait, maybe I could make another 45 years.

752
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,500
Yeah, sure.

753
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,880
I want to live to be.

754
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,140
Why did I smoke all the time?

755
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,240
I want to live to be 90.

756
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,000
I want to live to be 90.

757
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,980
Oh, yeah.

758
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,280
That's me too.

759
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,420
Oh, yeah.

760
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,480
We can, we can hit.

761
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,100
Go for 99.

762
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,800
Hit the cusp.

763
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,960
You know, you're supposed to be able to live to be four or 500 if you hit the cusp of when

764
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,020
technology catches up with you.

765
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,900
Oh, yeah.

766
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,640
You know what I mean?

767
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,240
The hippie from England guy with the long hair.

768
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,220
Right.

769
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,780
The singularity.

770
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,520
But he doesn't, he's not thinking about the ideogularity, which is neck and neck race with

771
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,060
the singularity and maybe drawing ahead.

772
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,320
Oh, I know.

773
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,480
So you got your, you know, sure.

774
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,880
We might have a computer smart enough to save us from ourselves.

775
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,460
Yeah.

776
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,480
Or maybe they'll.

777
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,160
Or maybe not.

778
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,340
Maybe they're smart enough to kill us.

779
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,700
That's right.

780
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,020
Maybe, maybe they saw Terminator and they'll shut that thing down before.

781
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm sure they'll have the singularity.

782
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,720
They'll save us from ourselves by killing us instead of killing us.

783
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:21,720


784
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:21,720


785
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:21,720


786
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:21,720


787
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,920
Instead of us killing ourselves.

788
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,880
Now, Dr. Drummond, you told me earlier today that you want to live to be a very old age,

789
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,880
but not because you love life, only because you want to live longer than everyone else.

790
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,600
Right, right.

791
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,000
It was simply one upmanship.

792
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,420
I don't really care about being immortal.

793
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,600
It was one upmanship.

794
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,080
I don't care about living forever.

795
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,380
I only want to live 500 years longer than the last human.

796
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,180
That's right.

797
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,120
So that you win.

798
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,980
You know what?

799
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,560
I would like.

800
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:48,760
I win.

801
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,080
I would just like.

802
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
The biggest toys, all the toys are mine.

803
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,620
You don't win.

804
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,160
Because you have to endure everybody's death and be alienated.

805
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
Well, but you're happy.

806
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,560
See, everything passes away.

807
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,700
Okay, but that'll take me like maybe 20 years to get over.

808
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,220
This is Dr. Drummond we're talking about.

809
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,120
You think he's going to feel all that sad?

810
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,340
I will.

811
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,620
No, he's going to go, hey, at least it wasn't me.

812
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,340
It wasn't me.

813
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,000
I will be sad.

814
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,820
Better him than me.

815
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,740
I will be sad.

816
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,840
But remember, I've got 500 years to endure it.

817
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,420
So it's only going to be like the first two or three years that I'm going to be sad.

818
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,900
And after that, I'll be going.

819
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,620
All right.

820
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,220
Now, I can't be just sad forever.

821
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,540
I got to start picking myself up by my own bootstraps and getting back to doing something.

822
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,720
I like those bootstraps, by the way.

823
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,860
Those are great new boots.

824
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,440
My bootstraps.

825
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,880
Which you can't do.

826
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm hoisting myself up by my own bootstraps.

827
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,360
And no one's worn any straps in their boots for about, what, 150 years?

828
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,140
I've got bootstraps in my boots.

829
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,420
No, that's not good.

830
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,480
I'm hoisting myself with my bootstraps.

831
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,240
You know, you shouldn't have mentally disabled people in your shoe closet.

832
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,560
That's what the names of bootstraps are, you know.

833
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,160
That's how Sam calls them.

834
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,620
Bootstraps?

835
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:51,780
Bootstraps.

836
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,480
Potards.

837
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,120
Oh, like being hoist on your own potards?

838
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,480
Right.

839
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,780
Oh, but what?

840
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,620
That's what those little things in your boots are called is potards.

841
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,120
Yeah, but then they changed it to being blown up by your own grenade.

842
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Or blown up by your own little poot.

843
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,060
Or, yeah.

844
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,000
That's what potard means.

845
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,740
You mean when you try to go to the bathroom a lot and you only go a little?

846
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,840
No, when you...

847
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Like a poot?

848
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,460
Is that what you...

849
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,000
A poot, yeah.

850
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,840
Like a poor.

851
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,580
I just love where this conversation is going.

852
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:19,640
Yeah, I don't know.

853
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,240
He starts using words like poo.

854
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,620
Yeah.

855
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,240
You know, I don't...

856
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,620
Poot.

857
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,760
I turned into the trailer trash show.

858
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,080
Yes.

859
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,560
A poot.

860
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,640
A poot.

861
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,100
A poot, indeed.

862
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm a poot to get off of this microphone if you boys keep talking that way.

863
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,260
P for free, a penny a poot.

864
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,540
Okay, well, let's cut that part out in the next slide.

865
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,040
We'll take it out because it is a besmirch on our reputation.

866
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, the besmirch is my honor and my dignity, my integrity.

867
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,360
I never used to watch the smirches anyway.

868
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,460
Those are endangered creatures.

869
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,600
Yeah, they were endangered.

870
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,580
Dr. Trump.

871
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,920
You know, we'll have to have a do.

872
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,180
Dignity, honor, integrity.

873
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,960
Yours, yeah.

874
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,760
It's a...

875
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,060
I'm the only one with any one laugh.

876
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,740
Everyone's duty is to stomp on every squealing smurf that is possibly...

877
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,860
I didn't want to be the last guy with integrity, but...

878
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,680
Well, you know, I don't want to live...

879
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,580
We've sort out that way.

880
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,640
I don't want to live longer than everyone else.

881
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,080
I just want everyone else to die earlier than I do.

882
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,440
And then I will have...

883
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,580
I think that explains Filo's approach.

884
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:18,860
Even that.

885
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,040
Fooly.

886
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,280
Yeah.

887
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,340
It's not that he wants to live longer.

888
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,200
He wants to see everyone die earlier.

889
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,520
And think how strong he is and how weak those may are.

890
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,400
I'll be sad for about 10, maybe like two or three years.

891
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,300
So sad.

892
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,980
And then the other 497 years, I'll be just like...

893
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,440
Party!

894
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,160
Party down.

895
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:41,800
Party!

896
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm doing it for all of you guys that died.

897
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,360
I'm going to party like hell for you.

898
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,960
Party down, man.

899
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,980
For my old...

900
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,240
You know, I might live...

901
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,900
For like two or three hundred years and be sad that they're all gone.

902
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,580
But by then I'll have like plenty of robot friends and things.

903
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,400
And blow up dolls and stuff to keep me company.

904
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:09,620
I could do like that guy on the island and have like handprints for faces on blow up...

905
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,900
On a deflated soccer ball.

906
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,580
On a deflated soccer ball.

907
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,340
And you'd be happy with that.

908
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,960
Yeah, happy with that.

909
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Or as a sex mate, the deflated soccer ball.

910
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,160
Yeah, but remember all the animals by then will be...

911
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,560
You'll be the sex mate then, though.

912
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,760
All the animals, though, will be conscious.

913
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,700
And so you'll be able to have sex with animals.

914
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,800
I'll be talking with the animals, though.

915
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,140
They'll be talking and having relationships.

916
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,880
You'll be chattering with the chimpanzees.

917
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,200
Having families.

918
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,840
You'll be having families with dolphins and some of the higher apes.

919
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,400
Now, that's just not likely.

920
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:37,880
I...

921
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,580
You know, let's not be...

922
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,120
Well...

923
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,720
Fantasistic.

924
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,120
Well, I have 500 years to evolve, too, you know.

925
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,740
So who knows?

926
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,400
My DNA might be up by then.

927
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,640
I'm thinking bioengineering.

928
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,040
You know, bioengineering.

929
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,080
We'll be able to create any kind of creature we want.

930
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,800
You know, human half, human half, whatever.

931
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,800
So sad.

932
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,240
Maybe they're diseased.

933
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,560
You know...

934
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,020
Diseased?

935
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
They'll have diseases, yeah.

936
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,740
But they won't care.

937
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,460
They'll just be...

938
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,500
You know, I've got to get some air.

939
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,680
It will be a world of no disease.

940
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,360
Get some arms.

941
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,980
No poverty.

942
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,680
Yes.

943
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,540
No sickness.

944
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,380
No war.

945
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
You'll be able to make love to any animal you want.

946
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,380
And it will be mutual.

947
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,020
It will be consensual.

948
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,400
They're all made out of rubber.

949
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,000
Love you.

950
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,940
That's right.

951
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,380
And never...

952
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,100
You won't need to sleep, work, eat.

953
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,960
You'll just lay around.

954
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,140
It will be a perfect...

955
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,000
A perfect paradise of sloth.

956
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,840
And sloth.

957
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,080
And indolence.

958
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,540
And...

959
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,700
Every temptation fulfilled to your wildest dreams.

960
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,680
You'll be taking in the absence of a Baudelaire.

961
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,320
You will be able to indulge every base pleasure.

962
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,240
Every taste pleasure.

963
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,760
You'll be able to bloom great flowers of evil that are incredibly sophisticated.

964
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,800
This is the only path.

965
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,000
To truth.

966
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,120
To truth.

967
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,460
To truth.

968
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,460


969
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,560
To truth.

970
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,240
To truth.

971
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,740
To truth.

972
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


973
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


974
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


975
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


976
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


977
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


978
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


979
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


980
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


981
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


982
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


983
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,740


984
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:01,440
We will teach you how you can't dig up the dead and bring them back to life.

985
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,560
Now that is against the rules.

986
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,060
No!

987
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,520
They can be dug up.

988
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,960
The blackest sorcery.

989
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,380
The worst.

990
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,140
Reanimated.

991
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,520
Excesses of black magic.

992
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,460
The one thing you don't want to do is be a necromancer.

993
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:20,120
Well, they say that the first zombies that we got the word from were real and that these

994
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,020
creatures did till the fields at night in haste.

995
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,760
Yes, they did.

996
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,680
They're completely different from the George Romero movie monsters, though.

997
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,600
Because they're real, for one thing.

998
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,640
They're unfortunate souls who've given up their will and their individuality to the practice

999
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,420
of the nativistic shamanism.

1000
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:40,980
Yes.

1001
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,500
Speaking of real zombies, do you guys have any of that puffer fish?

1002
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,460
Yeah.

1003
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,940
Just a little...

1004
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,280
Oh, yeah.

1005
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,100
I do.

1006
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,020
I have some of the talk.

1007
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,380
I have some of the toxin right in my soxin.

1008
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,720
The puffer fish is incredibly poisonous, but in just the right amount.

1009
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,000
You cannot be injected with it, but you can smoke the...

1010
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,420
Yes.

1011
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,280
And you can become a zombie.

1012
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes.

1013
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,700
Now, is this different from the puff adder?

1014
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,560
Someday there will be zombie bars where you can go and do puffer fish and be zombified.

1015
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,160
Then you'll enjoy your job for the next three or four days.

1016
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,420
Right.

1017
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,140
Because you'll be high.

1018
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
You'll be a zombie.

1019
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,120
You'll be a zombie.

1020
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,880
You'll go to your cube.

1021
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,240
You'll go to your cube.

1022
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,240


1023
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,380
And you'll be fine.

1024
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:21,900
Exactly.

1025
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,480
You won't be bored.

1026
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,320
You won't be looking at your watch all the time.

1027
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:24,740
Right.

1028
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,300
You'll be thinking about your next hit of puffer fish.

1029
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:27,620
Yeah.

1030
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,120
Exactly.

1031
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,040
Well, you would.

1032
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,260
But you know it's coming.

1033
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,000
You're getting paid.

1034
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,860
That's why you're working.

1035
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,520
Be not puffed up.

1036
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:32,780
I know.

1037
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,340
So you can get the puffer fish that allows you to work.

1038
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,260
Sure.

1039
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,580
That's why the zombies do it.

1040
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:37,840
That's why I do it.

1041
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,320
It's like steroids for Armstrong or for a biker.

1042
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,320
You know, you've got to have something to get you going.

1043
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah.

1044
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,480
Winners...

1045
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Some losers do drugs and some winners.

1046
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,740
I think the...

1047
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,060
Yeah.

1048
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,220
No.

1049
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,800
Video arcades have to say that.

1050
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,760
I think many winners and many losers.

1051
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,180
Almost equally.

1052
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,100
Losers do drugs and some winners.

1053
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,020
What a lot of build.

1054
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,980
And medium people.

1055
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,960
Malarkey, sir, if I may say so.

1056
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,600
About the people in the medium.

1057
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,900
Pure malarkey.

1058
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,240
Comedians do drugs.

1059
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,940
Well, they must inspire themselves.

1060
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,620
They must need to depart from the...

1061
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Only anti-drug message producers do drugs.

1062
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,780
That would be very good.

1063
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,780
Yeah, that's right.

1064
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,000
Because deep down inside...

1065
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,520
Inside the crack.

1066
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,140
What are they compensating for?

1067
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
Yes, they protest too much.

1068
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,820
Get them.

1069
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,500
They're the...

1070
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,200
Get thee away from me.

1071
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,980
Oh, damn spot.

1072
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,360
Get thee behind me.

1073
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,380
Get thee behind me, coffee enema deliverer.

1074
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,920
Oh, damn coach.

1075
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,680
That's telling him.

1076
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,140
Get thee behind me, doctor proctologist.

1077
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,320
Doctor proctologist.

1078
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,400
I saw that movie.

1079
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,860
Get thee cord from behind my behind thee.

1080
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,660
Jerry Lewis is...

1081
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,820
The playful proctologist.

1082
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,140
Get thee from behind me, Father McMurphy.

1083
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,000
How many times, my son?

1084
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,680
Yes, uh...

1085
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,540
2,975 times.

1086
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,080
Say 100 Hail Marys and then don't do it again.

1087
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,200
Go and sin no more, you little malfeasance.

1088
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,000
I've sinned so much I can't...

1089
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,000
You're no longer a sin.

1090
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,640
I have absolved thee.

1091
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,300
I'm a 60-year-old priest.

1092
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,520
I've been committing sins for 40 years.

1093
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,240
The Lord will forgive.

1094
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,180
Though your sins make your heart as black as a crumbling anthracite coal,

1095
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,860
be ye washed in the blood of the Lamb and it will gleam like Mr. Clean's T-shirt.

1096
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,860
Got a quarter for an old choir boy, Father?

1097
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,680
A penny for the old guy.

1098
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,800
No and no.

1099
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,500
I'm sorry.

1100
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,560
I'd only be encouraging you.

1101
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,140
You need to work.

1102
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,400
By the sweat of your brow.

1103
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:50,980
Yes.

1104
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,000
Dig post holes in the hot sun.

1105
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,740
Learn the meaning of the dog.

1106
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,180
That's the life of a zombie.

1107
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,560
Can I have some more of that puffer fish so I can go back to work again?

1108
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,280
Well, the life...

1109
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,780
Of course you can, my boy.

1110
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,480
The life of a...

1111
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,520
I keep it right here in the chalice in the palace.

1112
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,000
The life of a zombie is hard and he has to constantly be on the lookout for puffer fish.

1113
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,980
On the other hand, the hours are great.

1114
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,220
You get to work at night.

1115
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,580
Be ye not puffed up.

1116
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,600
And they are known as the only farmers in the world.

1117
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,460
Who work at night, I believe.

1118
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,720
Well, a lot of companies don't even bother to provide coffee, which would work almost as well as puffer fish.

1119
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,560
They don't need to be...

1120
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,520
You're keeping your zombies motivated to stick...

1121
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,680
Keeping their nose on that grindstone.

1122
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,440
Crossroads.

1123
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,840
Wearing it away.

1124
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,440
Maybe crossroads or something.

1125
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,060
Since they're zombies, there's not much...

1126
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,300
Poor zombies don't get any coffee, just like chain gang workers in Joe Arpaio's prison.

1127
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,260
Who's he?

1128
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,100
Oh, zombie, where are you?

1129
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,000
He's America's toughest sheriff who...

1130
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,500
Oh, right.

1131
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,560
Oh, right.

1132
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1133
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1134
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1135
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1136
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1137
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1138
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,560


1139
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,780
Brought back the chain gang.

1140
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,480
Really?

1141
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,340
The Arizona guy?

1142
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,580
And racial profiling.

1143
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,420
He's a horrible bastard and I hope he gets his.

1144
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,200
And I'm on record as saying something.

1145
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,460
Working on a chain gang.

1146
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,360
You better not let the sun set on you in Arizona, Dr. Howe.

1147
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,240
How did that go?

1148
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,780
I know my way around Arizona, I think.

1149
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,460
How did that song go?

1150
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,040
I've been working on a chain...

1151
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,760
Chain gang.

1152
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,560
So we're gonna call mine.

1153
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,200
Oh, there was one about a chain gang.

1154
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:15,560
Oh.

1155
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,040
Well, then it was...

1156
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,580
Oh, that's one about...

1157
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,960
We're gonna chain gang for Bob.

1158
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,580
All the live long day.

1159
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,620
Working on a chain...

1160
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,000
That's, that's call mine.

1161
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, no, that's call mine, right.

1162
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,200
Yeah.

1163
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,460
No, there's a...

1164
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,400
The chain gang song is about Bob.

1165
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,580
The chain gang might...

1166
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,080
We're gonna chain gang for Bob.

1167
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,900
Shuffle and clank into the call of mine.

1168
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,360
Clink, clink, clink.

1169
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,480
Yes, Colonel Clink.

1170
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,780
We'll oversee the chain gang and all of its manifestations.

1171
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,460
Oh, give me Bob.

1172
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,060
Clank.

1173
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,980
Let's just have a party.

1174
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
I'm fusing my face.

1175
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,400
Relax.

1176
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,580
Clank.

1177
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,300
It's...

1178
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:48,660
It's fun.

1179
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,460
Don't remember who I am.

1180
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,480
It's time for...

1181
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,340
Kicking up our heels.

1182
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,920
Don't remember my face.

1183
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,220
And making whoopee.

1184
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,460
Whoopee.

1185
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,960
There's a lot of old subgenius chain gang.

1186
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,560
Here's a...

1187
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,380
Here's one now.

1188
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,160
Oh, thank you.

1189
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,440
Subgenius chain gang song.

1190
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,960
Oh, really good.

1191
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,060
They had a different style.

1192
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,760
They didn't...

1193
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,040
They didn't sing in tune.

1194
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,880
A little bit more swank.

1195
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,720
Hit in the...

1196
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,580
The rails.

1197
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,380
Subgeni were more swank in the 50s than the chain gang.

1198
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,680
They had Bob to inspire them.

1199
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,620
This is a chain gang.

1200
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,360
Yeah.

1201
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,960
Yeah.

1202
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,560
Subgenius chain gang.

1203
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:17,800
Yeah.

1204
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,160
This is what they sing while they were working out in the fields.

1205
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,220
It's more quiet.

1206
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
It's a goodbye with a high blow.

1207
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,640
It's a little bit more easy going.

1208
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,420
And I got as high as a steeple.

1209
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,620
It's not the high energy, you know.

1210
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,980
But we were intelligent people.

1211
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,180
Steeple people, we call them.

1212
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,900
Oh, the steeple people.

1213
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,940
That's life, I guess.

1214
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,140
Religious nuts.

1215
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,960
I love the people.

1216
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,440
Subgenius.

1217
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,240
Steeple people.

1218
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,060
Steeple people.

1219
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
Actually, my sister coined that term.

1220
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,660
Really?

1221
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,960
Well, this was Bob Hope's theme song.

1222
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,060
You mean, you know, they go like, this is the hands.

1223
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,780
This is the...

1224
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:47,780


1225
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,100
This is the...

1226
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,380
Right.

1227
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,480
Tits.

1228
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,040
These are the...

1229
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,160
This is the house.

1230
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,360
Here's the steeple.

1231
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,000
Open the door.

1232
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,720
Or this is the church.

1233
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,420
Here's the steeple.

1234
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,380
Open the door.

1235
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,900
Where's all the people?

1236
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,640
The rupture happened.

1237
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,300
Next day, I'm left behind.

1238
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,140
I didn't send my $35 to Jesus.

1239
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,260
Oh, my God.

1240
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,420
There's no people left.

1241
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,040
They've been burned to death.

1242
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,720
And the subgenius got away.

1243
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,260
Life without people.

1244
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,200
But that was a great part of the show.

1245
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,940
This is a worst case scenario, ladies and gentlemen.

1246
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,200
That's right.

1247
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,900
That's my mom.

1248
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,040
So genius pornography.

1249
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,560
Life without people.

1250
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,120
That's right.

1251
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,520
Just blow them all up.

1252
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,700
And then you can, like, get anything you want at the store.

1253
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,320
And you can, you know, watch all the movies and not have to pay.

1254
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,980
You know, the reason that asteroid missed us was because donations weren't up enough.

1255
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,440
We didn't have the numbers.

1256
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,040
Right.

1257
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,680
The collection plate was far from full this day.

1258
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,300
And so the asteroid passed us by.

1259
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,540
Once again, ignored by Bob's judgment.

1260
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,380
Yeah.

1261
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,780
Who cares?

1262
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,020
Well, why should he care if the collection plate ain't...

1263
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,360
It's not full.

1264
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,820
Are you telling me...

1265
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,180
He's a jealous God.

1266
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,280
An angry God.

1267
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,640
Yeah.

1268
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,380
Why, you're saying just because of our cheapness that he has not...

1269
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,760
The hit was on and then it was called off?

1270
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,800
He's a God with a full bladder and it's irritating him.

1271
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,040
He's packing a mean load.

1272
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
And he wants to get a move on.

1273
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,140
It was prostate problems of later middle age.

1274
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,480
Now we've got to wait to, what, 2047?

1275
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,040
For the next...

1276
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,960
Good to the last...

1277
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,580
No, no.

1278
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,620
Only until July 5th.

1279
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,520
Oh.

1280
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:17,960
1998.

1281
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,040
Yeah.

1282
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,900
We don't know...

1283
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,240
You mean like...

1284
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,320
We have no idea what today's date is.

1285
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,740
Not really.

1286
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,900
We don't know what planet this is for sure.

1287
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,680
Well, it could be a Mayan calendar.

1288
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,800
But we know by these stripes, we know that on July 5th, 1998, the world as we know will end for the pinks.

1289
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,100
Yeah.

1290
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,480
And we will be reborn.

1291
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,140
We've saved.

1292
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,320
It's as simple as that.

1293
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,020
You know, it's funny.

1294
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,840
I heard that about...

1295
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,780
I'm afraid I may have to say it again someday without pay.

1296
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,400
It's funny.

1297
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,980
I heard that about last year where...

1298
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,340
We were supposed to go from out of the planet of the clocks and...

1299
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,360
It's just a test.

1300
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,520
It's a yearly test.

1301
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,920
And go to that terrible...

1302
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,540
We know not which day.

1303
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,420
Planet of the ape.

1304
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,580
...is going to be the real thing.

1305
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,380
But you just keep doing the drill and that way you'll know you'll be ready.

1306
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:03,900
This is the planet of the ape.

1307
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,080
Well, we'll always be at the assembly point.

1308
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,180
And they did blow it all to hell.

1309
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:08,360
Yes.

1310
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,860
Yes, we know.

1311
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,000
God damn them.

1312
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,720
They did.

1313
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,220
Well, but...

1314
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:11,600
Yeah.

1315
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,460
But this is the planet.

1316
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:13,760
Yeah.

1317
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,100
This is our second chance.

1318
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,540
Yeah.

1319
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,100
And it is just as bad as...

1320
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,880
...as the first time.

1321
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,700
Which we don't know anything about.

1322
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,160
Right.

1323
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,140
Well, according to our lawgiver, there was a terrible conflagration.

1324
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,580
Caused by the humans.

1325
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,140
Yes.

1326
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,480
Yes.

1327
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,280
Per usual.

1328
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,000
The filthy creatures.

1329
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,420
Right.

1330
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,120
Our...

1331
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,460
Yes.

1332
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,060
Compulsive masturbators.

1333
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,500
Our cousins.

1334
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,680
Yes.

1335
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,800
Not good apes.

1336
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,000
Not...

1337
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,460
Proper, fragile...

1338
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,280
Bad apes.

1339
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,800
Monsters.

1340
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,480
Well, they're bad apes.

1341
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,580
But, you know, a creature has to have a certain status to be bad.

1342
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,000
Whoever heard of a bad caterpillar?

1343
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,000
But apes...

1344
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,080
Right.

1345
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,800
Have enough status to commit sins and be evil.

1346
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,920
Bless them.

1347
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,880
Well, baboons do commit murder.

1348
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,380
That's been documented.

1349
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,760
Yes.

1350
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,520
And drive tractors in South Africa.

1351
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,480
Even simple monkeys practice deceit.

1352
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,040
Yes.

1353
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,000
They lie through their teeth and smile at their friends.

1354
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,760
Simple monkeys do.

1355
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,060
And more subtle monkeys...

1356
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,300
Yeah.

1357
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,220
...don't get caught.

1358
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,120
That's right.

1359
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,700
So, oh, these little liars and razzle.

1360
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,260
Speak for yourself, Dr. Half.

1361
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,160
Well, it might only be a matter of time.

1362
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,980
But, actually, once again, let's not have that invidious distinction.

1363
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,420
We are apes, not monkeys.

1364
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,440
Yes, well...

1365
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,660
Great apes, though.

1366
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:27,700
Yeah.

1367
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,900
Truly great apes.

1368
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,100
Well, really spectacular.

1369
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,340
Not as great as grape apes.

1370
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,140
Gigant, perhaps.

1371
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,040
But great nonetheless.

1372
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,320
Superb.

1373
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,320
Stupendous.

1374
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,060
Great in size.

1375
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,640
More graced.

1376
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,700
Very, very large apes.

1377
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,200
John Clayton, Tarzan.

1378
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,580
How can we praise ourselves more?

1379
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,460
Somehow.

1380
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,940
We have to think of ways.

1381
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,880
Yes, the...

1382
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,460
We must demand more bananas.

1383
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,100
That's it.

1384
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,840
The Titanic apes.

1385
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,240
The banana...

1386
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,360
No, that brings us back.

1387
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,320
All right, more bananas.

1388
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,720
Yes, we'll put that in.

1389
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,280
I love bananas.

1390
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,980
So, I...

1391
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,460
And no more terrycloth on wireframe mothers.

1392
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,360
No.

1393
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Well, what about...

1394
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,300
I hated that.

1395
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,740
Assured mutual grooming.

1396
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,820
Some of the worst years of my life.

1397
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,720
When I finally found out at the age of five,

1398
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,180
and I looked in,

1399
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,980
there's this coat hanger wire face,

1400
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,560
just with little crumbling bits of foam,

1401
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,380
just like falling off.

1402
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,080
And that was your mom.

1403
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,320
And that's mom.

1404
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,760
Harsh, man.

1405
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,760
It's a cold, cold world.

1406
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,240
For us experimental apes.

1407
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,180
You said you'd stay alive for me.

1408
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,740
And, you know, her arm kind of fell off.

1409
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,720
Well, you know, you can't expect perfection.

1410
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,060
I just cried and cried.

1411
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,160
All things must pass.

1412
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,700
Your hopes can now be resurrected.

1413
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,380
Everything worth having will be retrieved

1414
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,700
after X-Day

1415
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,240
to those who have paid their dues to the church.

1416
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:56,860
They're tied.

1417
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,620
It's so simple, so cheap,

1418
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,040
and yet people go,

1419
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,520
well, that's just what they want me to do,

1420
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,400
so I won't do it.

1421
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,820
Because they're contrary.

1422
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,900
We understand.

1423
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,600
It's natural.

1424
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,800
Right.

1425
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,840
It sounds like a con man.

1426
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,000
It sounds like a con man talking to you.

1427
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,340
Sure.

1428
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,460
But, see, if we tell you...

1429
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,520
It's too good to be true.

1430
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,440
That's what they always say about a problem.

1431
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:16,440


1432
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,660
It's a profit.

1433
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,960
But we know it's good, and it's true.

1434
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,580
That's...

1435
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,460
The thing is, if we tell you that we're not con mans,

1436
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,080
that's the first sign that we're not con mans.

1437
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,440
Right.

1438
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,940
Well, a really good con man

1439
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,640
would not go anywhere near the subject

1440
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,420
and start talking about con men.

1441
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,100
That's how you know we're not good con men.

1442
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,560
Then you know...

1443
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,760
We're the worst con men.

1444
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,920
It doesn't mean you're honest.

1445
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,600
It means you're an inept crook

1446
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,860
wasting their time.

1447
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,120
So they can trust us.

1448
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,840
They can trust you as far as to the front door

1449
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,200
when they're hobnail boots.

1450
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,860
Let's kick your bombosity down the concrete steps.

1451
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,540
Now, subgeniuses, you know,

1452
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,220
con man doesn't mean conspiracy man.

1453
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,560
He's confidence man.

1454
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,680
Confidence man.

1455
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,300
That's quite right.

1456
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,280
He commits his crime by getting your confidence.

1457
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,420
And by causing you to try to cheat somebody.

1458
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,060
Yes.

1459
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,340
And he's so friendly.

1460
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,920
That's why you like him so much.

1461
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,920
He's friendly, and you think you're getting the drop on him.

1462
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,180
The friendliest guy around is the con man.

1463
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,340
The friendly part isn't bad.

1464
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,040
The twisting of...

1465
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,120
Forcing one into a greedy attitude is bad.

1466
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,700
And, of course, one pays horribly

1467
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,980
by the complete success of the con.

1468
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,680
But the con man, you know,

1469
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,780
he tells you that it's all a con

1470
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,960
and that so many other people are conning you.

1471
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,240
No, he is the soul of probity.

1472
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,800
Our kind of con.

1473
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,160
They're always trying to sell you a pyramid scheme.

1474
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:46,020
We're trying to sell you an eternity symbol

1475
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,360
show.

1476
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,640
We're trying to con you into the truth.

1477
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:48,900
A dream.

1478
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,220
That's what we're...

1479
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,780
Yeah, we're trying to con you into believing in yourself for once.

1480
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,500
They're conning you into thinking you're okay.

1481
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,220
Believing in yourself.

1482
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,220
It's all bluff.

1483
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,880
As the Fireside Theater pointed out, it's all bluff.

1484
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,720
You're born, and you start bluffing your way to a nipple.

1485
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,520
Then you bluff your way through school, and you bluff your way through a marriage.

1486
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,040
And you scream a little louder than you really should.

1487
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,420
Your way through the radio show, and then the bluff is over.

1488
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,440
And you reveal the bluff.

1489
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,460
You bluff, but it's still a bluff, but you still reveal it, and it goes on forever.

1490
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,360
But if you bluff, you bluff others into happiness.

1491
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:25,820
That's right.

1492
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,960
It's a lie, but it makes them happy.

1493
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,740
That's right, and they want it.

1494
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,980
It's like a pop song or a heater.

1495
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,520
A heater or a piece of food.

1496
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,060
Yeah.

1497
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,460
A piece of music or, you know...

1498
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,680
Or a hit movie.

1499
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,960
A religion's just like a hit movie.

1500
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,140
Anything that covers your eyes with illusion.

1501
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,680
A playboy.

1502
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,380
Fold out.

1503
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,880
And deceit.

1504
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,440
And...

1505
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,060
It makes you feel better.

1506
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,560
A fantasy.

1507
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,400
It's okay to lie to yourself.

1508
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:50,820
It makes you feel better.

1509
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,100
Yeah.

1510
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,280
Whatever gets you through the day.

1511
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:53,900
That's right.

1512
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,340
As the serial killers say.

1513
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:55,700
Exactly.

1514
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,140
And maybe in about 20 years, then you'll realize it, that you've been lying to yourself,

1515
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:06,140
and you'll know the truth for about three days, and then that'll be good too.

1516
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,980
Then you develop the most convincing lies of your whole lifetime.

1517
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:10,480
Right.

1518
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,180
Rock solid lies.

1519
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:12,580
Right.

1520
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,300
That cannot be shaken by doubters.

1521
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,180
Exactly.

1522
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,220
And that's why you have to...

1523
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,760
Or bullies.

1524
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,680
...believe in them even all the more passionately.

1525
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,820
You believe it in yourself.

1526
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,460
Of course.

1527
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,880
You're just a pyramid of lies, but that's the way it goes.

1528
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,260
There's nothing wrong with that.

1529
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,200
That's the way nature intended it.

1530
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,640
You have to be fanatical.

1531
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,340
In fact, in this society...

1532
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,980
That's how primates develop to this point.

1533
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,400
Yes.

1534
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,260
In this society, you really have to be kind of like a little tank sometimes.

1535
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,820
A signifying monkey.

1536
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,640
A signifying tank or monkey.

1537
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,160
Well, yeah, but monkeys have a lot of...

1538
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,160


1539
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,160


1540
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,160


1541
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,620
They have teeth, as you pointed out.

1542
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:55,540
They can be quite effective in their barbaric violence, but of course, so can apes.

1543
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,880
And yet, they can produce the most beautiful music as heard in the background.

1544
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,500
There you are.

1545
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:00,760
Yeah.

1546
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,640
A little monkey quartet played with George Shearing.

1547
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:23,360
I guess you've noticed that my arms don't fit in my old suits

1548
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:33,920
I guess you've noticed that I'm eating lots of jungle fruits

1549
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,600
Anyway, more than I used to

1550
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,260
I used to be so tall and thin

1551
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,720
Now I'm not exactly sure which file I'm in

1552
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,960
And I know there's a monkey in the future for you

1553
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,280
And there's nothing modern science can do

1554
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,800
I'm keeping the thumb

1555
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,620
But I'm getting old

1556
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,960
I'm devolving

1557
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,560
I'm devolving

1558
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,920
I am devolving

1559
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:32,600
I guess you've noticed that I can't sit still at dinner time

1560
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,580
I guess you've noticed that I quit my job

1561
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,480
And I learned to sign

1562
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,980
Anyway, more than I used to

1563
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,540
I used to have a little body hair

1564
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,500
Now I have to use a razor everywhere

1565
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:03,380
And I know there's a monkey in the future for you

1566
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:03,820
Now I'm not exactly sure which file I'm in

1567
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:03,820


1568
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,540
I'm getting old

1569
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:04,540


1570
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:04,940
I'm getting old

1571
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:04,960
I'm getting old

1572
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,380
I'm getting old

1573
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:05,380


1574
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:05,380


1575
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:05,380


1576
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:05,460
I'm getting old

1577
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,760
And there's nothing modern science can do

1578
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,080
I'm keeping the thumb

1579
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,460
But I'm getting dumb

1580
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,320
I'm devolving

1581
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,860
I'm devolving

1582
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,360
I am devolving

1583
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,160
Why don't you agree with me?

1584
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,760
I don't understand

1585
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,480
How you expect me to defend my actions

1586
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,860
Knowing what you now know

1587
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,620
I'm devolving

1588
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:46,460
I guess you've noticed that I can't sit still at dinner time

1589
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:46,560
Heat the$ &&

1590
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,520
Chill out

1591
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,180
I'm d naive

1592
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,940
But you feel regularly

1593
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:53,940


1594
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:53,940


1595
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:53,940


1596
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,000
Mine

1597
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,140
All coming

1598
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,440
Saying BBC

1599
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:01,740
But are you so happy that you want to stay the night long?

1600
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:01,740


1601
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,720
What's in the gay black box?

1602
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,620
I was just five years older than you

1603
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,120
I guess you've noticed that I drag my knuckles

1604
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,760
When I dance

1605
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:32,680
I guess you've noticed that I stuff a tail

1606
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,420
Inside my pants

1607
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,920
Anyway, more than I used to

1608
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,620
I used to see a movie now and then

1609
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,860
Now I'm never gonna watch King Kong again

1610
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:55,300
Cause I know there's a monkey in the future for you

1611
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:00,600
And there's nothing modern science can do

1612
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,680
Okay, okay

1613
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,660
Okay, okay

1614
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:02,660


1615
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,380
I'm keeping the thumb but I'm getting down

1616
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,960
I'm devolving, I'm devolving

1617
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,320
I am de-evolving

1618
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,480
I'm devolving

1619
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,700
De-evolving

1620
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,660
I'm devolving

1621
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:32,660


1622
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,720
I'm a coal miner's duster

1623
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:50,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm accused of opening fire despite the objection of prosecutors and others.

1624
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,340
Vice President Joe Biden said

1625
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,040
Uh, uh, uh

1626
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,420
Biden said

1627
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,540
Uh, we could, uh, would, uh

1628
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,280
Biden stressed that he's saying

1629
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,660
I come to this meeting with a

1630
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,200
With no mind

1631
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,300
I come to this meeting with PR News

1632
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,880
West Virginia Democrat Jay Rockefeller said Biden should rot in hell

1633
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,800
Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito had already said

1634
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,840
It's not yet clear which seat

1635
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,600
For Wall Street, 17-13-348

1636
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,860
Nation's trade gap expanded to just under 49 billion percent from the previous month

1637
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:28,780
Proceedings were briefly interrupted when Joe Biden yelled out the quote

1638
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,220
You're listening to PR

1639
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,660
You've been listening to PR News

1640
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1641
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1642
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1643
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1644
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1645
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1646
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:32,660


1647

1654
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:02,640

1660
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:02,820
Thanks, Bob

1661
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,140
Now let's see what you got around here we can tax

1662
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,720
Mmm, let's see

1663
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,920
What's going on here?

1664
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,280
Say, what kind of a joint is this anyway?

1665
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,460
Why, I rep octopus him

1666
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,080
Two deep breaths

1667
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,400
He just lost a leg

1668
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,300
I bet's what worked

1669
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,120
YOU PURpole

1670
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,280
Keep credit, Punch

1671
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,780
What is your secret code?

1672
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:00,780


1673
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:00,780


1674
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,340
You sell me down

1675
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,340


1676
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,340


1677
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,340


1678
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,340


1679
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,360
Coming right up

1680
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:01,360


1681
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:01,420
Good job

1682
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:02,260
Phop

1683
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,240
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1684
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,720
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1685
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,540
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1686
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:20,560
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1687
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,640
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1688
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,160
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page,

1689
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:38,480
or the catalog store pages, and help out financially as best you can.

1690
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,840
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1691
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,500
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1692
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,420
But some of you still have jobs.

1693
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:56,340
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1694
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,440
Fifty bucks.

1695
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,740
Makes an even bigger difference.

1696
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:07,500
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1697
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,980
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1698
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:25,540
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1699
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,520
Thanks for anything.

1700
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,660
You can do to help let there be slack.
