1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
It's time for some signs and wonders, and if you bunch of skeptics don't like it, you might as well get out of the way, because you're about to get run over.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:18,360
The Holy Ghost is come, the Holy Ghost is here, and Holy Ghost power is covering the earth like the waters cover the sea.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:27,720
Somebody has to be unafraid and unashamed to use the word repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:38,400
I want to say it's time somebody came along against the forces of darkness and gave the devil the only thing he understands,

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,480
and that is a striking, deadening blow from a bigger stick than he presents.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,940
Sizzle as God's word burns true, calling the devil to attention.

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:57,060
I think it's time somebody stood up, put their foot down, pushed their plate back, pointed their finger under the devil's nose,

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,540
and said,

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,780
Let us entong the church of Jesus Christ is here, and we intend on the kingdom coming.

10
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,460
Find out why it doesn't get any hotter than this.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,440
We could talk about those things until the cows come home.

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm not talking about religion, I'm not talking about going to church, I'm not talking about praying or reading your Bible.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,980
Well, friend, that's not the truth.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,040
That is not the truth, and if the truth could ever dawn on you how Jesus Christ feels toward police officers,

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,700
you'd know.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,340
It would never be the same.

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,620
When are you going to give your fear to me?

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,460
Catch me, baby.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,360
Catch me.

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,180
I'm going out for a pass.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,140
And it's the war.

22
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,340
War.

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,560
I've been trying to help you out, get through that, Red.

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,420
I've been trying to help you out, see you in September or something.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
But it's in your programming.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
Your programmers were programmed.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,300
And it's just like you.

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,860
And it's just like you.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,820
It's easy to be here in the now.

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,020
It's like I've been...

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,200
We're all falling in the same submarine of a solar system forever.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
When are you going to give your fear to me?

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,960
Catch me, girls.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,420
I'm going out for a pass.

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,700
And it's...

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm going out for a pass.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,440


38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,440


39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,440


40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,440


41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,440


42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,800
I've been trying to help you out, get through that, Red.

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,740
I've been trying to help you out, see you in September or something.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,660
But it's in your programming.

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,940
Your programmers were programmed.

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,420
And it's just like you.

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,960
And it's just like you.

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
It's easy to be here in the now.

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,000
Now, it's like I've been...

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,620
We're all falling in the same submarine of a solar system forever.

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,780
Is that okay by you?

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,480
If the planet spins, is that a fair deal?

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,260
Huh?

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,380
Huh?

55
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,980
Hey Earth, just don't check.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,440
What in God's name is happening here?

57
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,920
Will, I know that must have looked kind of funny to you, but...

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,240
Funny?

59
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,220
Now, wait a minute, Will. You see that kid back there? The kid's a genius. A space-age genius.

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,080
Well, what's he doing here?

61
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,980
Well, that's it, Will. You see, the kid wanted his own lab.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,440
Well, he started in taking stuff home from school. Radar sets, jet engines, that kind of thing.

63
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,720
Then he went after their atomic reactor.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,240
Ah, a radar.

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,140
A braving lunatic.

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,680
I tell you, Will, he can put them in orbit.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,440
He can what?

68
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,520
He can put them in orbit, Will.

69
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,820
He can put them into orbit.

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,300
He can put them into an orbit of eternal grace.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,620
Keep those eyes closed. You don't even want to try to open them.

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,840
You can hear everything that's going on around you.

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,980
And you are now in a very relaxed state of mind.

74
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,760
Like being stoned.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,980
Such a far-out stoned feeling.

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,820
Feeling higher than you have ever felt before.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,860
Tell me, Buck, what about clearance from the space agency? Think we'll have any trouble there?

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,200
Well, I'll tell you frankly, Will.

79
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,660
I don't trust those civilian eggheads.

80
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,100
Too much of the old pink old pre-bird in force to suit me.

81
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,100
Ah, I think I'll go straight to Mr. Big with this one.

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,300
Good idea, Buck.

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,600
But enough of this palaver.

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
Let's get the show on the road.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,100
Fantastic women, fantastic dancers, featuring the world's loveliest Bucs addicts.

86
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,100
You've only dreamed there were women like these until now.

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,600
But they're real.

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,580
Unbelievably real.

89
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,240
Stand by for blastoff.

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,400
Ladies and gentlemen, stand by for blastoff has just been called.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,540
And in just a few seconds, we'll have this historic countdown.

92
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,740
Now let me present to you the man of the hour.

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,940
Without whom, none of this would have been possible.

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,120
The blessed reverend.

95
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,500
Too long in earthly bondage.

96
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,340
So it is written.

97
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,580
And so it has come to pass.

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Resurrection.

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,400
24, 23, 22.

100
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,840
To soar in celestial serenity in large measure.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,520
And as always, this nation is beholden to the genius of its children for this great moment.

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,200
Yes, China may brainwash.

103
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,220
Ten, nine.

104
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,920
Russia may educate.

105
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,000
Six, five.

106
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,320
But America breeds its genius.

107
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,860
Blastoff!

108
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,640
And now, the subgenius hour of slack.

109
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,680
It gets up and kills.

110
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,720
The people it kills get up and kill.

111
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:39,600
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,620
And only in the city of...

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,560
and only in the city of...

114
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,560


115
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,740
You host.

116
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,320
A man whose mind is distorted by hatred.

117
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,220
This man is dangerous.

118
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,340
He carries no gun, no knife, no dynamite.

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,800
Locked in his brain is a power stronger than a load of dynamite.

120
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,800
The power to read men's minds and corrupt their women.

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,240
This is the Will O' Dobbs, the only man on earth who can force things to happen.

122
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,760
This woman has never known what it means to be controlled by a man.

123
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,240
Girls barely out of their teens watched without really knowing what they saw.

124
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,020
Here was a power that could have changed the world.

125
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,180
Instead, it led him down wild and abnormal adventures that could only happen to...

126
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,540
...Guerilla Dobs!

127
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,200
I love you.

128
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,900
I love you.

129
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,880
The whole world acclaimed his strange talent.

130
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,140
But as his powers grew, his lust included every woman who crossed his path.

131
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,440
It made no difference who they were.

132
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,860
The highest society glamour girls, aloof and distant from most men, were his to claim.

133
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,620
And there were others who fell into his arms and awoke later...

134
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,200
...horrified and ashamed of the unnatural acts they performed under the power of...

135
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,920
...me?

136
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,640
Yes, the will of Dobbs.

137
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Welcome, welcome to the show, such as it is.

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,780
And what is it going to be tonight?

139
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
What is tonight's show?

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,840
You got me.

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,860
I'll tell you what I did this weekend, listeners.

142
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,920
I took the advice of my own spiritual guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, and I slacked off today.

143
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,740
I spent yesterday and today playing with my...

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,600
...my niece.

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,860
Eight-month-old niece.

146
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,800
She's already a subgenius, I can just tell it.

147
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,620
So that's what I did.

148
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,940
Hello, India.

149
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,200
Hope you're listening.

150
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,580
So that's what I did.

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,480
Did that leave much time to put together a show?

152
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,120
No. No, it didn't.

153
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,300
But it is done anyway.

154
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,740
I worked in super dynamic overdrive tonight.

155
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,840
And there is a show here, and it's about to get started.

156
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,600
Boy, it took a long time to get started.

157
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,280
It started tonight, didn't it?

158
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,240
But you all know how that is.

159
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,080
So welcome to all old, new listeners tonight.

160
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,360
I think we have some new listeners tonight, from my understanding.

161
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,560
It's always good to hear from you.

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,120
And I know...

163
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,840
Congratulations to you listeners in Athens, Georgia.

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,160
Our latest addition.

165
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,200
We get more requests for free information.

166
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,460
No memberships, really, yet.

167
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,500
But hello to Athens, Georgia.

168
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,420
It's good to have you.

169
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,260
Good to have you aboard.

170
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,240
And to the rest of you, too.

171
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,000
Always glad to hear all of you.

172
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,280
So the...

173
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,160
Maybe we should just play this all night.

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,600
Okay, I'll tell you one thing you are going to hear at least two times tonight,

175
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,420
are those wonderful, beautiful, and swinging love corpses.

176
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,920
We're going to hear a couple of tracks from them tonight.

177
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
We've been neglectful of them.

178
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,400
In fact, without any further ado,

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,980
stay tuned for the swinging love corpses on the subgenius radio ministry.

180
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,160
Hour of Slack.

181
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,180
With your host tonight, The Will of Doms.

182
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
Thank you.

183
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,720
The Vortex took them.

184
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,100
Just...

185
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,720
Just took them away.

186
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:16,680
Just took them away.

187
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Oh, Daddy said, shake your head.

188
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,960
Oh, it's freaking really hot out there.

189
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,640
We didn't lie.

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,040
We didn't care.

191
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,260
We were stoking on the fine things that come in our hair.

192
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,480
The six pack was iced down in the backseat.

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,780
Was a stole grill.

194
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,380
Couldn't be beat.

195
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,960
.

196
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:42,700
.

197
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,940
.

198
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:57,940


199
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,000
.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,100
.

201
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,120
.

202
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,140
.

203
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,780
.

204
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,700
.

205
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,800
.

206
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:14,880
.

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:14,900
.

208
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,200
.

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,540
.

210
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,680
.

211
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:15,700
.

212
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:15,720
.

213
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,380
.

214
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,580
.

215
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,700
.

216
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:17,820
.

217
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:17,880
.

218
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,320
The Vortex took them.

219
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
The Vortex took them.

220
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,660
How many of you know what movie that's from?

221
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,300
I bet a lot of you, actually, if I know our listeners.

222
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,520
And I had to stop that tape real fast because if I were to play,

223
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,360
as with most of our tapes that we have here,

224
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,320
if I were to play one more second, you'd hear,

225
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,240
actually, you'd hear my most favorite Swinging Love Corpses song

226
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,900
that you'll never, ever, ever, ever hear on this radio program.

227
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,120
Maybe the last show. It certainly would be the last show.

228
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,100
And you know what else?

229
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,820
Every time I reach this point, I get, well, I don't know,

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,300
I get all choked up.

231
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,700
Here it is, the great statue of the Blessed Reverend Wilbur.

232
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,120
This world-famous statue was executed by the internationally known

233
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,000
artist and sculptorist Tina Tube.

234
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,520
And is available in handsome reproductions

235
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,600
at the gift shop near the West Gate.

236
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,380
They're really quite marvelous, those little reproductions.

237
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Now, look at the book

238
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,320
containing the creed of the Blessed Reverend.

239
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,420
This book is carved of the finest Carrara marble.

240
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,300
The letters on the pages, they're 18-carat gold.

241
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,220
And they're worth at least $30 a piece.

242
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,900
And now, I want you to hear something.

243
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,940
I want you to hear the Blessed Reverend himself

244
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,240
speak the words of the creed.

245
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,820
This is the actual voice of the Blessed Reverend himself.

246
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,600
Now, my friends, my old buddy God was a weird cat.

247
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,760
He really was. He was into everything.

248
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,280
Cranked out quite a number of them years ago,

249
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,120
and supposedly he's still at it.

250
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,820
I don't know if it was really an infinite number of universes.

251
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,280
I mean, you've got to stop somewhere.

252
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,000
But old God, he had this deal where you'd go from one universe to another

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,060
every time you died.

254
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,040
They'd start you off in the before life,

255
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,200
which was sort of like an eternal paradise

256
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,820
to kind of get you off on the right foot.

257
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,500
And then all of a sudden, you'd lose your memory

258
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,940
and get born here on Earth.

259
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,520
And then when you got old and died,

260
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,040
you'd pass on to the...

261
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,980
etheric universe next door.

262
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,260
And why, after you died there,

263
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,140
you'd be born into the angelic universe.

264
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,940
So once there, friend, you'd find out

265
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
there were dozens and dozens of them,

266
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,440
each one better than the last.

267
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,120
In fact, each one incomprehensibly better than the last.

268
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,500
And as long as you didn't screw up too bad,

269
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,340
you could keep on traveling up through the universes,

270
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,140
getting ever closer to the bob head.

271
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,360
But right when you thought the next level would be the last

272
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,220
and the ultimate goal,

273
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,140
the ultimate peak experience of eternal slackness, friends,

274
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,140
why, instead, right then, you'd get reborn on Earth

275
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,820
with your memory wiped out again,

276
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,580
just a few years after you died there the last time

277
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,900
and you'd have to start all over again.

278
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,320
And that's how it all keeps going on infinitely.

279
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,600
Friends, you know, sooner or later,

280
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,360
you run out of infinity, even infinity.

281
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,520
But see, here's the thing.

282
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,020
Usually, these facts are never announced.

283
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,320
Friends, and we do it on this show,

284
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
where we know it won't be believed.

285
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,940
But see, if you die bad, friend,

286
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,900
or if you're a messed-up person,

287
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,680
you might leave behind a part of your soul,

288
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,120
the lower soul, or what we call the nental eye.

289
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,340
And that becomes a poltergeist, friend,

290
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,740
or a wandering shade,

291
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,460
an Earth-bound spirit doomed to roam the Earth,

292
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,260
pathetically repeating its sad loop of behavior

293
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,000
that made it so hard for you to get out of it.

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,100
And that's how you get split from the higher soul

295
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,960
in the first place.

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,120
Can you imagine a ghost trying to buy a pack of cigarettes

297
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,340
for eternity, friends?

298
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,980
No, I can't.

299
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,200
Well, what have we been listening to mostly here?

300
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,980
That was, of course, Swinging Love Corpses

301
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,580
with The Vortex Took'Em.

302
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,240
A little bit of a movie I like called The Loved One,

303
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,980
and that was Reverend Stang just there just a second ago

304
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,320
talking about, you know, his old buddy God.

305
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
And, you know, stay tuned.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,960
Stay tuned for even more of what all's going on here,

307
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,400
whatever that may be.

308
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,600
Oh!

309
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,460
Oh!

310
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:56,880


311
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,260


312
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,440


313
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,200


314
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,480
Oh!

315
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,940
Oh!

316
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,180
Oh!

317
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,220
Oh!

318
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,500
Oh!

319
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,500


320
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,620
Oh!

321
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh!

322
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:03,960


323
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:03,960


324
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,020
Oh!

325
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,280
Oh!

326
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,280


327
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,280


328
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,280


329
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,300
Oh!

330
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,680
Oh!

331
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,720
Oh!

332
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:04,720


333
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:04,720


334
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:04,720


335
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,500
Oh!

336
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,500


337
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,500


338
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,700
Oh!

339
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,860
Before the office invite to go

340
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,540
A shooting in the rectangle

341
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,500
Shooting on a pedestal

342
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,780
So make sure I'm capable

343
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,980
Be Believer!

344
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:44,980


345
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,220
Seems that remember's in the past

346
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,480
Contortions that he can't recall

347
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,740
The torso on a trampoline

348
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,060
The happiness felt in to be

349
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,020
To talk, to touch, to get to see

350
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,860
To taste, to smell, to breathe

351
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,800
The grace of the past

352
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,500
The love that you had

353
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,360
Is the one that you have

354
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
And time replaces emotion

355
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,880
One thought at last, someday

356
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
In darkness

357
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,340
The dark way most likely

358
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,520
Loops free

359
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,320
Is a butterfly

360
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,140
To hum out with anxiety

361
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,380
To talk, to touch, to get to see

362
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,660
To talk, to touch, to get to see

363
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,480
To feel

364
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,180
Maybe the same

365
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,460
If only I don't see

366
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,640
And you've gone

367
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,640


368
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,640


369
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,640


370
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,640


371
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,640


372
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,540
And back it up

373
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,640
To behind the chней

374
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,460
Can we try

375
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:14,940
And check the beauty

376
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,780
He's got blood in the nose

377
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,280
He is taking us along

378
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,880
He's got a net

379
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,260
But not the thing that depicts

380
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,620
The toast-cast reaction

381
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,240
So we get away

382
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,580
With his mouth shut

383
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,800
His mouth shut

384
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,400
He still shakes his butt

385
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,320
Cause he's struggling

386
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,900
And sweating and chomping

387
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,020
Trafalgar

388
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,480
Oh, oh, oh

389
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,140
Oh, oh, oh

390
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,200
Oh, oh, oh

391
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,640
Oh, oh, oh

392
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,340
No further questions at this time, Your Honor.

393
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,080
The witness may step down.

394
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,540
Call the next witness, please.

395
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,080
Your Honor, the people...

396
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,280
May I question him, Your Honor?

397
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,960
No, you may not.

398
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,200
Call the next witness.

399
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,800
Your Honor, the people would like...

400
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,780
You know, I'm going to defend myself one way or another.

401
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,600
I'd like to do it with words.

402
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,880
If you insist on interrupting this court, I'll have no choice but to have you removed.

403
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,220
Call the next witness.

404
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,120
I have you removed.

405
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,280
I have a little sister in here.

406
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,260
Mr. Manson, you are instructed to silence yourself.

407
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,460
Call the next witness.

408
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
Do you think I'm good?

409
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,260
Yes!

410
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,020
Silence! Silence!

411
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,620
Your Honor, the defense moves for a mistrial.

412
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,580
Your Honor, the defense moves for a mistrial.

413
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,320
Denied.

414
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,760
The defendants will not prosper by their own misconduct.

415
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,560
This court...

416
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:43,960
This court will continue.

417
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,460
The witness may step down.

418
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,780
Call your next witness, please.

419
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,580
The witness may step down.

420
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,080
Call the next witness, please.

421
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,660
Your Honor, the people would like...

422
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,780
May I question him, Your Honor?

423
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,440
No, you may not.

424
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,660
Call the next witness.

425
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,300
Your Honor, the people would like...

426
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,260
You know, I'm going to defend myself one way or another.

427
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
I'd like to do it with words.

428
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,420
If you insist on interrupting this court, I'll have no choice but to have you removed.

429
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,640
Call the next witness.

430
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,620
I have you removed.

431
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,700
I have a little sister in here.

432
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,520
Mr. Manson, you're instructed...

433
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:27,800
I need your silence, Your Honor.

434
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:28,840
PKim

435
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:42,000
Dance, Raja, Dance.

436
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,560
Yeah!

437
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:51,620
South Indian film music, don't you see? Because as the liner notes helpfully point out, India is

438
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,040
the film capital of the world. Why, they make more movies there, almost four times as many as

439
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,720
Hollywood per year, and attract more moviegoers than anywhere else in the universe. The two largest

440
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,960
buildings in many small villages are the temple and the cinema. And to top it all off, many of

441
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,880
the most popular politicians are former movie stars, just like in the United States. So it's

442
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,340
really strange, this whole CD is basically the work of one guy, and I'm gonna play at least one

443
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:24,220
track from it for you tonight, and in the future perhaps. So I like it, I hope you will too. This

444
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:34,060
is a little piece called Nahani Maharaja, or I Am the Emperor. Thank you.

445
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,620
Nahani Maharaja

446
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Nahani Maharaja

447
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Nahani Maharaja

448
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:22,860
Nahani Maharaja

449
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,880

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,140
Ohohohoh

Ramon

467
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:12,840


468
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,640
I will come with you every day.

469
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,080
King, oh King, I will come with you every day.

470
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:05,220
King, oh King, I will come with you every day.

471
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,220
I will come with you every day.

472
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,460
I will come with you every day.

473
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,920
Oh God, why did you make me a burden?

474
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,540
Why did you make me a burden?

475
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:38,200
I am the king of this world.

476
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,480
I am the king of this world.

477
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,820
Oh God, I will come with you every day.

478
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,100
I am the king of this world.

479
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,820
I am the king of this world.

480
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,780
The queen gave a big kiss to the king.

481
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,440
The man who has a lot of desires has come here in the morning.

482
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,700
King, oh King, I will come with you every day.

483
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,640
King, oh King, I will come with you every day.

484
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:10,880
King, oh King, I will come with you every day.

485
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,060
Ah, thank you.

486
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,780
That was, again, South Indian film music.

487
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,020
And the album is called, again, Dance, Raja Dance.

488
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,020
South Indian film music.

489
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,360
And what sort of music now, I wonder, for this?

490
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,440
That's pretty, isn't it?

491
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,700
The horror.

492
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,380
Some of us haven't forgotten.

493
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,540
Some of you long, well, not even necessarily long-time listeners,

494
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,080
just even short, even you short-timers out there,

495
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,480
perhaps remember a show that we did not too awful long ago.

496
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,140
Hope it was not too awful.

497
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,600
And in which virtually the entire show is taken up with a long reading

498
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,660
from the wonderful magazine Murder Can Be Fun,

499
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,100
and the subject was, I'm sure those of you who heard it will remember always,

500
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,680
was the hideous deaths that have occurred at Disneyland.

501
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,900
And apparently the author got a fair number of responses to that one,

502
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,400
and I hope a lot of subscriptions because the new one has just come out.

503
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,480
The new issue of Murder Can Be Fun, stand by for the address.

504
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,420
And I think the redoubtable Mr. John Marr has outdone himself,

505
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,840
with this issue's feature piece.

506
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,060
It's a good one, my dear listeners.

507
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,300
And I'm not going, we're not going to read you the whole essay this time,

508
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,960
because we want you to send for this information on how to get this.

509
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,660
But it's, we're going to read a little bit of it.

510
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,400
The title alone, I think, should pique your curiosity.

511
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,540
The title of this issue's feature essay is,

512
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,800
Please, Mr. Postman, Don't Shoot.

513
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,320
It begins,

514
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,360
Pity the poor postal worker.

515
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Nobly they make their appointed rounds,

516
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,580
in spite of the tacky polyester blend blue shorts they are forced to wear,

517
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,160
and the horrible conditions ranging from snow to sleet to the gloom of night that await them.

518
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,740
Nonetheless, they are universal targets of abuse.

519
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,540
Blue-haired widows upset over a 24-hour delay,

520
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,680
in the delivery of their social security checks.

521
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,860
Sick their ill-mannered poodles on innocent letter carriers.

522
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,540
Poorly applied staples and occasional used hypodermic syringes,

523
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,540
quote, found loose in the mails, rip at the flesh of mail handlers.

524
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,220
Frenzied SSI recipients lunge at general delivery counter clerks,

525
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,700
quivering behind barriers of bulletproof glass.

526
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,680
And everyone, from the most senior senator in Washington,

527
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,440
to the drunk at the corner bar, rants and raves over paying a few pennies more,

528
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,000
for a first-class stamp.

529
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,880
Yet these threats from outside pale,

530
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,620
pale next to the dangers that lurk on the other side of the counter.

531
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,440
For all the excitement, nothing serious happens after a rate increase.

532
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,240
A few high-level scapegoats are terminated,

533
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,980
the counter staff is abused when the supply of four-cent stamps gives out,

534
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,920
the octogenarians' poodles may have sharp teeth, but they aren't rabid,

535
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,660
and the street schizophrenics are seldom armed with more than their own delusions.

536
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,960
The same, however, cannot be said of the postal workers themselves.

537
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:51,860
Over the last twelve years, United States postal employees have taken to packing every manner of gun,

538
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:58,280
from .22 pistols to AK-47s, as well as bombs, hand grenades, and samurai swords.

539
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,940
And their targets aren't vicious dogs or irate customers.

540
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,840
Rather, they are their poplin-clad brethren,

541
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,920
as USPS mailrooms have turned into the killing fields of American industry.

542
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,040
Bullets have flown in post offices from New Orleans to Boston.

543
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,140
Blood has soaked the mails from San Diego to Manhattan,

544
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:23,500
as berserk postal workers seek vengeance for personal and professional slights, real or imagined.

545
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,380
Listeners, this whole long article is nothing but...

546
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,040
very long, it's a multitude of ten, twelve pages of nothing but...

547
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,340
postmen going nuts and killing their fellow workers.

548
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,580
This is scrupulously detailed.

549
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,420
Also in this issue, there's a lot of talk about the police.

550
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,500
There's an issue, Riot On.

551
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,200
A quick look back at twelve of the most memorable riots in US history,

552
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,760
with illustrations.

553
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,240
It's amazing, I mean, we have nothing to compare with it these days.

554
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,460
Oh, and here's a map to a future national monument.

555
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,640
It's official directions to the site of George Henard's record-setting

556
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,980
1991-22 victim shooting spree at Luby's in Killeen.

557
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,220
The Nashville train wreck.

558
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,480
Reviews of awful books, like the Indiana Torture Slaying.

559
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,980
Women Who Love Men Who Kill.

560
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,960
The Milwaukee Murders.

561
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,140
You know, Jeffrey Dahmer.

562
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,720
As he points out here, they're arrested in July.

563
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,040
The books came out in October.

564
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,580
So, there you go.

565
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,840
Galapagos Affair.

566
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,320
Beverly Hills, Anatomy of a Nightclub Fire.

567
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,140
So, it's a...

568
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,400
it's a heck of a magazine, dear friends.

569
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,120
And every, every, uh...

570
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,180
well, I don't know, as he points out, it's published on an irregular and erratic basis.

571
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,140
By John Marr.

572
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,420
And if you'd like information on how to get this or any other, you know, issue or what,

573
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,080
and, or his fabulous, fabulous date book, which I recommend more than highly,

574
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,400
write for that free information to John Marr, M-A-R-R,

575
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,400
at P.O. Box 640-111

576
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,520
in San Francisco, California, 94109.

577
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,580
Don't forget to do that.

578
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,980
Address for Subgenius, coming later.

579
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,420
In the last few, we've been listening to a tune called Travolta by Mr. Bungle

580
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,000
and more of the sweet Manson Family Opera.

581
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,180
And this thing is by a guy named Moby.

582
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,420
I like it for some reason.

583
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,540
Can't quite put my finger on it.

584
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,700
But I'm not sure this is the right thing to do.

585
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:53,700


586
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,860
We'll see.

587
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:56,860


588
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:56,860


589
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:56,860


590
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:02,580
Have a good one.

591
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,240
Bye bye.

592
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,980
Bye to you too.

593
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:04,560
Bye.

594
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


595
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


596
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


597
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


598
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


599
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


600
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


601
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


602
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


603
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


604
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


605
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


606
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,700


607
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,020
Bye.

608
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,780
that will peel the skin off your back.

609
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,580
There was no Miranda rule back then.

610
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,080
Everybody was guilty, and punishment was swift and terrible.

611
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,540
There was no place to hide or even run.

612
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,900
It was the end of the world, the time of the final judgment.

613
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,080
And in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it,

614
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,300
and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

615
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,360
That is Revelation 9, 6, one of the milder and more forgiving verses,

616
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,360
and one of Ronald Reagan's favorites.

617
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,320
The president is very keen on the book of Revelation.

618
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,140
I love it for the sharp and terrible power of the language,

619
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,080
but Dutch really believes it.

620
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,260
Sometime around Christmas in 1985, he told a reporter from People magazine that,

621
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,200
quote, this generation may be the one that will face the end of the world.

622
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,640
Indeed, that's you and me, sport, buried in fire and ripped to shreds like lizards.

623
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,980
Out of the valley, out of the valley, out of the valley.

624
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,880
Yeah!

625
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,040
Yeah!

626
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,180
Yeah!

627
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,080
Yeah!

628
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah!

629
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,340
Yeah!

630
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,420
Yeah!

631
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:30,420


632
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,580
Yeah!

633
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,340


634
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,340


635
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,420
Yeah!

636
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:32,460
Yeah!

637
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:32,600


638
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,220
Yeah!

639
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,220


640
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,220


641
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,320
Yeah!

642
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,480
Yeah!

643
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah!

644
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,000


645
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,000
Are you a boy or a girl?

646
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,160
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl or a boy.

647
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,820
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl.

648
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,220
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl.

649
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,340
You're just the way you're supposed to be.

650
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,880
Baby girls grow up to be big girls and then ladies.

651
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,860
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl.

652
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,260
Baby girls grow up to be big girls and then ladies.

653
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,300
Big girls and then ladies.

654
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,140
Baby girls, big girls, and then ladies.

655
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,460
Baby girls, big girls, and then ladies.

656
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,260
Big girls and then ladies.

657
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,860
Baby boys grow up to be big girls and then ladies.

658
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,920
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl.

659
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,860
But now I know that if you're a boy, you were born a girl.

660
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,480
It's a strange world where you can never be sure of what is around the corner.

661
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:59,260
Boys don't never, but never, make fun of no cripples.

662
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,900
Somebody called and giggled at you.

663
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,100
That's a violation of your civil rights, Gumpit.

664
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,400
That's what the world is full of.

665
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,940
That's what it's based on.

666
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,700
That's what this economy is based on.

667
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,300
Are you telling me that you don't see the connection between government and laughing at people?

668
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,080
Well, let me tell you one thing, son.

669
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,100
Nobody ever lends money to a man with a sense of humor.

670
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,620
You're all invited to a centennial celebration.

671
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,840
What they were celebrating wasn't important.

672
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,580
And it sounded like a heap of fun until...

673
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:39,140
2000 maniacs, crazed for time, started bathing an entire town in pulsing human blood.

674
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,500
You'll see six young strangers doomed to slaughter by an ancient curse.

675
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,120
From his lips there came an awful sound.

676
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,520
And from his lips there came an awful sound.

677
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,420
Brutal, evil, ghastly beyond belief.

678
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,880
You'll see the most diabolical device ever controlled.

679
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,200
The most evil of the five.

680
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,380
Designed solely for assassination by a town of madmen.

681
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,800
Insane, with blood lust.

682
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,840
It takes all kinds to work at Junkyard Sal's.

683
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:18,280
Like Zebula, member of one of the many minority groups in small town's bubbling melting pot.

684
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,640
One day, his dream is to own a junkyard of his own.

685
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,820
Then there's Bull Badger and his faithful sidekick, Tyrone.

686
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,880
Bull's a redneck, lean and mean.

687
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,880
Tyrone is a man of his word.

688
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,520
Tyrone's a racist.

689
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,180
Crude, rude and tattooed.

690
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,820
Dropouts from the rat race of life.

691
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,800
Human flotsam.

692
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,040
Useless roadblocks in the avenue of progress.

693
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,980
Bitterly envious of the lower classes.

694
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,580
Rejected by the volunteer army.

695
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,580
Their choice in life is a sad but simple one.

696
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,760
The drunk tank or the scrap heap.

697
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,720
But at Junkyard Sal's, they can find at last a useful purpose.

698
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,880
Because even they can be used as a weapon.

699
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,300
To be recycled.

700
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,620
To be made useful again in Sal's scheme of things.

701
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,540
The genetic principle.

702
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,080
It's very important to watch for manifestations of omnipotent control.

703
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,200
The genetic principle.

704
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,960
In particular, they is very worrisome.

705
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,980
The

706
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,260
Oh, that's a squirmy!

707
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,720
Oh, the first one went down easy.

708
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,860
But the second one was breezy.

709
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,180
Oh!

710
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,240
Just a flyin'.

711
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,520
Yes, sirree.

712
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,940
Just a flyin'.

713
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,220
Yes, sirree.

714
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,620
Shall we pray?

715
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,860
We recognize that in thy sovereignty,

716
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,720
Thou has permitted Ronald Reagan to lead us for the past eight years.

717
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,160
We pray that if he and his wife Nancy leave the White House

718
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,900
And go to the rest codes,

719
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,000
That thou wouldst give them many more years of help and happiness.

720
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,620
And now we come to a new era in our history.

721
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,540
In thy sovereignty thou has permitted George Bush.

722
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,520
George Bush to lead us in this momentous history for the next four years.

723
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,640
See, we have been here a hundred times.

724
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,140
And it is appropriate that we become the people of the world.

725
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,860
Man rules now where they ruled once.

726
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:52,400
They wait, patient and potent, for here they shall reign again

727
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,280
and rule where they once walked.

728
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,100
The old ones broke through of old and they shall break through again.

729
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,560
Stranger, enter these gates and be happy.

730
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,280
They told me, Francis Hensley,

731
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,180
they told me you were hung

732
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,560
with red protruding eyeballs.

733
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,100
And black protruding tongue.

734
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,680
The truth has not been in your courtroom.

735
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,620
Never has been in your courtroom.

736
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,540
All you have is confusion in your courtroom.

737
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,920
Why do I have to stand and take the blame for your sins again?

738
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,660
I've spent my life in jail.

739
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,260
Paying for you.

740
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,040
So that you could ride your bicycles.

741
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,620
Have your birthday parties.

742
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,400
Have what you call a life.

743
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,880
You know, I never had a life.

744
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,440
I don't even know what life is, you know.

745
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,820
I go to your desert.

746
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,120
I'm not even allowed to live in your desert.

747
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,020
I'm no good for anything except to be used

748
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,260
as your skin.

749
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,640
I'm a cape goat.

750
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,180
I'm used.

751
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
Every day of my life I've been used.

752
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,500
When I haven't been used and I have been on the street.

753
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,460
I've been chased, run, harassed, pushed, kicked.

754
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,900
My ribs have been broken, you know.

755
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:48,260
The same guy that gives you a traffic ticket is the same guy that knocks my brains out.

756
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,560
He figures just because he's the man, he can get away with it because nobody's gonna say anything.

757
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,720
My daddy's not a congressman.

758
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,500
Or a doctor.

759
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,160
Or a lawyer.

760
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,780
I'm sorry, I got to tell you something.

761
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,680
Sorry, I got to tell you something.

762
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,760
Sorry, I got to tell you something.

763
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,160
AHHH!

764
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,960
What happened there?

765
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,440
AHHH!

766
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,280
Expl���aahhhbo increases the amount of intellect in people okhee darllen so ob przed

767
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,820

768
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,600
th asteroid

769
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,060
Is Bob there?

770
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,480
She's laughing at me.

771
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,200
My soul is free.

772
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,040
Bob!

773
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,680
Can you do anything?

774
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,260
Bob!

775
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
I must be in different times.

776
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:21,980
Bob!

777
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:22,740


778
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,700
I know it sounds crazy,

779
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,880
but sometimes I have a dream.

780
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,220
I dream that I'm in the food giant supermarket,

781
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,020
the one on La Brea Street,

782
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,320
buying lobsters for Mom,

783
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,520
the biggest, juiciest lobsters you can imagine.

784
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,520
I buy them by the dozen,

785
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,700
just the way people buy eggs.

786
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,280
And then they see me coming to the market,

787
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,000
and they say,

788
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,200
here comes the lobster man.

789
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,680
Here he comes.

790
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,480
And then I know it sounds crazy,

791
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,280
but then I kind of,

792
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,860
I do this little dance,

793
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,240
and I sing,

794
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,960
Mama little joy boy want lobster, lobster.

795
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,620
Mama's little joy boy want lobster for Mom.

796
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,200
And then the whole dream changes.

797
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,300
I don't know, it becomes like a nightmare.

798
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,180
Because when I put that big darn platter of juicy lobsters

799
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,120
down in front of Mom,

800
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,000
they're still alive.

801
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,740
As if I haven't cooked them at all.

802
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,660
And suddenly I start to cry,

803
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,600
because I feel that I've let Mom down again.

804
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,440
That's all right, Laugh, she says.

805
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,600
I'll take them the way they are.

806
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,600
By golly, she tears right into those live lobsters claws and all.

807
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,000
But they fight back.

808
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,400
And they mean to claw her,

809
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,920
and chew her,

810
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,640
and eat her,

811
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,140
and it's...

812
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,240
I don't want to think about it.

813
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,520
But they don't stop.

814
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,660
They just keep on clawing and biting.

815
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,560
And then finally,

816
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,680
there's no more Mom.

817
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,020
Mom!

818
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,540
Mom!

819
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,680
Mom!

820
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,800
Mom!

821
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,140
Mom!

822
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,860
Are you hurt?

823
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,620
Mom!

824
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,140
Mom!

825
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:30,500


826
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:30,780
Mom!

827
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:30,780


828
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,980
You faker.

829
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,420
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

830
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,080
It's a time space warp.

831
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,200
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.

832
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,400
How?

833
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,040
I don't suppose anybody really does.

834
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,340
We've seen some strange things tonight.

835
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,920
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.

836
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,280
God only knows where they came from.

837
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,400
Jenny and... and Ben!

838
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,600
The Vortex took them.

839
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,040
Just...

840
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,720
Just took them away.

841
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,180
We have seen some strange things here tonight, dear friends,

842
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,520
and if you want to see some more coming through your mailbox,

843
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,340

Thanks a lot.

850
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,180
Stay tuned for more swinging love corpses.

851
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:38,780

852

859
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:42,380


860
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:42,580


861
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,760
guitar solo

862
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,560
guitar solo

863
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,760
guitar solo

864
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:00,480
You know, I was walking down the beach

865
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,380
Trying to get to my Woody

866
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,860
Well, I had my suds cold and my buds was gold

867
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,720
I was gonna get high and get real drunk

868
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,500
Woo!

869
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,480
Lay in the sand

870
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,360
With my beach bunny

871
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,220
With my beach bunny

872
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,440
But out to the side

873
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,340
Out of the side of my eye

874
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,300
I saw the ultimate wave

875
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,840
The super wave

876
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,720
It was the most stoked out stud wave

877
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,500
In all reality

878
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,600
It was 900 feet tall

879
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,940
And on the backside of reality too

880
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,340
I saw a black hole

881
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,520
Right in the middle of it

882
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,620
A vortex

883
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,580
I was ready to shoot through that black hole

884
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,700
Had my molecules rearranged

885
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,960
I'm gonna hang five

886
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,100
As I shoot through the black hole

887
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,540
Of the vortex of the super wave

888
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,740
The most god awful wave of reality

889
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,040
On the backside of reality

890
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,020
The front side

891
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,920
And the left side

892
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,820
And the right side

893
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,500
I was tubing

894
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,780
I was fixing to cut out

895
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,020
And then

896
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,300
And then

897
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:51,040
Which one would this be?

898
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,080
Honey, honey

899
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,580
How do I say this?

900
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:56,600
That is the

901
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:56,600


902
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:56,600


903
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:56,760
That is the

904
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:56,760


905
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:56,760


906
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,600
For me

907
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:07,000
It is

908
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:09,900
One of the willst

909
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,200
As much as I hate to admit it, it felt pretty good.

910
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,660
It felt pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex wave
