From PR news in Washington, I'm banging on a pipe inserted into a Boston native today, but so far, no response.
Anti-government protesters in the Central Asian country of West Virginia stand.
They're considerably higher than just a few weeks ago.
PR's calling for the current government to step down.
And injure his shoulder.
Kevin Federal Safedration says North Korea and the Washington Teachers Union
have reached a tentative agreement after a report showing U.S. gasoline supplies lower than expected.
There are reports that this is PR news in Washington.
The subgenius power of sweat.
I'm bored.
What plaything can you offer me today?
An obscure body in the SK system, Your Majesty.
The inhabitants refer to it as
The subgenius power of sweat.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Most effective, Your Majesty.
Will you destroy this, uh...
Subgenius power of sweat.
Later.
I like to play with things a while.
Before annihilation.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
From PR news in Washington, I'm the Coast Guard.
Control the oil.
Mexico.
A letter the Guard has sent to BP
sets an end-of-the-weekend deadline
for the BP to speed up efforts to pick up the pace.
BP Chief Operating Officer says he understands BP.
BP says it will respond to BBC today.
The subgenius power of sweat.
The subgenius power of sweat.
The subgenius power of sweat.
Support for PR comes from Progressive Insurance,
sponsor of A Race to Develop Cars.
Now that's progressive.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm taking a first step in easing global protests
over its deadly confrontation with snack foods and drinks.
But authorities say they still need a steady flow of PR hours.
So, let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
Yeah!
Come and get it!
Woo!
The redneck cookout was going full swing
Almost everyone in town had just arrived
Folks were throwing on the grill
Everything that they could kill
And a couple critters that were still alive
While the meat was running down
When army folks from out of town
Showed up and started bossing us around
They said everyone should leave
And now this you won't believe
The dead were up and crawling from the ground
Say, hang on right here
I just had a great idea
We'll have a zombie apocalypse barbecue
I'll save a couple ribs for you
Even though y'all were elated
You'll be thankful that you hated this
Zombie apocalypse barbecue
Make some for me!
The zombies started gathering
His bill began to slather
In the sauce on which he built his family name
But one of the zombies got him
So my sister up and shot him in the head
And then she dumped him in the flame
By the time we started packing up
The zombies were attacking us
They bit me and it caused a bunch of pain
But I heard the zombies say
Is my life just slipped away?
Could we try some of that sauce out on your brain?
I thought why not just let her?
The sauce makes everything better
At the zombie apocalypse barbecue
Well even if you don't survive
Be it brains or chicken wings
Barbecue's one of those things
That makes you smile just to be alive
Zombie apocalypse barbecue
We'll save some ribs for you
Whether or not you deserve it
Everybody will get served out at the
Zombie apocalypse barbecue
We'll save some ribs for you
Whether or not you deserve it


That there's some good eatin'
Alright, step right up
What kind of sauce would you like?
Spicy or mild?
Good God, son, what happened to you?
You look terrible
Here, take this
Hey, let go of the arms! What are you doing?

You're supposed to eat the ribs, son! Not me!
No! Let go! No! No!
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Come with me if you want to live

Anyway, not wearing two-bladed turn-lock is gonna be a real bad day, get it?
Come with me if you want to live.
This is Cactus Dangerous.
Brain fog.
This is Cactus Dangerous.
Brain fog.
This is Cactus Dangerous.
Brain fog.
This is Cactus Dangerous.
Come with me if you want to live.
Toto?
I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
Roger that.
This absolutely will not stop.
Ever.
Until you are dead.
Come with me if you want to live.
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Come with me if you want to live.
Yooooo!
And that was St. Anne.
And is Dave here?
I'm here.
Dave is here.
There's that old Dave.
Dave came.
All over his shoes.
That's not funny.
It certainly isn't.
In the middle of...
Oh, I have to give the credits, as always.
Your call is, of course, the cue for the credits of what's been done.
Credits.
So far.
That was St. Anne doing X Day.
And then there was all a series of End of the World songs.
Before that, the one called Zombie Apocalypse Barbecue.
It's by our friends at Consortium of Genius.
Or C-O-G.
COG.
Consortiumofgenius.com.
They're like a musical comedy variety show group that does skits.
And that one, Zombie Apocalypse Barbecue, that kind of relates to our upcoming X Day holiday.
As did Jonathan Colton's song, Always the Moon.
And the very weird electronic with the little voice going...
That voice was Janer.
And the music was done by Reverend Sodi.
Sodi.
The subgenius in hell, the plaintive subgenius in hell, was Reverend Eric,
who also helped with one of the intro tracks, as did The Large.
And?
Preuberant.
Preuberant lemur, the cousin of Fernandanende lemur, the Madagascarian subgenius.
So was he the preuberant preponderant?
He's the actual cousin?
Right.
Cousin lemur.
Preuberant lemur, cousin of Fernandanende.
So one is thin and smelt, and the other one is smelt regularly?
Yes.
And what is the reason?



You know, I can take a hint, man.
I know I need a shower.
I'm painfully aware that I could use a shower.
Yeah, but you're not 200 pounds overweight and need a shower.
That's a different smell.
I'm working on it, though.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Well, as my friend Mr. Sistar loses weight, having had the operation, I'm gaining it all.
It's like a karmic balance.
So I'm hoping that by X day I'll be too heavy to be lifted up by the Space Brothers into their escape vessels.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You probably need one of those grocery store wheelchairs for the large ladies with a little flag and says,
Support our troops on it.
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
Huh?
I hadn't.
I read on the Internet that back in 2003 when the balloon went up,
when the shooting started in Iraq, I didn't like what Emperor Bush's war,
but I have sympathy for men at arms.
And on our website, it was all red, white, and blue bobs, and it said,
We support our troops.
And I read today that because of that, I'm not a communist.
And they thought that was the person writing thought that was bad
because they were the chaos.
They're a mass Marxism group.
They're discordians of some kind of...
They're the kind of people who think that the one political path is the right one,
whereas we all know that the only one that's right is our individual political path.
As determined by the large platypus J.R. Bob Dobbs.
We have to add that because he's the mastermind behind every tuba.
Yep.
He's the one blowing the bass parts.
He's the one singing in the background here, I think.
Oh, no.
What is that noise in the background?
Afro-Celtic.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, the background music is the Afro-Celtic.
Is that the name of the band?
Afro-Celt or something?
No, it's not that.
It's Afro-Celtic Orchestra or something.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, Afro-Celt.
I'll listen to that.
Afro-Celtic.
That's it.
Well, that's how exciting it sounds like every other music.
Because that is what is great about music.
It is the unifying...
It's the unifying factor.
It's the hands and the feet and the third nostril of those who care to dance to the pooper.
You know, if they can get that far.
Oh, you should have seen Princess We rocking out in the studio here a little while ago
when that Janeer voice song was on.
Hey, it was lively.
Oh, and the extra St. Anne song.
It's lively, too.
Oh, yeah.
And the zombie apocalypse barbecue.
That one made my mouth water.
So she pantomimed to all of those songs.
She, like, walked around.
And the zombie one.
She held her hands out and went...
Yeah, I did interpretive dancing to all of it.
That is so artistic.
I kind of wish I had your succinct flavor.
You probably wish you had her body.
No, I wish I had some sort of human body.
Well, Dave, you'll get to...
Well, not necessarily a subgenius body, perhaps.
We all get to leave our bodies on that glorious time.
Which is coming up.
The time that we have looked forward to ever since it was first predicted 12 years ago in 1998.
Yes, this year might be it.
Next day, July 5th.
And I can advertise it on this public radio station
because it's pretty certain that I won't be making any money off of that.
Also...
No, seriously.
Also, Starwood.
Is coming up immediately after X-Day.
New date.
At a new date.
We are literally going to have to leave our escape vessels at 7.15 on July 5th
and go to the Starwood escape vessel,
which will be temporarily landed in Pomeroy, Ohio,
at a campground called Wisteria.
Almost on the Ohio River.
And it will be different and new because it won't be the same.
It's a new place.
And a new date.
Are there fabrications in the earth?
Indian mounds and different things like that?
Yes, there are, in fact.
Yes, there are Indian mounds there.
And they have made their own mounds there.
There's Turtle Mound and Ancestor Mound that they have made.
And Popular Candy Mound and Blue Light Special Mound.
And Unpopular Lonesome Cowboy Dave Mound.
No, I won't be at Wisteria because it's so far.
It's so hard.
It reminds me of trying to walk to the planet Xeron backwards with no feet.
In the snow.
In the snow.
In the burning hot sun and snow.
And pouring rain.
Without a drop to drink.
No.
With too much spaghetti.
Slugging our way through this horrible life
with only the dangling carrot of Bob's Promise
hanging in front of our blinkered faces.
Danny on.
Of course.
Get your chop.
He's leading us past an entire road lined with free carrot stands.
But you know how people are.
They have narrow focus.
Especially when you put blinkers on them like we did.
And you have someone as eye-catching as Bob.
I mean, come on.
Bob is more than eye-catching.
He's like nose-grabbing.
He's brain-smashing.
One of those people that goes up to your face and pulls your nose.
Yes.
He pulls your nose and he yanks your ear.
And then he comes...
He gives you a whoop-whoop sound, unfortunately,
which you can't do very well.
He tries to sound like Curly.
Instead, he sounds like a baboon.
He gives you a wedgie.
And he pantses you.
De-pantses you.
While he pants.
Yes.
Like a baboon.
If we had better leaders.
Think how much better things would be
if we didn't have leaders like Bob.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I mean...
And Bob's the perfect leader.
He's never around.
And he...
His commandments don't make a lick of sense.
Not a lick.
To speak of.
I guess that's my kind of leader, then.
Right.
He doesn't know what the hell he's saying.
He's not there anyway.
You can be alone with Bob.
You know?
You can have your cake and eat it.
And still have cake.
And you can do the cake walk afterwards,
with Bob, down a long, nuptial driveway.
That old Bob.
And you can have a short-duration marriage,
even with Bob in your mind.
Bob was the reason...
Yeah.
What?
That's true.
He said you could have a short-duration marriage
with Bob in your mind.
Oh.
That makes me feel better about what I did today.
Oh.
We were...
Bob and I were married, after all,
in a certain way.
It was legal.
And it was...
It was right in the eyes of someone,
of God, or...
some...
perhaps Dobbs himself.
Gosh, glad I was away at a meeting.
I don't think I would have liked to have seen that.
It was all right in the eyes of Gosh.
God's second-in-command.
His right-hand man, Gosh.
It's okay to say Gosh, damn it,
because it's not so vain when you do that.
How about Golly, damn it?
Well, Golly, gosh, darn,
is like the nephew.
God's nephew.
Oh!
Well, you know, Golly G's is, um,
is a subtractive art
that they use in the Orient,
sometimes like an abacus.
No, it means, um, Golly G,
and, you know, you fill in the remaining parts,
but you don't want to blast humor.
I believe in Golly G.
I believe in Golly G.
I believe in cripes.
I believe in cripes.
I believe in tuna salsan,
chicken salsan.
I believe in cramps.
And criminy.
St. Criminy.
The, Jesus' third nephew,
step-neighbor-in-law.
Oh, yes.
And criminies.
Oh, yes, we will, but soon.
You know, it's only two weeks
before we start packing the I-van
for X-Day at Brushwood.
Because that actually starts June 30th,
and we'll be hauling Dr. Howell out there,
Dr. Philodrummond and his girls,
will be there.
Um, the amino acids will be at X-Day.
Fat Man D will be at X-Day.
Oh, you and Fat Man D have a special concert planned,
don't you, Princess Wee?
Yes.
We have a rehearsal coming up,
just to practice for it.
And what will it be?
Well, I'm going to accompany her
in some torch songs,
the kind of torch songs that she sings,
but add some,
some harmony.
Who will be the accompanists?
The torturers.
That's why it's called Torch Song.
Ah.
We'll have the,
they'll play the torturers.
They'll be holding their feet in fire.
Baron Munchausen,
the torturer's apprentice,
or something like that.
Baron von Munchausen will be there?
Yeah, and the sultan.
And the Turks will be at X-Day.
A eunuch's, that was it,
the name of the song was
A Eunuch's Life is Hard.
Yes.
But that is all,
I think was the way that song went.
Well, one is reminded of the,
of the Chinese eunuch admirals
who were sent around the world
in the 1400s,
in the early 1400s and late 1300s
to navigate the entire planet
and bring back a large map.
That's right.
I didn't know that those were
eunuch captains of those ships.
Yes, although there were
many hot concubines
which were used as a form of trade.
The guys on top were left alone,
so to speak.
The pitchers.
Yeah.
I read that there is a wreck
of an ancient, really ancient,
but pretty large ship
at the bottom of a river
near San Francisco
that nobody can really prove this either way,
but they think it might possibly be
one of those Chinese expeditions
that found the New World
before Columbus did.
Well, why do you think the Haida
and the other people of the Northwest
were trading with the Japanese?
The Japanese got the maps
of the cool places to go
to get whatever they wanted,
be it large beetles and bugs and stuff
or reeds or chicken spit.
I didn't know that the Japanese
got to the New World.
Oh, they,
it was more than rumored
that they traded,
and intermarried with the Haida
and the people of Northern California
all the way up to Oregon
or Washington,
whichever is the farthest.
I did not know that.
I never heard that.
I heard about the Chinese
and, of course,
the Vikings for sure.
There's no question about that.
Yes.
That's a known falsehood,
but no, a known fact.
Right.
So.
I can't say it on the air.
I can't.
No one can know.
I can't say it on the air,
but I'll explain later.
I had to laugh.
It's a bit,
it's a subgenius thing.
It's a slack thing.
You wouldn't understand.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Aha, aha, aha.
And I thought my jokes were bad.
They are.
They're horrible sometimes.
Sometimes you take three weeks
to get to the punchline.
Yes, I know.
I need a shower, Dave.
You don't need to rub it in.
And if you want to say it
as Reverend Stanger,
and says it,
say horrible.
He says horrible.
Give me an orange.
I feel horrible.
My mom was from Connecticut,
and her mom was from New York.
So every now and then,
that New York stuff
pops up in my otherwise
South Carolinian-influenced speech.
Go figure.
Go figure.
Who else shall be at X Day?
Priestess Pisces shall be
the sub-manager,
and Rambam,
Reverend Modemac.
But Pisces is much more bossy,
and also the guys are much more
willing to hump
when she tells them to.
She has an ample bosom
and parts therein.
And so any man with any kind
of true manhood
sees her and wants to take orders
from her, not from Modemac.
Or the big boss of this area
will be there
with her consort, Sifu.
And people take orders
from her as well.
Doc.
Frop himself
and Sister Decadence
will be at X Day.
And these people aren't,
they don't get these names,
they don't just make up these names.
These are like,
they're like American Indian names.
They earned them.
And these were difficult names
to earn, too.
Decadence and Frop.
It was great Frop indeed.
That one time.
Whatever, whatever that,
whatever Frop,
I don't know what it is.
I really don't know.
I don't either,
but it is decadent.
I know that.
Well, I think it's,
in some countries,
it's a form of cheese
that's been lubricated
over a long period of time
and then allowed to commit itself
to a spermatic adventure
somewhere in, I don't know.
The spermatic adventures
will be at Hex Day.
I think Fat Free,
they're always there.
Oh, Monkey Hive.
That's a new band.
Monkey Hive?
That's an interesting name.
Reverend Sud's band, Monkey Hive.
Well, it's spelled funny
with a U in the monkey
and a Y in the hive.
So instead of like a beehive,
it's a monkey hive
or is it the kind of hives
you get after in contact
with monkeys?
Well, and then there's
Reverend H.V. Monkey,
our man in the Devo world.
And, oh yes, anyway, yeah.
All the babes will be there.
I hope Dr. Legume will be there.
Oh, by the way,
our friend Dr. Legume
has found himself
healing up from his
five bypass operations
on his heart
and he's kind of weakly
and he can't do the kind of
tough work he used to do
and he's looking for a job
and a place to stay.
So if there's a brave enough
subgenius out there,
one who, like Igor,
who would love
to have a shambling,
hulking monster
at his beck and call.
Actually, it would be
the other way around.
The monster would end up
ordering the Igor around.
It'd be kicking ball or something.
Igor, would you go bring me
another one of them
frog sticks?
Igor, would you go bring me
another brain?
Make it a criminal brain this time.
I don't need another one
of them egghead,
bighead brains.
I don't need another one

Don't use that
back it on up brain.
It won't fit in my skull.
Even though I have the...
Actually, we had a skull
measurement contest
in the Church of the Subgenius
and Dr. Legume, I must say,
was like, if he didn't have
the biggest skull,
it was the second biggest.
Dr. Cranium.
Now, has anyone verified that
or is it just a claim he made?
It could be.
Well, you know, Legume.
But he's pretty big.
He's pretty big.
He's pretty big.
He's pretty big.
He does have a big head.
He kind of looks like
the Gerber baby bottle baby
blown up to about six feet tall.
With a three-day shadow.
And with tattoos covering
his entire upper body,
except for where they put
the zipper in for his
repeated heart operations.
So, anyway,
actually, there are quite
a few subgeniuses
that I could list off
a name of poverty-stricken.
The worst one is
one of the greatest
subgenius artists.
I don't want to embarrass him.
It's not Lee Murr
and it's not Imgur
because they suck anyway.
But one of the really good
subgenius artists
has, he's agoraphobic.
But he's homeless.
So he's living in a car
in a campground
with his girlfriend
and his cat.
So Legume can't move in with him.
And I just know
a whole lot of subgeniuses.
And I bet you know
one or two
Dave,
just can't,
he cannot seem to find a job.
He can't find
a reasonable place to work.
Why would you ask me
where you could find a job?
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying that
if there are subgeniuses
out there
that want to put
another subgenius to work,
the Stang Doe
Employment Agency
is now open.
And we'll only take
40% of your first
20 paychecks.
Yes, sirree Bob.
That's all we ask.
If we can find,
if we can locate you a job.
I would say you'd be better off
looking for the trust fund subgenius
rather than the rank and file
who have to work two jobs.
Well, you know,
that's the problem with this cult.
We never had a crazy millionaire.
Or if we did,
he wasn't crazy enough
to tell us he was a millionaire.
We did have a crazy millionaire,
but he was too crazy.
Princess,
we and I went and met
a rich subgenius.
Actually,
I can't say he was
a subgenius.
But you could tell he was rich.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He flew a private jet
into the little Cleveland
special rich guy airport
to meet up with me.
But he really wanted
to meet J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And he was really disappointed
when he learned
that he wasn't going
to be meeting Bob
on that trip.
Now I remember
this sad story.
Yeah, yeah.
He had his dad,
his family owned
a giant seed company.
And as he explained it to me,
he goes,
my siblings run the business,
but I'm above
that sort of thing.
I'm a philosopher.
Oh, I see.
That's why he couldn't see Bob
in the helicopter
landing right next to him
fighting with Bob,
you know?
Right.
He's busy philosophizing
rather than looking around.
Well, exactly.
In fact,
this guy,
I'm probably digging
my own grave here
because,
although I doubt if he
knows what the Internet is.
I doubt it, too.
This guy was the richest
person I've ever met.
And I swear,
I think he was
the dumbest
person I've ever met
outside of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
It wasn't this kind of dumbness
Bob has, though.
Bob has the holy dumbness.
It's slack and luck.
This guy was just
a dumb pink.
Rich people can afford
to be stupid
and ignorant.
And they can afford
to believe anything.
But he did not want
to believe
some of the things
and some of the hard facts
that I had to tell him.
And he never came back
and he never gave us
another $5,000.
Maybe he expected you
to say,
you are Dobbs.
And he would have smiled
and he would have
walked away.
Maybe he was Dobbs.
But think how many people,
think how many people
would have done,
have done that.
I mean,
there have been people
who have come to my house
and said,
I'm Dobbs.
And I go,
well, no.
And they go,
thank you for telling me
I'm Dobbs.
This has been a great day.

This has been a great conversation.
I'll be Bob from now on.
Goodbye.
Oh, by the way,
I'm also an astronaut
and a ballet dancer
and I can fly.
Unfortunately,
all those are true, though.
Well, they're true
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
But I hadn't,
the last time I saw him
was on the stage
of the Victoria Theater
in San Francisco,
January 24th, 1984,
when he was shot
and killed
right in front of me
by puzzling evidence himself,
that worm.
Puzzling evidence
gets rid of you.





He's real upset
when I call him a worm.
I don't know what he has
against worms.
I spend half my days
looking at worms
lately.
But to some,
it's the ultimate disrespect
to call a person a worm.
Well, he shot Bob.
What are we going to do?
Give him a medal?
Oh, that's right.
Bob would have given him a medal.
Yes, he would.
I think Bob did give him a medal
right after he was shot dead
by the guy.
Bob got up
and gave him a medal.
That's how you know
it's really Bob.
You blow him up,
you shoot him,
and he bounces back
with a little smudge
of charcoal on
and a Band-Aid.
He's just like
one of those brand new
dangerous neighborhood
love dolls
that they have
that just come right back.
That's why our policy is
when some nerd comes up
and says,
I'm real high-e popped.
I'm J.R. Bob Dobbs.
You kill him,
and if they come back to life,
then by golly,
praise Bob.
Or you bite his foot.
And if they don't,
well, good riddance.
You got what you were asking for,
Mr. Amabob.
Mr. Amaheepopped.
I can tell your hatred
of these folks is strong.
Mr. Lame Bobby.
But you rely on these people
for soup or...
No, I rely on them
for $30 checks.
I rely on them
for credit card orders.
This is not a commercial station.
That's right.
Unlike the...
CMZY is beautiful
down, down,
wherever the last place
you just were.
Now, see,
if I was Rush Limbaugh,
I could advertise stuff.
Yeah, you could...
Rush Limbaugh could
even advertise
that toilet paper
that says
Flush Rush on it.
And...
Oh.
Oh, speaking of which,
I've got to run
to the bathroom right now.
Don't come back.
We'll be waiting in the...
Where are we?
Oh, I feel so much better now.
Oh, no.
Unfortunately,
I know where we are now.
Can we...
Please, um,
change the set?
Open the window.
Turn on those fans.
Light some incense.
Burn a match.
No, make it three matches.
Spank the air conditioner.
Breed more.
Breed more.
No, I...
Breed more.
Breed less.
Breed with anything available.
Remember,
your seed is important.
Oh, who will be at Starwood
who's famous and great?
Why, Reverend Ivan,
Evan Stang will be doing
a great, humongous
revival there.
And, uh,
Rocky and the Cavemen.
That's a good band.
Who's Rocky and the Cavemen?
Sounds meanderball.
A nice-looking young lady
who does Middle Eastern
jazzy music.
It's really quite good.
Sounds good.
Well, we hope
Rocky and the Cavemen
will be there.
Everything is in flux right now.
We really don't know.
Everything's been flushed.
It's all fluxy-wuxy.
I'll turn on the
Starwood-y type music there.
Okay, yeah,
because that's more like,
you know, beginnings
and cool stuff and everything
rather than the, you know...
Oh, Fat Man D
will be not only at X-Day,
but Starwood, just like us.
Hey, how about these
electric junkyard gamelan guys
from New York City?
Original music
on invented instruments.
Ron Slabe's Pyrosonic.
I love invented instruments.
It's wonderful.
Pyrosonic, Ron Slabe's band,
which also, it's...
Well, his band is also composed,
of explosives, fireworks,
and dozens and dozens
of topless young ladies
juggling fireballs.
And...
I'm sorry.
Is Stephen Kent,
the didgeridoo expert,
going to be there?
Well, as I say,
things are sort of changing.
How about my rifle...
I hope he'll be there.
How about my rifle cult leaders?
Yeah, I thought there were supposed
to be some rival cults there.
Yeah, the Church of All Worlds,
O'Bron, Zell,
will be there.
O'Bron will be there.
Louis Martinet
from the New Orleans Voodoo Temple.
Waking Dream.
Oh, they're...
Actually, they're one of the best things
about Starwood,
Waking Dream.
They're a puppet...
They're puppet makers,
but they make puppets
that are about 20 feet tall.
Oh, I've seen those before.
They look great
walking around the bonfire.
Yeah, they make...
And they show you
how to become a puppet, too.
And they're also making...
And they catch fire so easily.
They're making a completely
amazing psychedelic show.
They're making a show
in our Puffer Dome,
which is our very own
nightclub sort of space
that's a...
That's...
An inflatable dome.
Like Gaius...
You've been in there, Dave.
It has very weird acoustics.
They have very weird acoustics.
You can stand in one...
But unfortunately,
sometimes they go back
on themselves,
the acoustics do.
Right, if somebody...
And then you can't hear
anything real close,
but usually,
you can hear everything.
Like in an old
Greek theater
from miles away,
the acoustics are perfect.
And the smell-o-stics,
they're perfect.
It's like if somebody's
standing all the way
across the Puffer Dome
from you and they cut one,
you'll smell it instantly.
Unfortunately,
that is really true.
There's the ever-lingering
stench of hydronics
or whatever the hell
it's called,
made of hydrogen
or diesel fuel,
whatever,
propels the Puffer Dome,
which is also a bad name
for a place
where you can't smoke.
Dave, have you ever
read any history books
by Harvey Wasserman?
Harvey Wasserman...
He specializes in telling
the unpleasant histories
of the United States.
I've heard of Howard Zinn.
He's like Howard Zinn.
Okay.
We've also had him
at Starwood, I think,
at some point.
Anyway, Harvey Wasserman
is one of those guys.
Oh, and my...
Steve and Ina May Gaskin,
the founders of The Farm,
the actual,
the last and only
forever-working hippie commune.
It's still working.
It was the commune
that didn't fall apart.
That is beautiful.
As far as I know,
damn near every one
of the other big communes
finally tanked.
But they managed to...
I think you're right about that.
Zendik Farm was one
of the last ones.
I remember them.
We used to get mail from them.
And the name started with Z,
so you thought it was
the last one,
but it wasn't.
No.
No.
Nope.
Nope.
So if you like your hippie,
dippy stuff,
then you go to your Starwood,
and if you like,
your subgenius-y,
wubgenius-y stuff,
then you go to X-Day.
Or both.
Both is good.
Both is great.
Yeah.
It would be...
We could all use
a job.
And that X-Day
kind of turns into
a job at times.
It's hard to keep...
The kind of job
I can't say on the radio,
actually.
A bob.
Okay, I'll say it.
A bob.
A bob job.
A bob job.
That knobby fellow.
Oh, no.
I don't like the way
you phrased that.
Or I did actually like
the way you phrased it,
but the...
What was being phrased
kind of caused me to recoil.
Um...
I like the way
he flays that.
Alive.
You know, if anybody
is interested about
this Starwood Festival,
you can go to
starwoodfestival.com.
And read all about it.
This will be the 30th one.
They've been doing it
longer than Burning Man.
They've been burning people up.
They put a man inside
of a big wicker man.
They set it on fire.
And that gives them
the power of Satan.
I've had a lot of...
You know, there's people
who really do believe that.
The problem is
that a lot of...
Not everybody at Starwood
is a pagan.
Believe me, for instance.
But,
pagans don't actually
have a devil
in their
rather loose
belief system.
Well, there have been books
that were bestsellers
and people still
didn't get it
about this
same thing here.
I think
Robert Heinlein
or perhaps it was
Moose Coinkoiler.
Pagans don't kill people
just for Satan.
They do it for fun.
For fuzz.
Fun.
Yeah.
For the goddess.
That's different.
That's not the same as Satan.
Satan's a man.
Satan's got a tail and horns.
Goddess has bosom.
Great big bosom.
I've seen pictures of her.
Ample bosom.
She has huge blonde hair.
It looks kind of like
Princess Wee.
When people dream of the goddess,
they usually see Princess Wee.
Oh, I've got a letter from...
I have bragging...
Blushing.
Wonderful letters from listeners.
I'm just...
Here's one from a prisoner.
These are not real people.
No, these are real.
This is from James Anderson
in Portage, Wisconsin,
but he's in the big house.
And he says,
I am a huge fan of your show every time
I listen to your radio program.
I'm cracking up for the whole hour.
I think he means having a mental breakdown.
In addition to the humor,
you guys make a lot of good points.
You offer thought-provoking satire
at its best.
Oh, this guy thinks it's a joke?
That's one of the best...
That's one of the best...
That's one of the best blurbs ever, man.
Most people are too afraid to think for themselves
and through the medium of great humor,
you get people thinking about things
that warrant the application of thought.
Man, that is one of the best reviews I've ever...
Well-written and well-spoken.
He wanted us to send him some mail
because he's in prison,
but they took his radio away
and his cellmate is too heavily medicated
to even stay up that late.
So, uh...
Well, now he just can't hear it anymore.
But get this, down at the bottom,
he said,
P.S., that woman on your show
has the voice of a goddess.
But don't worry, I'm not a stalker.
In fact, the only reason I brought it up now
is because of the fact that I'll never see her.
It has me somewhat emboldened.
Please tell her she's amazing.
Well, buddy...
I am so blushing.
Oh.
I try to tell her that every three hours.
Let's see.
No, here's a...
When I was in high school,
I used to wonder if women were affected by cell fantasies.
Or, you know, just perverted dormitory fantasies
from a long distance.
You know, you're dreaming about some woman in Washington
you never met,
and you're actually fondling your shoes
at the same time.
I mean, you know, that you're...
Oh, she can tell.
She'll get an itch.
A special itch.
Or an irritation.
Depending on who it is that's thinking of her.
I don't know.


I thought one of the little horns wiggled or something
and made a ha-ha sound.
I don't know.
You don't know.
It's hard to tell nowadays.
Now, here's another letter.
This one came from Odd Brian.
Care of Odd Brian's Church of Amateur Traumatics.
Service is held tomorrow every day.
And his letter says...
Oh, this is about a weird coincidence,
and it's also a good promo.
To Brother Stang.
Today, I...
Quit my job.
It was cheap labor ruining my shoulder
filled with spiteful pinks
and had the crappiest coffee in the world.
This afternoon,
so after he quit his job,
I see your magnificence on my TV screen
discussing the comic book,
or the comic creator,
Jack T. Chick
in God's Cartoonist
on the documentary channel.
After stroking the wand of significance
in my excrementation chamber,
I feel I've become illuminated.
And sore.
But I must say that such a thing is so improbable
as to be beyond mere coincidence.
I think it's truly a synchronized chronological burp
in the digestive tract of time-space.
I just needed to share that with you.
I can't hang out with y'all on X-Day,
as I'll be trying to snare a passing asteroid
the night before.
Could you ask the X's to pick me up
between Rigel and Beetlejuice after lunchtime?
Thanks and praise Bob.
Wow.
What a passage of an air
from a person with no colon.
Yeah, that's from Gons O'Lager,
or Odd Brian,
and he's at bourbonasylum.com.
You sure it wasn't Odd Brain
that he inverted the A and the I?
Could be.
Could be.
So, but yeah,
apparently on the documentary channel,
which I take as one of these
cable television channels you people get,
this month they've been showing the movie
God's Cartoonist, which is indeed a documentary
about the great Jack T. Chick
and his insane, fundy, Christian, Catholic,
bashing, devil-beaten little comics.
You know, those little tiny ones that they give you.
That movie, God's Cartoonist,
was assembled by the great father,
Papa Joe Mama,
one of the great subgenius preachers.
He's been heard on the last several hours of Slack.
He's busy running his spook house business
and trading cards and stuff
and making documentaries.
But it is hilarious,
and it has record-breaking dry humor
by me and Dr. Howell
because at no point did any of us
want to come out and say,
this stuff is so...
So kooky and nutty.
It's hilarious.
We'd say things like,
yes, I was very influenced
by these comics over my...
You know, that kind of thing.
I believe those little books are called tracks, dear.
Yes, tracks.
Chicks, chick tracks.
Chick tracks.
Chicks dig chicks.
And Papa Joe wrote a whole book
about Jack T. Chick.
He sure did.
Yeah, if you go to monsterwax.com,
I don't know why he's called
Monster Wax.
Monsterwax.com.
But it's easy to remember,
and you'll find all of his book
and his video and so forth
and excerpts.
And people have even turned
those little chick tracks
into cartoons,
into flash animations
with voice characterizations
and everything.
Does his name appear
in the book of life?
Nay, Lord.
Then cast him into the lake of fire.
Man, those drawings
had such huge wings.
Such tiny, perfectly shaped bodies.
Like, I think he looked at those books
by, what's his name?
You know, Blake?
William Blake?
Jack T. Blake?
No, William Blake.
Dory's illustrations.
Trevor Blake.
For man is not slack as men...
No, no.
For the Lord is not slack
as men count slackness.
That was at the back
of many of the chick tracks.
It was a great line.
For the Lord is not slack
as men count slackness.
But is something, something
thereunto, ass-kicking thereunto,
something like that.
I forgot how it goes.
Snappy like a rubber tomato
or something.
Yeah.
They've saved a lot of people.
And you know, he's truly one of the...
He's like an underground cartoonist.
Like Robert Crumb
or S. Clay Wilson.
He published that stuff himself.
He's not approved
by any of the mainstream churches
especially because I think he's insane.
Well, they're right about that.
Well, anyway,
it's an interesting story.
I suppose there's some listeners
who don't read,
not even little tiny Christian comic books
that they hand you at the state fair.
But you should.
Because you can save.
And there's a little thing in the back
where you can sign your name
and sign up with Jesus.
And it tells you how to give your life
to Christ.
You know, I realize I'm a sinner
and that a way to eternal life
is only through forgiveness
of Lord Jesus
and John 3.16.
I'm the way, the truth, and the pipe.
And none may get into my lungs
save they who throw themselves
into my bowl
and are enlightened
by my special lighter
with the striptease bikini girl on it
when you tip it upside down.
Yeah.
Bikini disappears.
So that's the religion we're talking about, friends.
The church of the subgenius.
Of the disappearing bikini.
And while I managed to read the letters
from the listeners,
we usually get audio from listeners
rather than letters.
Oh, man, have I got...
No, I don't even want to go...
I've had somebody leaving messages again
who makes Bernard
seem like Dr. Howell by comparison.
But that's for another show.
We probably...
That's quite mad, a lot of them.
We probably should sign out
somewhere in here are my instructions.
Because if, yeah, if I go now...
It's in your instruction manual.
Yeah, there's a really good cut
by Reverend Godrex
of the long discussion about Bob.
And they talk about X-Day.
And we should play that.
And we might even get to hear
a Rudy Schwartz project
doing snot-mouthed Tweedle.
Tweedle.
That song's been stuck in my head all day.
And the only way to get it out
is to get it onto everybody else's head.
Yep.
So I'm going to sign us all out.
You, me, and Princess We.
So that we can hear
what Bob really had to say.
With one deft swell-foop.
About us.
Yes.
We're over.
Yes, so here...
Dave, thank you for calling.
You're quite welcome.
I'm glad I had a chance
to participate in this wonderful...
Oh, enough of that.
We need to cut away.
We are, too.
Okay.
Everybody up.
Bye.
So Bob was getting the interview.
And so Bob was in New Jersey.
Unfortunately, Bob died within a week.
So...
And such.
I was very impressed
with the way Bob would treat these people
whom he must have regarded
as deluded fanatics.
And that was the thing about Bob
is that he could...
He could see...
Once I read an essay in a book
about so-called cults and new religions.
Groups of people that live in worlds
we wouldn't recognize
going to another world.
And I thought, yeah.
It is.
Yeah, maybe...
Yeah, that might explain
how Bob felt about it, too.
Yeah.
If God himself were to approach him
and say, take your pick.
I've got the truth.
Yeah.
Yikes.
Yeah.
Didn't he deny that the moon landing ever happened?
That it was a fake of some way?
Well, he did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, he thought it was all just a big fake.
He thought that the governments of the world
all knew that the Earth is flat,
but that they were suppressing it.
Once everyone knew that the world was flat,

that there'd be sort of like worldwide peace
and all of this.
Yeah, that's right.
So...
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
That's interesting acting.
Yeah.
So what...
Oh, boy.
And it never really thought about it.
I thought, oh, no, this can't be true.
I'm having a nightmare.
I know.
Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah.
I know Bob would have loved that, too.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
That really is frightening.
It's like a cockroach.
If you see one, there must be a whole lot more.
Once there was a boy down south
Oh, yeah
Had snot running across his mouth
What's that mess
Boy the neighbors would say
Why's that snot on your face that way
Snot mouth riddle
Snot mouth riddle
Snot mouth riddle
Snot mouth riddle all day
Mama sent him to the grocery store
Let's go pro-berry
Asked him to buy three eggs times four
Run back home for the grocery man say
Why's that snot on your face that way
Snot mouth riddle
Snot mouth riddle
Snot mouth riddle
Snot mouth riddle all day
Mama sent him to the grocery store
What's that mess
Boy the neighbors would say
Why's that snot on your face that way
Mama sent him to the grocery store
Soon this boy became a man
Wanted to know the master plan
So to the Lord he did say
Hey guys
Why
Why
Is this snot on my face this way
Huh
Hey guys
Guys
Wait
Why did it that snot all over my face like this guys
Huh
Hey
He dans
Where is this snot on my face like this guys
Oui
Hey guys
Why is this snot on my face this way guys
Ah
Eh
God
Which oh
Really
Who can know
Wholde
Who can know
Who can know
Many Americans are fortunate and have weapons, including landmines,
and are a daily menace to life and limb.
This story is typical, is not typical, and your entire life is permanently changed.
And around me, and what happened, and freeze, and yet they do, and somehow, and ever, and also, and depression, and then, and not, and children that can last a lifetime, and medical, and refugee, and forms, and minds, and injury, and health, and weapons, and public, and citizens, and have nodes, and farms, and are buried, and are deployed, and we won't, and this is an assistance.
And become disabled, and other unexploded.
Cut off the rest of your leg, and hopefully, and you hope.
And in addition, and part of, and they step on, and then they, and as they're, and one of the saddest, and they want to play with them, and they explode.
And that, and that's, of course, who, who, who, who, who's, and many others.
Well, that's it.
