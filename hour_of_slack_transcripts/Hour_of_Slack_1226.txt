Around Dodge City and in the Territory on West, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers, and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the spell of...
The Soul Genius Power of Splash!
I need to be saved by the church of the subgenius.
You do.
I need to be saved.
Hello, this is me, Bernard.
I do not know who will receive this message, but it is true.
Those of us who are so-called subgeniuses, you know, we can't figure everything out.
We're not the smartest people in the world, but we are not dumb and stupid like the pinks and normals,
you know, who have the capacity for comprehension.
We don't have any material knowledge, but look what they do with their ability to comprehend knowledge of materialism.
And the UFOs have been returning when crisis, you know, arrives, with me personally, you know, dealing with the established...
Welcome to Starwood.
10-4, will you bring her down here? Bring her down here or something?
I'm going to get her.

Get her bags into her cabin.
Roger.
She's cute.
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!
Ladies!

Ladies!

Ladies!
Ladies!
And everybody in between.
Many, many years ago, the Reverend Ivan Sang was blessed with the gospel of Bob.
And because the Reverend Ivan Sang was so dutiful in writing down this gospel, we today now have rules to ignore.
What?
We're going to make this a little bit more difficult.


The Reverend Sang has been a huge influence on me and my life, which is why I am as internationally renowned as I am today.
Hey, Regis, why don't you boot up my band?
Thanks for coming out to Starwood, ladies and gentlemen.
Thanks for enjoying all the phenomenal artists, preachers, and screechers.
Take it close.
Take it close.
I got a brand new two-tone tattoo.
I got it just for you.
Good Lord, he knows what I can do.
My brand new two-tone tattoo.
I certainly hope the hairs do not hide away.
You, my two-tone tattoo to display.
But if they do, I'll show it to you anyway.
My brand new two-tone.
Fine, tattoo Baradado.
forming my own.
I claim the title of the new one Acho.
Friends, fellow Bob's Heads
We brought the Reverend Sang to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
On February 15, 1995
I was exactly 20 years old
It was the middle of winter
It was the biggest show I'd ever done in my life
300 people joined us to praise Bob and then kill him
So I did what any red-blooded American girl would do
I shaved my head
And I ran around bald until the bushes were elected out
On tattoo
Je l'avais fait spécialement pour vous
Le bon Dieu sait que
Je vous traînerai avec mes grands
Grands tattoos
Je serai les universe hideaway
Les humains grands tattoos
Le slave of the faith
Just show it to you anyway
Mes grands tattoos

Achoo!
Thank you so much
I'm going to turn this mic over to the one you should really be applauding
Without this man there would be no reason for any of you to be here
Give it up for the award winner!
The one and thankfully only
The most adorable and most delectable clergyman I have ever laid eyes on
The very reverend reverend
Ivan Stas!
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Thank you Fat Mandy
Fat Mandy dear friends
Um if you ever get a chance
And you will if you ever go to like Burning Man or any place really cool
There you will find Fat Mandy
And um welcome to Squishwood 2 friends
The old timers here remember an even rainier Starwood
Which was nicknamed Squishwood
And uh it's too much
Matt you've seen it
You've seen my preaching coat isn't it nice
I'm going to take it off now because it's too hot
To preach
Hey!
The first Starwood I was invited to in 1990
Which was the first one uh here at Brushwood
I uh me and the pagans didn't know how to take each other
They started yelling for me to strip and preach new
And I compromised
I took my paints off and preached in my drawers
Um you don't have to worry it's been done
Laughter
In 1990 I was invited to speak at a at a I guess you'd call it a neo pagan festival called Starwood
Uh that's held every year in New York
And I was so impressed by the campground that they held Starwood at
That I decided we should have a yearly subgenius uh practice for the end of the world
Where subgeniuses would gather at this little campground in in rural New York City

And this is way out in the country
Uh it and um
The reason we picked this campground is because you can get away with just about anything
It's clothing optional
We can make noise all night
They did outlaw us using explosives
Laughter
After numerous failed experiments with rockets
And other flying machines that we've done over the years
Uh
In in some ways it it it's kind of like a little tiny burning man
Festival because some we all get burned
Laughter
At at the end we wait for the aliens they don't show up and we all got burned
But we got had a good time
We earned our hangovers
Uh fair and square
I've been off planet until recently
Have you really can you change into your spaceship like this other dude
No this wasn't a I did
It was it we were really on this planet but might as well have been on another one
Oh so you can't drink your drugs in and get another car huh
Drugs
Well you're on another planet I mean how else would you get there
Well I've got interesting new experiences
In this particular case I was just reading a very interesting Larry McMurtry book instead of the watching the conspiracy news
And and we just returned from the Starwood Fair
And we're going to see the Starwood Fair


It's kind of like uh
Uh going on a trip to another planet
Is that the one that Hippy Keith went to
Yes
Did you go there
Well Hippy Keith is the Keith whose show follows this one
Uh yeah he ran lights he had a job there
So did I
Oh really
Yeah yeah I I worked there
Was it one
I'm one of the cops there
Really
Really
Yes
I heard it was a big uh gay bash man I heard you guys were all banging each other
Oh that too
That that too
Oh
But if you don't I wouldn't limit you know it would be a mistake to limit it to to something like that you know
Hey
Do we like pumping
Yeah we like pumping
Do we like pumping
Yeah we like pumping
Do we like pumping
Yeah we like pumping
Do we like pumping
Yeah we like pumping
We hope it doesn't rain
Or if it does rain friends
Let's pray this time for a rain of little living frogs and fishes
That would be something a story to take home and tell your friends
And plus we'd have breakfast you know
Uh it'd be an unusual breakfast
The um
Uh notice it stopped raining as soon as the subgenius stuff happened you know
It'd let you know you know you can you can worship all your false gods that you want but
You can notice you can pull strings with the weather gods
Um but
There's there's actually uh insights to be had with the rain along with the boredom and the filth
I was uh the first couple of days was raining really bad and I was up at Reginald's house and I was like
I was like I'm gonna go to the registration I actually work for for Ace sort of
And my job is to sit up there until something breaks
And I'm sitting there waiting for something to break
And um and I was sort of bored and I noticed
Two youngsters jogging by start naked in the rain
And I thought to myself now see that'd be
That's something you could do in the rain when everything else is shut down
And I thought I'd better wait until nightfall so as to not gross anybody out
But then my wife said no no no here's what you do just wait until somebody even older and flabbier
Jogs by and then falling behind them you'll look just like Dr. Manhattan by comparison
Uh I really feel more like Rorschach myself
So uh but while I was up there at registration waiting
I noticed two little boys I mean really little like a a one year old and maybe a
Or maybe one and a half year old and a
Three year old or something
Their parents were in line bored you know at that point we actually had a line
But the two little boys were rolling around in the gravel
They had found this kind of rocky gravel out there
And these two little boys were just rolling back and forth in the gravel
And they were ecstatic they had true slack
They were laughing their little tiny asses off
While their parents were paying $200
For permission to act like monkeys
And I was thinking you know if I weighed 150 pounds less
Rolling around on those rocks it would probably be just as slackful for me
And um but my friends and I we got to talking about it
And I got to I just became a grandfather recently
So I'm always looking at everybody's little kids
But thanks thanks
Um but uh I've noticed all the little kids around here
Have such a you know they're having fun
Just being little kids
They don't know any better
They haven't been taught but you know they have to spend money to have fun
And plus everything they do is the first time
And I think the joint conclusion we came to so to speak
Was that all kids are tripping balls
And uh they don't know how good they have been
Little kids don't know how good they have been
Sometimes I wish I could forget everything I've learned
And chances are that may very well happen
Dr. Well how come we're not tripping anymore?
I don't know baby
Dr. Oh that's right we got all of the carts turned off
What what what is it?
It's happening
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Dr. There must be some um some pretty crazy groups at Starwood itself
I mean could you talk a little bit about what you could
Because you actually help arrange Starwood don't you I think?
Right yeah this um
Starwood is one of the biggest if not the biggest uh
Neo pagan and world music festivals on this side of the country
And uh
I was first invited there to speak
I thought they were laying a trap
Because I'd been making fun of those people
You know in my high weirdness by mail book
And I come from basically a pretty skeptical viewpoint
Aside from my faith in Bob
Uh it's hard to get me to believe in very much
Um
I don't know that I'll even
You'd have to pay me a lot of money to say that I believed in very much
But uh
Nonetheless at Starwood I was very surprised to find that um
About half of the people who fall into that neo pagan category
Really are not fundamentalists of any kind
And they dislike the pagan fundamentalists
Uh
So they really enjoy me
And the subgeniuses coming in and making fun and making mockery of everything they hold sacred
Because a lot of them don't really hold anything all to themselves
And they don't really feel that sacred
Or even if they do
They can take a joke
In fact my experience has been
The stronger a person's faith is in something
The more they can laugh at it
They can take a joke
Because it doesn't threaten them
It's the ones who feel threatened by mockery
You have to wonder well
If your god or your guru is so powerful
Why are you worried about us making a few jokes
True
But eh
Seems like the longer your religion has been established
The more sensitive you become about it
Yeah
Now at Starwood
You'll find all manner of people gathered together
There's a large contingent from the church of all worlds
Which um
I don't know if you're familiar with that
No
It's based loosely on a science fiction story by Robert Heinlein
Uh
Stranger in a strange land
Ah that's right I've heard Wilson
Yeah
Wilson talked about this guy
These guys a lot didn't they I think
Yeah yeah in in that novel
A human raised by Martians comes to earth
And starts a new religion called the church of all worlds
One of the main features of which is polyamory
Uh swinging
Swapping
And such like
And uh I happen to know the the uh
I guess you call him the head of the church of all worlds
Uh Oberon
Uh Gazelle
Who also sells books on how to be a wizard
And he's a he's a real nice guy
He can take a joke
And they've got quite a a large following
I uh at Starwood they have their own sort of baptism
Or baptism in the pool
But I've noticed
That when when those old hippies leave the pool
It's it's a lot dirtier than when the young subgeniuses leave the pool
There's a there's more of them though
I gotta hand them that
They're they're pretty crowded together in there
They got you in the numbers game
Cut
Scene
Choices always were a problem for you
What you need is someone strong to guide you
They've been finding gum and born to follow
Scene
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me
You know this guy comes to my house
He's a Satanist from one of the Satanist churches here
Where they sacrifice babies
And melt those babies into candles
They're skinned
then that's supposed to give them more demonic power.
Demonic power.
Demonic power.
I don't know why it is that all of you seem to have satanic souls.
Sweet dreams are made of these.
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the felonies.
Everybody's looking for something.
Some of them want to be.
They don't believe I'm Christ, do they?
No.
They will when they make me into a carcass, though, won't they?
No.
To paraphrase God, let's shed some light on this, okay?
Don't ask me why, but I was walking down the streets of Fairfax, California,
and I saw this flyer hang on a telephone pole, and it said,
Can God fill teeth?
The music that they're planning to use to crumble the morals of America
is this rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd, lascivious junk called rock and roll.
It isn't just the lyrics, it's the beat.
It's the beat!
Jesus!
I hope sin did this to you.
My whole existence is flawed.
You got me closer.
I'm getting caught.
How this beat gets them 400 teenage girls in Detroit interviewed
as to why they had illegitimate babies.
They said not just the words, the beat.
His tongue is the pin of a...
Ready, right.
So how's God going to talk to me in the latter days?
He's going to be a better man.
And who's going to bring that book?
I don't know.
So there'll be no excuses.
Who's behind it all?
Yes.
Well, this mysterious E.T. called Satan.
Satan.
Satan.
Satan.
Oh, now you want to fight.
And I'm going to fight.
To the sky.
Tell me something about religion.
Some of you are too naive.
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.
You can't even follow him.
I don't know.
I got me some big plans.
We are real, we are real.
Deus does not exist.
Uh-oh, look out.
It's the oppressors.
You will be faithful.
Let your hands on the radio.
Let your hands on the radio band home.
Yes, friends, we're at Starwood.
It's great.
Earlier, we heard a collage, the God and Satan collage there.
It was by ReverendEric.com, also known as Signal to Noise.
Just amazing stuff there.
Our opening collage was by Lee Murr.
And now, back to the live sermon at Starwood.
Satan looks on with approval as the denizens of Starwood fall deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit of sin.
Following their temptations as far as they'll go.
And after we got the books and the DVDs and the CDs, then followed, of course, the lawsuits, the child custody cases, the mental illnesses, and prison terms and so forth.
Just like a real cult.
We thought we were, we actually, to tell the truth, there was a time when I didn't even believe Bob.
But his most outrageous utterances all came true.
And sometimes the truth comes out, in fact, it almost always comes out by accident.
We learned a new one just this very week.
Our friend A.J. Gooch saw somebody on television flub a line.
The person meant to say democracy, but it came out.
Mocracy.
And he thought, that's the church of the subgenius.
So, in short, this church, the one, as Robert Anton Wilson called it, the bet, the truest of all the one true religions, you can consider it a mock-racy.
Now somebody else here, I forget who, was joking with me about our silly little cult, which incidentally has about 40,000 members.





Believe it or not.
We don't know where most of them are anymore.
But anyway, this friend said, now Reverend Stang, be careful, don't become Bob's little bitch.
And I was like, boy, it's a little late for that, honey.
You know, I've been the bitch of Bob since the late 70s.
And I realized, bitch of Bob, B-O-B, there you go.
See, you can't escape.
If maybe eventually everybody will be Bob.



I'm not saying a B-O-B.
What a nightmare that would be.
You know, in fact, the goal of the church of the subgenius is actually to prevent everybody in the world from becoming a Caucasian, square,
brill-cream-haired, pipe-smoking salesman.
That's what happens if the conspiracy wins.
There only needs to be one Bob.
There have always been Bobs.
But that B-O-B, you just can't get away from it.
Even in fundamentalist politics.
In the paganry, you'll notice, just the way his name is spelled.
There's two B's, and then in between there's this Zen zero.
Nothingness.
It's in the center of Bob, you could say.
Nothingness between two B's.
Two blessed B's.
Yeah, I have to say that every time.
I can't remember when that happened.








The last guest we had on last week was a member of the OTO.
Did they show up at Starwood?
OTO?
Yeah.
No.
No, actually, yeah, yeah.
There are plenty of OTO members here and there at Starwood,
and there are workshops given by people.
But usually it's not a strictly OTO type thing.
I think you get more of that over in Europe and Great Britain than you do here.
The OTO people that I met in England were all cool.
But the ones that I've known in the U.S., mostly I generally avoid.
Oh, right.
And I don't know why that is.
But I really haven't had all that much.
I guess there's some crossover.
There are a lot of subgeniuses who are OTO rejects or else they rejected the OTO after a while.
I was going to say, I would have thought.
And they didn't.
They didn't get the guardian demon they were promised.
Oh, right.
Or else it backfired on them.
I would have thought Alistair Crowley would be quite a compatible person with subgenius.
Well, I think that Crowley and J.R. Bob Dobbs have a lot in common.
I think that both of them sit back and laugh at their followers.
I often wonder about L. Ron Hubbard as well.
Now, lately, speaking of L. Ron Hubbard,
there's been battles between Scientologists and subgeniuses on the Internet,
kind of cross-posted between the Scientology news group and alt.slack.
And those are kind of fun.
It's really fun to watch a cult versus cult fight.
You know, I mean, the Christians aren't, for the most part,
they,
they,
they kind of,
they're kind of Christian about it.
Yeah, they turn the other cheek.
Yeah, yeah, they turn the other cheek.
And for the most part,
they don't call for a jihad against all the unbelievers.
We have been trying to get them to for years.
We outright declared war on God,
on God itself,
just to see what would happen.
And, of course, death is still happening,
and taxes are still happening.
And so,
we're not doing very well in our war against God.
But we had hoped to rile people up,
but the most that ever happens is
occasionally a Christian who thought he or she had a sense of humor
and joined the church of the subgenius
resigns.
They decide that we're not that funny after all
when we start bad-mouthing the Lord.
Oh, right.
Personally, I feel like
if you're gonna make fun of God,
you better be funny.
Hmm, yeah.
If you're pulling God's leg,
that's a pretty big leg to pull.
So, you know, it's in your best interest to...
you better be funny.
Yeah, God would have some good put-downs.
Well, God obviously has a sense of humor,
a really depraved and sick sense of humor,
whereby some individuals who work hard,
and are good people their whole lives,
die slowly of an awful disease
for no reason or something,
or are horribly murdered,
and other people who go around doing the horrible murdering
and stealing and so forth
end up dying fat and happy and never get caught.
So, in that respect, I mean,
anything, nothing that we subgeniuses could come up with
could ever be as bizarre
and sick and twisted
as things that really happen in the real world
without us having anything to do with it.
Yeah.
You know, it's...
The normals have managed to outstupid even the subgeniuses.
That's really sad, you know.
Yeah, that's...
I think you guys need to step your game up a bit by the sounds of it.
Well, we're working at it, you know.
Uh...
I mean, we're pretty good at being stupid.
We're...
That's not really the point of the thing.
The point is that...
is that intelligence has been misdefined
throughout the centuries.
The conspiracy defines intelligence
in a way that we don't agree with.
Yeah.
Um...
You know, their idea of smart
doesn't necessarily get you a date.
A successful date.
It doesn't necessarily bring happiness.
And it doesn't bring you slack.
Uh...
An idiot with one good joke,
as the book of the subgenius says,
is doing more for the world than a million geniuses
inventing super weapons.
And we think we have found that idiot
with that one good joke.
Have you...
The global village idiot.
Ah, right.
Oh, dear.
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency...
Subgenius Power of Slack.
Hello.
This is me, Bernard,
and I hope that, you know,
Reverend Ivan Stang receives this message.
Because, you know, I...
You know, I kind of like Reverend Ivan Stang
because he's very much aware of what's going on.
And that, you know, the conspiracy of these pinks and normals,
you know, this false progress, you know, technology, is true.
And that we are not part of the same race and species
as so-called humans.
And that something has got to happen.
You know, the UFOs appearing in the sky.
The UFOs.
I want to stress that the UFOs are returning in the sky.
When, you know, the conspiracy representing the establishment
subject me to their ignorance and their...
expert use of those known voices in forests,





And they speak English too
How many galaxies?
A hundred billion
How many stars in E?
A hundred billion
So the chances of me finding you
Are less than one in a billion trillion
And I still don't wanna
Be your friend
You're far too self-obsessed for me to
Be your friend
You're selfish and repressed
Don't wanna be your friend
You're scheming and you hate
Don't wanna be your friend
My folks are here to pick me up and
We ain't coming all the way to meet you
We ain't coming all the way to meet you
We ain't coming all the way to meet you
We ain't coming all the way to meet you
We're not how you imagine aliens, I guarantee
Though we'd rather be referred to as indigenous ETs
And frankly our immune system's a fine one up to scratch
It's insulting all these movies where you never meet your man
After ten thousand years
I stopped off at your site
I've been intelligent

With spacemen looking for you
Nobody wants to

You're really quite obnoxious though to

You'd really start my prospects I will

There's something about the universe
Well be your friend
We'll all be dead at 40 years

We ain't

We ain't
Coming all the way to meet you
We ain't
Coming all the way to meet you
Okay I'm going now, it's not been much fun
I've given you a tune up, press this and you're done
I hope I'm never back so please take a hint
At least until you've all made yourselves extinct
Just stop your signals and your radio breaks
It's just annoying and a little cliché
Don't be so needy it just doesn't appeal
All the ghosts up here in the sky were with you
We don't wanna
Be your friend
You're just a little backward we will
Be your friend
There's nothing in it for us to
Be your friend

We've got our friends to think about and
We ain't doing all our ways and we're not doing it right

And all the other recordings, pretty much, in this episode of Hour of Slack,
number 1,226, are either from or about the Starwood Festival of 2009.
The radio phone interview, however, is from Right Where You Are Sitting Now,
episode 29 of the British podcast,
which you can hear lots more of at sittingnow.co.uk.
Oh, and the one radio clip was from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.
Pretty much all the other recordings are location recordings made at Starwood
by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
except that one collage about God and Satan, which came from Signal to Noise.
And the title collage is by Lee Murr.
Thank you.

Now, back to Starwood.
Anyway, friends, this is my 20...
No, this is the 29th Starwood.
It's my 19th Starwood.
And unless you folks...
You know, we've had kind of a low turnout because of weather and the economic cataclysm
and Satan and Jesus and all the powerful monsters.
And if you want to have another Starwood that has...
If you want to have another Starwood that has as many acts and workshops as this one,
go to the Ace sales table and buy those wonderful occult books.
You don't have to...
Actually, you might as well believe everything in it.
That's the solution.
But always the lark's voice will whisper my name.
Come to the water and dance with me.
And always I'll go and deliver the same.
And always I'll go and deliver the same.
And always I'll go and deliver the same.
So over the years, we regularly brought in Robert Anton Wilson.
I got to meet Robert Shea at one of those events.
Shea and Wilson together, in fact.
They brought Wilson and Timothy Leary together a few times.
And I got to edit a sort of a debate or discussion between those two.
Terrence McKenna used to come to Starwood.
We had the painter...
We tried to get the painter Alex Gray this year,
but it turned out that he was too expensive.
But he did send some wonderful sort of copies of his big paintings
that were displayed in a giant dome,
and they were lit up with special digital effects.
It's hard to describe.
He started a church of the sacred mirrors,
is what it's called.
Church of the Sacred Mirror.
And I have not really looked into it that much,
but it seems to be centered around psychedelic artwork.
Specifically, the psychedelic medical illustration type artwork of Alex Gray.
And that makes sense to me.
It's like, well, yeah, if you're going to bust your ass doing paintings like that,
why not turn it into a cult?
And charge a lot to speak.
But...
And avoid taxes, if possible.
Yeah.
I might.
I don't know.
Now, almost every Starwood,
I get half of my material from the mighty Starwood tour guide.
Because the names and concepts of the classes are often inadvertently hilarious.
And I don't mean to put any of them down,
but this particular year,
I had to come up with more of my own crap,
because the workshop names weren't as funny,
but I did find a few.
On Thursday, no, Tuesday night,
there was Party Like a Rockstar,
which was fun,
but it was false advertising,
because I didn't see Elvis, or Jimmy, or Janice, or Jim, or John, or Michael.
But...
But...
But...










But Jackson was here.
Right where you are sitting now,
two weeks ago,
at X-Day,
the Subgenius Festival,
which is not quite as well attended,
but has obviously bigger celebrities.
And that happened two or three,
at least a week after he was supposed to be dead.
So you see the power of Bob.
I like this,
that Phil Farber had a class called
ID Your Inner Pantheon.
I thought, man, that's...
Ask him.
I'm not sure if he's a fan of the show,

But it is a great title.
Elspeth had a great title.
I don't know what I want, but I know this isn't it.
I do know what I want, and this is it.
Thank you, thank you.
Somebody was doing one called Science Spirituality,
and I hope that's not an oxymoron.
At the same time, there was one called Pagan Myth Busters.
Spoilers, spoilers.
Oh, yeah.
The same person did,
Now we know we're God.
Now that we know we're God, what should we do?
Why cast Satan and his imps into the bottomless pit?
Duh!
Didn't you read your...
Whatever that book was?
That one we burn every X-Day?
Religion Without Faith.
That's this sermon.
Tantra for Beginners.
Uh-huh, yeah.
I get it.
Uh-huh.
Experience Oneness, Blessing, Brewing, Beer, Wine, and Wine.
Oh, that's two different classes.
I thought I'd naturally assume it was the same thing.
Oh, and here's one that caught my eye.
High Fairy Tea and Hot Luck.
High Fairy Tea and Hot Luck.
Yeah.
And this also caught my eye.
Wet Felching Magic.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's Wet Felting Magic.
I've got a one-track mind, friends.
And I think, yeah, that was about passion.
Now, tomorrow or Saturday, Passions of the Pot-Smoking Patriots,
which sounds like a fire song.
I'm not sure if that's on the theater now.
Harvey Baughson is doing that.
I want to see.
I always miss his because they're always on at the same time as my stuff.
Anyway, praise Ace, praise Starwood, praise everybody who puts on these workshops.
I'm sure they're all great for somebody.
I really enjoy waking up in the cabin back there,
and there's always one of those Tantra X-ers workshops happening right outside our little cabin.
Those are fun to watch when you first wake up.
That's a good point.
We all watch sports every now and then.
That gives me the feeling that I've got to make up my targ sandy back.
No, this is great local.
This is realizing that I have this thing that I can't be off often and maybe the area isn't so bad for me.
Hey, you want to know a really cool thing about Bob?
He never sleeps.
Phone light, always on.
Always with you.
Broadband, always on.
Wireless access throughout your whole house, always on.
Come on, suck it up.
Come on, suck it up.
Come on, suck it up.
From kindergarten through 12th grade.
You're stupid.
I know that feeling.
Hello, this is me.
I want to state it straight and clear.
This is me, card-carrying member.
Well, except I lost my membership card in 2002.
2002.
It's not the 1900s anymore.
You know, you know what I'm saying?
It's the end time.
And then I just want to say
that these pinks, you know, what you call the pinks,
they're going to get their ass kicked.
They put their hands on one of us.
They want to put us in jail.
They want to put us in prison.
But they're going to get their ass kicked
for screwing around with us
because we're not part of the human race.
The human race is a species
that's doomed to die,
to get wiped out.
And they better not put their hands on us,
so-called subgeniuses,
because they're going to get their ass kicked.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm making false statements to federal agents
high up in the atmosphere.
Files contained formulations and instructions
for making PR News in federal court Monday.
The White House says President Obama
will hold the Israeli prime minister on Tuesday.
We can now say
that we free McDonald's.
Our money is bleeding.
It's a top stuff.
Monday.
President Obama said a return to normalcy
can't be since late Monday.
We just need to find firepower
and be a good subscriber.
And this is a bonus.

The president's pushing for PR News.
Union members at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Plants
have taken extremely small presidential candidates.
The winner was 28% Mitt Romney.
You're listening to PR News from Washington.
The deal with the United Steelworkers Union
ensures PR News will keep six plants.
The protected plants are in Ohio,
in Kent, Ohio.
Firefighters broke out in Riverside County,
southeast of Los Angeles.
NASA says it was part of an experiment.
NASA is intended to collect information
about strange PR news.
Well, Harvey Wasserman often talks about
the conspiracy, the real conspiracy.
And he thinks we don't usually think
was George Washington gay?
What difference does it make?
Did the founders smoke pot?
Et cetera, et cetera.
The subgenius view of conspiracies,
of course, everybody has their own.
They're welcome to their own theory.
But it's true that the world is run
by rich people.
On the rare occasions that it is being run at all.
Generally, I think the conspiracy runs itself
just because people are so great
at building good stout cages for themselves.
You know, the controllers don't have to control.
They can just sit back.
As somebody said,
the TVs don't have to watch us
as long as we're watching TV.
They know what we're doing.
The only way to beat
the conspiracy,
the only way to beat the conspiracy,
is to be rich, I guess,
is to either get really rich yourself
or else drop out of the game totally.
And I wish I could say that I personally knew somebody
who's done either one of those,
but I don't.
A lot of us like to think we've dropped out,
but you know, we're still all at the mercy
of the rich people.
We just haven't been noticed yet
because we've been successfully hungered down
and haven't fought back yet.
And I'm in the same category myself.
The subgeniuses are mostly what we call
the clown trodden.
Yes.
But,
but we do know this much.
We know that conspiracy is all about mind control.
Would you mind if we nose in on your business over here?
Would you mind if we nose in on your business over there?
Friends, we subgeniuses are not here to mind you.
We're here to read your mind.
We mind you.
We're here to under-mind you
and mine out that old mind.
And not replace it, not with mine,
but with a much infinitely stupider mind.
A 2D mind.
A button-down mind.
A veritable mind filled,
the bedotted mind of J.R. Bob Dobbs!
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!
Praise God damn, damn God Bob!
That is what's going to help you make it through
the workaday world.
We're not talking about the wimp-powerment
of the conspiracy.
We're selling you,
and this is written down by my friend Onan,
so you know it's true.
We're selling a genuine fortification
of your inherent status as
a superior mutant
fit to stand as judge, jury, and executioner
over anyone who might stand between you and your slap.
Now, what is slack?
Again, friends, it's different for everybody.
For me, slack is avoiding wild-eyed crazy men
screaming obscenities during performance art religious events.
For you, this is clearly not the case.
Or is it?
Praise Bob! Praise Starwood!
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack,
number 1226, from the Church of the Subgenius.
And to get more information, check out the website,

We'll close out in a second here
with Little Theodore,
the great Little Theodore,
from littletheodore.com,
from his new album, Peace is Boring.
Praise Bob!
Peace is boring!
Give me football!
I want action!
I'll take murder!
Peace is boring!
I crave drama!
Conflict and anguish
Keep things interesting!
Body counts from bombs!
Make good meetings!
Peace is boring!
Nothing changes!
Invading countries!
Brings twists and turns!
What'll happen tomorrow?
At least it won't be boring!
Smooth, straight, cardiographs!
It's not good news!
High peaks, low points!
Pump's blood gives price!
Complications!
I'm not a doctor!
Like hot peppers!
Energizing!
Peace is riskless!
Competition!
Is how we got here!
Inside your teeth, riskless!
Rabbit's face, lame piss!
Peace means lipstick!
Ideals antagonized!
Lights, steel cheeks, for the cause!
Now you're not boring!
Shake things up, rationalize!
That wave could kill you!
Dry dust flows away!
Peace goes nowhere!
Good boy, bad ass!
Sexual selection!
Conquer to procreate!
For the means extinction!
Pilots from afar!
It's win-win for me!
Warrior nation!
Give Serge a chance!
Now that we've settled that!
We're gonna get him!
Don't tell me different!
Peace is boring!
Up your asshole!
모두 시� � här이야!
Peace against your bones!
Force to transform!
все part of the tails!
War is not about powder!
