Please destroy this recording by the usual method.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,060
Sorry, I was giving myself an oil jar.

In any event, please dispose of this tape recording as directed.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,860
Oh Pete's got ideas!

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,860
Those that ain't vile are foul!

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,180
As usual, this recording will decompose one minute after the breaking of the seal.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,340
You have soft hands for a man, Don.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,160
My micro-mechanism thanks you, my computer tapes thank you, and I thank you.

00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,500
Come in, come in sergeant. Stop that noise. Come in!

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,180
Why do you stand there? What is it? Speak up, you empty head.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,840
Do you keep watching the clock? Do you run down and jittery?

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,180
Do you tired? Do you never end?

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
But that's how you feel.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,980
For your own sake.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,580
That's right, Sub-Gideon Meter gives you glorious strength, energy, and needed vital substances.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,200
Plus iron. The name is Sub-Gideon Meter.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,260
And now, turn off your radio.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,600
Now.

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,880
My pappy said, son, you're gonna drive me to Lincoln.

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,120
But you dog

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,120

A

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Holy

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,840
Someone's Bob

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,340
Someone's Bob

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,280
Someone's Bob

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,100
Bob

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,360
Bob

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,380
Bob's own Bob's head

35
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,920
Bob's own Bob's head

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,400
Bob struggled again for air

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
While smelling his rank body odor

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,600
Bob knew it was wrong

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,260
Bob

40
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,440
Had a beer and a good laugh

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
And then a good night's sleep

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
My bourbon Kentucky

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,100
Too much beer

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,920
Bob asked, how is your daughter?

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,880
I would ask her, but she's still unconscious

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Bob

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,180
Some big punk

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,260
Something out of a nightmare

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,140
Fly legs and spider heads through his brain

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,920
One sip and I'm gone

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
Oh my god

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,300
Then he got down

53
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,740
Down to it

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,080
Bob

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,820
Perfect round black hole

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,240
Bob

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,640
Entry positions in the rear

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,240
Bob

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,980
Bob

60
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,680
Bob

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
Bob

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,640
Bob

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:07,720
Bob

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,160
Bob's

65
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,840
Bob's own Bob's head

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,600
Bob

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,820
Bob's

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,400
Bob's own Bob's head

69
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,900
Oh my god

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,440
Bob stayed as calm as he could

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,520
But nobody was interested in his strange idea

72
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,240
sin

73
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,940
He proved that in corporateattan

74
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:38,980
ended up against Bob

75
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,140
Bob's best friend

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,140


77
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,440
Bob that's it

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,920
Bob's going to shower

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:56,920


80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:56,920

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,980
Bob left a good helping hand

83
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:56,980


84
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:56,980


85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,960
Oh Thanks Dog

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:57,960

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,060
chance to go to Vegas and Bob thinks you know possibly a chance we could have been slacking

99
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,480
there. I don't know. I think we did all right but we might have slacked a little. I wanted to get

100
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,200

101

it. From Bob! Lay down with some nice clothes for us to wear on our night out in Vegas courtesy of

102
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:25,200
Bob. That's Bob, that's the kind of guy Bob is. Bob knows me this is so sick.

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
Bob knows that this could potentially be a huge distraction. But uh one thing we had

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
to remind him of- it's like, Bob we just went home.

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,240

This is our last FastFestFestFestFest before Vegas with Bob.

118
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,360
And Bob isn't too happy we're going,

119
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,860
because he thinks that there's a chance we could slack off.

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,660
So he is pushing us really hard today.

121
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,200
Two more.

122
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,720
He is killing us.

123
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,680
And it's not too fun.

124
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,500
This trip is coming at the worst possible time.

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,400
Last one.

126
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,240

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,640
Got Oprah Winfrey programmed on her VCR, plucking off her goatee.

130
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,480
So her boyfriend won't see any kind of infection on her.

131
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,060
He might surmise Rush Limbaugh on the radio.

132
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,540
Well-versed in fellatio.

133
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,200
Extraordinary nice.

134
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,380
She's a traitor.

Just ignore the pubic lice.

You wanna try some of that?

142
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,200
I have said all along that America is based on Judeo-Christian beliefs.

143
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,140
And our unalienable rights don't come from man, they come from God.

144
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,420
To avoid constipation,

145
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,180
she always took some dung.

146
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,200

Met a man from Vida, bought a double wider.

150
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,880
Traded in some plasma for some hairspray and wine.

151
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,520
Perfume came naturally from Walmart.

152
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Smelled just like a dog fart.

154
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,900

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,540
And when she craps, it's as smelly as cattle in an abattoir

180
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,760
Momentarily out of tampons, bloated with digestive gas

194
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
Always pretty

195
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,020
And beats all me

196
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,820
And beats all me

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,640
Don't panic, but sobering.

198
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,540
Yes, if you ever use the term American.

199
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,180
The gorilla.

200
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,700
Do it.

201
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,340
Same country.

202
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,920
America.

203
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,340
Bad.

204
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,100
From.

205
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,160
All right.

206
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,880
But then.

207
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,720
You know.

208
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,380
Robert.

209
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,660
They look like you and me and everybody else.

210
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,300
God.

211
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,200
God.

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,060
God.

213
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,160
God.

214
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,160


215
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,260
,

216
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,440
Green means time to go.

217
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:19,900
Go.

218
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,360
Move over, bro.

219
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
You're moving way too slow.

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,780
Maybe you should know.

221
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,040
No.

222
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm the leader of the western world.

223
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,360
The big decider in the neighborhood .

224
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm floating hope on an ocean of need.

225
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm Santa Claus.

226
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,460
So look under your tree.

227
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,020
I got.

228
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,580
Something for everybody.

229
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,740
Something for everybody.

230
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,900
All right.

231
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,820
Red says time to stop.

232
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,760
We're back.

233
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


234
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


235
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


237
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


238
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


239
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:57,760


240
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,880
Stop the giving up.

241
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,220
Run, now ditch the walk.

242
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,240
Next, get back on top.

243
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,220
I'm here to fix it so it runs like new.

244
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,420
But the bankers tell me no can do.

245
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm facing problems way beyond control.

246
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,820
I'm talking smooth but I'm deep in the hole.

247
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,160
Now, tell me what I say.

248
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,520
Sounds like a line.

249
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,440
Trust me, every word is true.

250
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,000
Just don't ask me why.

251
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,760
I got something for everybody.

252
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,920
Something for everybody.

253
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,120
Something for everybody.

254
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,300
Something for everybody.

255
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,380
All right!

256
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,140
Psychopundits keep on burning the fire.

257
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,540
Spin the story then they call me a liar.

258
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,480
Telling me how I should do my job.

259
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,640
Dropping crumbs for the angry mob.

260
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,360
Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

261
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Fundamentally way out of hand.

262
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,220
I keep trying to turn it all around.

263
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,460
But the new world order wants to take me down.

264
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,580
They got something for everybody.

265
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,800
Something for everybody.

266
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,940
Something for everybody.

267
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:24,980
Something for everybody.

268
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,980
Something for everybody.

269
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,120
Something for everybody.

270
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,300
All right!

271
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,080
Something for everybody.

272
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,220
Something.

273
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,220
What about the pink tool?

274
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,160
Both of which were easy.

275
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,460
And also a joke.

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,160
But a neck.

277
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,600
To perform in public.

278
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,940
It was open war in the end.

279
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,100
The eyes fixing the horrified viewer.

280
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,340
In a ghastly glare.

281
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,440
All she'd needed was one man.

282
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,000
And that's what she'd got.

283
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,340
Bob.

284
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,100
Animals twisted everything.

285
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,600
Old age is the blood.

286
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,340
I thought everything you did was glamorous.

287
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,740
A bodiless hand.

288
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,460
Scrolling across a wall.

289
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,280
Maybe God doesn't have a left hand.

290
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,840
I said he got his left hand cut off in a war.

291
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,440
What about the pink tool?

292
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh!

293
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,720
Well, now the song is being recorded.

294
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,040
That's right.

295
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,540
You heard a lot tonight on Big Things in Copyright Australia.

296
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,080
You did a real pretty good job today.

297
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,080


298
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,080


299
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,080


300
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,080


301
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,080


302
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,820
The jam band with the amino acid helpers and Dr. Sinister on bass, I believe.

303
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,820
Does anybody want to rant?

304
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,180
And Pope Black is about to rant.

305
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,340
This is an amazing piece here.

306
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,960
Take it away, Pope Black.

307
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:36,920
Now, I'm looking out here into this terracotta army of overmen, and you look like you're guarding the grave of your emperor, Dobbs.

308
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,680
But I got news for you.

309
00:13:44,960 --> 00:14:02,980
Instead of sitting there on your awarding asses, you should be getting up and jumping and singing and dancing and screaming and praising Lord Dobbs.

310
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:13,040
Because in a few hours, the skies are going to open up.

311
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,940
And that sweet cherry...

312
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,160
is going to swing down and let us ride.

313
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,120
And take us off into the heavens.

314
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,700
To another place.

315
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,540
To a planet X.

316
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,280
A planet sex.

317
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,360
Where we shall be the love toys.

318
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,600
The chew toys of intergalactic goddesses.

319
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,740
Who will keep us.

320
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,900
And love us.

321
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,780
And catch.

322
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,060
From now.

323
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,520
Until.

324
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,680
The end.

325
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,820
Of time.

326
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,060
That we control.

327
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,880
There'll be no more hate.

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,180
There will be no more fear.

329
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,600
There will be no more pain.

330
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,380
And there will be.

331
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,660
A cornucopia.

332
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,040
Of drugs.

333
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,340
And alcohol.

334
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
And meatloaf.

335
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,700
And grape jelly.

336
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,760
Because you.

337
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,460
And you.

338
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,180
And you.

339
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,660
And you.

340
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,140
And you.

341
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Believe.

342
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,120
Believe.

343
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,600
Believe.

344
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,240
Believe.

345
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:59,780
And if you got it right.

346
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,400
Right tonight.

347
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,080
Going into physical madness.

348
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,680
Run through your mind.

349
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:14,880
Going to the world.

350
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:14,940
All the time.

351
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:14,940


352
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,100
Get it right tonight

353
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,640
Get it right tonight

354
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,080
Right tonight

355
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Get it right tonight

356
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,140
Great jelly

357
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,420
In the open heavens

358
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,000
In the open heavens

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
All you can eat

360
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,440
It'll be the Wesley Willis

361
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,300
Snorkin' board of

362
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,120
Intergalactic love

363
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,900
Love

364
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,200
Love

365
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,700
Love

366
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Love

367
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:14,280
In the hot rocks

368
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,680
In the hot rocks

369
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,760
From outer space

370
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,600
Gonna swing down

371
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,440
And give you a smile at least

372
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,780
They're gonna pick you up

373
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,280
Carry you off to heaven

374
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,560
And give you an intergalactic

375
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,360
7-Eleven

376
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,580
Frame up

377
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,200
Wraith ball

378
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,140
Wraith ball

379
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,800
Wraith ball

380
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,580
Dr iPod

381
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:12,960


382
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:12,960


383
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,700
guitar solo

384
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,060
I got sprayed with mace

385
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,740
In a sacred place

386
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,400
Love got us coming down

387
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,600
Take me off this base

388
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,060
You think it's fair

389
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,680
To live on planet Earth

390
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,980
With loads of bad TV shows

391
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,200
And landmines in the dirt

392
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,680
Well, we're going to play

393
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,780
In outer space

394
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,540
Where there ain't no hurt

395
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,340
Where there ain't no hurt

396
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,880
Praise God

397
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,440
Praise God

398
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,940
Praise God

399
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,980
Praise God

400
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,520
müsst

401
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:17,520


402
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,060
And you

403
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,060


404
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,460
And you

405
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,220
And you

406
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,900
Thou

407
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:30,900


408
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,240
Are

409
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,240


410
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,240


411
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
Thou

412
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:32,640


413
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:32,640


414
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:32,640


415
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,620
Thou

416
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,120
Thou

417
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,540
Fed that conspiracy

418
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,380
By the tape of the neck

419
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,280
Shake it like a rag doll

420
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,620
And stomp him to heck

421
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,780
Take that evil conspiracy

422
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,240
Drive him off to hell

423
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,540
We'll go off to space

424
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,860
And eat it like an electric taco bell

425
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,600
Woo!

426
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,940
Woo!

427
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,300
Woo-hoo!

428
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,520
Ah, yes.

429
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,740
Pope David Lee Black.

430
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,620
Oh, man.

431
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,600
Yeah, Pope David Lee Black there,

432
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
recorded by Potter Nostril,

433
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,920
at 13X Day.

434
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,340
And, yes, Pope Black really did get maced

435
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,560
at X Day.

436
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,040
Welcome back to America, Pope Black.

437
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,640
Unbelievable.

438
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,260
Yes, that was a pretty amazing rant there

439
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,620
that was totally spontaneous.

440
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,340
And the music was spontaneous,

441
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,000
and that was Six-Fisted Tales of Connie.

442
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,300
That's the name of the band

443
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,780
that forms once a year at X Day.

444
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,040
It's always different people

445
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,300
on different instruments each song.

446
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
But this was more or less, I think,

447
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Reverend Sud Shaw with Monkey Hive

448
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,820
and Reverend Angry Larry,

449
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,500
I think, both playing guitar.

450
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,460
Dr. Sinister played bass

451
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,240
until he had bloody fingers.

452
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,020
He described that on his show last week.

453
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,520
He played drums sometimes, didn't he?

454
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,020
Yeah, and Reverend Phil played drums

455
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,440
and Dr. Philo Drummond.

456
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,900
He played all kinds of things,

457
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,220
but mostly saxophone.

458
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,000
That was recorded a Sunday night

459
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,920
at a time when a Buffalo newspaper

460
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
claimed that, quote,

461
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,540
nothing was happening at X Day.

462
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,220
I think they must have been

463
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,740
at the wrong pavilion or something.

464
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,260
Anyway, before that, we had,

465
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,680
well, starting at the beginning,

466
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,940
there was a long string of collages

467
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,060
that were by the great

468
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,340
Fernand and Andy Lemur,

469
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,900
and other ones by The Large

470
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,020
and Mr. Rection,

471
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,360
and other ones by

472
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,940
the great Reverend Hart Ignition,

473
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,400
who is back after some hardship.

474
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,600
He sent a whole bunch of audio cut-ups,

475
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,040
and if you look at the Subgenius Art Mines

476
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,980
at subgenius.com,

477
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,820
you'll see some of the greatest artwork

478
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,500
in the church's long history,

479
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,900
which is kind of equivalent

480
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,520
to the Catholic Church's history of artwork.

481
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,160
The song Trailer Queen

482
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,460
was our friend Reverend Joe Newman

483
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,080
from his band,

484
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,220
the Rudy Schwartz Project.

485
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,440
I'm not sure which DVD or CD,

486
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,660
whatever that was,

487
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,920
the HoloCube that was.

488
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,400
Possibly...

489
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,240
Oh, I can't remember.

490
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,540
And that was Devo

491
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,240
from their new album,

492
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,020
a song called Something,

493
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,100
which I think is about

494
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,380
President Obama

495
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,860
or any president.

496
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,780
That's my theory about that song.

497
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,400
And thanks to Reverend Baz Otherwise,

498
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,420
who loaned us that CD.

499
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,400
And this is some kind of music

500
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,580
from 70s porno movies

501
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,500
in the background.

502
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,400
I've always loved it.

503
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,100
Some of it sounds kind of like

504
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,000
Jefferson Airplane.

505
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,300
Not this one,

506
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
but you'll see what I mean later on.

507
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,120
Princess Wee,

508
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,720
is here,

509
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,880
and this is the first time

510
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,900
we've been in the studio

511
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,060
at WCSB here since

512
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,140
before X Day.

513
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,880
This music reminds me

514
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,160
of the Greek band

515
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,120
at the fish fry.

516
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,500
That's right, yeah.

517
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,700
Yeah, the freak fry,

518
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,860
freak fry at the

519
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,060
Greek Orthodox Church.

520
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,260
There's a Greek Orthodox Church

521
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,480
near us,

522
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,200
near the Slacker Mansion

523
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,660
where we go to their

524
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,240
their fish fries.

525
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,460
Yes, very Greek,

526
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,020
Greekly.

527
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,700
That band, that house band

528
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,080
does sound a little like this.

529
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,600
They do a killer Greek version

530
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,820
of Black Magic Woman.

531
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,400
Oh, speaking of killer versions,

532
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,220
would this be Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

533
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,000
Could it be?

534
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,440
On this particular piece,

535
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,620
the armature of the student

536
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,640
should be very firm,

537
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,180
and the lip should be,

538
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,160
the bottom of the lip

539
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,140
should be cemented up

540
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,520
in a kind of a bridge-like motion

541
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
so that the teeth

542
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,060
can move.

543
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,040
And the tongue

544
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,180
and other parts of the labial area

545
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,520
can produce the note.

546
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,820
Is that the Dr. Overman's

547
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,920
saxophone lessons?

548
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,980
That is right.

549
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
And also, in his lessons,

550
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,880
he includes a brand new reed

551
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,580
for each student.

552
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,060
But it's not the kind

553
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,280
that you would think.

554
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,640
It's an interdimensional transport

555
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,580
of some kind, I believe.

556
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,180
Well, we all believe,

557
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,680
as Pappy said,

558
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,720
I believe what I need to believe.

559
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,320
That's true.

560
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,360
Our needs are based on

561
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,640
what we need to believe

562
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,820
of our needs, our needs.

563
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,800
And that's what the church,

564
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,480
the subgenius, is here for, friends.

565
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,760
Whatever you need to believe,

566
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,000
we'll probably tell you.

567
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,780
Sure, yeah, go ahead, believe it.

568
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,700
Absolutely.

569
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,620
Reinforce them.

570
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,200
Reinforce those beliefs

571
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,460
right up the wazoo,

572
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,780
and start to engender

573
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,200
and create kind of a false,

574
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,460
no, I wouldn't call it false,

575
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,000
but a need for new beliefs

576
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,420
that,

577
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
are convenient for us.

578
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,580
Well, as J.R. Bob Dobbs said,

579
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,800
believe me out of it.

580
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,700
And he was believed out of it.

581
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,440
Wasn't he?

582
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,540
I mean, most of the time,

583
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,140
he was still kind of believed out of it.

584
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Is Bob in the station?

585
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,380
Did I hear Bob?

586
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,400
That's Bob.

587
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,400
That's baby Bob.

588
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,940
He's whining.

589
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,860
He's whining?

590
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,240
That's unusual for Bob,

591
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,280
but I guess, you know,

592
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,800
he doesn't like to be in the station.

593
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,340
You need coyotes,

594
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,340
and you need coyote urine,

595
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,340
which you can buy out

596
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,940
in your local,

597
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,980
outside of Cleveland stores,

598
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,800
out in the sticks,

599
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,380
in your feed and grain

600
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,800
and pet supply stores.

601
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,160
You get your coyote repellent,

602
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,760
and you put it around

603
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,800
the WCSB station down there,

604
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
the beautiful, beautiful

605
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,800
WCSB station.

606
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,620
And that way,

607
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,200
no wolves or bears

608
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,580
or coyotes come in there.

609
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,880
Oh, because the coyote's

610
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
already been there

611
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,760
and staked his claim.

612
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,440
It'll also keep rabbits out,

613
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,180
I would think,

614
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,980
and pussycats.

615
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,140
Well, like Bob will keep rabbits out.

616
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,100
You know, he's got the,

617
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,100


618
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,100


619
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,100


620
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,100


621
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,700
the trickster coyote juice.

622
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,700
Yeah, Bob's urine

623
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,480
will keep almost anything away.

624
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,660
Except customers.

625
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,500
It draws customers.

626
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,080
That's the funny thing about it.

627
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,040
They just want to get close enough

628
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,780
to reach in for their wallet.

629
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,660
That's about it.

630
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,880
Just close enough

631
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,060
to hand him that money and run.

632
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
And any closer, P-U.

633
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,140
Hand over the money and run.

634
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,960
Well, every church has its,

635
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,120
every church has its pew, Dave.

636
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,140
And I thought my jokes were bad.

637
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,400
And many jokes have kneelers.

638
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,500
Oh, never mind.

639
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,300
Kneelers.

640
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,240
Um, kneelers.

641
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,860
Kool-Aid Lorraine.

642
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Thanks, Lorraine.

643
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,080
Lorraine?

644
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,980
Her name's Lorraine, too.

645
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,720
We're all Lorraine,

646
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,540
and you will be Todd.

647
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,100
And name choosing,

648
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,700
especially for you,

649
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,440
by Gil.

650
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,100
What does Bill do

651
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,000
with all your stuff?

652
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
He's holding it

653
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,960
for us at the car.

654
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,080
Oh, I see.

655
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,400
A compound.

656
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,740
Where's the compound?

657
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,740
I'm not really sure.

658
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,600
In Texas?

659
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,220
Oh, you're not a singing group,

660
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,940
you're a cult.

661
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,060
Are you sure?

662
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,120
Of course we're sure.

663
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,980
We're the Bureau of Alcohol,

664
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Tobacco, and Firearms.

665
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,860
It's our job to know

666
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,680
what these fanatics do.

667
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,900
So you have no ethics at all,

668
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,540
do you, Bob?

669
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,060
Oh, we have a couple of events

670
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,120
to mention

671
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,860
that might be of interest

672
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,920
to the subgenius listening audience,

673
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,520
at least the ones in Cleveland.

674
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,080
On Monday,

675
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


676
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


677
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


678
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


679
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


680
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


681
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


682
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


683
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,080


684
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,180
August 7th,

685
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,540
the Cleveland Freethinkers

686
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,220
are having their monthly meeting

687
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,720
or whatever,

688
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,560
and they've invited me

689
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,180
to come and speak to them

690
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,880
about how to lose

691
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,920
their free thought,

692
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,860
how to give their thought

693
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,680
over to Bob,

694
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,580
and it will become paid thought.

695
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,160
You'll pay to know

696
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,020
what you really think.

697
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,380
Anyway, that's at Panera Bread

698
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,800
in Rocky River,

699
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,200
Saturday, August 7th,

700
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,700
at 7 p.m.

701
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,760
And I think anybody who wants to

702
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
can come in.

703
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,840
It's a...

704
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,240
Oh, what did he say about it?

705
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,140
Reverend Anacron is part of that,

706
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,540
and he said,

707
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,840
the Freethinkers are a group of atheists

708
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,940
who hope to build out

709
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,160
an island of sanity

710
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,800
in the sea of theocratic nutjobs.

711
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,160
I'm sure they'll be receptive to you

712
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,200
in the word of Bob.

713
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,900
And so...

714
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,240
And Princess,

715
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,240
we will be there also.

716
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,700
Isn't that what atheists

717
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,180
always do, though?

718
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,680
Yeah.

719
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,240
Oh, they're such a bring-down.

720
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
I mean, you know,

721
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,920
they can't believe in Bob,

722
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,780
for one thing.

723
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,220
And they also falsely

724
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,700
and indeterminately believe

725
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,180
that Bob will bring them down.

726
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,400
Maybe atheists can believe in Bob,

727
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,500
because he's not God.

728
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,420
Sure they can.

729
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,420


730
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,500
They don't think that Bob

731
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,600
is a nutjob, though,

732
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,440
unlike, you know,

733
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,720
the Christians and the...

734
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,080
Are you making fun of me again?

735
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:31,980
No.

736
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,720
Oh, no, no, go on.

737
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
I'm trying, but I can't.

738
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,880
That's an inside joke,

739
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,680
an inside joke.

740
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


741
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


742
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


743
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


744
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


745
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


746
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,680


747
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,120
The scrotal area joke.

748
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,000
A nutjob.

749
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,560
Now, why would you want

750
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
to expose the insides

751
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,780
of scrotal areas?

752
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,940
For laughs.

753
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,320
For cheap laughs.

754
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,140
That's a simple answer.

755
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
Sophomore humor.

756
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,060
I will...

757
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,040
If people look at the events

758
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,120
part of subgenius.com

759
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,240
tomorrow night,

760
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,260
they will see information

761
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,680
about that Freethinkers show.

762
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,440
I didn't get that on there today.

763
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,660
And also tomorrow night,

764
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,760
hopefully they'll be able

765
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,020
to see our photographs

766
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,480
from X Day, 13X Day.

767
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,900
But they won't be able

768
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,620
to see the photos

769
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,280
from the devotional for Devo,

770
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,200
which is coming up

771
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,740
August 27th and 28th.

772
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,900
It's two days this time.

773
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,200
Wow.

774
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,060
At the Beachland Tavern

775
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,100
here in beautiful Cleveland.

776
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,860
Actually, that's over

777
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,720
in Collinswood, right?

778
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,660
North Collinwood.

779
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,460
Or...

780
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,860
Where we used to live there.

781
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,520
The Waterloo Arts Area.

782
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,500
Yes, David.

783
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,700
We used to live there once.

784
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,900
Well, I was like

785
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,720
a part-time liver.

786
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,440
Yeah.

787
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,680
Just like many of us

788
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,440
have in the church.

789
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,380
One that works

790
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,060
once in a while.

791
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,440
I would go there

792
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,200
and spend the night

793
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,140
many nights in a row.

794
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,860
Wow.

795
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,460
Like four or five.

796
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,440
And it's not important

797
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,960
how many nights

798
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,600
you would spend there

799
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,140
in a row.

800
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,720
But I often spent

801
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,920
summer afternoons

802
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,040
gazing out at the lake

803
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,280
from a fifth floor window.

804
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,320
And then below me,

805
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,740
all around,

806
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,840
there was just natural beauty

807
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,760
and there was squalor

808
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,480
like gunshots

809
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:08,860
and bullets.

810
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,480
Yeah, right.

811
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,220
I was gonna say.

812
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:10,300


813
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,660
hoes and mofos

814
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,800
and different kinds

815
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,700
of words like that.

816
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,780
Yeah, that's actually

817
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,060
a pretty rough neighborhood

818
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,720
over there.

819
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,940
A steady in contrast.

820
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,460
But the Devo fans

821
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,960
will all cluster

822
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,600
at the nice, secure

823
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,940
Beachland Tavern.

824
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,460
Oh, it's wonderful there.

825
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,140
On August 27th and 28th.

826
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,420
Oh, yes.

827
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,600
That part of the neighborhood

828
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,000
is lovely.

829
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Plenty of security.

830
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh, it's all

831
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,300
gentrified now.

832
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,740
It's all...

833
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,200
There's like

834
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,780
five art galleries

835
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,220
in one 20-yard area.

836
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,340
Oh, yeah.

837
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,640
Nice place to eat.

838
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:39,640


839
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:39,640


840
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,280
And all kinds of things

841
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,580
are in there.

842
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,460
Shoot, rich people.

843
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,020
I hate them.

844
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,760
People without goatees

845
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,040
are fined $25.

846
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,560
That's right.

847
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Princess Wee,

848
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,960
you better have that 25 bucks

849
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,400
ever since you shaved.

850
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,260
I've got my goatee.

851
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,340
I get made fun of

852
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,120
from having a goatee

853
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,020
by, I don't know,

854
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,460
these subgenius haters

855
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,940
who think that, you know,

856
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,780
the goatee is supposed

857
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,640
to be devilish or something.

858
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,760
Well, I just thought

859
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,080
it was supposed

860
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,620
to be goatish.

861
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


862
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


863
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


864
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


865
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


866
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


867
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


868
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


869
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,620


870
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,960
I just thought it was

871
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,600
goulardish.

872
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,740
I'm not from...

873
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,380
I'll start with the

874
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:16,860
guh sound,

875
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,000
which makes me, you know,

876
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,400
goatee, goulardy,

877
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,040
goat...

878
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Ghosts.

879
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,680
Ghosts.

880
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,560
Goot, goot, goot.

881
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,420
It's, um, I wonder

882
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,020
what the phonetic

883
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,100
relationship is there

884
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,900
between, you know,

885
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,620
the mind sound,

886
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,620
like if we were

887
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,540
ancient Aborigines

888
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,840
about 12 million years ago

889
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,960
and we would look at a box

890
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,000
and everybody at the same time

891
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,280
would go,

892
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,120
gah-gah,

893
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,340
or something, you know.

894
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,220
And that would be

895
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,620
the word for

896
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:39,620


897
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:39,620


898
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:39,620


899
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:39,880
box.

900
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,000
Maybe.

901
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,040
Well, actually,

902
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,240
you know, probably

903
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,820
if they looked at a box,

904
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,800
a perfectly squared-off shape,

905
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,240
that would freak them out.

906
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,460
They might worship it

907
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,500
like Bob does.

908
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,460
If you were from

909
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,480
a Stone Age kind of a culture,

910
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,360
a cardboard box would be

911
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,600
something of a marvel

912
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,700
because of the straightness

913
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,200
and evenness of it.

914
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,400
That 90-degree angle,

915
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,200
squared-off blockhead,

916
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,620
that's unique to you.

917
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:09,620


918
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,360
It's unique to people

919
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
who build square houses,

920
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,560
squares.

921
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,900
Only the square culture

922
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,020
builds square things.

923
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,480
Round cultures like to have

924
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,260
round living areas,

925
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,220
like teepees

926
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,060
or little yurts

927
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,920
and such like.

928
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,800
Domes.

929
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,600
We're the box dwellers,

930
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,260
the caged people.

931
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,280
Sebaceous dwarves.

932
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,040
What?

933
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,720
Sebaceous dwarves?

934
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,600
Are you kidding me?

935
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:39,600


936
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:39,620
Are you kidding me?

937
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,780
Are you making fun of me again?

938
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,000
You are, aren't you?

939
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
You just came quick

940
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,360
picking on me.

941
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,500
If there's something to pick on,

942
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,240
I say get out the needle and thread

943
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,900
and pick on it.

944
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,220
Wow.

945
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,100
Bob knows

946
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,400
that picking is good

947
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,420
in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

948
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,260
Oh, well.

949
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,340
Oh, well.

950
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,920
Hey, next.

951
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,900
Bob knows it's no fun

952
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,740
to think of, about, of, about.

953
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,040
so we are

954
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,640
um

955
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,860
I'm

956
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,380
Bob Head

957
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,220
we're not perfect

958
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,100
Bob must die

959
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,020
internet porn

960
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,300
prostitution

961
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,940
sex trafficking

962
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
what did he mean by that

963
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,600
down down down

964
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,300
8-06

965
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,480
why

966
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,220
hierarchical

967
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,020
we have the power

968
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,520
click

969
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,000
well Dave

970
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,800
you were at

971
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,740
X Day

972
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,640
for one day

973
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,560
that was my

974
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,620
briefest time ever

975
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,600
in the history of humanity

976
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,420
well

977
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,220
but it was brilliant

978
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,740
I don't know

979
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,340
that it was

980
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,120
I haven't heard

981
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,240
the recordings yet

982
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,940
for all I know

983
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,820
it could be awful

984
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,680
but it was Dave

985
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,640
come on

986
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,360
well there were

987
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,980
a few titters

988
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,760
of laughter there

989
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,180
but there were

990
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,740
more titters

991
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,660
than there were laughers

992
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,860
there was Dave

993
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,600
and Dr. Hal

994
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,620
and Susie

995
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,220
the floozy

996
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,800
and I remember

997
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
oh yeah

998
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,240
we have pictures

999
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,300
Susie the floozy

1000
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:14,880
got bored

1001
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,060
with the boy talk

1002
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,220
and took her shirt off

1003
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,160
and smoked a fake

1004
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,580
smoked a cigarette

1005
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,540
but it's a fake cigarette

1006
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,620
you see her all the time

1007
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,060
with this

1008
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,140
it actually smokes

1009
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
smoke comes out

1010
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,820
of the end of it

1011
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,240
but it's not a real cigarette

1012
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,300
she just

1013
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,440
she just smoked

1014
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
but uses it

1015
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,600
to look slutty

1016
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,320
in keeping with the name

1017
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,480
Reverend Sue

1018
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,280
Susie the floozy

1019
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,900
just a prop

1020
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,040
just another prop

1021
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,860
she did some

1022
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,700
wonderful preaching

1023
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,600
we'll be hearing

1024
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,620
all of that preaching

1025
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,360
on future

1026
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,260
I mean hours of slack

1027
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,160
whatever this is

1028
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,020
oh god

1029
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,580
and then there was

1030
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,180
Starwood

1031
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,020
and I

1032
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,240
we're still dizzy

1033
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,620
we're trying to

1034
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,320
grasp our bearings

1035
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,700
but

1036
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,780
yeah we've had

1037
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
actually that was

1038
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,380
in the land

1039
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,480
of round places

1040
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,860
and now we're back

1041
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,340
in the world

1042
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,880
of square

1043
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,560
in fact on the way

1044
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,620
back from Starwood

1045
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,280
we and our past

1046
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,000
and your Reverend

1047
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,820
Baz otherwise

1048
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,720
stopped at a

1049
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,660
like a family restaurant

1050
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,120
Laurie's family restaurant

1051
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,740
just inside the Ohio border

1052
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,400
across from West Virginia

1053
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,220
what a memory

1054
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,560
West by God Virginia

1055
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,080
Mr. Sister knew

1056
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,980
what town it was

1057
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,660
it's like Crawford

1058
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,680
or something

1059
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,080
not that's where

1060
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,040
President Bush

1061
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,800
used to live

1062
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,400
Crawford

1063
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,880
but it's

1064
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,320
something with a C

1065
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,680
anyway

1066
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,780
we had been

1067
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,740
okay at X Day

1068
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
which is pretty

1069
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,820
there's some weirdos

1070
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,260
but we had been

1071
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
and then we were

1072
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,840
at Starwood

1073
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,560
which is all different

1074
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,820
kind of weirdos

1075
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,420
and then suddenly

1076
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:45,940
here we were

1077
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,600
in Laurie's family restaurant

1078
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,180
in off the highway Ohio

1079
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,240
and Baz drew our attention

1080
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,060
to the fact

1081
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,220
that everything was

1082
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,040
white

1083
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,700
and clean

1084
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,680
and smooth

1085
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,640
and square

1086
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,240
straight

1087
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
flat

1088
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,280
flat

1089
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
all of

1090
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,160
and including

1091
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,200
the people

1092
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,460
and just as

1093
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,440
who obviously

1094
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,100
had just

1095
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,260
gone to the

1096
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,480
church

1097
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,660
most of them

1098
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,900
and here's the funny thing

1099
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,180
just as we were sitting there

1100
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,520
thinking about how pink

1101
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,980
all these people must be

1102
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,920
suddenly

1103
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,900
this old feller

1104
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,720
who looked like

1105
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,500
Abe Lincoln

1106
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,160
crossed with Uncle Sam

1107
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,740
quite a courtly old gent

1108
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,080
a real old gent

1109
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,960
like in his 80s

1110
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,820
he did have the facial hair

1111
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,800
to create those illusions

1112
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,320
yes he did

1113
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,820
he had a long white beard

1114
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,180
and he looked like

1115
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,760
Uncle Sam

1116
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,020
out of his costume

1117
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,920
and he was with his family

1118
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,300
and he suddenly stopped

1119
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,040
by our table

1120
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,760
and looked at me

1121
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,200
and he goes

1122
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,720
excuse me

1123
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,020
fella

1124
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,500
I need to ask you a question

1125
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,540
now

1126
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,560
you're sitting here

1127
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,440
and you're not all that good

1128
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,320
looking of a fella

1129
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,420
but you've got these

1130
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,520
two beautiful women

1131
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,360
sitting here with you

1132
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,320
I want to know your secret

1133
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,580
I know you must have a trick

1134
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,560
he said that to you?

1135
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:52,860
yes

1136
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,040
yes

1137
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,820
and I

1138
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,900
and I witnessed it

1139
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,860
now you can see why

1140
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,380
that part of my family

1141
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,340
that lives down there

1142
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
in the hillish area

1143
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,200
that did

1144
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,480
I

1145
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,140
think they're crazy

1146
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,400
well they're not

1147
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,120
this guy

1148
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,000
my father

1149
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
and they'll just walk up to you

1150
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,440
and say these really weird

1151
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,180
things sometimes

1152
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,180
that's not that

1153
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,080
I've been

1154
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,400
it was so much like

1155
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,940
something my father would do

1156
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,360
that I knew exactly

1157
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,140
how to handle it

1158
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,440
you know

1159
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,500
he sort of insulted me

1160
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:17,940
by saying

1161
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,160
you're not so good looking

1162
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,920
and you're sitting there

1163
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,880
with these beautiful women

1164
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,600
what's your secret

1165
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,640
and I said to him

1166
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
I'm rich

1167
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,220
and the whole place

1168
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,960
cracked up

1169
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,520
and he said

1170
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,700
I thought you had a trick

1171
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
because I got one too

1172
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,340
and he

1173
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,240
you know

1174
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,660
kind of

1175
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,440
motioned to the ladies

1176
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,320
he was with

1177
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
and did the balloon animals

1178
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,080
routine work?

1179
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,180
yeah

1180
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,180


1181
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,280
for two and a half hours

1182
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,880
so you see

1183
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,520
there's

1184
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,000
the moral of the story

1185
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,200
is we're sitting there going

1186
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,680
god

1187
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,300
we're these weirdo subgeniuses

1188
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,980
and everybody around us

1189
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,900
is oh so pink

1190
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,400
oh god

1191
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,840
and suddenly

1192
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,040
this local guy

1193
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,700
walks up

1194
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,760
and proves he's as big

1195
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,080
a subgenius as anybody

1196
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,300
so it just goes to show

1197
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,920
you can't

1198
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,280
only

1199
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,840
only J.R. Bob Dobbs

1200
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,660
can judge a book

1201
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,320
by its cover

1202
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,300
he's the only one

1203
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,000
who can do that

1204
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,840
truthfully

1205
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,760
I've always believed

1206
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
that what I said about

1207
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,820
the other side

1208
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,420
of my family

1209
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,700
is not correct

1210
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,020
I

1211
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,340
I

1212
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:07,540
I

1213
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,940
speed

1214
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,260
up

1215
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,320
my

1216
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,320


1217
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,760
oh you know

1218
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,740
like hula ladies

1219
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,660
those ceramic

1220
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,340
hula ladies

1221
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,200
that have the name

1222
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,740
of a ship

1223
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,780
from world war 2

1224
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,280
or Korea

1225
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,980
underneath them

1226
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,320
and stuff

1227
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,160
and that sort of thing

1228
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,400
and I forgot

1229
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,940
where that was

1230
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,540
you were telling us

1231
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,520
that your family

1232
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
are a bunch

1233
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,580
of characters

1234
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,280
Dave

1235
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,380
Lonesome

1236
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,160
Cowboy

1237
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,620
Dave

1238
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,460
northeastern

1239
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,080
perspective

1240
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:46,320
I remember going to a place and asking for some eggs and toast and the lady went you don't want no meat with that

1241
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,740
meaning pig meat

1242
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:55,580
Yeah, I was automatically felt very outcast just just because of the huge volume of pork consumed

1243
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,060
in those areas

1244
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,280
Well, you know when in Rome

1245
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:09,460
Eat pork. Yep. Everything's better with bacon. Don't you think that your relatives from down there might occasionally say

1246
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,220
Yeah, we've got we've got a relative up north names a lonesome cowboy Dave. He's a bit of a character

1247
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:21,960
Oh, of course, they would of course they would he reads then stuff. I

1248
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,300
Seen him read a book one time. I

1249
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,020
Don't even think it was upside down

1250
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
But I couldn't

1251
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,220
take

1252
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,200
a look at the

1253
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,180
No, it was pretty good at reading and writing but

1254
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,360
Those are kind of Bob Dobbs is rich in a strange way

1255
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,800
Even though they're all gnarled and twisted and kind of connected to everything every group of people if there were

1256
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,260
Excellent group. Well, jr. Bob Dobbs himself was raised in a small town. I

1257
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,720
Will reveal that it was not in Texas. It was in Kansas

1258
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,980
Fairly small town

1259
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,200
and although he

1260
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,740
He grew he kind of he moved to Texas and developed he had to just kind of a general

1261
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:10,780
Midwestern accent a tornado picked him up and dropped him off in Texas. I would suppose a Kansas

1262
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,620
Actually

1263
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:22,600
You're thinking of Bob's attempt the attempted abortion of jr. Bob Dobbs his mom for reasons

1264
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,620
Wanted to abort the infant Dobbs before he was born but

1265
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,620
He could yank him out of there because of his magic power and they finally strapped her down in a Kansas wheat field and

1266
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,660
Tornado came and that managed to suck the fetus Bob out. But as soon as she saw the little

1267
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,020
preemie Bob she like everyone else she loved him and

1268
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:53,600
Was sorry that she had attempted to abort him and so they they raised him and I don't think mr

1269
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,020
Dobbs ever really was had a clue about any of that or

1270
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,580
the stories about the real father

1271
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:09,600
The different colors of hair on his neck and stuff. Why they don't matter. Yeah. Well, mr. Dobbs was a

1272
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:17,240
One of the few American Mayans. He was Mayan American and and Bob obviously doesn't really resemble

1273
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,140
I mean, he's like a

1274
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,540
he's so

1275
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,300
Caucasian he's

1276
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,460
Almost alien looking I'm speaking of which I read in the news today that the aliens are fleeing

1277
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,420
Arizona and selling their disintegrators

1278
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,700
Well, that's not the Martian community. I guess the Martian community is selling of CDs to world beat guys

1279
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,840
I guess their music is really really bizarre

1280
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,520
It's like elements of Martian disco mixed with afropop mixed with

1281
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,140
you know country music just everything thrown in there and

1282
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,600
It's hard for some to understand but it's an experience

1283
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:54,740
You know what?

1284
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,200
I mean people buy the CD to have the some of them vomit some of them cry

1285
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,040
But it sounds like some genius music. Yeah

1286
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,040
Purgative in some ways and an animatic in other ways

1287
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:13,780
Oh we next next day we're thinking of changing the name of it to love parade

1288
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,540
I thought that might be a

1289
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,600
Kind of a draw and in some ways it'd be more accurate. I

1290
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,240
Could just see though like huge ants on a screen with a bunch of subgenie around it and where the

1291
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,660
Huge ants are like eating the heads off of regular people running down the street and Kansas or some

1292
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,160
It just kind of puts an unusual perspective to it. That is an unusual perspective

1293
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:45,400
I'm not sure where that came from. Well, everything is so smooth and flat and suddenly there's huge ants

1294
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Oh or little crabs or whatever they are

1295
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,780
right

1296
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:57,860
I'm just I'm just a little slow today. The heat's been getting to us. Mm-hmm me too. It's me for

1297
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:05,500
I guess our north up in Canada and you know around the northern Great Lakes from Minnesota and so forth

1298
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,700
it was even hotter than down here for some weird reason and

1299
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,300
Many hundreds were recorded and whatever that is in Canadian talk 30 something whatever

1300
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:23,600
Yeah, yeah, that's uh 40 maybe it's kind of brutal. Oh, it's probably snowing in Texas now

1301
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:24,860
I

1302
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,500
Heard it's raining and I'm very lush in Texas right now

1303
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,140
Have any thoughts?

1304
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,040
Yeah, but it's that spent that new methane rain coming in from the Gulf

1305
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:43,460
Now that the hurricane sees the storm season is coming in the it's the the the new chemicals are wafting into the heartland

1306
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,320
Soon soon my brother's goats will all have oil

1307
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,800
wads

1308
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,560
Like those pelicans. Yeah, you'll be wearing gas masks

1309
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
I did goats with a gas mask

1310
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,520
That's a strange image, you know goats can handle almost anything if a goat has to have a gas mask

1311
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,360
And that's a bad

1312
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:13,680
Yeah, I remember seeing early military training films and stuff and they put gas masks on the poor little coach and then

1313
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,700
Pump whatever kind of gas and if the goat was still working, I mean goats still standing that meant the mask was working

1314
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,240
Oh, there was one military then there was the military

1315
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,900
experiment where they killed goats just by staring at him because they

1316
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,740
were Jedi's

1317
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,260
the new earth army

1318
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,460
And then they made a lot of money off of a movie and then there were yeah

1319
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,300
Oh, and then there was the people who killed goats by cussing at them. It was called men who swear at goats

1320
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,700
That was in it was in Arabic originally was this I should

1321
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,100
I

1322
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,660
Should take over dr. Dark's job as awfulest punster

1323
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,420
Actually, they're I couldn't hold a candle to him. I

1324
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,280
Put me in front of the radio. I don't do this all the time. Do I princess way? Yeah, you do

1325
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:11,660
The point is yes, she

1326
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,940
One point and now I'm a punnery

1327
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:16,860
fellow

1328
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,700
Also, I used to talking puns constantly, and he would never quit

1329
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,000
We make you cry sometimes

1330
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,620
I'm sorry

1331
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,240
I could

1332
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,180
I could swear I heard the Devo song I played today, I could swear I heard him say,

1333
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,020
Psychopath Finders in the lyrics.

1334
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,320
But that can't be. I must have just imagined that.

1335
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,020
I actually read the lyrics online before I played it on the radio,

1336
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,560
because, you know, I'm deaf. I can't actually hear anything.

1337
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,620
So, like, for instance, what you're saying now, I had to look it up on the internet

1338
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,700
so I'd know what to say, you know, on cue.

1339
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,540
Thank goodness it's all there on Google.

1340
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,220
Everything you're going to say is right there.

1341
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,460
What would we do without that safety net?

1342
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,400
Talk about stealing people's dreams. I think that's what Google's all about.

1343
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,020
They wanted to steal every author's book and make it free.

1344
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,820
Oh, we've decided your book is free now.

1345
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,160
Well, then they'll write it for you and charge you.

1346
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,640
So we finished those last four chapters.

1347
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,300
We knew what you were going to say anyway.

1348
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,340
Here's an invoice for...

1349
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,980
Reverend Stang, we improved your subgenius book.

1350
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,000
It wasn't very good.

1351
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,180
It's gone.

1352
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,600
It's called... It's Praise Bill now, the Book of Bill.

1353
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,720
That'll be $5,000.

1354
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:41,100
Well, no, they'll just won't pay me any royalties until that $5,000 has been accrued by sales, advanced sales.

1355
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,200
They'll be like, you know, potty chairs with lots of fur and any of your favorite...

1356
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,540
I know you're into sodomizing animals, so, you know...

1357
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:48,780
What?

1358
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,400
Those magazines and stuff will provide it for you.

1359
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,620
No, I only do that for on stage.

1360
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,640
That's just a stage.

1361
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,760
Okay.

1362
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,140
It's just wild vegan food to be commenced today.

1363
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,980
And it's... I'm sorry, I forgot.

1364
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,960
Ay yi yi.

1365
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,840
I didn't mean to interrupt with that.

1366
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,680
Mm-mm-mm.

1367
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,140
What did you interrupt?

1368
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,020
I don't remember even that.

1369
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,440
Me neither.

1370
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,520
I think he interrupted himself.

1371
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,860
We better Google it.

1372
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,380
Wait a minute.

1373
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,980
Oh, no.

1374
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,720
Here, let me Google that for you.

1375
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,340
Yeah.

1376
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,520
Yeah.

1377
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,140
Yeah.

1378
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:20,500


1379
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1380
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1381
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1382
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1383
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1384
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1385
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1386
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1387
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1388
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:21,700


1389
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,320
Yeah.

1390
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,580
Yeah.

1391
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,080
Yeah.

1392
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,060
Yeah.

1393
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,620
Yeah.

1394
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,520
Yeah.

1395
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1396
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1397
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1398
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1399
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1400
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1401
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,540


1402
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:50,100
Well, I made the mistake of looking at the news again today or yesterday.

1403
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,540
Well, it had this funny headline that said,

1404
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,520
Is Pakistan During...

1405
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,080
directing Afghanistan insurgents.

1406
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,720
It was implying this fantastic, horrible secret

1407
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,260
that the CIA knew but didn't want to admit,

1408
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,380
that the Taliban had actually been being supplied

1409
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,460
and advised by the Pakistanis.

1410
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,700
And then I remembered, wait a minute,

1411
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,820
we used to supply and guide the Taliban

1412
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,300
when they were fighting the Ruskies.

1413
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,680
Yeah, they're still using them stingers on us.

1414
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,000
So what's the difference?

1415
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,820
I mean, what did not seem like, it's just a horrible...

1416
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,440
Talk about dog eat dog.

1417
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,120
Yep, that's what's bad about the WikiLeaks.

1418
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,860
Talk about bog sucking in bog.

1419
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,120
Yep.

1420
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,440
Bog is my favorite character on the Dead Dave show.

1421
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,720
Bog?

1422
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,620
Yeah, that's Reverend Angry Larry's new TV show,

1423
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,220
the Dead Dave show, you should look that up.

1424
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,500
I knew that part, I'm glad you repeated it for the airtime.

1425
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,120
Yeah, and bog is this...

1426
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,040
brainless swamp thing

1427
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:03,340
that talks kind of like a cross between Zippy the Pinhead and Bob Dobbs.

1428
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,240
He gets a lot of the best lines, and Dead Dave is the straight man.

1429
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,300
It's a sitcom about what zombies do when they're not eating your brain.

1430
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,200
Like what?

1431
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,580
It's all pretty mundane.

1432
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,380
He celebrates Halloween in one episode,

1433
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,260
and they have Christmas in another episode.

1434
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,660
Then there's an episode...

1435
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,900
It's like a making of the Dead Dave show that's behind the scenes

1436
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,940
that shows their effete director, Colin Dewar,

1437
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,800
engaging in all kinds of lascivious movie director type stuff.

1438
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,480
Sometimes referred to as Colin Dower.

1439
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,760
What else is in the news here?

1440
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,840
U.S. holds drills off Korea as Pyongyang talks war.

1441
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,560
I thought,

1442
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,940
Oh, if those drills are deep sea oil drills,

1443
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,600
that'll sure show those North Koreans.

1444
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,560
Yeah, why don't we just light up North Korea with a nuclear device or...

1445
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,780
Just send BP there or any of those guys.

1446
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,000
It didn't have to be BP.

1447
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,040
It could be any drilling company.

1448
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,560
Caliburton will be right behind them.

1449
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,280
When I think of drills and, you know, destroying the Gulf and so forth,

1450
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,880
and then I think of the drills that the Pakistani secret police are doing,

1451
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,260
which are just, you know, drilling like,

1452
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,060
Okay, how can we kill a bunch of Americans?

1453
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:31,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1454
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,060
And when I think of all the other drills they're having,

1455
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,020
and there's never going to be a war between North...

1456
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,400
Nuclear war between North and South Korea.

1457
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,940
I mean, why would Americans even believe that?

1458
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,620
I mean, would there be a nuclear war between Ohio and Pennsylvania?

1459
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,080
Why would they use any of those drills when they could go to the X-Day drill?

1460
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:48,660
Yeah.

1461
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,760
Or they could just use a good old dental drill

1462
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,420
that kind of makes people flap around on their seats and scream.

1463
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,840
Yeah, some people pay extra for that, I've heard.

1464
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,020
Yeah.

1465
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,460
Some people make a living out of it.

1466
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,280
Yeah, I've actually paid quite a bit of money

1467
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,280
to have somebody do that to somebody else.

1468
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,060
It was my kids, in fact.

1469
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,140
I paid a dentist a lot of money

1470
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,960
to torture my children's mouths.

1471
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,540
And they all have...

1472
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,300
They have all their teeth now, you'd think.

1473
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,400
I mean, they look just like they have all their teeth.

1474
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,320
Beautiful.

1475
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,040
In any second, I could be...

1476
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,620
We could be grandparents, too.

1477
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,180
Any second now.

1478
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,400
Any moment.

1479
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,820
My daughter is scheduled to thwelp a new stang child.

1480
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,500
Actually, its name won't be stang

1481
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,140
because she's married to somebody whose name is not stang.

1482
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,540
But think of the horrible visit you've created in the mind's eye

1483
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,900
of so many listeners out there.

1484
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,220
A little teeny beautiful baby girl with a stang head on it.

1485
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,860
She looks just like you exactly.

1486
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,640
You're not a very good-looking guy.

1487
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,500
What are you doing?

1488
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,240
What's your head doing on this beautiful woman's body?

1489
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,620
You're not that good-looking.

1490
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,800
That body's real good-looking.

1491
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,420
What's your secret?

1492
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,020
Get me the hell out of here.

1493
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,940
Hmm.

1494
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah.

1495
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,140
Oh, hi.

1496
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,060
I think all subgeniuses who enlist, re-enlist,

1497
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,520
or co-opt themselves today

1498
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,960
really ought to consider the fact

1499
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,520
that they could instantly become

1500
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,360
a sort of conceptual grandpa or grandma

1501
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,120
if they want to.

1502
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,480
Even if they're not old enough,

1503
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:23,480


1504
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:23,480


1505
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,920
they're not old enough to have a child of their own.

1506
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,400
I would just make that offer as a statement

1507
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,660
just to flip it out in the air

1508
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,360
and hope that it never comes back.

1509
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:32,740
Now, what?

1510
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,880
Did you say you're offering to be the grandchild

1511
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,380
of any subgenius?

1512
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,380
No, I was just saying that any subgenius...

1513
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,180
Any person...

1514
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,460
Come here, little Davey Wavey.

1515
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,580
Sit on my lap.

1516
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,640
Let me spoil you.

1517
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,680
You've got some toys.

1518
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,060
Bounce a baby.

1519
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,380
Bounce a bounce a baby.

1520
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,040
I'm going to show you how to play the accordion, child.

1521
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,300
I'm going to show you how to play the accordion, child.

1522
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:53,460
I'm going to show you how to play the accordion, child.

1523
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:53,460


1524
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,320
When's our new grandchild Dave here

1525
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,560
going to start growing some hair?

1526
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:57,800
Yeah.

1527
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,460
His teeth have come in.

1528
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Well, some of them.

1529
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,820
And now he's growing hair on his mouth

1530
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,740
and teeth on his head.

1531
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,820
And that's the way things should be.

1532
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,440
They could...

1533
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,440
I was horrified to learn that hair

1534
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,780
had begun to grow inside my ears.

1535
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,680
I didn't know.

1536
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,480
There are tools, aren't there?

1537
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,880
My friends told me.

1538
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,780
Yeah, there are tools.

1539
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,840
And I had to start, you know,

1540
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,440
learning.

1541
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,300
Learning to use them.

1542
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,340
Old, old, old.

1543
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,100
As a youth, I once mocked a man

1544
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,880
for looking like a man,

1545
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,140
except for the fact you could tell

1546
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:33,980
he was getting old because

1547
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,040
he had a mustache on his nose.

1548
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,140
On his nose.

1549
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,280
And I thought,

1550
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,480
he picked that.

1551
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,840
And I realized after a while,

1552
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,220
who cares, you know?

1553
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,620
Just get out a can opener

1554
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,060
and remove as much extra wind as you can

1555
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,560
and scoop it up

1556
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,520
and hope it never,

1557
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:52,800
uh,

1558
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,960
gets in your way.

1559
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:53,960


1560
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,340
I'm gonna go to the toilet.

1561
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,740
But we don't have to worry about that.

1562
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
We'll never get old.

1563
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,080
Because any minute now,

1564
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,680
Bob and the aliens will come and save us.

1565
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,580
Because X-Day could be any moment.

1566
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,200
That was Bob's point

1567
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,340
in making us wait at 7 o'clock

1568
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,680
on every July 5th

1569
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,080
for the last 13 years.

1570
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,460
That's a magic number, too,

1571
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,900
in your holy masonic rituals.

1572
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:16,920
Well, and some.

1573
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,340
Well, no, I mean...

1574
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,220
A lot of good it did us.

1575
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,980
24 or something, but...

1576
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,440
Yeah, no, it's a magic number, too.

1577
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:23,440


1578
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:23,440


1579
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:23,440


1580
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,480
It's gonna be lucky 14.

1581
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,140
That's...

1582
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,980
I'm sure that'll work.

1583
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,660
Yeah, well...

1584
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,160
Double sevens.

1585
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,080
Hey, speaking of the world ending any second,

1586
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:33,880
which it could,

1587
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,240
this show is also ending any second,

1588
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,720
or actually in a couple of minutes.

1589
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,240
And, uh, I'm just warning you,

1590
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,280
because I'm gonna turn...

1591
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,160
I'm gonna hang you up

1592
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,100
and get off the mic in about a minute

1593
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,180
and play something.

1594
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,860
I can't remember what is next.

1595
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,060
Right, that was a big deal.

1596
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,660
Because, uh...

1597
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,140
I was going to call late,

1598
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,200
so I could talk all the way until 12 o'clock.

1599
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,580
No, until, uh...

1600
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,680
Until 10 o'clock.

1601
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,080
12 o'clock.

1602
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,700
You can, actually.

1603
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,320
Dr. Sinister's show starts in...

1604
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,740
Yes.

1605
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,760
He usually starts taking calls about 11 o'clock.

1606
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,820
You can call in and...

1607
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,260
Perhaps we could do that, too, isn't it?

1608
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Commiserate with Rock Gnar and...

1609
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,160
Eviscerate.

1610
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,920
Yeah, eviscerate Bernie and all the regulars.

1611
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,460
And then with that,

1612
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,040
I think it is just about time

1613
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,000
to let this, uh,

1614
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,820
to give me some scissor space.

1615
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,380
Friends, you've been listening to the Hour of Slack

1616
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,640
number 1,267.

1617
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:30,980
Oh.

1618
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,560
On this July 25th, 2010,

1619
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,120
which, the rest of you,

1620
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,580
it won't be that date anymore.

1621
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,840
That's what we call time control.

1622
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,380
And if you want to know more about

1623
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,140
the Church of the Subgenius Hour of Slack

1624
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,540
or anything that we've been playing,

1625
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,900
you can look at subgenius.com.

1626
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,160
And in the radio section,

1627
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,280
if you click on the number of a radio show

1628
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,180
that's stored in there,

1629
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,480
you can see the log of everything that was on there.

1630
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,860
Again, that's subgenius.com.

1631
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,220
And if you really...

1632
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,880
For those of you in prison,

1633
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,900
my prisoners out there

1634
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,140
who aren't on the internet,

1635
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,080
that would be post office box.

1636
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,060
What is it now?

1637
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,440
How can I possibly...

1638
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,860
It's been...

1639
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,060
I didn't get very...

1640
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,240
I didn't sleep well last night.

1641
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
I should forget your post office box.

1642
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,640
Was it 181-417?

1643
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,160
Yes.

1644
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,100
181-417.

1645
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,640
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1646
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,600
You see, too many X days,

1647
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,280
too many Starwoods.

1648
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,880
Too many ones and eights.

1649
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,480
Too much slack.

1650
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,020
And...

1651
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,720
Too much crumbly brain.

1652
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,960
Too much is always better.

1653
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,500
Too much spontaneous breast enlargement.

1654
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,140
And...

1655
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,380
So let's see what comes next here.

1656
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,120
Here with my Bob,

1657
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,040
I feel safest of all.

1658
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,920
I can light up my pipe.

1659
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,960
It's the only way to live.

1660
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,880
Praise Bob.

1661
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,520
Here with my Bob,

1662
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,420
I receive lots of slack.

1663
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,480
I can listen to stang

1664
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,400
and keep me stable for a day.

1665
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,280
Praise Bob.

1666
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,140
Here with my Bob,

1667
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,080
where my brain cells break down.

1668
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,980
Will you visit me please,

1669
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,880
If I give you some frappres, Bob

1670
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,500
Here with my Bob

1671
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,460
I just stare at his face

1672
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,240
My brain in deep outer space

1673
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,500
I can feel alone with Bob

1674
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,480
Here, here, here

1675
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,220
dot com

1676
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,620
praise Bob
