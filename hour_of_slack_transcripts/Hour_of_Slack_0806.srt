1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,340
Yes, and praise Bob!

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,140
Hey!

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,080
Time for show, live show for you now!

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,540
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,720
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Of Dallas, Texas?

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,920
Well, it's actually been some time since Gary has been on the show.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,420
Strap in, help. Show's about to take off.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,940
...to about two and a half miles in wind.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:40,940
Bob?

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,080
Oh my God, the pilot's dead!

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,000
He's been dead for over ten years!

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,720
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,720
Power of Slang, sponsored by the church.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
...of the subgenius.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,580
Wow!

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,060
Oh, wow!

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,140
Slang!

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,720
Hey!

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,020
Bob!

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,920
Praise!

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,060
Oh, yes, it's scary on the show again tonight,

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,560
because, as it says in Isaiah 28, 7, 8,

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,380
the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,580
They are swallowed up with wine.

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,720
They're out of the way through strong drink.

28
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,380
They err in vision.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,160
They stumble in judgment.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,980
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness,

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,180
and there is no place clean.

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,800
...who then?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
...who speaks for man.

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,780
I do. I am the spirit of man.

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,920
Bob?

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,880
They shall all drown in lakes of blood.

37
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,200
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,200
Now they will learn why they fear the night.

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,080
Keep me covered, Ma.

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,100
When Captain America throws his mighty shield,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,460
all those who chose to oppose his shield must yield.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,980
If he's led to a fight and a duel is killed,

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,180
then the red and the white and the blue will come through

46
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,520
when Captain America throws his mighty shield.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,300
...he's led to a fight and a duel is killed.

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,820
...he's led to a fight and a duel is killed.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Continue fighting.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,820
Why mess with the enemy in the name of the eagle?

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:18,820


52
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:18,820


53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,180
And he's sent to the moon to conquer manchuria.

54
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:29,860
...he's sent to the moon to conquer manchuria.

55

¶¶

65
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm so worried about the shows on TV that sometimes they want to repeat.

66
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm so worried about what's happening today, you know.

67
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:21,540
And I'm worried about the baggage retrieval system they've got at Heathrow.

68
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:31,060
I'm so worried about my hair falling out and the state of the world today.

69
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:40,380
And I'm so worried about being so full of doubt about everything anyway.

70
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,260
I'm so worried about modern technology.

71
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,540
I'm so worried about...

72
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,320
All the things that they dump in the sea.

73
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,800
I'm so worried about it.

74
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Worried about it.

75
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,020
Worried, worried, worried.

76
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm so worried about everything that can go wrong.

77
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm so worried about whether people like this song.

78
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm so worried.

79
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,460
Worried about this very next verse.

80
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,760
It isn't the best that I've got.

81
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:37,400
And I'm so worried about whether I should go on or whether I should just stop.

82
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm worried about whether I ought to have stopped.

83
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,720
And I'm worried because...

84
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,520
It's a...

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,020
It's a sort of thing I ought to know.

86
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:03,400
And I'm so worried about the baggage retrieval system they've got at Heathrow.

87
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,740
I'm so worried about whether I should have stopped at the end.

88
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm so worried that I'm driving everyone around.

89
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:32,060
I'm worried about the baggages retrieval system they've got at Heathrow.

90
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,180
Crocodile hunter here in the wilds of Afghanistan.

91
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,600
On the trail of the fierce and elusive Osama bin Laden.

92
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,340
The bin Laden is a native of Saudi Arabia.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
But recently migrated to Afghanistan.

94
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,540
Where it caused...

95
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,040
Now under...

96
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,420
Trouble...

97
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,360
upsetting the natural order of things, you know.

98
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,280
Hold on, I think I see one now.

99
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,440
You have to approach the bin laden with extreme caution.

100
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,540
And when you're meant to grab at him,

101
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,100
don't go for the turban.

102
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,440
It'll come right off.

103
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,240
My preferred method is to just grab him by the beard.

104
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Gotcha!

105
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,820
Ha!

106
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,740
Ornery little fellow, ain't he?

107
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,040
And just look at those teeth.

108
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,900
Actually, I think those teeth could use a good brushing.

109
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,420
And I just happen to have a nice wire brush here.

110
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,780
All better now,

111
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,720
except for this one tooth in the front here

112
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,860
that just has to come out.

113
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,500
Fortunately, a good wildlife management professional

114
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,460
always carries a pair of pliers.

115
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,780
Now many people think the only good bin laden's a dead bin laden

116
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,040
and kill him on sight.

117
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,380
But I've found that his behaviour can be modified quite effectively

118
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
with neutering.

119
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,760
And all you need for that is a nice sharp box cutter

120
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,580
to cut off his gads like this.

121
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,500
And then you can safely release him back into the wild,

122
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,760
confident that he'll become docile and surefire.

123
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,760
And don't throw away the gads.

124
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,060
They make a tasty treat when roasted slowly over an open fire

125
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,260
and served up with red, white and blue sauce

126
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,100
just the way you yanks like them.

127
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,460
G'day from our mates,

128
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
and be sure to tune in next time when we go off

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,080
in search of the strange and wily Slam Hussein.

130
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,740
We sell them missiles

131
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
We sell them tanks

132
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,580
We give them credit

133
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,340
You can call up the bank

134
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,500
It's just a business you can pay us

135
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,980
and prove

136
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,260
You'll love these toys

137
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,900
Just go play out your fuse

138
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,920
I've got no pride

139
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,620
Don't care who's boosin' to lick

140
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,820
We act so greedy

141
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,660
Make me sick, sick, sick

142
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,800
So get up, stand up

143
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,560
Out of my way

144
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,960
I wanna talk to the boss right away

145
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Get up, stand up

146
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,820
Who's gonna pay?

147
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,660
I wanna talk to the man right away

148
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,120
We walk the highway

149
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,060
We walk the highway

150
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,160
We walk the highway

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,220
We walk the highway

152
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


153
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


154
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


155
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,480
We walk the highway

156
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,420
Send them in to the front line

157
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,180
And open the door, catch the hill fire

158
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,660
Of hot guns and cold, cold knives

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,340
We walk the highway

160
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,520
Send them in to the front line

161
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,940
And tell them to pipe in the sunshine

162
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,800
Of hot guns and cold, cold knives

163
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,480
We walk the highway

164
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,380
All right

165
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,000
I lose the thread and

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
I drop with wrist

167
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,960
And sometimes dictators need

168
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
The slap on the wrist

169
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,860
I know the Munich just can't afford

170
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,100
We're gonna ascend

171
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,500
The Hades in a hair симul...

172
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,220
Get up, stand up

173
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,640
Now who's gonna pay?

174
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,360
I wanna talk to the boss right away

175
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,560
Get up, stand up, out of my way

176
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,000
Why won't I talk to a man right away?

177
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,520
We want the highway

178
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,380
Putting the world on a deadline

179
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,580
We're hoping we don't taste the shellfire

180
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,100
Of hot guns and cold, cold nights

181
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,680
We want the highway

182
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,480
Putting the world on a deadline

183
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,660
We're catching them back on the prime time

184
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,140
With hot guns and cold, cold nights

185
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,920
Yeah, yeah

186
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,140
Yeah, yeah

187
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,740
Yeah, yeah

188
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,840
Yeah, yeah

189
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah, yeah

190
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah, yeah

191
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,200
Yeah, yeah

192
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Yeah, yeah

193
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,400


194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,560
Yeah, yeah

195
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,560
Yeah, yeah

196
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,260
Yeah, yeah

197
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,300
Yeah, yeah

198
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,660
Yeah, yeah

199
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,760
Yeah, yeah

200
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,500
Get up, stand up

201
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,320
Get up, stand up

202
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,840
Get up, stand up

203
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,080
We want the highway

204
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,740
Sending the men to the front line

205
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,880
We're hoping we back the right side

206
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,460
With hot guns and cold, cold nights

207
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,460


208
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,460


209
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,440
cold at night

210
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,040
We walk the highway

211
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,100
Send them into the front line

212
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,820
Hoping to go catch the hill fire

213
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:34,080
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold, cold, cold at night

214
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,420
Yeah

215
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,420
Oh yeah

216
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,600
We walk the highway

217
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,080
We walk the highway

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,580
If this had been an actual emergency, this station serves the alert tone.

219
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,280
This is your game plan.

220
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,020
We just want schlitz

221
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,360
Yeah, yeah, nothing else comes near

222
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,620
When you're out of schlitz

223
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,120
You're out of schlitz

224
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,640
The shadow

225
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,780
The shadow

226
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,760
What have you to say?

227
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,480
Schlitz

228
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:13,700
Schlitz

229
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,080
Schlitz

230
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,400
Schlitz

231
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,820
Schlitz

232
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,420
've got tomorrow people we're heading to new moat

233
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,000
And if

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,440
there's no other

235
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,940
than my newavour

236
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,340
To mina

237
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,060
yeah

238
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,060
the

239
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,320
they

240
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,200
半

241
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,660
Give me drinks, set the floor

242
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,460
Give your time to you

243
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,640
So it's saving

244
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,540
And you've been a stunt

245
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,840
Swimming through the sea

246
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,540
Let the storm and the tide

247
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,300
They are changing

248
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,720
Writers and critics

249
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,400
Of other stars with you here

250
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,500
Keep your eyes wide

251
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,040
The chance won't come again

252
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,080
Don't speak too soon

253
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,900
For the wheels still in spin

254
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm just telling you

255
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
That it's name is

256
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,700
The loser now

257
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,520
Will be later to win

258
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,980
For the times they are

259
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,300
They're changing

260
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,260
A scientist's promise

261
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,000
Made me speak of all

262
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,760
Not standing alone

263
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,020
Of love and fear

264
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,020


265
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,940
And the heart

266
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,100
He then gets a clue

267
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,860
That he who has stalled

268
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,980
Is a better man

269
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,740
Outside and it's raining

270
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,760
In a suit

271
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,540
The windows rattle your eyes

272
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,980
For the times they are

273
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,180
They're changing

274
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,960
Mothers and mothers

275
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,240
About the land

276
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,120
Of the land

277
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,020
Of the land

278
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


279
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


280
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


281
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


282
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


283
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


284
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


285
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


286
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


287
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,020


288
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,460
Well, they know

289
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:57,460


290
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:57,460


291
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:57,860
But there's just

292
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,380
One who can stay

293
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,200
Something that doesn't

294
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,480
They'll be undefined

295
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,100
The road that is rapid angel

296
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,500
Please can anyone

297
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,860
Look at these Azariahs

298
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,040
Who are turning

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,880
Please just say

300
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:22,880


301
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,020
Please I invite you

302
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,580
It is long and the castle is cast

303
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,940
Slow down, we'll later be fast

304
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,280
As the present now, we'll later be past

305
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,620
The old world is rapidly fading

306
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,900
And the best one never will be to be left

307
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,600
But the dark will never change

308
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,060
And the public will swear out of the schools

309
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,240
The abortionists will have to bear some burden for this

310
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,800
Because God will not let us drop

311
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,540
And we destroy 40 million little innocent babies

312
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,100
To make God mad

313
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,060
I really believe that the patriots

314
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,480
The abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians

315
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle

316
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,140
ACLU, People for the American Way

317
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,200
All of them

318
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,360
Who are trying to secularize America

319
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,960
I am

320
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,960
I really concur

321
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,860
And the problem is we have adopted that agenda

322
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,760
At the highest levels of our government

323
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,380
And so we're responsible for free society

324
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,220
For what the top people do

325
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,320
The top people of the support system

326
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,940
Amen

327
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,100
The ACLU and all the

328
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,980
The American People, the American Way

329
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,440
The OW, etc

330
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
We're totally different

331
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,880
From the Democrats and the Republicans

332
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,640
In all powers of Congress

333
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,420
As they went out on the steps

334
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,520
And called out to God in prayer

335
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,000
And sang God bless America

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
And said let the ACLU be happy

337
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,480
In other words

338
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,260
When the nation is on its knees

339
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,240
The only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do

340
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,840
Is what we ought to be doing

341
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
And all the time

342
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Calling upon God

343
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,380
You are new here

344
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,300
And we don't expect you to believe us

345
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,880
When we tell you how bad we are

346
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,740
It is a flat scary jungle

347
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,840
Bricked with scrub trees and tall grass

348
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,280
Hot and wet in intermittent rain

349
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,620
And strong tropical dragonflies

350
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,060
And Vietcong monsters

351
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,100
You are a long, long way from Port Riley now

352
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,060
And there is no Jersey Cafe in town

353
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,380
On Washington Street

354
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,080
Where you can sit around the counter

355
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,520
Eating on the go

356
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
And sipping coffee without having to be afraid to eat

357
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,200
Or make a go

358
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,720
Like a dink at that restaurant inside on a V-Way's back

359
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,400
You can get killed here

360
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,520
Get out while you are still alive

361
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,380
And before it's too late

362
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,020
Get out while you are still alive

363
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,940
And before it's too late

364
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,500
Get out while you are still alive

365
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,400
And before it's too late

366
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,660
Get out while you are still alive

367
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,080
Amen

368
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,080


369
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,200
sponge

370
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,260
Speed

371
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


372
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


373
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


374
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


375
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


376
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


377
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,260


378
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,200
Well I see fingers

379
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Hands and shades of faces

380
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,240
Reaching up but not quite

381
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,420
Touching a promised land

382
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,920
Hey, what?

383
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,880
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper saying,

384
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,880
Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand.

385
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,800
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,800
Way down in the background, I can see frustrated souls, the city's burning.

388
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,780
And on across the water, babe, I see a weapon sparking out the sting of death.

389
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,220
And up in the clouds,

390
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,440
I imagine UFOs chugging themselves, laughing they sing.

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,520
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess.

392
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,040
Hey!

393
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,320
Hey!

394
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


395
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


396
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


397
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


398
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


399
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


400
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


401
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


402
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


403
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


404
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,480
Hey!

405
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,100
Hey!

406
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,100


407
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,660
Some things in life are bad.

408
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,200
They can really make you mad.

409
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,680
Other things just make you swear and curse.

410
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,360
When you're chewing on life's gristle,

411
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,820
daa, grumble!

412
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,240
Give a whistle!

413
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,900
And this'll help things turn out for the best.

414
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:01,680
Ayyyyyyyyyy!

415
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,640
Ayyyyyyyyyy!

416
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:03,780
Ayyyyyyyy!

417
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:03,780


418
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,320
Always look on the bright side of life

419
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,180
Always look on the light side of life

420
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,100
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten

421
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,220
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing

422
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,140
When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps

423
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,240
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

424
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,240
And always look on the bright side of life

425
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,220
Come on

426
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,200
Always look on the bright side of life

427
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,240
For life is quite absurd, and death's the final word

428
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,200
You must always face the curtain with a bow

429
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,140
Forget about your sin, give the audience a grin

430
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,220
Enjoy the night, and you'll be fine

431
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,220


432
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,000
Enjoy it, it's your last chance, anyhow

433
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,220
So always look on the bright side of death

434
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,220
Just before you draw your terminal breath

435
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,280
Life's a piece of shit when you look at it

436
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,540
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true

437
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,440
You'll see it's all a show

438
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,520
And laughing as you go

439
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,560
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

440
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,460
And always look on the bright side of life

441
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,540
Always look on the bright side of life

442
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,860
Come on, boy, cheer up!

443
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,440
Always look on the bright side of life

444
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,460
Always look on the bright side of life

445
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,600
The brightest things happen at sea, you know

446
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,680
Always look on the bright side of life

447
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,580
And what you gonna lose?

448
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,140
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing

449
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,840
What you lost?

450
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,740
Nothing!

451
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,260
Always look on the bright side of life

452
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,780
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what I say?

453
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,380
Always look on the bright side of life

454
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,660
Cheer up, you old bugger

455
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,900
Not my music quiz

456
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,980
There you are

457
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,880
See?

458
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
It's the end of the film

459
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,640
Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer

460
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,600
Always look on the bright side of life

461
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,060
Someone's gotta live as well, you know

462
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,400
Alright, it's a lot

463
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,460
Always look on the bright side of life

464
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,320
You can charge this man from there in three weeks

465
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,320
You can pick place for this, brother

466
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Always look on the bright side of life

467
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,480
I told you

468
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,780
I said to him

469
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,020
Bernie, I said to him

470
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,660
I never

471
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,960
so I'm expressly gone

472
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,180
But you were only a stele

473
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,260
When I turned the work up tonight

474
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,260


475
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,640
I turned things into no alternates

476
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,820
I started seeing the government

477
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,380
What happened?

478
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,400
What happened?

479
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,380
Somebody set up us the bomb

480
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
We can't say no

481
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,760
What?

482
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,600
What?

483
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,240


484
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
Mainstream

485
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,500
Turn on

486
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,280
It's you

487
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,000
How are you gentlemen?

488
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,680
All your base are belong to us

489
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,080
You are on the way to destruction

490
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,300
What you say?

491
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,980
You have no chance to survive

492
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,240
Make your time

493
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,240
Captain

494
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,040
Take off every dick

495
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,400
You know what you're doing

496
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,860
Music

497
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,180
For great justice

498
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,820
Hey

499
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,340
Hey

500
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,580
Hey

501
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,520
Hey

502
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


503
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


504
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


505
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


506
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


507
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


508
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


509
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


510
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


511
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


512
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


513
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


514
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


515
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


516
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


517
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


518
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


519
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


520
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


521
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


522
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


523
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


524
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


525
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


526
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


527
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


528
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,520


529
00:26:59,540 --> 00:26:59,940
Hey

530
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,660
Hey

531
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:00,660


532
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:00,660


533
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:00,720
Hey

534
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:00,780
Hey

535
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,940
Take off every dick

536
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,380
You know what you're doing

537
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:15,760
Music

538
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,540
For great justice

539
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
Music

540
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:45,280
I just said it

541
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,640
Hey

542
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,380
Hey

543
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,560
Hey

544
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:48,580
Hey

545
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,120
Hey

546
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,080
Hey

547
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,220
Hey

548
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,760
Listen air

549
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:52,820
Hey

550
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,000
Hey

551
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,000


552
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,520
Well I think your life is dead

553
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,080
You are on the way to destruction.

554
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,060
We get signal.

555
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,620
Living is easy with us close.

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,200
Misunderstanding all you see.

557
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,260
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out.

558
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,000
It doesn't matter much to me.

559
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:40,680
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Field.

560
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,160
Nothing is real.

561
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,040
Nothing to get hung about.

562
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,160
I just saw you play show.

563
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,140
I am lucky to have such a good pilot.

564
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,960
Oh, I'm sorry, did I shoot you?

565
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,760
Oh, my gun, it keeps going off.

566
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,320
I must point it the other way.

567
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,200
Oh, I ricocheted.

568
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,260
Oh, I hit you again.

569
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,940
I'm so sorry.

570
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,980
Oh, here, let me, I'll point it at me.

571
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,440
How can you laugh at a time like this?

572
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,260
Well, golly, some days you can't do anything right.

573
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,560
We just want to remind our listeners

574
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,240
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

575
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,240


576
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,240


577
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,860
There's nothing funny about what's going on.

578
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,120
This is just human nature and quite understandable.

579
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,420
However, if we are to find the truth and get down with trash tax,

580
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,140
well, we have to force all these battle lines

581
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,600
and leave what began from peace history.

582
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,020
History is a wartime activity stirring up monsters.

583
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,540
Yes, huge monsters sleeping in the millennial deep

584
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,520
are being stirred up by the wartime activities of man.

585
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,220
That restless man.

586
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,840
Oh, my gun.

587
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,900
Oh, I've got a thing be happening on this ship.

588
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,360
Yes, I'm at peace now.

589
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,460
Did somebody say peace?

590
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,660
We don't want peace, especially if that dirty commie,

591
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,480
Gorby, tries to force it down our throat.

592
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,840
He came up with the idea it must be some sort of trojan war here.

593
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,640
Over here.

594
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,040
Never trust a commie.

595
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,760
Especially if they try talking of peace because you know.

596
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,360
Oh, no.

597
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,940
He starts speaking.

598
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,640
Speaking of peace.

599
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,840
They really have war.

600
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,440
Actually.

601
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,560
Some kind of people are out here now.

602
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,200
I've got to pass me the bandages now, man.

603
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,100
It is in current.

604
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,400
Look, it's a parade, man.

605
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,560
We're late for the parade.

606
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,540
I have never known anyone who would even venture to stick his toe

607
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,340
in its polluted ground.

608
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,980
Ask for fun.

609
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, shut up.

610
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,280
Stay.

611
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,120
I always wanted to do that.

612
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,120
Isn't it fun?

613
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,020
Uh-huh.

614
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,980
You think it's so easy.

615
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,160
Most things want him happy.

616
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,680
Toto.

617
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,480
Here on show.

618
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,120
No, on this show.

619
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,600
This has been Radio Moscow, the freedom-loving people of communist Russia.

620
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,760
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-doo.

621
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,480
I've got another puzzle for you.

622
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,080
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-dee.

623
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,620
If you are wise, you'll listen to me.

624
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,780
Who do you blame when your kid is a

625
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,860
Trap pampered and spoiled like a sign?

626
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,400
I am East.

627
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,660
Cat blaming the kids is a lie and a

628
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,440
Shame.

629
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,300
You know exactly who's to blame.

630
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,160
The mother and the father.

631
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,260
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-dah.

632
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,960
If you're not spoiled, then you will go far.

633
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,480
You will live in happiness, too.

634
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,640
Like me.

635
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,760
Oompa, oompa, doompadee-doo.

636
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:55,860


637
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,880
My special host, Abbott and Costello.

638
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,020
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

639
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,860
You know, Lou and I were thrilled when they asked us to host the Midnight Express special here in Istanbul.

640
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,460
Now, Lou, this is your first trip to Europe, isn't it?

641
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,260
Yes, it is, Buzz.

642
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,800
You like turkey?

643
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,280
Oh, you know me, I love turkey.

644
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,980
I love turkey with stuffing and gravy on the side.

645
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,720
Turkey, turkey, the country.

646
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,320
I wouldn't call it a turkey, Buzz.

647
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,180
We've only been here a couple of minutes.

648
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,920
Oh, cut it out.

649
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,580
Softly, Lou.

650
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,800
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a great show for you tonight.

651
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,040
All right.

652
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,060
All right.

653
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,440
All right.

654
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:25,840
All right.

655
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:25,840


656
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:25,840


657
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:25,840


658
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,600
They're making their big comeback on the show tonight.

659
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,580
So, Lou, why don't you introduce the band?

660
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,000
You want me to introduce the band?

661
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,440
That's right.

662
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,680
All right, I'll introduce the band.

663
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,320
What band?

664
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,260
The band.

665
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,680
What's the name of the band?

666
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,460
I'm telling you, man, the band.

667
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,360
Well, who's the band?

668
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,040
No, no, no.

669
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Who's on next week?

670
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,880
What are you asking me for?

671
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,980
I'm not asking you.

672
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,660
I'm telling you.

673
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,600
Who's on next week?

674
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,860
What do I care who's on next week?

675
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,700
If I'm going to introduce the band tonight, I've got to know their name.

676
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,460
That is their name.

677
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:48,980
That's whose name?

678
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,560
The band.

679
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:49,780
The band.

680
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,560
What's the matter with you?

681
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,180
Look, are you the fellow who booked the band?

682
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,660
That's right.

683
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,340
Well, who's the band?

684
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,560
Who's on next week?

685
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,720
That's what I'm trying to find out.

686
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,780
Well, I'm telling you.

687
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,200
Look, have you signed a contract with the band?

688
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,580
That's right.

689
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,500
Was the band's name on it?

690
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:00,960
Absolutely.

691
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,480
It's no good unless they sign it.

692
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,320
It's no good unless who signed it?

693
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,660
The band.

694
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,480
Well, who signed it?

695
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,740
Who's on next week?

696
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,760
I don't care who's on next week.

697
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,120
I've got to know the name of the band that's on tonight.

698
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,300
Are you listening to me?

699
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,060
The band is on tonight.

700
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,260
Who's on next week?

701
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,960
You follow me?

702
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,380
Yes.

703
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:14,900
No, no.

704
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,660
Yes said no.

705
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,200
They were booked.

706
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,120
Who's booked?

707
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,180
Didn't I just say who's on next week?

708
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,640
Yes.

709
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,260
No, no, no.

710
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,740
They're booked.

711
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,540
Who's booked?

712
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,940
Yes.

713
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,160
Look, let me get this straight.

714
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,260
Yes is booked.

715
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,900
Who's on next week and the band is on tonight?

716
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,860
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said.

717
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,760
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

718
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,600
And frankly, I don't give a darn because this is for the birds.

719
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,680
What did you just say?

720
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,300
I said this is for the birds.

721
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,800
Ah, they broke up long ago.

722
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,680
Now, look, forget the band.

723
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,660
They probably packed up and gotten home by now.

724
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,580
You took so long.

725
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,440
Well, I don't blame them.

726
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,140
A band without a name is certainly not going to go anywhere.

727
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,600
Just introduce John Denver.

728
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,300
John Denver.

729
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,160
Well, at least he's got a name.

730
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,580
He's got a name.

731
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,540
Here's John Denver.

732
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,140
Oh, yes, dear friends.

733
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
It's kind of like the old-timey war shows, isn't it?

734
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:06,220
Just lots of fun and inspirational music to lift us above and away from it all.

735
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,540
That bit just there, the Abbott and Costello parody,

736
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,120
was, I believe, from an old Second City TV bit.

737
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,140
We heard the Oompa song from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

738
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:27,080
Some war from Papa Joe Mama, Dr. Howell, and puzzling evidence on KPFA,

739
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,560
Berkeley, back in 1991.

740
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,600
Strawberry Fields by The Bobs.

741
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,020
All Your Base Are Belong to Us by Net Poet and Xenon.

742
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:46,000
Bright Side of Life, of course, is by Monty Python, as was the Worried song.

743
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,020
Jimi Hendrix did Somewhere Over the Rainbow,

744
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,940
and Star Spangled Banner.

745
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:01,800
That Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson mix rap thing is by Blindfold.

746
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,600
We also heard, of course, Bob Dylan live in New York City from a bootleg in 1991 or so.

747
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,060
The Rolling Stones' High Wire.

748
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,920
This is Devo in the background.

749
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,780
And, friends, coming up will be some ESO Swamp radio clips

750
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,420
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Professor Chaz and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

751
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,600
But first, friends, let's find out about why The Rudy Schwartz Project did this song,

752
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,100
I Married Bob, The Rudy Schwartz Project.

753
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,020
The Rudy Schwartz Project

754
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,020


755
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,280
The Rudy Schwartz Project

756
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,000
The Rudy Schwartz Project

757
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,160
The Rudy Schwartz Project

758
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,140
The Rudy Schwartz Project

759
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,960

00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:58,960


761
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:58,960


762
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:58,960


763
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm married Bob and cloudy April day

764
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,780
I Married Bob, I don't care what they say

765
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,440
Cause he doesn't look so bad when we turn out the lights

766
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,160
I Married Bob

767
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,900
I'm Mary Bob

768
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm Mary Bob

769
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,900
My friends all laughed at me

770
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm Mary Bob

771
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,620
I guess they just can't see

772
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,080
We look stupid when we're dancing

773
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,000
But what the fuck

774
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,020
I'm Mary Bob

775
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm Mary Bob

776
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,080
So what if he leaves open doors of may

777
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:03,040
So what if he makes noises when we fuck

778
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,860
I don't care if he snows

779
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,160
But I'm sleeping on the couch

780
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,900
He doesn't beat me, isn't that easy

781
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,440
I'm Mary Bob

782
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm Mary Bob

783
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,640
I'll love him till I'm grey

784
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm Mary Bob

785
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,100
In love we will stay

786
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,020
Yes, he drools on me when we make fun

787
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,680
But what the fuck

788
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,820
I'm Mary Bob

789
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm Mary Bob

790
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,880
I'm Mary Bob

791
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm Mary Bob

792
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
I'm Mary Bob

793
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm Mary Bob

794
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,980
I'm Mary Bob

795
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,620
So what if he leave out the jar

796
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm Mary Bob

797
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,000


798
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,660
mayonnaise

799
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,260
So what if

800
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,740
he make noises

801
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,440
when we fuck

802
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,860
Fuck!

803
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,240
I don't care if he smell

804
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,080
bad when he's sleeping

805
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,720
on the couch

806
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,400
He do not beat me

807
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,960
Don't that be

808
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,560
enough?

809
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,720
I married that

810
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,220
cloudy

811
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,040
April day

812
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,080
Married

813
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
but in love

814
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,740
we will stay

815
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,460
Till I carve

816
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,660
a blood and maggot

817
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,380
be my rotting flesh

818
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,420
I married

819
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,280
Bob

820
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,880
Bob

821
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:15,880


822
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,420
Bob

823
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,340
Bob

824
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,580
Bob

825
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


826
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


827
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


828
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


829
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


830
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


831
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


832
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


833
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


834
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


835
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


836
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,580


837
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,060
Before the accident

838
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,180
Yeah, before Bob

839
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,440
and the Bobbies

840
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,840
had those names

841
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,360
Before they'd been bobbed

842
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,620
Ouch, man

843
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,540
It hurts just to think about it

844
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,760
Yeah

845
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,900
When I remember back

846
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,160
to when they bobbed me

847
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,720
Yeah

848
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,360
I was just

849
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,780
five minutes old

850
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,820
I'm still sore

851
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,960
Damn

852
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,360
It's rough being a sub-genius

853
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,960
my friends

854
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,660
But it's probably

855
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,600
a hell of a lot easier

856
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,640
than being a genius

857
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:44,980
Yeah

858
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,020
Yeah

859
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,020


860
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,020


861
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,020


862
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,020


863
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,800
Yeah

864
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,380
Oh, no

865
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,500
They're just dumb

866
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,680
Them geniuses

867
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
They're just dumb

868
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,040
I'm gonna join

869
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,360
that sub-gum cult

870
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,920
Cause they

871
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,720
They know how to party

872
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,200
I've seen them pictures

873
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,640
I'm gonna start a

874
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,800
They get vagina

875
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,740
I'm jonesing, baby

876
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,760
No, Bob

877
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,280
You're getting to be

878
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,060
a pretty big fella

879
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,260
Yes, sir

880
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,440
Maybe

881
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,160
this is a good idea

882
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,100
A chance for us

883
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,840
to have a little talk

884
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,640
Why, sure, Dad

885
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,120
What's cooking?

886
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,720
You mind

887
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,620
if I smoke in your room?

888
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,020
Oh, I'm good

889
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,440
I know, Dad

890
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,000
Go ahead

891
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,520
Mm-hmm

892
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,100
Oh, but Dad

893
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,420
That's wrong, isn't it?

894
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:38,800
I mean

895
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,580
No, no

896
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,160
It's not at all wrong

897
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,260
It's not at all wrong

898
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,660
Well, maybe you're ready

899
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,460
for the next break

900
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,200
Oh, shoot, Dad

901
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,900
I'm all ears

902
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,060
Oh, here's a match

903
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,160
Your pipe's going out again

904
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,620
Bob designed that

905
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,740
He designed a great

906
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,060
league of

907
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,060


908
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,640
Look out

909
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,760
It's quite

910
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,260
a chocolate party

911
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,260


912
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,260


913
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,260


914
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,260


915
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,260


916
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,260


917
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,360
Look out

918
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,180
for an

919
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,220
prend sorted

920
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,320
off

921
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,180
off

922
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,180


923
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,420
?

924
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,000
Be

925
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,320
very

926
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,500
soft

927
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,160
here

928
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,000
Really com

929
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,740
Let's shoulder

930
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,200
Real cool, man.

931
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,860
I got a new voice thing.

932
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,200
Vagina Jones, some of her songs uses, she has an artificially adapted voice box.

933
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:36,860
Yeah.

934
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,200
Vagina's got an adapted box.

935
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,780
I do.

936
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,600
That she can switch on and off.

937
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,520
You speak the truth.

938
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,900
Yeah, I've got one too, only mine works for swallowing.

939
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,280
It's called the diverter.

940
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,600
See the little knob on the side of my neck?

941
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,720
Which one?

942
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,260
When I switch that, the food that I eat will go down to the little sack, the sack over here on my side.

943
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,120
See, it's kind of full.

944
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,660
I was at International House of Pancakes earlier.

945
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,480
I ate a whole bunch of fattening food and I didn't want to get fat, so I just diverted it into that bag.

946
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,560
I got a switch that makes mine throb.

947
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,900
Do you mind if I empty my bag?

948
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,480
That's alright.

949
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,060
You want some?

950
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,740
Empty your sack.

951
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,260
You want some?

952
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,380
It's already chewed up, but it's mostly pancakes and syrup, so what's the difference, you know?

953
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,380
You can have some, it's still warm.

954
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,040
I just swallowed it, you know, about half an hour ago.

955
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,460
That's good for later.

956
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,400
Yeah, okay.

957
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,240
You can sit in that.

958
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,140
After the show.

959
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,220
It'll keep your booty warm.

960
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:34,860
Yeah.

961
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Well, for a while.

962
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,740
After a while, it becomes air temperature.

963
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,940
Well, if it's ice cream.

964
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,420
And then go.

965
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:41,760
It's cold.

966
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,420
Oh, it's cold.

967
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,440
You know?

968
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,000
But it warms up.

969
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,860
But I didn't mix, I didn't eat any ice cream because I wanted to eat the pancakes again later when I get really hungry.

970
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,540
Yeah.

971
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,620
I ate something with vitamins in it, too.

972
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,880
I understand those urges.

973
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,500
Yeah.

974
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,280
Eat it again later.

975
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,360
I'll turn the switch and actually eat it to digest it later.

976
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:01,900
Right.

977
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,520
It'll swallow.

978
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,580
After I turn the switch, when I swallow, it'll go straight into my stomach.

979
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,240
What kind of noise does that make?

980
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,080
What, the diverter?

981
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:09,500
Yeah.

982
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Well, you want to hear it?

983
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah.

984
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:11,720
Yeah.

985
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,440
Well, I need something to eat, though.

986
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,540
There's a Dr. Pepper you can eat.

987
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,680
I'm not going to touch that thing.

988
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,320
I don't know where that thing's been.

989
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,740
It's been in Vagina's mouth.

990
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,720
Yeah, that's exactly what I was envisioning.

991
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,520
Vividly.

992
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,660
I could almost, well.

993
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,520
Well.

994
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,600
I shouldn't.

995
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,080
Boom, bop, boom, bop, do-ba-dee-doo.

996
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,620
I've got another puzzle for you.

997
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,160
Boom, bop, boom, bop, do-ba-da-dee.

998
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,660
If you are wise, you'll listen to me.

999
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,100
What do you get from a glut of TV?

1000
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,640
A pain in the neck and an IQ of three.

1001
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,340
Why don't you try simply reading a book?

1002
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,180
Or could you just not bear to look?

1003
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,840
You'll get no, you'll get no, you'll get no, you'll get no, you'll get no commercials.

1004
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,260
Boom, bop, boom, bop.

1005
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,780
Doom, bop, dee, da.

1006
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,820
If you're not greedy, you will go far.

1007
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,520
You will live in happiness too.

1008
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,000
Like the.

1009
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,180
Boom, bop.

1010
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,960
Boom, bop, doom, bop.

1011
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,060
Boom, bop, dee, doom.

1012
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,360
You see enough bad monster movies, you don't have much choice but to become a preacher.

1013
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,840
And that's why we have to watch for these shows.

1014
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,300
Or mad scientists.

1015
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,640
Or mad scientists.

1016
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,220
Or mad scientists.

1017
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,500
Or mad scientists.

1018
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,500


1019
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,500


1020
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,500


1021
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,500


1022
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,740
We prefer to be called differently abled scientists, if you don't mind.

1023
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,200
We prefer to be.

1024
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,420
Different, differently saned.

1025
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,940
Like you wanted to be mad.

1026
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,900
Differently sanitized scientists.

1027
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,220
There wasn't a degree for that.

1028
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,720
Boy, was I mad.

1029
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,300
Oh, you've been very concerned.

1030
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,680
It's that steel plate in his head.

1031
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,380
It glows when the aurora borealis acts up and it sends him radio signals from Duluth, Minnesota.

1032
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,180
It could be that plastic genus that he keeps on his helmet there.

1033
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,160
It's Albert Einstein, I believe.

1034
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,460
That plastic genus or is that, wait a minute.

1035
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,040
It's a genusaurus supremus, I'm afraid.

1036
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,440
Wow.

1037
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,120
With an order of fries on the side.

1038
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:24,580
Yeah.

1039
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,420
The time is right to start your own new religion.

1040
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,360
Think of the seal of the new followers.

1041
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,180
We'll follow you anywhere in the name of RocketBud.

1042
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,820
Oh, yeah.

1043
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,780
Found a new religion and it's same and fortunate.

1044
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,260
The religion of RocketBud.

1045
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:38,940
Been there.

1046
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,700
Final final.

1047
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,440
Been there.

1048
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,200
Done there.

1049
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,600
Done there.

1050
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:41,900
Been there.

1051
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,080
Done there.

1052
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:43,420
Shredded self perspective.

1053
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,800
We will do it there.

1054
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,480
Sure.

1055
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,280
Yeah, I see what you mean now.

1056
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,360
I just thought, you know, RocketBud, what a character.

1057
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,480
What a new emblem for mankind.

1058
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,160
What a new symbol for us, as Bob was in the days before the days.

1059
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,600
It's like VT before Tuesday.

1060
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,120
Those were the days of Bob.

1061
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,400
RocketBud.

1062
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:06,920
RocketBud.

1063
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,880
Son of Bob.

1064
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,220
And now it's like Superman and things happen really neat and fast and everything.

1065
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,960
Look, bullets just bounce off. Maybe this war isn't going to be so bad after all.

1066
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,200
Oh, looky there. What's set up in the sky?

1067
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,720
Is it a bird?

1068
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,900
It is some sort of aircraft.

1069
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,060
It is a plane.

1070
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,540
It is Super USA Man.

1071
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,440
And he does not look too happy.

1072
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,380
Yes, it's Superman.

1073
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,960
Strange visitor to another planet with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.

1074
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:41,840
Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, then steal in his bare hands.

1075
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,440
And who, disguised as Glark Brent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper,

1076
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,720
fights a never-ending battle against truth, justice, and the American way.

1077
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,940
It's an anti-ship missile. It'll be used in the opening.

1078
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,480
I'll just take out the little teeny, teeny, teeny Iraqi Navy.

1079
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,580
Oh, no, Lois, you're not going to scoop me again.

1080
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,680
You're not going to be a fan on this big story.

1081
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,960
And all those way out about 60 mirages.

1082
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,380
Oh, Ken, really? Sometimes I think you're such a win.

1083
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,380
Ha, ha, ha. If she only knew.

1084
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:20,220
Well, Perry, I guess we both have tickets on the steamer to Iraq, the latest trouble spot.

1085
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,000
And I guess the planet is going to be right there with the coverage.

1086
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,220
Ken, I'm worried about sending you over there.

1087
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,340
The fact of the matter is, I think Lois is more of a man for the job.

1088
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,060
But, Mr. White, don't argue with me.

1089
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,560
...and luxuriating in the golden light in San Francisco.

1090
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,420
I still don't see what this is going to do to...

1091
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,960
Maybe I should use my X-rated vision to check up on Lois.

1092
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,120
Oh, no. Jimmy, use your Superman beamer.

1093
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,420
Zee, zee, zee, zee.

1094
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,240
Look, up at the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane.

1095
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:53,740
It's...

1096
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1097
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,200


1098
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,840
Ha, ha, ha. Supernon, so good of you to join us.

1099
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,560
Just in time.

1100
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,480
Hi, for my latest invention.

1101
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,220
Hold on. Let me bare my chest so these bullets can bounce off.

1102
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,740
It won't do you any good, Superman.

1103
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,700
I'm afraid I have my special crypto ray.

1104
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,760
Oh, no.

1105
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,260
Ah!

1106
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:20,920
Blacking out.

1107
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:25,860
Lois must reach switch to cut off kryptonite field.

1108
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,700
It won't do you any good, Superman.

1109
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,260
After all, I thought of everything.

1110
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,480
It's only unconditional coincidence that allowed you to beat me.

1111
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,240
And boil my plans in the past. Ha, ha.

1112
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,460
All right, Luthor. You've got me.

1113
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,020
Good.

1114
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,260
At long last, I have the Man of Steel at my very beckoning.

1115
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,240
First, you must answer to my every whim.

1116
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,600
All right, uh, what are your other demands?

1117
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,380
Got to keep him talking until I can get out of range of this red K.

1118
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,920
First, I want a shrubbery. Yes, a shrubbery. Ha, ha, ha.

1119
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,660
And I want it right here now.

1120
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,060
And it must be of kryptonite red.

1121
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,460
And that's the joke. You have to go to Kryptonite.

1122
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,580
To get it. Ha, ha, ha.

1123
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,880
But krypton doesn't exist except as billions and billions of gigatons of glowish greening rock.

1124
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,860
At last, you see the irony of my plan.

1125
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,680
Ha, ha, ha.

1126
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,480
But the only way I could get to krypton was to fly backwards around the Earth

1127
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,580
until I threw up and found myself back in time on my original home planet.

1128
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,700
Only I know that he knows about the alternative universe.

1129
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,920
And there he can get the krypton that he needs.

1130
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,540
Maybe that was in the vest pocket universe on the square planet of Bizarro, I thought.

1131
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:31,800
Ha, ha, ha.

1132
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,000
When he tries to go to the alternate universe,

1133
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,020
I'll have my special clone follow him.

1134
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,320
Oh, not that tiny deformed imp, Mr. Mixitleplick.

1135
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,960
What? He's reading my thoughts.

1136
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,520
All right, Superman, this time you're indeed a deep poo-poo.

1137
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,540
Ha, ha, ha.

1138
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,600
It's really neat when they do that, you know.

1139
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,220
And then I'm just waiting in the airport and you put a quarter in these TVs and they play these, like, old Superman movies.

1140
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,780
If I can just make sure that my hairpin hits that lever, I think I can deactivate his kryptonite.

1141
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,120
Gee, Miss Lane, do you think that would do any good?

1142
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,640
We've got to try, Jimmy. It's the only thing we've got left.

1143
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,040
You know, I've noticed something about all these bad guys and blowhards.

1144
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,140
They may talk tough, but when you get right down to it, they're just a big cream puff.

1145
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,320
Well, Jimmy, I really hate to ask you to do this, but you think maybe you can go over there and knock him on the chin?

1146
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,260
Oh, you mean I have to do that?

1147
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,200
That's the kind of stuff Superman gets involved in.

1148
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,240
Oh, here he is!

1149
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,940
It must be the alternative universe Superman. He must have beckoned out with them at the Super Race.

1150
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,980
No, I'm one of the super robots who do that.

1151
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:33,980


1152
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,820
I just recently escaped from Clark's closet along with his 80-year collection of skin mags.

1153
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,900
I've been double-crossed!

1154
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,020
This is terrible, but this time I'm going to get even. Just you wait and see, Superman.

1155
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,320
Why am I laughing? This is terrible.

1156
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,240
Oh, boy, it feels great to be out of the range of that red cape.

1157
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,140
How come he does that?

1158
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:00,000
Fortunately, I've got my special Luthor-mobile. It'll fly me out of here quicker than the speed of light.

1159
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,640
Oh, hold on, Lois. I have to see a man about a car.

1160
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,220
What a car!

1161
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,860
Clark Kent, what are you doing here now? You just missed Superman again.

1162
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:27,220
Oh, uh, sorry, Lois. I'm looking for my clothes. They seem to have burned off my body when Superman went over.

1163
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,260
You're never here in time to have helped us. We could have been killed by Lex Luthor.

1164
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,980
Oh, is that who that was? I saw him going by his name.

1165
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,660
He went by like a bat out of, uh, well, pardon my French.

1166
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,240
You're such a wimp, Kent.

1167
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,020
If she only knew.

1168
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,200
They should all drown in lakes of blood.

1169
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,540
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

1170
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,540
Now they will learn why they fear the night.

1171
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,880
You fear the night because you have no barbed light to guide you.

1172
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:11,760
A barbed night light available from the same place where you get this show, friends, which I'm about to tell you that amazing address.

1173
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:22,240
And, uh, we've been hearing some old, old puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell and Papa Joe Mama on KPFA in Berkeley.

1174
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:32,680
Plus some new ESO, Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland with guest Vagina Jones,

1175
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,300
whose music is heard in the background.

1176
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,940
And also, I think, Dr. Legume on there.

1177
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:43,680
And, uh, the, oh, the Sexy Squid Jazz Sex Mix.

1178
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,940
Uh, Smoke to Squid is by Champion Jack Codini.

1179
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:55,600
All addresses available from me, stang at subgenius.com.

1180
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,940
That's www.subgenius.com.

00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,620
Or, got that pencil ready? Post Office Box.

1182
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:10,140

1183
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,800
Uh, that's me.

1184
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,580

1185
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,640
Or P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1186
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:26,700
And, my friend, you better put down that joint or that cigarette and pick up that pipe.

1187
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,820
Uh, cause you ain't got that much time left.

1188
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,960
Think about it. Think about your lung, Dave.

1189
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,940
Think about it and then get paranoid.

1190
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,960
Iron footballs lodged in your thorax.

1191
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,200
How old are you? How much time do you have left?

1192
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,200
73, 45, 68 years.

1193
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,160
Think about it. It's scary, isn't it?

1194
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:45,880
Time is running out.

1195
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,280
There's kids out there just laughing, going,

1196
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,980
those old people, they think they're just afraid of death.

1197
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,000
Ah, yes.

1198
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,180
They're afraid, well, they think they're gonna get lung cancer or something just cause they smoked cigarettes for 45 years.

1199
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,480
Well, that's never gonna happen to me.

1200
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,440
Nothing bad ever happens to me, they say.

1201
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,540
Oh, yeah.

1202
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,600
Until that day when you find Dr. Legume inside your chest.

1203
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,280
Deep in the iron lung.

1204
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,620
Legume in your chest.

1205
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:24,900
You got like a, uh, an iron lung and a, uh, you got a wooden hand too, don't you?

1206
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,800
And a glass eye and a crystal ball.

1207
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,120
Yeah, switch one, you switch.

1208
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,260
You got like a scrap of hair if you take it you just just leave...

1209
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,720
It's like a-

1210
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,880
and a-

1211
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:41,620
But that history's struggle is all in your dec���ion here, that would come in the end just like that.

1212
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,220
I'm gonna sit there and let everyday misery all us.

1213
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,560
With one of your skint penser's aliens in the middle of the yard.

1214
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,960
See, this can 먹

1215
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,600
on policNew

1216
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,780
I'm not nagging.

1217
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,360
That that's the big one.

1218
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,760
E subject daily.

1219
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,460
Rih, I'm...

1220
00:55:59,460 --> 00:55:59,460


1221
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,140
cell in your brain.

1222
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,520
And you've got it now.

1223
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,020
You tuned in.

1224
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,300
You turned

1225
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,500
that dial to this frequency and now

1226
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,540
you've got the Dave

1227
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,860
cell growing

1228
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,600
inside.

1229
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,180
There is a cure though.

1230
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,540
Sure. It's easy.

1231
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,260
And I think you know what it is.

1232
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,380
It's a two-dimensional

1233
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,600
image of a face of a man.

1234
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,560
A smiling man smoking a pipe.

1235
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,420
You know.

1236
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,840
Oh Bob!

1237
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,860
That's the cure for Dave brain kids.

1238
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,880
So file on down

1239
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,740
to the stockyards here.

1240
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,100
File on into the factory.

1241
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,060
Legume heart.

1242
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,380
What's the cure

1243
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,280
for legume heart?

1244
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,760
So when you eat that hamburger

1245
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,360
eat the hell out of it!

1246
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,880
So.

1247
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,120
So.

1248
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,800
Be a simple

1249
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,020
man.

1250
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,460
Kind of man.

1251
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,780
Be a simple

1252
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,040
man.

1253
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,320
Who loves none of this

1254
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,780
things.

1255
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,340
I'm sorry.

1256
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,200
I had to do that.

1257
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,140
I need to go down south.

1258
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,500
You can come to my saucer.

1259
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,320
I want to come to your saucer.

1260
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,700
And decadence

1261
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,740
can come to my saucer.

1262
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,340
Can I come inside your saucer?

1263
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,340
I'm a little man.

1264
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,420
You come inside the trunk of her gremlin?

1265
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:29,960
Ah!

1266
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:30,480
What?

1267
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,780
Back at the saloon

1268
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,840
my tears mix and mildew

1269
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,580
with my drink.

1270
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,700
I can't really

1271
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,580
tell my feet from the

1272
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,640
solace on the floor.

1273
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,680
But as far as I know

1274
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,780
they may even try to

1275
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,400
wrap me in cellophane and sell me.

1276
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,640
Brothers

1277
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,860
help me and don't

1278
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,400
worry about looking at the score.

1279
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,960
Hey yeah hey yeah.

1280
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,760
Bye bye!

1281
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,700
Bye bye!

1282
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
Excuse me.

1283
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,940
you know what I mean.

1284
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,840
We might as well peas up on this topic,

1285
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:26,840


1286
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:26,840


1287
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,860
She was so pretty when she had brown hair.

1288
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,060
I can't remember how to hold her.

1289
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,280
You need to play the old song.

1290
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,580
Where did it go?

1291
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,740
Close your ears.

1292
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,780
You need the old song.

1293
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,720
Slap John.

1294
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,260
Is it?

1295
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,800
And you want to fight the man now.

1296
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:58,780
Mother Earth will swallow you.

1297
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,680
Lay your body down.

1298
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:11,100
Find the cost of freedom.

1299
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,460
Buried in the ground.

1300
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,540
My.

1301
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:26,180
Mother Earth will swallow you.

1302
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:31,660
Lay your body down.

00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,860
My.

1304
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,860
Mother Earth will swallow you.

00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:35,880
Lay your body down.
