1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Dr. Howell is here in the studio with me.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,720
I am with you.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,220
He is with us all.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
Hopefully, Dave will be calling in.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm going to play a little bit.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,660
This will be a bit of a mystery.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,620
Mystery?

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,640
First off...

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:17,880
Music?

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,500
Let's see.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,200
Let's do a proper monster movie background.

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,680
I am seeking information about Bob.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,720
Bob, let us see what is on the radio.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,960
You're listening to PR News.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,000
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,120
Nor that one.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,940
Yes, she is.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,420
Powerful.

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,680
Smart.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,480
So, uh, come on, come on.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,460
You won't believe your eyes.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,960
You've never seen anything like this outside of a circus freak sideshow.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,920
Except at other X-Days and the devotional.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,340
And other performance venues that have featured the Mutant Mountain Boys.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,560
Or other subgenies.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,760
Or other dance systems.

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,120
This is a good dance number, so, come on up.

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,380
You get enough of that frop and it becomes plaid grass after a while.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,100
Let me tell you.

30
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,580
You should try frop salts.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,520
Gives you human munchies.

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,120
That makes good head cheese.

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,520
That makes good head cheese.

34
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,080
That makes good ass taffy.

35
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,080


36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,080


37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,080


38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:18,600
And wanted me to raise you up to Sparrow.

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,540
Yeah, I know we love that.

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,540


41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,760
laughing, having fun, everyone's going to parties, laughing, having fun, everything's

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,560
fucked up and it's all coming down.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:39,720
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song, it takes a worried man to sing a worried song,

44
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,080
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,620
I don't know what's going on in the world these days, I don't know what's going on in

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,260
the world these days, everything's fucked up and it's all coming down.

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:19,260
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around, seems like everyone's got everything

48
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,320
turned around.

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,520
They're all going to parties, laughing, having fun, everything's fucked up and it's all coming down.

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,660
They just don't care about their fellow man.

51
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:33,760
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song, it takes a worried man to sing a worried song,

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,180
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,120
Like an ostrich eating pizza with his head stuck in the sand.

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:09,500
Don't you know it takes a worried man, it takes a worried man to sing a worried song,

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,260
it takes a worried man to sing a worried song, I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.

56
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,860
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.

57
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,940
Always sugar Możicek kelling man.

58
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,360
When you're worried, he may have a organizing heed to your worries.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,360


60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,360


61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,360


62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,360


63
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,420
It makes us sound Straßen dell.

64
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,420


65
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,420


66
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,420


67
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,420


68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,420


69
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,500
Disclaimer.

70
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,700
The mutant mountain boys, and their during Neghatma on this background.

71
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,340
But the mutant mountain boys do not represent the opinions of this station, or any other

72
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,900
station.

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,920
But they do of The subgenius foundation, which is okay.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,420
that doesn't give a shit.

75
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,760
And with that, friends,

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,660
the Hour of Slack is now giving way

77
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,940
to the following show.

78
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,620
Insert show name here.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,060
Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia.

80
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,300
And the biggest change that's going to happen

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
is we'll change seats and headphones.

82
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,760
We might change seatings to...

83
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,000
By the way, this next day was marked by my headphones.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,960
Finally, right?

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,180
I've had these headphones.

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
Oh, nigh on to 100 million years.

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,540
And finally, this very afternoon.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh, that is sad that Reverend Stang's

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,840
mighty headphones broke.

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,740
Well, they sort of work with the cushioning.

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,640
The cushioning part now falls out of both sides.

92
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:43,980
You're not supposed to put on them.

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,740
The cushiony part is held onto my head just by spring.

94
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,960
You shouldn't have been making whoopee with those cushions.

95
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,340
You might want to pause to change discs.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,260
Oh, yeah, yeah.

97
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,820
We're going to change some discs.

98
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,780
We'll be back in just a few minutes.

99
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,400
No, not my discs. Stop.

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,640
I ruptured one.

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
At least something got ruptured this next day.

102
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,780
Well, there's always next year.

103
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,400
From PR News in Washington,

104
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,580
I'm Karen Thria,

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,720
astronauts to the International Space Station,

106
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,220
including Egypt's army chief.

107
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,460
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

108
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,080
has left about two weeks ago

109
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,320
and died this morning.

110
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,280
Yesterday, she met with PR News in Washington.

111
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,380
PR's PR News.

112
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,160
PR News.

113
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,840
PR News.

114
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,340
Gross.

115
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,560
And disgust.

116
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,000
President Obama says he's frustrated

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,260
that this is PR News from Washington.

118
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,060
Now, I make all such stories.

119
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,360
You know, now that the world is ending

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,920
and starvation will be rampant among the survivors,

121
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
I think it's important to let people know

122
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,000
that both cats and dogs have scent glands near the anus.

123
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,160
And when you're skinning and gutting a cat or a dog for dinner,

124
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,520
make sure and remove that scent gland

125
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,680
because that will spoil the meat.

126
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,700
And, of course, you don't want to penetrate the intestines either.

127
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,180
Right.

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,980
You can keep the mud bug vein in there if you want.

129
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,180
I mean, that's up to your own particular taste.

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,420
That's different from mammals.

131
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
There's a lot of things you have to do right

132
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,120
when you're gutting a deer or a rabbit.

133
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,100
There is more than one way to skin a cat.

134
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,460
Right.

135
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,080
And what are they?

136
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
There's a wrong way and a right way.

137
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,560
And the wrong way involves spewing all that scent gland

138
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
all over the meat.

139
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,640
I'm going to be one of the vegans now.

140
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,060
Or the gallbladder.

141
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,260
The gallbladder.

142
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,640
You must be careful not to punch at the gallbladder.

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,840
I would never do that.

144
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,340
Poison the meat.

145
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,080
The gallbladder or the branches.

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,520
Yes, the ureters.

147
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,500
Then there are those urethra-fractic records

148
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,580
which we were playing so recently.

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,040
To understand death,

150
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,920
you must make love to life in the gallbladder.

151
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,780
Yes, some say.

152
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm very confused now.

153
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,200
I was hearing about gallbladders

154
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,960
at the same time airplanes were flying

155
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,480
and I knew that that had something to do with X-Day.

156
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,700
All planes are flying.

157
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
The planes are in the air.

158
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,060
The missiles are in the air.

159
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,500
Hallelujah.

160
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,100
The fighter jets have scrambled.

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
The balloon has gone up.

162
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,580
But soon they will be scrambled like eggs.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,520
Yes.

164
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,340
You mean like us?

165
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,280
Good eggs.

166
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,300
The death rays shall be like whisks.

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,080
Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,980
Hello, you're on the air.

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,320
All shall be scrambled.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,500
This was the theory of the egg-worshipping albuminites.

171
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,880
They are the egg men.

172
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,020
Cuckoo-cuckoo-choo.

173
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,280
We got another caller here.

174
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,800
All right, let's have it.

175
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,040
Oh, man.

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,880
Hello, you're on the air.

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,740
Is it a Google phone or a real phone?

178
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,400
How you guys doing?

179
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:43,660


180
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,780
Welcome on the show.

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Are you there?

182
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,160
Yes, we are here.

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,700
We are here in more ways than one.

184
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,560
Oh, um...

185
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
This is Zane calling from Leviathan.

186
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,660
State short question.

187
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm sorry, this is who?

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,300
Leviathan?

189
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,260
Zane, if you'm calling from Leviathan.

190
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,060
Leviathan.

191
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,740
That sea beast, Leviathan,

192
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,800
which god of all his works created hugest,

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,480
Leviathan.

194
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,760
Swim the ocean stream.

195
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
So he says he is?

196
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,080
Or out.

197
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,300
You believe you are sane.

198
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,760
It is.

199
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:14,920
It is.

200
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,580
But how do you really know?

201
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,900
On the Norway foam.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
If you were not sane, would you know?

203
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,180
The pilot of some small night-shandled skiff

204
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,220
dealing some island.

205
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,020
Do not adjust your headset.

206
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,480
As seaman tells.

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,780
This is how it's supposed to sound.

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,580
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,

209
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
moors by his side,

210
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,140
under the wind,

211
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,800
while night invests the sea.

212
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,200
And wish it more delays.

213
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,220
If I have something super, super big

214
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,240
that might change our realities,

215
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
as we know it.

216
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
My doctrine, I'd have no hell.

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Would, uh...

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,780
I've decided to sit back and...

219
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,220
It's all passive.

220
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,040
It's all...

221
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,160
Not all.

222
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,120
A message.

223
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,720
Almost all.

224
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,120
I can prove that they're almost common.

225
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,720
But not quite.

226
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,340
If not commonest, probably homosexual.

227
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,920
Almost all?

228
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,820
No, all.

229
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,940
Right here in my hand, I have a paper with the names of those individuals.

230
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
Now here's the thing.

231
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,480
Some of them are not common.

232
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Some of them have been together.

233
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,340
Some of them have been living together.

234
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,660
Is there any way you can get a free will?

235
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,780
Some are born to sweet delight.

236
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,120
Hey, let's all talk at once.

237
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,000
It's the man with two voice boxes.

238
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,740
Some are born...

239
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,760
Can you believe this freakish monster?

240
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,240
...to endless night.

241
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,940
The rudest thing on earth.

242
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,980
Hi folks, I'm Garly.

243
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,440
Millpup has reached, researching a guy named Charlie Five Tongues today.

244
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,880
Oh my gosh, is this Bob Bob?

245
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,920
Charlie Pryde, he was a country and western star.

246
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,500
He was a poet...

247
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
Bob will be here soon.

248
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,780
Bob is coming.

249
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,520
Again and again.

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,780
Bob is coming.

251
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,040
Again and again.

252
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,900
Oh my gosh.

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,320
Look in the dictionary, under coming, it says C, Bob Dobbs.

254
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,260
J-R Bob Dobbs.

255
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,980
Uh oh.

256
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,060
Uh oh indeed.

257
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,520
Uh oh, SpaghettiOs.

258
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,660
We've got another call here.

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,180
Everybody talk at once.

260
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,060
You're out of the air.

261
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,580
There's a dead armadillo under me.

262
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,440
All right, Big Johnson.

263
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,520
On Bob's bumper, he hid it far and square.

264
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,500
Where's the dog?

265
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


266
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


267
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


268
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


269
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


270
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


271
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


272
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


273
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


274
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,500


275
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,460
We're here.

276
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,040
We're here.

277
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,880
Big Johnson.

278
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,040
I do not care if he drives by, cause me and old Bob Dobbs, he just don't care.

279
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,040
Whoa, hold on, hold on, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

280
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,580
Everybody hold up.

281
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Everybody hold up.

282
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,220
I believe Big Johnson had something to say about...

283
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,760
Okay, okay.

284
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,460
She was born with...

285
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,180
She was a woman...

286
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,600
I think she's from England or the UK.

287
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,860
No, I haven't.

288
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,780
She's pretty good looking, you know?

289
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,220
It's pretty tragic that she was born with two vaginas.

290
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,740
You said she was born with two vaginas?

291
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,940
Okay, not only was Charlie Five Tongues...

292
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,860
That is a story I've heard.

293
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,620
Charlie Five vaginas or Charlie Four vaginas?

294
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,380
No, just two.

295
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,060
But the odd part is that they were working vaginas.

296
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,720
They had all the reproductive organs to have babies.

297
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,260
So she had two wombs as well and four ovaries.

298
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,480
Two sets of ovaries, all that stuff, two cervix.

299
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Peggy's mother has two wombs.

300
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,260
Sounds like a good breeding stock.

301
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,300
Oh, God!

302
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,600
I've got three penises!

303
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,200
A womb with a view.

304
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,900
I thought I had a chance!

305
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,640
Finally!

306
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,160
Oh, my God!

307
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,120
How would a person have two ovaries if that's twice as many as you'd have to have four?

308
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,720
She actually had to lose her virginity twice.

309
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,040
One in each, you know why.

310
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
Speaking of which, portions of the following...

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
Portions?

312
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,840
Yeah, portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the

313
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,480
audience, which is why we advise listener discretion.

314
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,060
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland

315
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,560
State University.

316
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,980
Take no portions here.

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,460
This is Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

318
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,760
We've got our guests here.

319
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,640
Dr. Howell, Princess Wee Ardo, and Reverend Ivan Stang.

320
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,780
We've got Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the line.

321
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,720
We've got Dr. Zeronius.

322
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,360
We've got Big Johnson, the notorious PNG.

323
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
It's a natural story.

324
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm not making it up.

325
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,220
She refused $1 million to do a porn.

326
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,500
She was offered $1 million to do a...

327
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
She should have offered many vaginas.

328
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,700
If I got one of my peni amputated, maybe I'd have a chance with her.

329
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,660
No, Terry, you're already married.

330
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,160
Sorry.

331
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,100
You're claiming credit for multiple peni now.

332
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,060
Yeah, but I think...

333
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,700
Welcome to the PNG.

334
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:07,740
Welcome to the PNG.

335
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:07,740


336
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:07,740


337
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:07,740


338
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:07,740


339
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,360
You're a party dove.

340
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,740
You've got three, but your wife owns two of them.

341
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,640
I think Princess Wee Ardo is in trouble because this woman has two vaginas.

342
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,140
No, I'm not in trouble.

343
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,940
I think Reverend Ivan Stang will be leaving you for that woman with two vaginas.

344
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
It'll be headlines.

345
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,200
Dr. Reverend Ivan Stang marries woman with two vaginas from the UK.

346
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,480
Well, Ivan Stang, man with three peni, marries woman with two vaginas.

347
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,760
Still leaving her quite satisfied with her friends.

348
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,120
Actually.

349
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,620
She'll have a wife for each penis.

350
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,720
Then a husband for each penis.

351
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,520
For each vagina, for that matter.

352
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,640
There's actually, there's three in the center.

353
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,500
Of what?

354
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,500
Of several rings of them, but I don't know that we're supposed to go into that kind of detail.

355
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,000
With this ring, I thee worship.

356
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,780
Don't be divulging secrets like that.

357
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,340
Come on.

358
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,080
With my body, I thee worship.

359
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,620
And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.

360
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,720
And by the science of Heaton, I pleasure my wife.

361
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
And by the science of Heaton, I pleasure myself daily.

362
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,880
Now, lizards have dual, or hemi-peni, don't they?

363
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,560
They do, but it is essentially one that is divided into two.

364
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,440
And this was also common among the dinosaurids.

365
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,440
Then there is the phallic Ouroboros.

366
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,140
The phallic Ouroboros.

367
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,600
The worm-eating itself.

368
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,540
The pair of phalli that appear to be eating themselves.

369
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,520
More interesting was the necessary sexual differentiation between the two types of the largest sauropods.

370
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,420
How likely is that to happen?

371
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,220
Somebody born with two sets of sexual organs that are the same?

372
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,540
Well, they might be happier than some of us.

373
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,100
Well, I don't know how many times has it happened.

374
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:53,920
Actually, it never happens that they're born with sets of sexual organs from both sexes at once.

375
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,100
Never, ever, ever.

376
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,960
Which bathroom did they use?

377
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,080
Huh?

378
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,420
Which bathroom did they use?

379
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,880
The headgear is ours.

380
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,980
The girl screamed when they saw it.

381
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,660
The hermaphrodite used the boys' room.

382
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,300
Yeah.

383
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,580
See, that's male privilege right there.

384
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,300
I didn't lie. I laughed.

385
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,760
But every privilege carries with it a responsibility.

386
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,300
A responsibility.

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,160
I was like, what the heck is a girl doing in a guy in an immense locker room?

388
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,020
And then somebody whispered to me, she's a hermaphrodite.

389
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
And I'm leaving.

390
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,380
I said, I only thought I heard about that.

391
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,700
You had to run in terror.

392
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,680
I thought I only heard about that stuff in fairy tales.

393
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,740
Are you afraid of hermaphrodites?

394
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:32,820
Hermaphrodite.

395
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,640
With great genitals comes great responsibility.

396
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,640


397
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm acting as if he never read the satirical Gaius Petronius Arbiter.

398
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,580
You know, we are, the world is enriched by all things bizarre.

399
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,020
That's true.

400
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,540
But did you know that the human fetus is actually born a female?

401
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,620
Yes.

402
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,240
And then it becomes a male.

403
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,080
Yes.

404
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Did you know that, Sinister?

405
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,660
I did know that.

406
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,140
But it's not born a female again if it's not.

407
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,680
What's funny is the Y chromosome is shorter than the X chromosome.

408
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,960
It's got less interweaving.

409
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,360
Yeah, but it's like three months older than the person becomes a male at three months.

410
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,020
Likes long walks in the moonlight.

411
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,680
If they're a male, they turn into a male at three months.

412
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,940
As each of the genes express themselves, eventually it runs out of options.

413
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,840
You didn't know that they become a male at three months?

414
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,420
Otherwise, your X chromosome is going to be a female.

415
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,880
I learned that in kindergarten, but go on.

416
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,260
I think embryos look tasty.

417
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,480
They kind of look like shrimp.

418
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,560
So if you have three X's, that means you're going to be a serial killer.

419
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,360
I think that's what they were born to do.

420
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,480
If you're four and you get some ziet

421
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,560
theyev

422
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,920
They held her down and they gave her some drug and the baby came out in like five minutes and was dead.

423
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,520
Wait, what?

424
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,820
They forced an abortion on a woman in China.

425
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,640
They forced it.

426
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,660
They held her down and they shot her up with a needle and the baby came out in five minutes and was dead.

427
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,540
They tried to do that with J.R. Bob Dobbs when he was in the womb, but it backfired.

428
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,000
They couldn't kill him.

429
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,840
They held his mother down in a Kansas cornfield and waited for a tornado to come along.

430
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,060
That was the only thing powerful enough to yank that infant fetus Dobbs out.

431
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,460
Bob's out.

432
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,220
And yet he survived.

433
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,780
Isn't that amazing?

434
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:16,440
Bob is an abortion survivor and that is why abortion is legal in the Church of the Subgenius up until the 15th year.

435
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,140
Because they've got more than a fighting chance.

436
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,080
Because any fetus that gets aborted doesn't deserve to live if it doesn't survive.

437
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,380
Right.

438
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,980
Bob was only a cluster of cells when this happened.

439
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,380
And yet when his mother saw the aborted tiny baby.

440
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,780
She loved him so much that she decided to keep him.

441
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,540
Well, it just gets crazy up in here all over the place.

442
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:50,500
And Wisteria campgrounds getting hit by tornadoes and firestorms and all sorts of earthquakes.

443
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,380
No.

444
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,220
No, just the opposite.

445
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,120
Everything around Wisteria is getting hit.

446
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,480
Honest.

447
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,560
It's the veritable bunker of the situation.

448
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes, Zeronius.

449
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,700
In fact, I've been having...

450
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,940
Of course, I'm going to be driving into this disaster area tomorrow.

451
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:21,020
And the fact is, while Pomeroy and Athens are without power and all the pink cities around there, Cincinnati and Columbus, everything's shut down.

452
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Wisteria still has power and water.

453
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,060
It is as if X-Day...

454
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,120
It's a preview.

455
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,440
It is an X-Day preview to show the rest of the unbelieving world.

456
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:33,640
It's a preview, Ben.

457
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,160
One final...

458
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,940
One final chance offered to them.

459
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,320
It had to stay for the wedding.

460
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,100
Otherwise, it couldn't have had the wedding.

461
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,040
The marriage of Cadmus and Harmony.

462
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,960
Yes.

463
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,560
This holy matrimony between these two fine mutants shall not be aborted.

464
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,940
Certainly not.

465
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,880
Not on our watch.

466
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,120
Why abort acrimony?

467
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,980
If you have multiple organs, you should have multiple organs.

468
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,440
It's an auspicious omen for this day.

469
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,040
For us, gentlemen.

470
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


471
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


472
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


473
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


474
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


475
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


476
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


477
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


478
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,040


479
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,740
It's an oasis of wellness.

480
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,040
That's funny.

481
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,460
I'm used to suspicious omens.

482
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,140
Just can't bust an argumentative animal.

483
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,160
Oh, man.

484
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,800
You're on the air.

485
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,840
I was wondering, that woman with the two vaginas, if she had a theme song, would it be God Save the Queef?

486
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,600
Oh, good God.

487
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,820
That would be fascinating.

488
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,640
Nanny Mae Derendinger.

489
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,660
Isn't that the woman that we're talking about?

490
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,840
Nanny Mae Derendinger?

491
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,340
Yes, she was...

492
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,140
Well, now, this woman really exists or didn't, though.

493
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,700
More than...

494
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,040
More than...

495
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,040


496
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,040


497
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,040


498
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,580
I mean, I haven't.

499
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,980
Did this woman really exist?

500
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,360
And this is a true story.

501
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,800
It's not just a thing going on.

502
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,640
Nanny Mae Derendinger.

503
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,060
Dreams can come true, my friend.

504
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,120
Write the Google words in and read her tale.

505
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,280
The sad story.

506
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,940
Oh, I saw it.

507
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,820
I did see it.

508
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm sorry.

509
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,060
And so you see, nothing human is alien to me.

510
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,460
Ni hil humanum alienum me puto.

511
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,060
I embrace all mutants.

512
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,560
And weirdos.

513
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,720
Fervently and enthusiastically.

514
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,180
They may shave my...

515
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,380
What?

516
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,720
Are you complaining?

517
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,500
There's going to be a lot more.

518
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,200
That was a pardon.

519
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,200
Bracing, sir.

520
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,840
That was not at all invasive.

521
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,340
That was a loving act of spirituality.

522
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,380
And great significance.

523
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,200
Much like licking on that frog stuff.

524
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,200
One doesn't lick it.

525
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,900
Well, you still...

526
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,180
I know.

527
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,320
How many times do I have to say?

528
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,020
It must be squirted, dried, and smoked, all right?

529
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,420
Right.

530
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,360
And then smoked with great...

531
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,080
Poison yourself.

532
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,460
It's not my fault.

533
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm not giving that information out.

534
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,900
I'm taking pains to explain that one does not lick a Colorado river tome.

535
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,560
That's actually the only way I've ever had that.

536
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
And, uh...

537
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,360
But I didn't do the harvesting myself.

538
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,820
How many licks does it take to get to the psychedelic center...

539
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,160
...of a Colorado river?

540
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,360
The psychedelic experience of cardiac arrest.

541
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,700
How many licks does it take you to get to the psychedelic center?

542
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,160
The psychedelic center, that's about two blocks down and on the left.

543
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,580
Hey, your Colorado river toad fell into my Australian cane toad.

544
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,040
Boy, this is good.

545
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,060
And that's how it gets there.

546
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,400
United again at once.

547
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,780
Let's cooperate.

548
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,200
Where do you go when you're toad away?

549
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,800
Let's learn the five C's of cooperation.

550
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,460
Castration.

551
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,400
Conviviality.

552
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,400
Conviviality.

553
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,520
Candiru fish.

554
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,360
Your candiru fish fell into my California condor.

555
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,080
Ouch!

556
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,160
Speaking of the candiru fish...

557
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,520
The candiru condor on the line.

558
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,060
We might as well, since you introduced the subject.

559
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,480
I was told by...

560
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,760
...a little bit more authority than Dr. Pete Goldie...

561
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,480
...that that whole story of the candiru was simply...

562
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,720
...a bull and didn't really exist and there was no such fish...

563
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,360
...and it didn't swim up the human...

564
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,340
I was told that.

565
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,620
And then I found out, no, the story is not only true, not only absolutely true...

566
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,160
...but they had a guy and they made a video, which I watched, of the extraction of this thing...

567
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,100
...and they put a special camera on the end of a...

568
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,300
...flexible catheter-like tube.

569
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't even have one!

570
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,920
They showed, you know, they had to cut the little fish to pieces to extract it...

571
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,220
...because it's backward-pointing gills.

572
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,980
And these things swim in the pond at Wisteria.

573
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,620
They shouldn't be here in the upper...

574
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Supposedly they can't exist except in tropical waters.

575
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,240
But remember, invasive species are moving all over the place as a result of climate change.

576
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,180
Not to mention invasive feces.

577
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,080
In the Amazon, the natives go into the water...

578
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,080


579
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,080


580
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,080


581
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,080
...completely naked except for a special sheath on their peenies.

582
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,780
This sheath is to keep the candiru from worming its way in.

583
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,140
It is the only vertebrated animal that parasitizes on man.

584
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,160
Look it up with the search words...

585
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,000
...vandelia cirrhosa.

586
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,260
The word candiru is of native...

587
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,700
Is cirrhosa spelled like cirrhosis?

588
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,380
Uh, C-I-R-R-H.

589
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,200
The result of a cut-up...

590
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,920
R-O-S-A, I believe.

591
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,240
So there's...

592
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,540
Even if you misspelled it, it would still come up.

593
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,740
It would say, do you mean...

594
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,460
The intertubes are so smart these days.

595
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,180
So I could type in candiru cam.

596
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,900
So Pete Goldie's rational-sounding thing that it was all bullshit...

597
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,780
...was, in fact, proven wrong by this damn video.

598
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,660
The hook was the hook.

599
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,660
And it was a guy who survived the operation.

600
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,740
And he was the one who was peeing and who was invaded by a candiru.

601
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,840
So is it related to the salmon?

602
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,660
Because it swims upstream?

603
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,080
It swims...

604
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,460
It is a vampire.

605
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,060
And it looks for fish also to parasitize anything.

606
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
It follows the current.

607
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,020
The current flowing through the gills of a fish...

608
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,940
...and out from the operculum, the gill cover.

609
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
It swims up that stream.

610
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,420
It fastens its little teeth under the gill cover...

611
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
...and it drains the fish dry.

612
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,860
But it also swims up the stream from a human urethra...

613
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,520
...which its little sensor detects as being the same thing.

614
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,620
If you pee underwater, it cannot, as others have reported...

615
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:31,820
...swim upstream.

616
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,060
If you swim up a pee stream...

617
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,600
...if you're standing at the edge of the water...

618
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,760
...that is pure invention.

619
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,060
Ah, well, you know.

620
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,240
Candiru.

621
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,360
It's all part of nature's plan.

622
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,500
Well, with that cover, it makes you wonder why Noah put him on the ark.

623
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,020
But...

624
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,740
Hey, why'd God make a fish so small you can't eat it?

625
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,620
Yeah, how about that?

626
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,420
Why'd he make a lamprey-like creature...

627
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,560
...that could crawl right up your...

628
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,900
...urethra like that?

629
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,260
Because you've been sinful, kids.

630
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,940
God is a sick, twisted monster.

631
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,940
Well, we know he's somewhat senile after all his eons of...

632
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,220
The mind of God was damaged during the Big Bang.

633
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,760
He's sort of been resting on his laurels for some time.

634
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,080
He no longer directly interferes.

635
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,780
It doesn't matter why.

636
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,640
It matters what next, now that you've got a spiny thing...

637
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,020
...floating in your...

638
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,740
All right.

639
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,240
Here's something more about that.

640
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,320
It is actually being digested by the prairie squid.

641
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,920
Since you are asking.

642
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,700
When the candiru was originally reported, it was thought to be a hoax.

643
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,420
And in 1913, German missionaries in the area found that it did happen.

644
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:54,200
And they treated the candiru going up the penis by immediate amputation...

645
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
...in the missionary hospitals there.

646
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,560
And only later did it determine that the natives know of something...

647
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,580
...which, if they chew...

648
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,640
...will cause the candiru just to drop out.

649
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,940
But, unfortunately, that wasn't the German missionary way of doing things.

650
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,540
This was in some book that I read years and years ago by...

651
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
The missionary position.

652
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,040
...Villy Lay or somebody like that.

653
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,400
Made the missionary position impossible.

654
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,460
Author of Exotic Zoology.

655
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,820
Although he was a German rocketry expert, he also wrote these other books.

656
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,020
He debunked many legends of many fabulous creatures...

657
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,500
...which it would be nice to believe in.

658
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,400
Like the cannibal tree.

659
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,980
That consumes human victims and so forth.

660
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,380
Oh, wow.

661
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,600
Yeah, that one.

662
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,580
I hated to lose the cannibal tree.

663
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,860
How can that be?

664
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,820
I've seen that in that movie, The Lost World.

665
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,600
It just about ate that Indian girl up.

666
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,280
Oh, it's vividly described in the hoaxy accounts.

667
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,940
But weren't gorillas considered to be fabulous creatures?

668
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,500
They were.

669
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,260
They were thought not to be real.

670
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,060
But surely they have been known before.

671
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,180
The word orangutan.

672
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,720
Comes from the Malay term meaning, you know, forest person.

673
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,260
Forest man.

674
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,040
Orangutan.

675
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,540
Yes, forest man.

676
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,080
Now, Dr. Howell, do you happen to know when...

677
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,220
Which is also where the 20 o'clock recording came from.

678
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,960
...the gorilla was positively identified as existing?

679
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,620
No, I don't.

680
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,940
Because I think it was...

681
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,600
You say 1873?

682
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,820
No, I was just kidding.

683
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,000
Well, that would be amusing because it would be so late.

684
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,220
Man, there's some loud...

685
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,280
Somebody's really mad.

686
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,540
...singling a microphone, and it isn't me.

687
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,660
That's erroneous.

688
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,880
I can tell.

689
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,600
He's handling a microphone heavy-handed.

690
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,320
You can tell by the smell.

691
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,780
With sweaty hands.

692
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,760
The reason I ask is...

693
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
Sorry, I fell asleep.

694
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,300
That Zane Grave novel I was reading,

695
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,400
one of the villains was constantly being referred to as gorilla-like.

696
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,400
The heroine kept thinking...

697
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,940
By the characters in the novel?

698
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,080
He's like a gorilla.

699
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,680
And I thought, well, now, wait a minute.

700
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,560
This novel takes...

701
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,120
This novel takes place in the 1870s.

702
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,360
Did they even know what a gorilla was?

703
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,760
I think they'd heard of them.

704
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,920
They hadn't seen them, yeah.

705
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,720
So what expedition, if any, said, hey, that's a gorilla.

706
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,120
That's...

707
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,720
That's...

708
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,880
There's one for sure.

709
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,320
The Greystoke expedition.

710
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,900
The ill-fated Greystoke family expedition.

711
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,380
Well, those...

712
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,380
First of all, those weren't gorillas.

713
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,360
And secondly...

714
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,860
That's not true.

715
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,900
I actually think the expedition to find Dr. Livingstone.

716
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,680
Didn't they make...

717
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:30,880
I presume.

718
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,460
Uh, identifications of gorillas?

719
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,140
A gorilla, I presume?

720
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,800
That had never been seen before.

721
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,320
Now, the great apes that reared Lord Greystoke are not gorillas.

722
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,700
They are a type of apes called...

723
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,720
I knew that.

724
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,280
I'm not ignorant.

725
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,480
Yes, I know.

726
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,460
But just to point this out...

727
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,620
Did you hear about the chimps in the zoo who...

728
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,220
They are apes, but not gorillas.

729
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,860
This one chimpanzee in a zoo actually killed one of the babies in the...

730
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,200
Yes, I read that.

731
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,700
While a crowd watched.

732
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,060
Well, first of all...

733
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:07,520
Well, anybody in a cage is a prisoner and will exhibit pathological behavior we shouldn't blame him or his species for.

734
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,020
Secondly, even in the wild, sometimes the males do kill the infants.

735
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,420
It has been observed in the wild.

736
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,740
In fact, this almost happened to Tarzan when he was adopted by his adoptive ape mother, Kala.

737
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,400
She defended him from a male who wanted to kill him.

738
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,960
And her own baby had been destroyed by such a male.

739
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,940
Well, creed on the case of the...

740
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,860
Creed on the...

741
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:30,960
Creed on the...

742
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,560
No to him.

743
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,200
Absolutely.

744
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,740
Tarzan.

745
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,240
Tarzan.

746
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,880
Yes.

747
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,020
But in the case of the one in the zoo, it was obvious it was making a statement.

748
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,500
They returned the dead baby to the mother.

749
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,780
This is not going to be much of a life for you, son, so...

750
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,800
They kill the offspring of another male.

751
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,620
Right.

752
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,720
Unfortunately, it's part of their genetic strategy.

753
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,780
So their line will continue.

754
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,340
Right.

755
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,680
So their own genes will get the...

756
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,060
I agree.

757
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,000
It seems very selfish.

758
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
Maybe there was something personal going on.

759
00:29:59,760 --> 00:29:59,920
I do the same thing.

760
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,940
I do the same thing.

761
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,980
If it turned out there's a dead cat on the line, I'd probably drown that baby in the well.

762
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,820
Still do it in China.

763
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,800
That's right.

764
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, now they have the ultrasound.

765
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,400
They can really be selective.

766
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,560
And they can tell if it's been somebody with extra organs, too.

767
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,560
And that's next on the list.

768
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,220
So the apes that raised Tarzan have gone extinct, right?

769
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,380
Unless they still exist somewhere in Central Africa.

770
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,180
It would have to be in the Congo Basin because they couldn't possibly exist.

771
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,220
They're not existing anywhere else.

772
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,920
Most of the bush animals are now gone.

773
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,640
That used to be...

774
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,600
Well, you can still get them in restaurants in Paris.

775
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,620
Bush meat.

776
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,760
They are not...

777
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,120
You can get your spiny echidna in finer places in Paris.

778
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,620
Oh, yes.

779
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,600
Well, if you're rich enough, you can order a whooping crane with a side of century plant salad.

780
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,160
But for most of us, it grows more and more difficult to find these exotic animals.

781
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:10,520
And that's why we're here today.

782
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,880
We're here to talk about the

783
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:10,880


784
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:10,960
We're here to talk about the most interesting and most interesting things in the world.

785
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:19,480
I stepped out for a bottle of milk and it turned out to be tacos and beer.

786
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,860
After all, I'm sorry.

787
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,700
I missed out on most of what you guys said for the last two minutes.

788
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,900
Did I make a sound?

789
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,600
We were simply discussing.

790
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:29,800
You said you were making a sound.

791
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,100
We were simply discussing.

792
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,140
You said you were making a sound.

793
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,500
Certain native customs.

794
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,500
Every time you unzip your pants and do that thing, it makes a really loud noise for those of us listening on the phone.

795
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,620
I'm sorry about that.

796
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,400
It's the effect your voices have on me.

797
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,940
Though I may not register the words, I certainly get a certain feeling.

798
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:58,340
You need to unclip the lavalier from your zipper area and put it up by your collar or something that's not being used so much.

799
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,140
I've been donning...

800
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,840
I've been donning a Dremel tool in the place of a zipper handle.

801
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,620
Life is but a Dremel.

802
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,300
That's not what you're hearing.

803
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:13,460
All you listeners who haven't called it yet, get your hands out of your pants and call us at 215-9-0-4-5-6-6-6.

804
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,460
This is a once-a-year opportunity.

805
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
Actually, we'll get to this next week, too.

806
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,560
Get your hands out of your pants and call us at 215-9-0-4-5-6-6-6.

807
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,480
We'll return to the zoo story in a moment.

808
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,120
We'll return to the zoo story in a moment.

809
00:32:44,700 --> 00:33:00,080
We'll return to the zoo story in a moment.

810
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,080
We'll return to the zoo story in a moment.

811
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,100
We'll return to the zoo story in a moment.

812
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:08,020
Some of you may know that Reverend Lucy Van Pelt and I couldn't be here last year because we had a shop.

813
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,660
We have a store now called Used On Due in Weirdsville, and we sell books and records.

814
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,900
I had a girl come into the store the other day, and I got a great big bob in the window of my store.

815
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,500
And this girl comes in, and she goes,

816
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,860
Hey, mister, do you sell those displays that you have in your window?

817
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,860
And I said, What's the display?

818
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,320
I don't have display in the window.

819
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,720
And I'm thinking, Oh, that's right.

820
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,160
I've got Bob on my window.

821
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,060
And I said, Do you know who Bob is?

822
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,520
She goes, No, I don't know who Bob is.

823
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,780
And I said, Well, you know what?

824
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:50,660
You don't have $10,000 to buy this bob head that's in my window.

825
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,580
So buy something else out of my store, and that will help Bob out.

826
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,100
And she said, Well, I don't have $10,000.

827
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,100


828
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,100


829
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,100


830
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,240
And she left, and I was really kind of pissed.

831
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:12,400
It's like, well, we told her to go to subgenius.com, so she may be one of those pinks that go on there and look and not understand what the fuck is going on.

832
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,460
The pinks who are unwilling to pay the price of slack.

833
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,440
The price of slack.

834
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,500
The price of slack.

835
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,620
The price of slack.

836
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,800
The price of slack.

837
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,820
The price of slack.

838
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,660
The price of slack.

839
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,660
The price.

840
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,660
Of Bob.

841
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:30,660


842
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,800
The price of slack.

843
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,820
The price.

844
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,820
Of Bob.

845
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,820
The price.

846
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,740
Of slack.

847
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,900
Oh, I want to let everybody know that there will be probably more.

848
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,080
Let me see what we got.

849
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,540
One, two, three, four, five.

850
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,700
This is the five fisted tails of Connie.

851
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,480
The only way you can get our music is through subgenius.com, and you've got to get a hold of Reverend Ivan Stang to do such.

852
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,240
And I know you want our stuff.

853
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,220
The price of slack.

854
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,180
Because it's really fucking good.

855
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,040
Or bad, if you will.

856
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,780
The price of slack.

857
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,760
The price of slack.

858
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,820
The price of slack.

859
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,840
The price of slack.

860
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,740
The price of slack.

861
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,320
You're going to go to sleep tonight thinking the price of slack.

862
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,260
The price of slack.

863
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,880
You'll wake up in the morning and go, I need more slack.

864
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,920
I need your money, the money, the money of myoi.

865
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,380
I just want to make wine.

866
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,140
I don't have any.

867
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,340
You're more than making founder's money.

868
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,240
I mean, there would be some geek out there.

869
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,240


870
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,720
You just failed, vermong feeling like aorund belle

871
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,540
If, if you were still here, I would say that.

872
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:45,900
You know you're part of the law

873
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:45,900


874
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,460
worry vídeos

875
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
We're just talking about the people that are Shaft over you.

876
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,300
So, proud.

877
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:50,840


878
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm out.

879
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,320
You tripped over your bass.

880
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,940
Yeah, well, it's not mine.

881
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,300
It's Styx, so.

882
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,680
You tripped over Styx bass.

883
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,640
Normally I loop it around because, you know, I know those Amino guys,

884
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,640
and I try not to, you know, they'll end up stepping on something.

885
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,460
Hey, does anybody want to play drums?

886
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,080
I mean, you have to kind of know a little bit about them to get up here and play.

887
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,140
Not like, oh, my God, I wanted to play drums since I was seven.

888
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,860
Actually, we're Styx.

889
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Nobody would buy me a set of drums.

890
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,220
Styx.

891
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,800
We're playing musical fucking chairs is what we're doing.

892
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,420
Thank you for the inspiration for the new song.

893
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,100
The deck chairs of the Titanic.

894
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,420
That's the next song.

895
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,000
That was so last year.

896
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,700
So pull your wallet out of your pants in the Praise Bob Dance.

897
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,740
Yeah.

898
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,120
An epic tale of love and fun.

899
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,400
Fear.

900
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,740
The zoo story.

901
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,960
Hi, I'm Dorothy Baxter from the New Education Foundation.

902
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:05,940
Hi, Dorothy.

903
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,660
And what you've just been listening to is an example of alternative radio

904
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,860
and what it can mean to you and your students.

905
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,280
Today, now more than ever, children need to learn the right things.

906
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

907
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,400
Barbara became Barbara.

908
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,940
Oh, Dorothy.

909
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,640
It's been so long.

910
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,200
Yeah, yeah.

911
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,880
Some things happen along the way, honey.

912
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,300
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,940
What have you learned, Dorothy?

914
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,880
Well, I learned that a sex change operation can affect more than your mammary glands.

915
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,760
It can actually deepen your voice.

916
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,540
It can deepen your perception in many situations.

917
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,760
I happen to have extrasensory perception now.

918
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,140
All that from a little nip and tuck.

919
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,520
What part of his real name was Dorothy?

920
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,040
Tuck and roll job, we call it.

921
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,040
A tuck and roll job.

922
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,280
But it lasted for longer than a week.

923
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,800
Believe me, it was horrible.

924
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,740
It was horrible.

925
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,700
Well, it's the opposite.

926
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,280
We're going to start showing the tuck and roll show on cable.

927
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:02,900
You're on the air.

928
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,900
Hi, I'm Tuck and I'm roll.

929
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,260
No, you're on the air.

930
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,840
That's wrong.

931
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,120
Hold on, rookies.

932
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,780
You are on the air.

933
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,880
No, you are on the air.

934
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,360
No, you are on the air.

935
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,700
We are all on the air.

936
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,120
Hello.

937
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,480
And the rest of you people are.

938
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,700
I was saying you're there too, aren't you?

939
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:27,960
Please.

940
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,100
He's there.

941
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,980
He's right over there, officer.

942
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,540
I'm so happy to hear from you.

943
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,380
You're there.

944
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,240
The one that Margaret gave him.

945
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,540
Whoever that was.

946
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,060
Why did I call him that?

947
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,120
Why not?

948
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,940
I don't remember her that well.

949
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,260
Did she?

950
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Very good show tonight.

951
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,200
Yeah.

952
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,660
Well, we're thanking you for that.

953
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,180
We're trying to be entertaining.

954
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,780
That's the biggest lie.

955
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,720
That is a big old lie.

956
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,580
All right, all right.

957
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,840
Let's keep it in the family.

958
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,500
Dr. Howe's been doing a portrait of Dr. Sinister this whole time.

959
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,320
Yeah, just a nervous affliction that comes over me.

960
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,800
Ever since the hand transplant after that terrible railroad accident.

961
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,840
Is that why you draw all the time?

962
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,620
Uh-oh.

963
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,420
Well, there's something in me that insists that I make these images.

964
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,460
Wouldn't it be cool or really great if a lot of times some of the collars,

965
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,840
the hat, the one they hung.

966
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,060
And they made that sound.

967
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,140
They hung up.

968
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,040
Neat, neat, neat.

969
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,140
But that was actually like happening to them somehow.

970
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,660
Or the room they were in just like starts.

971
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,960
They were actually turning into an electronic pulse.

972
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,080
How do we know that's not happening?

973
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,660
Every beep that they subjected us to, they felt profoundly.

974
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,800
In the abdomen.

975
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,020
In the groins.

976
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,620
In the eyes.

977
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,440
In the labanza.

978
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,640
In the labanza.

979
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,380
In the great labanza.

980
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Yep.

981
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,560
I'm telling you that is a vengeful fantasy.

982
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,800
I need a cause.

983
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,500
We need not be so hostile to those misguided souls.

984
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,600
Zeronis sounded like.

985
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,860
He sounded like he had one of those little lavalier mics clipped to one of his teeth.

986
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,140
So that every time he closed and opened his mouth, that mic would bang against a tooth.

987
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,100
It sounded to me, as I said, it sounded like he was doing break dancing on his chair.

988
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,880
On his microphone.

989
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,040
Talented fella.

990
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,940
But I wonder if this isn't.

991
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,900
And all beside the point since that particular color is no longer on the air with us.

992
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,560
But of course it's beyond the point.

993
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,360
And who gives?

994
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,780
One of them was making disjointed noises.

995
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,420
Another one slobbered all over the microphone.

996
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:49,500
And the best description of that was actually the tooth of the zipper sound.

997
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,160
Baron Von Zipper.

998
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,500
I remember those movies.

999
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,560
But, you know, when we're old.

1000
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,780
You know.

1001
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,120
We're probably going to give away these childish superstitions about supernatural beings that

1002
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,140
comes and pays us for our teeth.

1003
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,560
What?

1004
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,000
Or even cancer.

1005
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,180
No no.

1006
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,300
Not even the tooth fairy.

1007
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,980
Oh, next, you're going to tell me Bob's just beats clip art.

1008
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,800
Well, more than clip art.

1009
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,140
Next you're going to tell me Jesus is just some made up, composite character.

1010
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,060
I wonder if I should spill the beans since we're so close to x day anyway.

1011
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,800
See this bean.

1012
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,460
He has beans.

1013
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,400
the actual model

1014
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,520
for the so-called made-up

1015
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,600
clip art. You're on the radio.

1016
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,400
A living, breathing being.

1017
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,060
Yeah, that's right.

1018
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,120
There's a photograph of the

1019
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,240
Dobbs head, the original Dobbs head.

1020
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,360
It has come to life.

1021
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,060
Yeah, it's...

1022
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,680
Oh, right, oh, right, oh, right.

1023
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,420
I know they don't believe it.

1024
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,160
They don't believe it.

1025
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,520
Too esoteric.

1026
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,020
Too in with the in crowd.

1027
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,480
guitar solo

1028
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,700
From PR News in Washington,

1029
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,440
I'm still the slow, stifling,

1030
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,220
powerful turkey in the largest

1031
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,440
single explosion in South Dakota.

1032
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,340
The state is uncertain.

1033
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,840
PR's bad.

1034
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,160
PR's turkey.

1035
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,920
On Wall Street, 5722-863-1233,

1036
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,180
Bob tells us

1037
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,120
this is PR News.

1038
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,380
Yes?

1039
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,200
Mr. Dobbs purchased

1040
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,420
another radio station.

1041
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Assuming that radio

1042
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,260
would be in his future,

1043
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,200
Dobbs adds yet another laurel to his long list

1044
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,600
of achievements.

1045
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,900
You do take medicine for schizophrenia.

1046
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,440
Hopefully.

1047
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,920
I hadn't heard this country before.

1048
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,240
In the last 20 years of his life,

1049
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,160
the most dynamic

1050
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,060
industrial individual

1051
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,380
with 41 hours

1052
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,080
of tape, as much as

1053
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,160
41 hours of tape,

1054
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,740
secret conversations recorded.

1055
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,300
Therefore, simple mathematics dictated

1056
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,140
that in less than one minute

1057
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,940
of each hour, actually, the show could

1058
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,940
penetrate the record

1059
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,400
population with little effort.

1060
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,600
And so, there were

1061
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,960
the first 20 years.

1062
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,160
Hey, calm down, Jack.

1063
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,060
My head's too big. Wait.

1064
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,940
I've been piping.

1065
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,180
Here, let me close.

1066
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,720
I'll show you back here.

1067
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,760
Oh, here we go.

1068
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,980
The distant future.

1069
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,480
Ah, yes.

1070
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,160
The year 2000.

1071
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,680
The distant future.

1072
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,940
The year 2000.

1073
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,220
The distant future.

1074
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,660
Oh, that's better.

1075
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,620
That was a long way back, Jack.

1076
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:11,840
Smaller now.

1077
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,840
There's no show in there.

1078
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,900
Oh, yeah, I didn't think so.

1079
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,920
Show's over here, Doug.

1080
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,760
Y2K.

1081
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,380
Right here I am.

1082
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,220
We are robots.

1083
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,040
Okay, good.

1084
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,220
Yeah, well, we're the robot versions of ourselves.

1085
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,980
That's the really cool thing I was trying to tell you earlier.

1086
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,700
There is no more.

1087
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah, we don't.

1088
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,180
We're the automatons that just keep going, even though we're robots.

1089
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,180


1090
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,580
Even still, we're the automaton.

1091
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,400
Our bodies have already left for X.

1092
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,460
Yes, for automaton.

1093
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,040
For the other world.

1094
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,360
Yeah.

1095
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,440
For the outer world.

1096
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,060
We already left a long time ago.

1097
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,320
We keep going about this myth of X day.

1098
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,700
But still, it's good.

1099
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,980
Everything is so automated now.

1100
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,920
We actually did leave.

1101
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,080
Still, it's good, right, X day?

1102
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,700
Yeah, we actually, our real, our earthly selves actually did leave in 1998.

1103
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,820
It's just our robot selves that continue on this illusion.

1104
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,080
And here we are.

1105
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,300
And this planet is Mars.

1106
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,780
The humans are dead.

1107
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,460
And this planet is Mars.

1108
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,180
The humans are dead.

1109
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,180


1110
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,180


1111
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,180


1112
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,180


1113
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,180


1114
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,180


1115
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,120
The humans are dead.

1116
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,340
The humans are dead.

1117
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,280
And we're still here.

1118
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,280
But we're just robots.

1119
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:02,720
Except for a person.

1120
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,780
Michael Jackson was a human.

1121
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,420
It's too soon.

1122
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:06,700
Sorry.

1123
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,180
Yeah, they talked about Ali, about Michael Jackson.

1124
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,660
But what about Ali Akbar Khan?

1125
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,060
They look like they're dead.

1126
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,680
They're a boss and girl.

1127
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,880
It has to be done.

1128
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,360
I'll just confirm that they're dead.

1129
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:16,800
Okay.

1130
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,260
So that we can have fun.

1131
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,920
Bubbles is not dead.

1132
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,600
I told you it was dead.

1133
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,140
Dead.

1134
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:27,160
My, but wasn't that a peculiar little excerpt from the puzzling evidence show, KPSA?

1135
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1136
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1137
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1138
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1139
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1140
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1141
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1142
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,160


1143
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,300
Yes, KPSA.

1144
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,080
Stops talking.

1145
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,560
If you go to the podcast of the nào, keep nice bro.

1146
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:43,940
The other little episodes of the show BLPP came out.

1147
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:43,940


1148
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,080
They're放Queen cuatro mil things.

1149
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:44,640
They're top regularúrition.

1150
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,780
And that's what we're going to talk about on Facebook.

1151
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,780
NYX is not doing just that.

1152
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,780
It's something Gzb replacing.

1153
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:52,980
I forgot to tell Coleman, but I know how much his Newton's

1154
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,060
niez can do.

1155
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,080
He's got his novo province program coming up.

1156
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:53,080


1157
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,160
It's going to be a day of his life, his lingκ LGU

1158
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,140
house, 9 canal, yeah es po tah, and his chance to get a female mayor and a woman mayor

1159
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,920
태

1160
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,240
Princess Wee and I left for the big drill.

1161
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,600
Yeah, yay drill.

1162
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,400
And the rest was recorded there at Wisteria Campground on July 4th,

1163
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,260
the day before the world ended.

1164
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,560
The jam band was Several Fisted Tales of Connie with Pisces

1165
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,820
and Reverend Angry Larry singing on the price of slack,

1166
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,940
and I think Reverend Robin Mountain Boy on drums,

1167
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,940
and the instrumental had Dr. Sinister on drums and other things.

1168
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,040
And Reverend Sud Shaw played guitar, and Bishop Stick played bass, I think.

1169
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,220
I'd have to look at the pictures, which I could do on subgenius.com

1170
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,020
by following the events link to the 15X Day photos.

1171
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,160
The music behind me is by Reverend DJ Two Beans,

1172
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,360
and this show, The Hour of Slack, is from the Church of the Subgenius

1173
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,880
at subgenius.com and many other places.

1174
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,920
Subgenius.com.

1175
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,200
Which, by the way, holds the uncensored versions of about a thousand episodes

1176
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:06,640
of Hour of Slack in MP3 form, as well as text logs of all the tracks we play.

1177
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,620
But now let's play a nifty instrumental not recorded at X Day,

1178
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,740
a ditty called Mass Produced, made by the Psychoskeletons.

1179
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,920
So, here we go.

1180
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,620
mashup

1181
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,280
prepare

1182
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,140
to

1183
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,160
die

1184
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,360
THRONE

1185
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:18,380
than

1186
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:18,400
Maurice

1187
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,700
Dia

1188
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:24,920
of Thanks for watching!

1189
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,320
Let's let Jack get a word in here.

1190
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,640
Do you ever wonder if the cowboys from Brookback Mountain ever marched in a Charlie Pride parade?

1191
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,120
Well, you know what pride parade?

1192
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,260
And with that, friends, we'll sign them.

1193
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,540
Beloved country and western entertainer, Charlie Pride.

1194
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,020
Pride. See, there's like the Pride Parade.

1195
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,180
And that's where all the country western singers wear all the, you know, the crazy get-up.

1196
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,360
The more march down the street with big, large haircuts and stuff.

1197
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,160
Nine. Conflation of two non-related things.

1198
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,400
Everyone marched down the street, not a cowboy or country western.

1199
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,180
Artistic synthesis, but not historically valid.

1200
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,780
Rejected.

1201
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,640
Rejected.

1202
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,600
You are obsolete.

1203
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:07,920
I agree.

1204
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:09,680
Obsolete.

1205
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,320
Obsolete.

1206
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,340
Obsolete.

1207
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,060
Bobsolete.

1208
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,800
Call your radio.

1209
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,660
Bobsolete.

1210
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:16,380
That too.

1211
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,860
Bobsolete.

1212
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,900
You're obviously asleep.

1213
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,520
A glim-glam.

1214
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,780
Some little glimpses.

1215
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,120
Well.

1216
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,060
Well, don't let it get you.

1217
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,460
Get the whim-whims.

1218
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,540
Do you have a question for the panel tonight?

1219
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,840
Yes, I do.

1220
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,700
All right.

1221
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,800
Snow Toilet, let's hear it.

1222
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,300
How come you picked up so fast?

1223
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,880
Because I'm just a fast kind of guy.

1224
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,080
Oh, man.

1225
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,560
I was expecting like 20 minutes to take.

1226
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,720
Oh, no.

1227
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,980
Uh-huh.

1228
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,420
Is that the question?

1229
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,800
We'll pick up the line, but you might not be able to get a word in.

1230
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,700
Well, the question for the panel, then, I guess, is why did you pick up so fast?

1231
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,020
Yeah.

1232
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,600
Um, Dr. Howell, why did you pick up so fast?

1233
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:01,160
Well, I like to be quick on the draw, and I often pick up things before other people

1234
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,880
will even put them down.

1235
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:03,960
Yes.

1236
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,180
Hmm.

1237
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,300
I'm Mr. Sinister.

1238
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,400
Yeah, I, I...

1239
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,320
Why did you pick up so fast?

1240
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,620
Well, I...

1241
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:08,900
Oh.

1242
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,400
Well, it's, uh, it's an easy thing to pick up and a hard thing to drop.

1243
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,420
Yeah.

1244
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,000
Don't want to put it down, eh?

1245
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:16,900
Yeah.

1246
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,120
Donny, how about you?

1247
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,120
I know, is it...

1248
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,080
I have a bad habit.

1249
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,680
Oh, yeah.

1250
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,320
Yeah.

1251
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,320
It always does.

1252
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,780
See, you know, Doc, I wanted to bring something up to you, something that happened to me

1253
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,000
today.

1254
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:26,840
Okay.

1255
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,340
I wanted to know if you'd mind this, but I don't know if I'd be able to hear it.

1256
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:29,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1257
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,820
See, now he's making weird noises, too.

1258
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,320
The aliens are interfering with your translation.

1259
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,460
You left the alien on the line.

1260
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,060
Sorry.

1261
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,240
Dad, I'm just getting some alien interference there.

1262
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,100
Got me a telephone call from Jesus.

1263
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,380
Got him on the line.

1264
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,540
Let's hear the big question again.

1265
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,660
De, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de,

1266
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,380
de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de.

1267
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,640
Snow Toilet, what was your question again?

1268
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,340
Hey, hey.

1269
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,700
Hold on one second, one second.

1270
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,500
He needs a second.

1271
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,080
Okay, stop.

1272
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,240
Okay.

1273
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:57,360
All right.

1274
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,640
Okay, stop.

1275
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,360
I'm getting this really strange sound on my phone.

1276
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,160
That's between your ears, Peter.

1277
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,380
Those are the transmissions from the future.

1278
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,340
We control the horizontal.

1279
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:07,660
Yes.

1280
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,340
We control the vertical.

1281
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,660
It sounds like there's calibrations at all.

1282
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,040
Whoa.

1283
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,400
Steve.

1284
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,440
See now that was another disseminated message.

1285
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,620
message, the aliens

1286
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,500
might indeed be involved

1287
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,200
in sabotaging this broadcast.

1288
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:25,960
Sabotage?

1289
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,700
Aliens? You gotta prove it by me.

1290
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,500
You know, we're in

1291
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,700
with the aliens. That's what you guys

1292
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,460
just don't seem to pick up on. I mean, we're

1293
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,760
tight like that with these so-called

1294
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,040
aliens. And a recent poll

1295
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,540
said that they couldn't decide

1296
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,380
whether they wanted Barack Obama

1297
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,680
or Mitt Romney to deal with the

1298
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,480
inevitable alien landing.

1299
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,660
Yes. And here was what I wanted

1300
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,940
to bring up back. Okay.

1301
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,620
Okay. So after work, I went

1302
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,680
up to the cash register, and I

1303
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,540
threw up an iced tea up

1304
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,520
under that shed. It's getting confessional.

1305
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,280
I want a pack of Arbor Lights.

1306
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,420
She says, no.

1307
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,340
I says, why?

1308
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,320
She says, because you need to quit.

1309
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,760
Is that fair?

1310
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,660
That kind of sounds like a pharmacist

1311
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,700
who won't give out birth control.

1312
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
The nanny state.

1313
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,380
Exercise.

1314
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,640
Using her freedom of conscience

1315
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,660
on the job. It's a bit codependent,

1316
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,320
if you ask me.

1317
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,380
I mean,

1318
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,760
one exists because of the illusion of a previous

1319
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,640
one. That's why I can't work in a convenience store.

1320
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,760
Meet the public.

1321
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,480
All right, folks.

1322
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,040
It looks like we're about out of time here.

1323
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,020
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

1324
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,560
Now we're going away.

1325
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,500
Oh, Jesus.

1326
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,420
But we'll be back.

1327
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,620
Yes. Stay tuned.

1328
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,660
We've got a big steaming pile of crap coming down the pike.

1329
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,840
I hope we're not back.

1330
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,580
We'll be broadcasting from Planet X next week.

1331
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:50,920
Yeah.

1332
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,840
Until next time.

1333
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,120
Beware of the saucers.

1334
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,560
Beware.

1335
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,500
Repent.

1336
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,180
The end is here.

1337
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,120
Until then, keep it surreal.

1338
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,240
Wooden nickels.

1339
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,160
You know, the Mutant Mountain Boys,

1340
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,580
this will be their first performance at X-Day,

1341
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,200
but I've seen them at the,

1342
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,380
annual devotionals,

1343
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,520
why, nigh on to every year since

1344
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,840
0-0-0.

1345
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,760
At which time,

1346
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,800
get this,

1347
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,320
the Mutant Mountain Boys were essentially

1348
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,900
the only girls

1349
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,620
at the Devo convention.

1350
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,180
Imagine the energies

1351
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,560
focused on them.

1352
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,020
Well,

1353
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,260
pardon me,

1354
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,300
at any rate, they're not the only

1355
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,260
female yetis here.

1356
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,620
But Tam tiring it out.

1357
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:52,740
근

1358
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,680
This is the third work we have

1359
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,460
oneg sons.

1360
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,800
0-5.

1361
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,160
9.

1362
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,160


1363
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,360
This was one,

1364
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:15,420
The local dent and mine RutENS

1365
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:15,640
foll

1366
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:15,640


1367
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,580
but I miss them.

1368
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,680
DUTY NOW FOR SLACK!

1369
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,100
We got another new one for you.

1370
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,120
We want to hear you singing on this one and you'll know when to come in.

1371
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,480
Praise God.

1372
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,740
You all know what we're talking about.

1373
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,680
Praise Bob.

1374
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,280
Amen.

1375
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,400
20 years of slack and he answered me.

1376
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,980
Praise Bob.

1377
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,820
Amen.

1378
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,800
All my money now Bob's gonna set me free.

1379
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,240
And a little pledge.

1380
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,380
Neath nuclear plan.

1381
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,020
I often screw with friends and bread.

1382
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,020
Old time bull dodder still lives on.

1383
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,140
And please do cause eternal spawn.

1384
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,900
Praise Bob.

1385
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,460
Amen.

1386
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,340
20 years of slack and he answered me.

1387
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,840
Praise Bob.

1388
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,920
Amen.

1389
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,460
All my money now Bob's gonna set me free.

1390
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,900
Go get me wild.

1391
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,080
Soon day long.

1392
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,440
Or give me slingshot.

1393
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,220
And a little pledge.

1394
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,220


1395
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,220


1396
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,220


1397
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,220


1398
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,220


1399
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,940
If I am wrong.

1400
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,200
We'll talk together and get high.

1401
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,660
But happy gathering in the sky.

1402
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,960
Oh joy hallelujah.

1403
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,040
Praise Bob.

1404
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,660
Amen.

1405
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,780
20 years of slack and he answered me.

1406
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,120
Praise Bob.

1407
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,220
Amen.

1408
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,100
All my money now Bob's gonna set me free.

1409
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,200
And a little pledge.

1410
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,200


1411
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,200


1412
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,200


1413
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,200


1414
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,200


1415
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,200


1416
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,600
He set a baby free.

1417
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:44,600


1418
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:44,600


1419
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:44,600


1420
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,560
Oh joy hallelujah.

1421
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,680
Praise Bob.

1422
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,200
Amen.

1423
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,120
He told him I was right.

1424
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,320
20 years of slack and he answered me.

1425
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,740
Oh joy hallelujah.

1426
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,020
Praise Bob.

1427
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,440
Amen.

1428
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:58,540
He found me a new home.

1429
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,300
I said to dog.

1430
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,620
All my money now Bob's gonna set me free.

1431
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,300
I said to dog.

1432
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,580
All my money now Bob's gonna set me free.

1433
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,800
He gonna set me free.

1434
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,660
Let it go.

1435
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,180
Oh joy hallelujah.

1436
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:14,180


1437
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm frozen and contact with Americans outlawed.

1438
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,980
The Turkish government is accusing Syria of PR news over the Mediterranean.

1439
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,840
The Syrian government admitted to it and has apologized.

1440
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,480
It is unknown if they survived.

1441
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,620
President Obama addresses a large Mitt Romney PR spad.

1442
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,660
That's the sound of gunfire.

1443
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,160
Last check on Wall Street, 44.

1444
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,560
But the BBC says you're listening to PR News in Washington, D.C.

1445
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,920
PR News, Washington.

1446
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,200
Iraqi authorities say...

1447
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,920
The U.N. believes a humanitarian crisis is growing.

1448
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,600
Traumatic post-psychological suicide.

1449
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,460
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is urging mental health professionals

1450
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,100
to stop PR news.

1451
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,880
PR News in Washington.

1452
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,040
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1453
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,460
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1454
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,240
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1455
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,280
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1456
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:39,380
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1457
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,320
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1458
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,900
or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1459
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,200
and help out financially as best you can.

1460
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,580
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1461
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,200
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1462
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,140
But some of you still have jobs.

1463
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,520
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1464
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,060
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1465
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,500
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1466
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,300
All we're saying...

1467
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:19,260
is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1468
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,740
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1469
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:37,200
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1470
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,420
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1471
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,300
We'll see you next time.

1472
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:43,300


1473
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:43,300


1474
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:43,300


1475
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,200
