1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,540
Don't be half-saved, don't be half-saved, don't be half-saved.

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,400
We are sneaking

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
In the county jail

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,580
Looking under the door

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,500
To see if the man is there

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,160
Sneaking like little children out of town

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,000
Sneaking

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,960
Sneaking all around the courthouse

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,740
Sneaking

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,260
Sneaking everywhere

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,480
Everything is sneaky up around

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,140
Sneakyville

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,340
Everything you have to do to get to the truth

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,360
Has to be sneaky

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,900
It seems a shame to have to sneak to get to the truth

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,300
To make the truth such an evil dirty old nasty thing

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,200
You gotta sneak to get to the truth

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,460
The truth is coming down

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,320
The truth is in the gas chamber

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,960
The truth has been in your stockyards

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,460
Your stockyards

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,200
Your slaughterhouses

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
The truth has been in your reservations

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,240
Building your railroads

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,500
Emptying your garbage

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,880
The truth has been in your ghettos

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
In your jails

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,420
In your young love

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,540
Not in your courts or your congress

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,660
Where the old set judgment on the young

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,300
What the hell did the old know about the young?

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,460
You put a picture of old George on the dollar table

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:50,460


34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,660
And tell her that he's your father worshiping

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,140
Look at the madness that goes on

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,960
You can't prove anything

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,560
That happened yesterday

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,260
Now is the only thing that's real

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,600
You can try to prove that Columbus sailed on an ocean

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,220
But it's not the same ocean

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,680
It's a different ocean

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,040
Hey and it's a whole new world

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
For you

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,620
And whatever kind of life you got sprinkled in the field of planets

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,460
You know

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,300
And how the only answer is yes

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,020
To everything

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,880
Hey it's a small thing

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,400
But it exists

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,220
And so the answer is yes

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
You know like it's in positive

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,600
You want the prize, tomato?

53
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,060
It's only really a reflection of your heart

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,240
Like a blade of grass is on a big wide hill

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,380
Hey, hey tell me, what's the answer?

56
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,020
You know, I'm a Nixon man

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,800
And say my God

58
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,300
I'm a part of mankind

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,100
For you

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,720
And whatever kind of life you got planted in the field of planets

61
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,560
The field of planets

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,220
That's Charles Manson

63
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Listeners

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
I heard that

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,120
I heard you hearing that

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Well this is your fill-in host

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,520
The Will of Dobbs

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,900
But not just me tonight

69
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,440
There's yet another

70
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm gonna bring his mic up

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,800
I'll let him introduce himself to you

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,480
You're on

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,360
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm Reverend Sterno

75
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Fresh into town

76
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,600
From Little Rock, Arkansas

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,660
Sitting in for Reverend Ivan Stang

78
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,880
Who is even now as we're speaking

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,640
Undergoing the horribly mutilating

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Disfiguring and terribly painful processes

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,460
Known in the Subgenius lexicon as

82
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,760
Accubating and Glanscaping

83
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,080
He's in Dobbstown, Malaysia right now

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,820
Which is why we're doing his show this evening

85
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,560
His third nostril unfortunately healed up

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,620
He had a bad soul-piercing children and we've got to get him back

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:43,620


88
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,440
We've since sacked that particular legion of slacklicites

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,620
Who somehow faked their way into Dobbstown

90
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,240
The blessed environs of that slackful

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,920
Wonderful retirement paradise

92
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,780
For all subgeniuses

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,920
And so think good thoughts for Reverend Stang

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,160
As we attempt to further our endeavors

95
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,360
Smashing the conspiracy as we trailblaze our way through

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
The belly of the beast

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,880
Yeah the belly of the beast

98
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,600
I kind of wanted to

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,480
Ah someone else is here too

100
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,160
We'll put a tape on and perhaps

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,380
Perhaps it could be a surprise guest

102
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,260
Do we dare

103
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,760
Well let's wait and make sure that it's not him and some

104
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,380
Did Bob say he was coming up

105
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,720
Is that a mental eye stench I feel

106
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,180
Wafting up the stairs

107
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,640
Around the corners

108
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,060
Raising our hairs on in

109
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,740
Could it be

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,380
We're going to put a

111
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,260
Alien flesh

112
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,980
Ah I'm ready for it

113
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,580
Well friends this is worth waiting for

114
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,360
If this is who we think it is

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,860
So we're going to go back into the world of tape

116
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,220
For just a brief second and go

117
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,640
Stay tuned

118
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,460
Do stay tuned

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,580
That's an order

120
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,680
You heard him

121
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
Sterno talking to ya

122
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,880
So let's see where we are here

123
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,340
With a tissue

124
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,620
They'll have sex with you

125
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,940
From behind

126
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,180
They'll fill every part of your body

127
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,880
With oysters

128
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,480
Biscuits please

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,540
They will not clean you out

130
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,340
They will not clean you out

131
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,480
No they won't

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,160
No they won't

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
No they won't clean you

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,660
But they will read you

135
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,940
Sure sign of social consciousness

136
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,880
I guess a lot of things start smelling better when a guy grows up

137
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,180
You're free to stay in that place huh

138
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,460
You betray the ocean

139
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,080
The ocean

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,720
The ocean

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,460
The ocean

142
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,420
So our bodies crawl with terror

143
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
The light sun be human

144
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,920
On your feet

145
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,400
On your feet

146
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,580
On your feet

147
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,740
On your feet

148
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:56,740


149
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,760
Pray for you

150
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,400
And they say no I'd rather you wouldn't

151
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I'd rather you wouldn't

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,860
I just

153
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,360
My mother prays for me all the time

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,180
That's alright

155
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,360
But don't ask him that

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,060
Just reach out

157
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,840
Get hold of his hand

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,140
Say I'm gonna have prayer

159
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,520
God bless you Mr. Jones

160
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
And bow your head

161
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,480
And have your heads bowed

162
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,180
Same way with you ladies

163
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,720
Then you pray for him

164
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
I want to have prayer for you Mr. Jones

165
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,560
Bow your head

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,860
Dear Lord I thank you

167
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,740
For this man that wants to go to heaven

168
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,660
Takes a real new man

169
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,140
That wants to go to heaven

170
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,920
Alright ladies

171
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Thank God for you

172
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,180
Lord I'm so glad

173
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,360
Now I pray you'll reveal to them

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,740
The sweetness and the glorious of heaven

175
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
That heaven is sweet and warm

176
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,060
And that you'll take those hearts

177
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,100
And hold them in your arms

178
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,920
Yes in the heart of the unimposing

179
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,800
Metro puke

180
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,740
That is Dallas, Texas

181
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,500
There lies the key to your salvation

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,120
Yes people

183
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,540
RRR

184
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,460
A panacea looms not

185
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,740
Within the environs of my innermost bob self

186
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,340
Yea, tis fallacious fancy

187
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,240
To assume unrighteous asylum

188
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Lurks beside the piteous

189
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,740
And frightfully insignificant

190
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,580
Deeds of an unbeliever

191
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,200
Your salvation lies not towards

192
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,100
Far-reaching unattainable ather tomes

193
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,040
Or childish and Santa tales

194
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,420
No

195
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,440
But with and by the lacerated logic

196
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,160
Of J.R. Bob Dobbs

197
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,280
Try to find a comfortable place

198
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,140
Oh

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
If I don't enjoy it

200
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't want you to enjoy it either

201
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,460
Every time I reach this point I get

202
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,500
Well I don't know I get

203
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,720
All choked up

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,620
Now I can't help it

205
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,500
Make her front look

206
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,500


207
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,940
You shocked in what you can wait

208
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,580
For Ken Abraham

209
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,160
Oyaya'yaya

210
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,800
Oyaya'yaya

211
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,060
Speaking a foreign language.

212
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,460
Well, we'll just talk with Dr. Philo Ulysses Drummond for just a minute.

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
Dr. Drummond, what brings you to...

214
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,720
Oh, Reverend Stang is on the phone.

215
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,260
I'll be jiggered.

216
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,640
He's really in the back room.

217
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,480
You got him tied up back there, right?

218
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't you have him...

219
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,580
Stang is really under wraps, I think, isn't he?

220
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,040
Yeah.

221
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,880
What about Spam?

222
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,640
I wish we could put him on the phone.

223
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,700
Is that Reverend Stans?

224
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,940
Spam.

225
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,160
Spam.

226
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,160


227
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,100
They're Spams.

228
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,880
Can you put him on the line?

229
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,820
Can we bring in Reverend Stans?

230
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,560
No.

231
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,900
No, we don't know how to do that anymore.

232
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
But I'm sure we can...

233
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,780
What were we talking about?

234
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,640
Talking about Spams?

235
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,700
Spams.

236
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
We were talking about Spams.

237
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,860
Well, the other day...

238
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,200
And this is a sad story, children.

239
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,960
You're Stans?

240
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,860
A little girl walked up to me.

241
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,240
I don't believe you.

242
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,960
Said, Reverend Sterno,

243
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,840
in my school, they teach us all about

244
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,180
dope and Jesus and communism,

245
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,140
but they haven't said anything about Bob Dobbs.

246
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,220
Children, that's a serious indictment against this nation.

247
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,900
That's just further evidence that it's a sick and perverse world.

248
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,940
I felt so sorry for that little girl.

249
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,640
She's trying to claw her way blindly

250
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,960
through the festering masses of normalcy.

251
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,540
She's trying to do it without Dobbs.

252
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,520
It just makes me sick.

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
I just can't believe it.

254
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,520
What?

255
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Wait, try that again.

256
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,780
Me too.

257
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,740
But seriously, the primary difference between the subgenius race and the human race, of course,

258
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,680
as almost everyone knows, is the fact that we are the only ones with the right to do what we want.

259
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


260
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


261
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


262
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,020
We're the only ones with the intellectual capacity to realize that we're living in a world without slack.

263
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,660
We're living in a world without Bob.

264
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,580
We're living in a world sorely beset by demons of its own creation.

265
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:29,500
And blessed, yea blessed, are those few yetison-blooded subgeniuses

266
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,200
who realize and recognize

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
and can stand for the truth.

268
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,660
and can stand for the truth.

269
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,800
They stand full front saluting the truth.

270
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,960
The fact that there are only two.

271
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,160
Gotta go, Mom's here.

272
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,260
The fact that there are only two who really know.

273
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,540
Bob and Oboe.

274
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,700
Anti-Bob.

275
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,020
Oboe's a liar.

276
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,380
Oboe's a deceiver.

277
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,740
Oboe will lie and deceive.

278
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,860
I think you're just spouting off the top of your head.

279
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,320
Oboe will use your lime jello

280
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,060
for a sexual partner.

281
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,100
Oboe will open a can of Spam in your living room

282
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,240
and submerge his various and sundry prehensile members

283
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,400
deep within the throbbing gristle of that

284
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,660
grunt.

285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,060
And it spews off the top, kinda skittering along across the top of the water like a

286
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,240
like skipping a rock.

287
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,240
Wearing not a poop dog hat.

288
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,580
He didn't wear the poop dog hat.

289
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,680
Now you're talking about something I can identify with.

290
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Fecal canine headgear.

291
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,860
Available now at the Church of the Subgenius.

292
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,540
1995, Post Office Box 14306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

293
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,420
Buy two this week, a special two for one.

294
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,460
And get a free Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer Disco Soccer Kit.

295
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,820
Available only from the Church of the Subgenius.

296
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,700
And every penny goes for the resurrection of Bob himself.

297
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,440
In Dobstown.

298
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,820
Thank y'all.

299
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,120
It is hard.

300
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,880
It's a task that we've set ourselves to.

301
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,600
But we don't know how long it'll take.

302
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
It could be a year.

303
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,800
It could be 20 years.

304
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,800
It could be 30 minutes.

305
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
It could be five seconds.

306
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,620
It could be five seconds.

307
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,740
It could be a billion years.

308
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,940
It could be a nanosecond.

309
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,120
It could be three megaeons.

310
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,000
We might have to go back to the beginning of time to get enough time.

311
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,620
Or even before.

312
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,840
Or even before.

313
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,260
And you may scoff.

314
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,620
To get enough time it'll take to do it.

315
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,560
And you may scoff.

316
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
But it's a job that we've shouldered.

317
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:25,860
And we'll take.

318
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,400
But you won't be scoffing for long.

319
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,000
You won't be sorry.

320
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,900
You've only got about six years of scoffing left you.

321
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,800
You pink boys.

322
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,180
You butt-lipped pinks.

323
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,740
Maybe not even a full six years.

324
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,460
Maybe only like five and a half years.

325
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
You'll be a five and three quarter.

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
You'll be lucky.

327
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,460
Your time's running out right now.

328
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,200
You'll be lucky.

329
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,520
It's getting short.

330
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,060
If you don't get that checkbook out.

331
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,700
Look at your watch.

332
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,400
What time's your watch saved?

333
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,260
And send $20 to the Church of the Subgenius.

334
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,440
Mark your time now.

335
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,640
$20 for salvation.

336
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,480
Mark your time.

337
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,720
That's all it costs children.

338
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,900
Because your scoffers won't be scoffing.

339
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,660
Too much longer.

340
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,320
And we're the only church that guarantees salvation or triple your money back.

341
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,240
Yeah, your scoffers might want to scoff.

342
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,940
That's $20 in my pocket.

343
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,080
You'll be walking around in hell with $60.

344
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,680
You don't even know what scoff means.

345
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,740
And we'll be laughing.

346
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,940
You don't even look at scoff.

347
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,960
We'll be laughing at you.

348
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,120
Just get your dictionary out right now and look up the word scoff.

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
Can you say dictionary on the...

350
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,700
If you can even spell it.

351
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,100
Can you say dictionary on the...

352
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,520
Anything.

353
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
The kind with the spelled C.

354
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,260
Can you say get your dictionary out.

355
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,860
Get your dictionary out.

356
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,080
If you know what we mean.

357
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,820
And put it on the radio right now.

358
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,980
And look up the word scoff.

359
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,620
If you know how to spell it.

360
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,740
Or just whip your dictionary out and write scoff on it if it's not there.

361
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:27,920
Probably.

362
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,040
Put it right on the radio.

363
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,400
Or whatever appended member might be ailing you children.

364
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:41,420
And Philo and Sterno and Willa Dobbs will heal it through the power of transmutated

365
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,940
chain link subgenius public radio.

366
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,260
Is that Stan's again?

367
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,240
Spams is calling us again.

368
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,700
Yeah, you know, unbeknownst to our listeners now that I know that I'm safely off the air,

369
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,880
we've got Stan in the back room tied up.

370
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,980
He's back there.

371
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,740
We've got him hog tied like the hog that he is.

372
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,880
He's tied up with the members of the California subgeniuses.

373
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,960
Yeah, him and those pinky winky boys.

374
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,240
Of course just to tie Stan's...

375
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,280
Just to tie his hands up we had to...

376
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,340
Woke up hard.

377
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,300
We had to de-member about 35 California subgeniuses.

378
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,020
No, they don't like that get up with the diamond hard blue vayner word of Bob.

379
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,620
They won't go for it.

380
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,100
No way.

381
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,760
They're afraid of the squirting Bob.

382
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,640
Back to the pamphlet word of Bob.

383
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,700
They're afraid of the squirting universe.

384
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,640
That's why we're heading to Panama.

385
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,380
They're a bunch of oozing sissies is what they are.

386
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,300
They're just tied up right now.

387
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,120
They don't even know where they're coming from.

388
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,280
Tell you the truth, they probably like being tied up together like this.

389
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,580
They probably...

390
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,480
They're probably watching their own heads back there.

391
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
You can't hear them crying like we could a little while ago.

392
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,760
They're just crying like babies.

393
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,860
They're little cranky golfers.

394
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,520
Just like little puppy dogs back there just crying.

395
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
They're little cranky golfers.

396
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,300
Just crying like puppy dogs.

397
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,400
But I'll tell you, it's only about six more years of scoffing in your pockets, pink boy,

398
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,140
if you don't send $20 to the Church of the Subgenius.

399
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,800
Ska, S-K-O-F.

400
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,580
There you go.

401
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,860
When the exes land July 5th, 1998, as it was so ordained in the pre-scriptures,

402
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,760
if your name is not in the book of Gabrogfran, you gon' fry.

403
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,540
That's second ecclesiastiches.

404
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,800
That's bleeding head Colossians 4, 1398.

405
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,280
For lo, the veil of Moab was lifted.

406
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,580
In the valley of Moab.

407
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,040
In the 80 million lambs of Moab and the 80 million tribes of Moab.

408
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,180
The Moabites themselves.

409
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,160
Who bit that Moab?

410
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,460
Get that Moab out of your mouth, boy.

411
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,680
We got some lambs to slaughter here.

412
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,120
First you whip your dictionary out and then you put your Moab in your mouth.

413
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,040
Put your Moab on it.

414
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,200
Come on.

415
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,160
And then you put those lambs on the altar and you just slit them a little bit right there underneath the throat.

416
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,760
Just kind of nick them.

417
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:48,800
Just nick them.

418
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,540
Just stick them in the licking.

419
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,040
Just a little bit of nicking comes out.

420
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,400
Yee-haw.

421
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,220
And then you put that in that gla-cene.

422
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,600
The blood.

423
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,800
The blood.

424
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
But it's the blood that cleanses.

425
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,660
It's the blood that makes things right.

426
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,320
It's the blood that provides the ultimate salvation to which you have attached yourself all these years.

427
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,340
It's the blood that we make that special antidote for the, you know, those bats that get on your face.

428
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,820
You know what they do to your face.

429
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,400
Special bats.

430
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,160
Just put your dictionary away now, children, and we'll tell you about the bats.

431
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,020
That book is kind of heavy.

432
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,500
It's a heavy book.

433
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,380
The frontal cerebral fornicating bats.

434
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,580
Those ones that attach themselves to your face.

435
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,040
And the ejaculate.

436
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,640
The ejaculate.

437
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,460
But we won't talk about them.

438
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,640
No.

439
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,360
No, we can't.

440
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,040
We can't.

441
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,620
We can't talk about them.

442
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,480
We can't get too specific about what those bats do.

443
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,380
You may as well just stick your finger in a light socket.

444
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,860
You might as well.

445
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:37,860


446
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:50,640
But the Church of the Subgenius is the only way, provides the only proscribed and tested by time instructions for de-beaking the prairie squid, which is all the practices.

447
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,660
That you'll need, children.

448
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,600
Yeah, I talked to my...

449
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,300
In order not to get...

450
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,760
My step-neighbor-in-law...

451
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:55,880
By those bats.

452
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,160
Porky was telling me that story one time about Moab.

453
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,840
And he was...

454
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,100
He was...

455
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,880
Well, I hate to say this, but Porky didn't say no.

456
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,740
He forgot to say no.

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,920
So he was not in the state of mind he might have been.

458
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,560
And he hadn't launched ahead in years.

459
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,660
He hadn't launched ahead in oh Lord knows how long.

460
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,060
He'd never been in a doctor band.

461
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:27,020
Yeah, he'd never realized the glories of doctor music and basked accordingly.

462
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,260
He'd never...

463
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,240
His own...

464
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,340
Ever.

465
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
Boy, Willa Dobbs was quick on that...

466
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Oh, sorry.

467
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,620
...button there.

468
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,900
I knew who was coming down tonight.

469
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,520
Well, yeah, Porky and me, we used to go downtown together in a pickup truck with Jones.

470
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,160
Jones was in the back then.

471
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,500
He hadn't learned how to drive yet.

472
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,360
He was in the back.

473
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,820
That Pobucker.

474
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,580
That Pobucker.

475
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,040
Is he still there?

476
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,860
What up, Pobucker?

477
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,220
That Jones was such a Pobucker.

478
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,500
I'll tell you what, he was wearing them Johnson overalls.

479
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,080
He was wearing Johnson overalls the other day when I seen him and he whipped a Trevino head right out of his pocket.

480
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,480
Launched it there in the middle of the street.

481
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,480
I couldn't believe it.

482
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,360
Right next to his dictionary.

483
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:07,800
Right.

484
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,380
It was on his dictionary right next door to the pump and stump and he just didn't know what to do with it at all.

485
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,620
He thought it was a Palmer head.

486
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,740
He thought that he had the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

487
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:26,000
With a D-Beak Prairie Squid extruding from the stump, soiling his britches.

488
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,880
Soiling them.

489
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
It just made me.

490
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,260
Hoo boy, he stunk like he was bleeding.

491
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,060
I shook my head and walked away.

492
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
That's what I thought about it.

493
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,320
I just pinched my nose and hoo boy.

494
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,900
I went directly the other way.

495
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,120


496
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,280
When I see somebody.

497
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,880
When I see something like that I always go hoo boy.

498
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,160
When I see a Pobucker launching a Trevino head next to the pump and stump in the middle of the street.

499
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,720
Now while you're over there in the estes looking at the street.

500
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,340
Looking up scoff.

501
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,340
Just whip back over to the W's and look up hoo boy.

502
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,940
It's from the middle French.

503
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,300
Hoo bus boy-us.

504
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,300
It's derived actually from the Gaelic.

505
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,260
The pre-Gaelic.

506
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,680
You have to go back before.

507
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,500
Long, long time before the original muh muh.

508
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,460
And then eventually it evolved down into the hoo boy that we know today.

509
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,700
It's amazing the way those linguistic twists and diversions and tangents.

510
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,080
The way they take off like that.

511
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,940
You gotta go back a long time.

512
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,140
There are no original origins.

513
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,460
Lemurian, Murian or Atlantean.

514
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah.

515
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,700
No connections whatsoever.

516
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,520
The mutex wouldn't imply that words would progress in such an unorderly fashion.

517
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,860
Mashed fashion mashing.

518
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,920
Kind of mashed up in a fashion sort of.

519
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,140
He was really mashed up.

520
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,080
It was a fashionable mashing though.

521
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,380
And it was a splendid buggery that they endured.

522
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,700
I believe the buggery took place in the conservatory.

523
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,700
Or was it the laboratory?

524
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,540
It was an extraordinary buggery.

525
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,540
The way they took place back there in the lavatory?

526
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,220
It wasn't in the lavatory.

527
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,700
I thought it was in the conservatory.

528
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,620
But that buggery was the most extraordinary buggery I'd ever experienced.

529
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,140
They scoffed.

530
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,900
Oh they scoffed.

531
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,540
It was it.

532
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,040
Hoo boy, little did they know.

533
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,860
I believe it was in the aviary.

534
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,000
I've got pictures.

535
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,580
I've got pictures of that.

536
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,880
It was a conspiratorial buggery.

537
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,940
Which was brought about by lack of faith in Bob Children.

538
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,900
And there's a motto somewhere around here.

539
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,440
There's a parable involved.

540
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,500
Ah, the E section of the voluminous K-N-O-N library.

541
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,140
There's one volume there.

542
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,740
No, that's the F section.

543
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,680
The E area?

544
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,420
But you were saying.

545
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Focus on the E.

546
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,320
Focus on the E.

547
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,520
The maid's going to be here in about ten minutes.

548
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,100
And she isn't going to like this mess.

549
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,560
I'll tell you.

550
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,020
You need to.

551
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,140
What's the deal here?

552
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,880
How come this stuff is out here?

553
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,520
I mean, everything's kind of messed up.

554
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,940
But follow that little girl.

555
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,820
She didn't know anything about Bob.

556
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,020
She was begging me to tell her about Bob.

557
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,080
She paid me $20 for one word of Bob.

558
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,280
She gave me her.

559
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,700
I gave her.

560
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,600
I sold her about a dictionary for it.

561
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,240
She gave me my first dictionary.

562
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,160
She was only 13 and I was 83.

563
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,920
Yeah, I remember that.

564
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,720
That's time control.

565
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,420
Yeah, yeah.

566
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,040
Back when we went back early, way back in time.

567
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,120
We were back there a couple of, just a couple of amoebas flipping our flagellas around.

568
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,560
And next thing you know, we was progressing through time.

569
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,320
Well, she ended up in a freezer bag.

570
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,720
If I recall my course of events correctly, I believe that it was dinner time in Dobbs Town.

571
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,360
Yep, dinner time.

572
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,820
Wasn't it?

573
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,240
Or maybe supper time.

574
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,640
I don't know.

575
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,920
It was supper time in Dobbs Town.

576
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Dinner, supper.

577
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,740
And she'd suffer a serious freezer burn.

578
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
And it was all because of her lack of faith in Bob.

579
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,340
She wouldn't put her soul in Bob's hands.

580
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,820
She couldn't bring herself to face the facts.

581
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,900
Then after lunch we have lupper, which is kind of like a brunch between dinner and, I mean, supper and lunch.

582
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,960
She had problems.

583
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
And then you have sinner.

584
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,780
With a bit of the subgenius dogma.

585
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,620
She had problems with slurs.

586
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,040
And sinner is not the sinner you would think of.

587
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,040
It's actually a meal that we have between dinner and supper.

588
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,700
Sinner on rye.

589
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,260
Supper.

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,480
Sinner on rye.

591
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,720
And then we have pupper at night.

592
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,300
Late at night we have puffer.

593
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,380
And then we sin.

594
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,100
Then we just sin.

595
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
We just sit there and sin.

596
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,440
That's all we do.

597
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,340
We don't even have to do anything to sin.

598
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,540
For the church of the subgenius.

599
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,700
We think sin.

600
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,100
In our mind.

601
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Doesn't want to eradicate sin.

602
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,140
But not because we want to.

603
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,120
It's not because we want to.

604
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,560
The church of the subgenius.

605
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,280
Because we have to bear that sinful burden of mankind.

606
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,180
Justifies sin.

607
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,960
Of the normals.

608
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,680
The pinks.

609
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,280
You know, they're sinning all the time.

610
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,580
And it's their sins that we kind of ride on like the luck plane.

611
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,260
Like a wave in the luck plane.

612
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,580
Like riding like cosmic surfers.

613
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,400
You know.

614
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,560
What do you think about them?

615
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,500
What do you think about them?

616
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,540
Wimped subgeniuses on the coast that were upset by peeping out through the slats of the pro-struggling.

617
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,120
Protruding blue-veined throbbers in the new stark filth of removal.

618
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,320
What do you think about that, Philo?

619
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,260
What about them subgeniuses out there on the west coast?

620
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,180
They just couldn't deal with the new stark filth of removal.

621
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,840
I mean, what have they got against it?

622
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,440
What have they got against it?

623
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,060
What have they got against those things sticking out everywhere?

624
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,420
They just think it's...

625
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,300
Nasty?

626
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,540
They think it's like...

627
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,180
They think it's like...

628
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,700
Juvenile.

629
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,800
Juvenile.

630
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,040
Something you would do if you were a sophomore.

631
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,520
It's a manly thing.

632
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Sophomore.

633
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,780
Isn't that like if you're a sophomore.

634
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,180
You do that kind of stuff.

635
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,380
It's plenty of sophomores.

636
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,280
Plenty of sophomores.

637
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,700
I know.

638
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,420
Always do that.

639
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,640
It's very studly.

640
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,320
It's very studly and southern.

641
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,780
Yeah, here's this letter I was talking about.

642
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,220
A letter.

643
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,540
Drummunt.

644
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,760
Whichever one of you has the best British accent should read that one.

645
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,660
We just got this in the mail this week, and I think it's interesting.

646
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,380
You have to sort of self-censor yourself there a couple of times.

647
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,400
Let's see.

648
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,520
Your stuff used to be clever, modern, and a very, very good one.

649
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,520


650
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,520


651
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,520


652
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:18,100
funny intelligent the latest church magazine is none of these you can't make

653
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,360
any excuses for the rape fixated fantasies I can't even read this guy's

654
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,820
writing you really try to pass off as a celebration of sexuality that's so human

655
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,180
that's so human as much as I've enjoyed the subgenius stuff over the years I

656
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:44,020
don't want to receive any more of your and your and your contributors grow out

657
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,620
of this adolescent until you and your contributors grow out of this adolescent

658
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:54,340
arrested sexuality beep you've lost it see ya Chris a time

659
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,980
ah Chris let's just let's just let it die

660
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,780
let's just die so I want to say you're all missing we didn't put out by word

661
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,920
that's right that was a that was a blatant attempt of the citizens

662
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,160
movement to stop the rape of the state of California and the state of California

663
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,560
for normalcy or some other underground organization to discredit the Church of

664
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,580
the subgenius with by publishing that fell that horrible horrid filth and we

665
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:17,700
the subgenius with by publishing that fell that horrible horrid filth and we

666
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,660
will take no credit for whatsoever although if we did we would be gladly

667
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,780
gladly aligned with it we would support it to the fullest degree but uh

668
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,800
unfortunately I can't take credit neither can would Reverend staying if he

669
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,900
was here it's just a it's an unfortunate thing that they did such a good job of

670
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,640
it's an unfortunate thing that they did such a good job of

671
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,140
it's an unfortunate thing that they did such a good job of

672
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,440
imitating our style, but I have to admit now, before we take any more unnecessary heat,

673
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,340
although we were trying to pick up the profits as well as we could, which is, you would normally

674
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,460
expect that from us, but I have to admit right now, we had nothing, nothing whatsoever to do

675
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,520
with that horrible, filthy, stark filth of removal that you may have received after our

676
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,140
mailing list was stolen from us. That's right, it was stolen. So, first of all, let's just dissect

677
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:18,280
this letter. He starts out, dear subgenia. Now, we could dismiss him immediately. What gives him

678
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,460
the familiarity to call us dear? How dare he? Okay, dear subgenia. He doesn't know me well enough to say

679
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,580
dear. If we had been in a little bit worse mood, we would have abandoned this immediately.

680
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,500
That's sad.

681
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,780
Okay, you're a shot. It looks like shot. He says you're not stuff. How can you call the primary

682
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:45,160
excommunication with the X's and the word of Bob stuff stuff that just relegates it to some type

683
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:53,180
of mundane fecal tissue? Okay, and then he says you're stuck. I'd be quite used to be now masters

684
00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:00,060
of time control. Don't even we don't even need the used to be. What is this used to be?

685
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,900
Masters of time control.

686
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:11,720
Have no need for such for such narrow, narrowly confining form of time used to be used to be clever,

687
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,620
funny and intelligent. Never been clever, funny or intelligent. There's no such thing as claim to be

688
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,260
clever. It's subgenius. We're not geniuses. Clever. I mean, if you take the C off, it's lever.

689
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,980
And what is lever but just a simple machine? And we're like CLEV off and it's just ER.

690
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,060
This is simpleton.

691
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,920
Take all of that.

692
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,500
We have nothing more complex than the C.

693
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:39,300
It's basically one of a basic wheel, inclined plane and lever. That's the most complex we get in our in

694
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:46,240
anything we may even consider. So calling us clever or funny or intelligent. It's just it's just an

695
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,580
insult.

696
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:53,780
Okay, and then look at this word here. The he starts the second letter with the word three letter

697
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,200
word.

698
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,200
Okay, the latest v.

699
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,940
The latest Church Magazine.

700
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,920
how does he know it's the latest church magazine the one we put out this

701

704
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,400
them as we sit here and 11 of them in the morning what's unless one of them

705
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,440
gets wet but it's nice to swell up we put it in that box about what's I mean

706
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,020
it does that open box does he have an open cast does he have the Ark of the

Bleeding Head of Arnold put it in what's he gonna do it starts I just can't

708
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:57,480
believe this none of these okay another three-letter word you can't make any

709
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,020
excuses

710
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:05,280
every excuse our church is an excuse for slack full abbreviation friends if

711
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,900
these rape fixated fantasies you well he's right there I mean I've given that

712
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:17,960
one as you pass off but of course we didn't publish it we even claim credit

713
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,220
for rape fixation okay well he really passed me off with this last one here

714
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,140
just passes pass off to a celebration of sexuality celebrating sexuality

715
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,500
sexuality

716
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:40,360
in 1992 that's so 13 years old running sexuality in 1960 much as I have it well

717
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,760
who is he much and he's enjoyed the subgenius guff oh the gun enjoys the

718
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,920
gossip geniuses rhymes with stuff he's one of those latent subgenius Bobby

719
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,500
masochist he's a limey he's a bloody limey

720
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


721
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,560
you know what that means

722
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,920
I don't want to receive any more over the years

723
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,900
more when your

724
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,300
آد 때문에

725
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,980
뭐가

726
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,960
یا

727
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,720
Maybe to, you know, we perform some police brutality from time to time for the fun of it.

728
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:40,940
I don't even understand the concept of growing out of wanting to sexually arrest adolescents.

729
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
How can you grow sexually arresting adolescents? How could you grow that way?

730
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:56,360
How could he possibly even realize that we can't grow adolescents that have been sexually arrested?

731
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,640
We don't have the firmament. Not for lack of trying.

732
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,760
I mean, the fertilizer has to be shipped from Dobstown itself at great expense.

733
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,160
We can't grow arrested sexualities. We're Stans.

734
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,680
You missed that. You came in late, Dr. Drummond.

735
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,820
Yeah, Stans was already here. Let's not give this guy enough attention.

736
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,500
I think so. He's had more attention than he deserves.

737
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,120
We'll be sure and send him a tape of this particular episode.

738
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,080
The next dollar that you burn, just subsume that particular limit.

739
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,700
Right in the healing flames.

740
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:36,700
I'd like to point out, Pope Sterling, you were mentioning earlier as far as rape fixation in that issue of the magazine.

741
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,040
I believe you pointed out quite properly that the only raping in that entire issue...

742
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,260
The only people that get raped in that entire issue are humans. So what's the big deal?

743
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,020
It's just humans. It's not like having your way with a bowl of lime jello.

744
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,580
But just don't forget that we didn't have anything to do with that publication.

745
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,140
Right.

746
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,540
The whole...

747
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,380
The fact that we're defending it is just purely academic.

748
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,360
It's all moot.

749
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,300
It's a moot point.

750
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,640
That's right.

751
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,620
Just academicians.

752
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,160
It's kind of like verbal masturbation. It's a lot like verbal masturbation.

753
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:20,720
It's freedom of spout. And we have a basic freedom to spout in the United States as we have a basic freedom to squirt or ooze.

754
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,720
You can look it up.

755
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,040
A woman can make a choice.

756
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,560
Look it up.

757
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,360
And subgeniuses can spout.

758
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Get your dictionary out. Turn to the O's. Look up ooze.

759
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,480
There you go.

760
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,440
Dr. Drummond is perusing the huge studio here at that...

761
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,860
It's unbelievable.

762
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,080
He's looking for frop is what he's doing.

763
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,420
It's unbelievable.

764
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,400
You won't find any here.

765
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,620
I know that look in his eyes anywhere.

766
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,960
Yeah. One time I found some frop here. It was underneath this film can right here.

767
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh, well, they found it.

768
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Another time I was looking right here underneath this CD cover.

769
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,540
Nope.

770
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,820
And now...

771
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,980
I shall return to my chair.

772
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,520
Ah. He's back in his chair now.

773
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,100
Oh, dear friends.

774
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Ah.

775
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,160
Dr. Drummond.

776
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,300
Ah, yeah.

777
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,520
How was that ether frop, Dr. Drummond?

778
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,520
It was...

779
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,860
It was...

780
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,260
Did it...

781
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,600
Like the void of Moab.

782
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,880
Were you linked to the 80 million tribes of the blood of the Lamb of Moab?

783
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,900
Yes. I was spiritually and psychically linked. Through the...

784
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,680
Did you forthwith launch that especial head?

785
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,900
That espessilene. The head espessilene.

786
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,300
Was it coated with espessilene before you launched it?

787
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,140
It was coated with vaseline.

788
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,100
And you...

789
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,660
To give it that quick lift off.

790
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,620
Well, I don't know about you, but I use espessilene.

791
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,420
It's so richly deserved.

792
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,180
Should I... Should I answer this line?

793
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,160
Well, let Dr. Drummond answer the phone.

794
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,000
Go right ahead.

795
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,260
K... K-something.

796
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,160
We have another call. Hopefully they're calling to...

797
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,380
Will.

798
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,880
...apply for the three free eternal salvation certificates we have to offer you tonight.

799
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,640
Tonight only?

800
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,960
Here on KNON. Tonight only.

801
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,220
Or whatever station you're listening to.

802
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,480
Just call us here at KNON.

803
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,640
Or if you don't happen to be listening to KNON, if you happen to be watching television, it's KNON.

804
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,740
Instead of this, if you happen to be driving in your car and you don't have a radio, then please stop...

805
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,640
...of the, uh, Church of the Reb... of the, uh, Wretched Excess.

806
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,900
Does that have to do with... that doesn't have anything to do with retching, does it?

807
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,740
Good.

808
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,380
Could well.

809
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,520
I hate to retch.

810
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,620
If you've ever done it, it's really...

811
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,240
It's sort of like squirting upside down.

812
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,760
It's, uh, kind of Shakespearean wretched, he said.

813
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,660
I feel that way sometimes myself.

814
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,620
So, kind of wretched.

815
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,380
That's the hour of slack.

816
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,140
We listen to one side of the phone conversation.

817
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,380
I can understand why retching was derived.

818
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,240
You know retching was derived from wretched, right?

819
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:11,260
So anyway, the fourth caller will receive free, at no additional charge, the Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer Disco Soccer Kit, the Certificate of Absolution from the Church of the Subgenius.

820
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:18,460
Yeah, this, uh, this caller makes an excellent point, is that, uh, that redneck, jello-headed, limey... bleep!

821
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,740
Uh, I guess... can we say bastard?

822
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,640
Sure, we can say bastard.

823
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,580
Bastard on the phone.

824
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:22,820
Sure.

825
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,380
And, and he basically...

826
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,800
That redneck, low-liming, limey bastard.

827
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,860
Low-liming.

828
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,820
Low-liming, yeah, he's not even a full-blown limey.

829
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,040
And what did you say?

830
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,900
What was your excellent point?

831
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
He has no yettison DNA or RNA coursing to his system at all.

832
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,600
He doesn't have Hello Kitty in his heart.

833
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,260
Yeah.

834
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,440
I'm gonna cry.

835
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm gonna cry right here on the air.

836
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,520
You're somebody who doesn't have Hello Kitty in his heart.

837
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,060
I, I, I, I, I, I don't know if I can go on.

838
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,600
Eyes are rolling up.

839
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,620
I don't know if I can go on.

840
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


841
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


842
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


843
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


844
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


845
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


846
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


847
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,620


848
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,660
Okay, that was an excellent point, though.

849
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm gonna let you go now.

850
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:54,740
Thank you.

851
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
But thanks for your excellent point.

852
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,660
And, uh...

853
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,400
We have another caller.

854
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,660
Talk to you later.

855
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,600
Bye.

856
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020
That's right, dear friend.

857
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,880
And, uh, Sterno will take this call.

858
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,640
Uh, unfortunately, we can't, uh, tap the phone callers in.

859
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,300
Most of them are so foul-mouthed that it would be against the law to have them tapped in,

860
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,640
so...

861
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,320
That's why we don't take our callers in anymore.

862
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,280
But, uh, some of them are, have some grain of humanity and...

863
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,120
Oh, they do.

864
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,960
Not humanity.

865
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,800
Not in the, not in the negative sense.

866
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,240
Only in the, in the philosophical sense.

867
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,080
Yes.

868
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,800
And, uh, we, we wouldn't like to imply that any of our listeners were human.

869
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,360
Nor should it be inferred.

870
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,760
That's right.

871
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,020
Or, or implicated in any...

872
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,360
So, Dr. Drummond?

873
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,180
Yes, yes, sir.

874
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,620
You would know better than any man here.

875
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,920
What, what was Dobbs like before his immaculation?

876
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,540
We had a caller ask me that last week.

877
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,620
And I, not knowing you were going to be here...

878
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,500
Well, like, in what context?

879
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,060
Uh, what was he like?

880
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,600
I mean, that's a fairly broad question.

881
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:51,600


882
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,120
That's a good topic.

883
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,320
Uh, he was like, uh, like, uh, like a man.

884
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,700
And yet, like a bear.

885
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,780
Or a bear slapping fish in a stream.

886
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,720
So that was, that was Dobbs.

887
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,240
In the winter.

888
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,600
Or in the summer.

889
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,400
He was sort of a sea, a man for all seasons.

890
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,640
A bear for all seasons.

891
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:21,260
And, but, but that's a real, fairly, uh, uh, philosophical bent on what Dobbs was like.

892
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,440
That the Limey interpreter can...

893
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,760
Another, another comment on the Limey interpreters.

894
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,020
That he can put his lips on her buttocks.

895
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,700
Okay.

896
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,600
And she gives him permission to do that.

897
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,440
And make smooching sounds.

898
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,500
And make smooching sounds.

899
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,720
And make smacking, smooching sounds.

900
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,260
While the entire Church of the Subgenius hierarchy stands around...

901
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Gawking and laughing and pointing fingers.

902
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,440
Having their way with dee-beaked prairie squids.

903
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,540
Gawking and scoffing.

904
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,620
Gawking uproariously.

905
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,600
And pointing their fingers at him.

906
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,240
At that no-brainer.

907
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,540
English-ster.

908
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,160
He's got a lot of gall.

909
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,980
Sending that letter in this company.

910
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,580
This country.

911
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,160
Yeah.

912
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,240
This company.

913
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,260
We were hoping that this...

914
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,200
This company of countries.

915
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,980
This grand merry band.

916
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,700
This grand scheme of, uh, pan, uh, pan-political structures.

917
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,380
That was Karen, who lives in Dallas.

918
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,380
And Karen says that he can plant his limey lips right on her buttocks.

919
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,960
For sending us that despicable, childish, puerile, adolescent, pointless letter.

920
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,760
But I hope that he wipes his lips off since that lime juice may sting a little on those,

921
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,080
those, uh...

922
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,060
Well, I was hoping that with you here, Dr. Drummond, uh, we could talk about...

923
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,380
Globular-shaped human anatomy.

924
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,040
Certain amount of butt kissing.

925
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,420
Because there's no...

926
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,360
The zen of butt kissing.

927
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,480
We, that is one of the most requested cuts that we play on this program.

928
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,860
The zen of corporal butt kissing.

929
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,420
Yep.

930
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,020
It's a very difficult art to master.

931
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,820
One that I've spent years and years to...

932
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:49,900
He's paying with his soul.

933
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:49,900


934
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:49,900


935
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:49,900


936
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:49,920
He's paying with his soul.

937
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:49,920


938
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:49,920


939
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:49,920


940
00:39:49,960 --> 00:40:01,040
...find just the exact, uh, distance that's the approved distance that would allow you to manifest that butt kissing, uh, viewpoint.

941
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,460
Which is so strongly required of American management.

942
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,320
We have a caller here who's made a good point.

943
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,500
Oh, we'll interrupt this, uh, diatribe for another comment on the limey bastard.

944
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,740
He's made the point that the limey bastard, he's already paid his $20 for salvation, is receiving the material.

945
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,500
Our caller wants to know what the cost will be...

946
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,100
What the cost?

947
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,600
...so that we won't send him any more material.

948
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,760
We'll save money.

949
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,940
Just think.

950
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,280
Think of what a wonderful thing he's done for us now.

951
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,960
But it's not just money.

952
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,420
I mean, it's the cost...

953
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,120
It's the cost...

954
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,340
...of his slack.

955
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,260
Yeah, watch.

956
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,180
Yeah, that too, yeah.

957
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:32,880
And...

958
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,500
So we put a little bit more slack back in the cosmic slack pool.

959
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,640
You know, as far as I'm concerned, it's, uh...

960
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:37,980
Well, hopefully...

961
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:49,080
...we gave it to him, he rejected it, and, uh, so now he's taunting us instead of giving us the benefit of the doubt and realizing up front that there was no possible way in heck that we would ever publish a video.

962
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,080


963
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,940
We didn't publish such a horrible, infan...infantile...

964
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,240
That's it.

965
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,420
...that's the word I was looking for.

966
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,320
...or, uh, puerile...

967
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,760
Adolescent.

968
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,860
...horrible adolescent sexually fantas...fantastic, uh, whatever those other things he said.

969
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,120
We wouldn't be doing those things.

970
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,540
Bestial.

971
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:05,900
Bestial.

972
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,580
Bestial.

973
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,460
That's one of the...

974
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,760
It's a bestial damn magazine I've ever seen.

975
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,480
It's the best...

976
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,080
It's the best you'll get around here.

977
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,500
Oh, yeah.

978
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,380
And I'll tell you...

979
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,900
Hey, I forgot.

980
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,320
Ah.

981
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,200
Oh, never mind.

982
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,100
That's the Pobucker.

983
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,000
That's the Pobucker coming out in me because, you know, I am an ascended Pobucker.

984
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:37,920
And that which should give all you Pobuckers heart, that even you, too, could possibly become an Overman, uh, from your lowly status of Pobuckerdom, inside the foot of every Pobucker beats the gland of a subgenius.

985
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,880
Only waiting to be...

986
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,020
Stifle, stifle that radiating...

987
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,380
...massaged...

988
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,980
...Overman aura there, Philo.

989
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,060
...in such a way...

990
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,820
...it's burning me.

991
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,260
Ah.

992
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,080
Ah.

993
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,800
Oh, yes.

994
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,220
It's...uh.

995
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,260
Anybody got any aspirin?

996
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,440
Or a beer?

997
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,300
Or pills?

998
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:51,860
Pills?

999
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,700
Aspirin?

1000
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:52,800
Beer?

1001
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,600
We were looking for pills on the way out here.

1002
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,040
How much is a...

1003
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,380
How much is a bucket of pills in Dallas now, anyway?

1004
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:56,960
They're...

1005
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,020
They're going...

1006
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,440
They're pretty high in Little Rock.

1007
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,740
Well, if you get the kind that have the...have the stuff inside, it's about...it's a little

1008
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,980
bit more than the kind that don't have anything inside.

1009
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,260
Well, the, uh, claw-legged, ball-peen antique bathtub full of pills that they used to sell

1010
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,880
down on Greenville Avenue, I believe.

1011
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,140
Yeah.

1012
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,120
I like the burlap sack full of pills.

1013
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,380
They were...

1014
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,180
They were cheap several years ago.

1015
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,820
...that they used to sell over there on the...on the...on the north side of the south part

1016
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,200
of the East End there.

1017
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,760
It's kind of on the back side of the west, uh, side of that grocery store.

1018
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,360
They closed it down now, because it got, uh, kind of out of hand.

1019
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,700
Especially when they started pushing those wigs.

1020
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,000
And you know who came in to buy the wigs?

1021
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,900
Those insidious, uh, gasket wigs that tightened down like a metal band.

1022
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,220
There's one crawling right there.

1023
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,720
Look out!

1024
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:48,940
Look out!

1025
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,040
I got it.

1026
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,580
I killed it.

1027
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,600
Killed it with my breath.

1028
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,340
That's why I don't brush my teeth.

1029
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,120
A lot of people have asked me, Philo, why don't you brush your teeth?

1030
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,800
It's...it's those wigs.

1031
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,420
You know what I mean?

1032
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:00,960
You never know.

1033
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,020
They're gonna come crawling across a...a floor or a desk or whatever, and you've got this

1034
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,700
built-in power that you can utilize, and it works.

1035
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,780
And there's living dead proof of it right there.

1036
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,860
It's living dead proof slack squirt.

1037
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,540
There's a pool of it right there in my chair.

1038
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,980
Absolutely.

1039
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,740
Just don't inhale.

1040
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,240
Just don't...

1041
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,200
And if you'd like that pool of...

1042
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,260
If you're like...like Bill Clinton, you won't inhale.

1043
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,320
Right.

1044
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,940
And if you'd like to receive some of this special...

1045
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,820
I never inhale.

1046
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,380
...lap squirt vomit...

1047
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,480
No.

1048
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:29,540
...and, uh, blood bottles...

1049
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,660
I don't even inhale when I breathe.

1050
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,320
...and, uh, blood bottles sum up.

1051
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,820
Certified pure by the Church of the Subgenius.

1052
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,300
Just send 1295 to Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas...

1053
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,880
People tell me, how's it going, Philo?

1054
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,720
...75214.

1055
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,120
Yeah.

1056
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,640
I say, what?

1057
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,760
How's what going?

1058
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,680
Yeah.

1059
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,360
What is it?

1060
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:45,740
It's the it.

1061
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,160
You know, what is the it?

1062
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,460
People say, how you doing?

1063
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,800
Well, I never really thought about how I did it.

1064
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,940
How am I doing it?

1065
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,920
You know, I just did it.

1066
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,140
It just came kind of natural.

1067
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,440
Lightning erupted.

1068
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,160
Yeah.

1069
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,960
Dobstown shut down for a weekend when Philo did it.

1070
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,660
Uh, let me tell you a little bit about what happens when Philo does it.

1071
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,300
People say, Philo, how are you?

1072
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,900
Rogans flee by the millions when Philo does it.

1073
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,260
Am I alive?

1074
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,660
I'm alive.

1075
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:14,940
I'm alive.

1076
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,280
Vinyl melts by the ton when Philo does it.

1077
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,120
People said, uh...

1078
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,280
Speakers crackle.

1079
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,860
Old women's beehives melt.

1080
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,340
You checked out.

1081
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,500
You checked out.

1082
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,100
You just left.

1083
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,080
Grocery stores.

1084
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,600
You just cut out.

1085
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,780
You hit the road.

1086
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:32,960
The meat section in grocery stores turns rancid overnight when Philo does it.

1087
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,000
You packed it on down the highway.

1088
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,020
You packed it up, rolled it down, and shoved it on down the road.

1089
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,400
Rolling along...

1090
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,240
Kitten natividad squirms when Philo does it.

1091
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,300
Yeah, I knew old Kitty.

1092
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,180
Yeah.

1093
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,780
I called her Kitty and she just knocked P. Wadden out of me one time.

1094
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,420
Then when?

1095
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,960
Now, as we go back to the phones, we find that we have a caller who's ready to pledge.

1096
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,420
She'd like to do Philo.

1097
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,160
She'd like to pledge.

1098
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,300
She'd like to do Philo.

1099
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,260
They'd all like to do Philo.

1100
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,440
Karen wants to do Philo.

1101
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,100
I can understand that.

1102
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,360
I like to do Philo.

1103
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,080
Don't we all?

1104
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
And I am Philo.

1105
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,240
Philo has been done.

1106
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
But it's a hard thing.

1107
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,780
It's a very hard thing to do Philo the right way.

1108
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,900
Philo was done yesterday.

1109
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,640
I've tried it myself.

1110
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,120
I've done it.

1111
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,880
When Philo does it.

1112
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,700
I've done it.

1113
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:16,720
When he does it.

1114
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,680
And I've been there.

1115
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,660
And when I got there, I didn't know what the heck was happening.

1116
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,080
Hello?

1117
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,500
Hello?

1118
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,980
You may want to talk to Karen just a minute.

1119
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,220
Karen.

1120
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,660
This is Karen.

1121
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,900
Paint factories explode.

1122
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,140
Karen who wants to do Philo.

1123
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,600
When Philo does it.

1124
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,360
When Philo does it.

1125
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,920
Well, she knows that we come as a pair, doesn't she?

1126
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,240
Yes.

1127
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,700
You know that Philo and Sterno come as a pair.

1128
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,260
So to speak.

1129
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,340
And it's quite messy.

1130
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,440
Yeah, well.

1131
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:41,600
When it happens.

1132
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,100
Yeah, well.

1133
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,180
I'm going to go.

1134
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,260


1135
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,460
But that's the type of universe we live in.

1136
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,240
What are you going to do?

1137
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:45,480
It is.

1138
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,260
It's a wonder of mankind.

1139
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,480
It's the squirting universe.

1140
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,200
You have your.

1141
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,060
It should be.

1142
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,560
She has her tools.

1143
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,900
She has her tools.

1144
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,980
And we're speaking literally, friends.

1145
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,340
You're not brought my tools as well.

1146
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,540
Subgeniuses and pinks.

1147
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:56,760
I always carry my tools.

1148
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,600
This is not innuendo we're spouting here.

1149
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:58,980
All three of them.

1150
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,380
No, no.

1151
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,040
It's not spoken in a roundabout.

1152
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
This is the literal truth.

1153
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,220
She only has one tool.

1154
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,100
Well, that's okay.

1155
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,680
There's just.

1156
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,400
Things can happen that way.

1157
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,800
You know, that's an understanding.

1158
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,120
Well, I've only got 17.

1159
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,240
I'm not going to.

1160
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,240


1161
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,920
I've only got the.

1162
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,180
Yeah.

1163
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,160
Well.

1164
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,480
It's dead air.

1165
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,500
She's talking about her sister.

1166
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,760
Okay.

1167
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,480
There you go.

1168
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:23,840
Sterno.

1169
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:24,800
Yeah.

1170
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,200
Keep it going.

1171
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,720
The caller.

1172
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,640
The caller is talking about her sister.

1173
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,880
And she's going to.

1174
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,800
I just can't believe this.

1175
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,880
People think that a subgenius hierarchite can be swayed.

1176
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,560
As a.

1177
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,780
By human sex.

1178
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,020
It.

1179
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,780
It doesn't make any sense.

1180
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,120
I mean.

1181
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,720
After you've experienced the rapture.

1182
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
The Nirvana.

1183
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,000
The sheer gut split.

1184
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,460
Of overmanned them.

1185
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,060
After you've had your third nostril open.

1186
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,420
After you've experienced righteous subgenius acubating.

1187
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,020
After you have been glanscaped by the doctors for Bob.

1188
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,380
Humans think that we can be swayed by sexuality.

1189
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,940
I just can't understand the petty mind speak.

1190
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:07,940
The petty.

1191
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,240
But speak.

1192
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,100
The petty but wilt.

1193
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,300
Of these humans.

1194
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,620
What what what is happening?

1195
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,160
What is happening in this nation.

1196
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,500
Sad.

1197
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,860
Sad commentary.

1198
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,860
We can whiff the aural stench or of these.

1199
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,040
Of these humans.

1200
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:25,820
We do it all the time.

1201
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,860
Coming down the street.

1202
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
They haven't taken that boat trip.

1203
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,820
They haven't disembarked on the pier.

1204
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,980
The sacred pier.

1205
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,980
The pink deep pink deep beak prairie squid studded spear.

1206
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,160
Of the mighty.

1207
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,800
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1208
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,480
You're listening to KNO in 89.3 FM.

1209
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,720
Community radio in Dallas Texas.

1210
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,200
Approved by Gabrogfran.

1211
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,280
Little Gabrogfran.

1212
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society.

1213
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,600
Excuse me.

1214
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,180
Excuse me Sterno.

1215
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,320
I have an announcement to make.

1216
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,200
Our last caller Karen.

1217
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,320
Wanted to regret.

1218
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,340
She regretted the fact.

1219
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,960
That her sister Christina.

1220
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,780
Unless she realizes the error of her ways.

1221
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,800
Will not be able to enjoy the ride.

1222
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,180
Be next to her sister.

1223
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,480
On the pleasure.

1224
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,500
The saucers of the sex goddesses and gods.

1225
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,340
From preceding the exes.

1226
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,040
That we've all spoken of.

1227
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,520
I really feel sorry.

1228
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,460
And I understand.

1229
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,620
I have empathy.

1230
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,760
For Karen and her sister.

1231
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,160
Because.

1232
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,540
Fortunately my brother will be with me.

1233
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,020
And all my concubines.

1234
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,080
And 50 or 60 wives.

1235
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,380
And but Karen.

1236
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,020
I just hope you are able to convert your sister.

1237
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,000
Soon enough.

1238
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,760
And we can all have a good time.

1239
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,600
On that very self-same aforementioned sex saucer.

1240
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,140
Barney Barney.

1241
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,960
Are you out there?

1242
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,240
Barney Barney.

1243
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,580
Barney.

1244
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,840
He's calling.

1245
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,600
He's calling and he's lying.

1246
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,160
And we've all lied tonight.

1247
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,640
It's been a lie.

1248
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,860
Barney.

1249
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,380
Yeah.

1250
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,280
You gotta.

1251
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,120
Okay thanks for the call.

1252
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:21,340
Bye.

1253
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,080
Okay.

1254
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,140
All right now.

1255
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,620
Well.

1256
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,360
I guess we're kinda.

1257
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,360
Are we getting close to the end of our time?

1258
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,900
You know we commandeered the show tonight from Reverend Stang.

1259
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,600
He really was tied up in the back room.

1260
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,220
He's still tied up.

1261
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,480
I can hear him squirming around.

1262
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,640
We're gonna let him go.

1263
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,540
in a little while, but we've enjoyed being here.

1264
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:42,380
Have you?

1265
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,620
Yes, all six of us.

1266
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,520
They're really working.

1267
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,700
I hope that the glands have been escaped.

1268
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,720
Sterno didn't enjoy it, but he never enjoys anything.

1269
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,120
I hope that your butt has been split.

1270
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,380
His relative unenjoyment is variable enough to measure

1271
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,900
that some levels of unenjoyment are greater than others,

1272
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,940
and so therefore in some sixth sense he does have some level of unenjoyment

1273
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,720
that's to a lesser degree than others.

1274
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:17,740
I hope that our listeners have sniffed the veil of Moab somehow by this evening's lectures.

1275
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,220
What's that?

1276
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,700
By the end of this evening's lectures you hope that somebody mentions the word Moab at least 60,000 times?

1277
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:30,560
We hope that someone sniffs the veil of Moab and the 80 million tribes and lambs of Moab.

1278
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,660
Or the belly button of Moab would work.

1279
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,920
He says,

1280
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,440
Lo unto me ye.

1281
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,940
By the smiling pink false prophets.

1282
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,580
Launch and yet launch again.

1283
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,840
Ah, yes.

1284
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,880
And true words were never spoken.

1285
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,280
Willa Dobbs and Dr. Drummond.

1286
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,280
Truer words were never spoken.

1287
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:57,320
Willa Dobbs, I'd like to say thanks for allowing Sterno and I to come on Reverend Stang's show.

1288
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,200
We're sorry you had to beat him up like that.

1289
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,760
We hope that he's in shape next week.

1290
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,780
Well, we'll see.

1291
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,360
It remains to be seen.

1292
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,240
Recover his normal.

1293
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:16,580
As long as sick with a sore throat.

1294
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:16,600


1295
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:16,660
It's led by God Jesus Christ.

1296
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:16,660


1297
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,440
He's off that, but we hope that he also happens to get back to the point

1298
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,440


1299
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,920
Then I'll have a strategy show to end it up with.

1300
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,300
Git sins whispers in that honor.

1301
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:22,300


1302
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:22,740
We'll get the other way for you.

1303
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:22,740


1304
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:22,740


1305
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,140
I'll go with you and I got this衣

1306
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:32,880
When they used to sit in a chair on a chair and they sat on the screen with it in Rapid six-ah and the guy that says it's like coming because the fact it's layer is their carbohydrate that they should come from.

1307
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,700
Canada also knows America is not like that so.

A man.

1355
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,740
Thank you.

1356
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:48,840
As we take a walk into the sunshine in our little canvas boat,

1357
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:56,100
we dream and reminisce upon times forgotten,

1358
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,000
ancient days of woeful sadness,

1359
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:09,240
intricate patterns of conscious revelry and sickness.

1360
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:18,900
Ah yes, even before the time of the sea,

1361
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,000
we knew that these things would come to pass.

1362
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,700
As I fall,

1363
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,720
the elder ask that day...

1364
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,700
Right?

1365
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,140
Hey!

1366
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,240
You!

1367
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,040
You!

1368
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,260
What?

1369
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,960
What?

1370
01:01:59,960 --> 01:01:59,960


1371
01:01:59,960 --> 01:01:59,960


1372
01:01:59,960 --> 01:01:59,960


1373
01:01:59,960 --> 01:01:59,960
