1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Sound impossible?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,540
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,500
Oh well, you take the pinch of salt, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,360
walk with a shim around a turning decapitated child's head,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,480
and then jump into the grave and say,

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,960
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb, this is a problem I must overcome.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,220
Play in a dead cat, or a live cat that's not feeling well.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,720
Then cover with the sod, and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Micklemas,

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,760
take a large dill pickle and insert it in the tumulus.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,840
Insert it in the tumulus, the heap, the shambling mound over the grave.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,480
And this time you will experience a divine regurgitation,

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,780
somewhat like unto the immaculation of J.R. Mockadobs,

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,620
the slain and martyred epoch of the Church of the Subterranean.

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,180
I believe it's something God puts in us.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
It's something somebody put in us.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,120
Fusion.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,920
Help.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,480
Hydrogen fusion.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,500
Hydrogen fusion?

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,540
Hmm.

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,520
Well, it's...

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,460
I know you are the mama.

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,820
Hydro-confusion.

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,400
Join the Church of the Subterranean.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,120
Yes.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,640
Hydrogen fusion, hyper-confusion.

Shut up!

That's it!

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,140
Look out, guys!

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,300
No way!

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,720
A beginning is a very delicate time.

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,900
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,200

Oh, okay, we're on lock.

Oh, okay.

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,600
You are interested in the unknown,

45
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,760
the mysterious, the unexplainable.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,800
That is why you are here.

Excuse me.

Set, set, set.

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,180

52

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,640

Wait a minute.

58
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,040
Wait.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,080
That's this switch here.

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,880
Okay, I think we're ready to go.

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,740

Welcome, dear friends,

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,340
to the subgenius hour of...

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,260
What?

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,240
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

86
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,840
Bob?

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,800
That's your key phrase.

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,000
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

89
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,960

Ah, so nice out here in the little studio.

92
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,620
Perfect concentration.

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,460
No distractions.

94
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,220
No anxiety.

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
No fear.

Hi there. I want to talk to you about ducts.

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,880
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned?

131
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Out of date?

132
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,040
Central Services' new duct designs

133
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,040
are now available in hundreds of different colours

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,720
to suit your individual taste.

135
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,980
Hurry now, while stocks last,

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,080
to your nearest Central Services showroom.

137

138
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,720
The rumour became reality.

139
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,060
Another satanic cult.

140
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,460
Yes, just another evil cult that was supposed to be a good one.

141
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,780
This is how the war gets on the radio.

142
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,680
I think a lot of subgeniuses originally believed

143
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,880
they were doing something good by joining the church.

144
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,680
That wheel and chain set up makes the sound of moving artillery.

145
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,520
Sounds like a real battle.

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,720
Well, it's nothing compared to what it takes to move this show.

147
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,900
Don't be alarmed.

148
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,840
It's a lot more work than saving souls, believe me.

149
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,260
That punch didn't connect.

150
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,980
The sound was faked.

151
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,780
Although, Stang suffered a real blow

152
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,860
from an infuriated Gabofran.

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,220
That was a great blow.

154
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,020
Yes, the mallet on a grapefruit gave the sound of that blow.

155
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,820
Curiously refreshing.

156
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,200
It was a lot of fun, too.

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,500
But here they come.

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,920
The guard is forming to march the guilty offender away.

Yes, those who believed the wrong lies in the book of the subgenius

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,180
from crawling to early walking,

171
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,180
to full walking, trotting and running,

172
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,400
until he is actually strutting, dancing and doing gymnastics.

173

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:04,660
Hey!

195
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,960
Bob!

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,240
Watch!

197
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey!

198
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,300
Bob!

199
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,720
Oh yes, dear friends.

200
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,880
This is the VT, a Chinese subgenius.

201
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,220
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

202
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

203
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:25,980
Bob.

204
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,580
He is a channel, just like in America.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,100
And people need Slack.

206
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,620
That's a lot of fun.

207
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,760
In Chinese, we call Slack, Lutin Pack.

208
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
That's a lot of fun.

209
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,580
But it must be true Slack, not the best Slack of our conspiracy.

210
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,620
Boy, will you look at that guy's Slack.

211
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,520
Help me somebody.

212
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
Help me somebody.

213
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,880
Thank you, Lily Jing.

214
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,800
Yes, my friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,620
Ivan Stang himself.

216
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,040
The grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith,

217
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,780
who has every subgenius' name on his special basement computer.

218
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,680
And he's here tonight to make the hour and a half of Slack seem like, well, like forever.

219
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,400
Ivan Stang.

220
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,460
That's Stang who stangs.

221
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,700
Silly and sour of rank.

222
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,120
Of Serno's squad and Jeter's fang.

223
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,800
When the feats are upon us, when the day finally is on us,

224
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,080
the beats will broil, but not in song.

225
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
Nature and men will stand aside.

226
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,700
The jaws of doom shall open wide,

227
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,120
while Ivan Stang shall perch inside.

228
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Where fromlessness and sickness dwell,

229
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,340
false prophets from their citadels,

230
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,820
he topples down to nether hell.

231
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,280
He judges pigs and guinea-paws,

232
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,800
and renders into visit-blobs

233
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,460
those who profane the name of dogs.

234
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,620
He rules the pasts of king or host,

235
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,640
evens his nights on the coast,

236
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,460
a clinch from his name as from a ghost.

237
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,840
Where can we go?

238
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,380
Where can we find?

239
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,580
No place in all this world so wide,

240
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
shall escape the dire subgenial tide.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,460
The jaders howl, the sternoes plead,

242
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,320
Bohemondess rises from the sea.

243
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,180
No hiding place for you indeed.

244
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,540
What future does our doom procure us?

245
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,260
Can the earth indeed endure us?

246
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,820
Let the damned world offset for us.

247
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,360
A man of God's destiny,

248
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,360


249
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,360


250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,440
The General Stangerang, the gangster of the Gang of Gangs.

251
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,380
Let us now welcome Ivan Stang.

252
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,460
Ah, yes, dear friends.

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,740
So good to be here.

254
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,000
Say it, Ivan, say it.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,420
Feeling the power.

256
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,560
In this hideous, hideous place.

257
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,220
Bob lives, friends.

258
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,420
Bob lives.

259
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,900
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

260
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,720
He ain't dead.

261
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, what is this anyway?

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,660
I should know.

263
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,260
I'm the guy that has to read sooner or later all the mail that comes to that.

264
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,580
That you probably thought was just made up.

265
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:05,040
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff and management of this radio station,

266
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:13,380
the other staff, the relations and spouses of the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and staff.

267
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,820
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

268
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,360
Bob's body dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

269
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,180
These deadlights look.

270
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,900
They've done Bob and the light was drifting from them forever.

271
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:37,960
There's saint of sale corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

272
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,660
I don't know what the big deal is.

273
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,580
I mean, just because there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily...

274
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,720
I mean, can Bob really die?

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,140
Can Bob really die?

276
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:14,520
We be ready and sit on him for decades.

277
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,140
Bob?

278
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,200


279
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Well, that was fun.

280
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,740
Well, that was, wow.

281
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:19,740


282
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,340
Hey, how was it?

283
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,800
We did.

284
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,200


285
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,340
He was, he threw in a ton of snow.

286
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,340


287
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,340


288
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,340


289
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,340


290
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,340


291
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,040
The second.

292
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,300
Control.

293
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,980
When it blows its.

294
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,940
When it blows its.

295
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,600
When it blows its.

296
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,120
When it blows its.

297
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,620
When it blows its.

298
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,040
He ain't nowhere to be found.

299
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,540
When the wolves crawl.

300
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,120
While we're down.

301
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,640
When the war troup.

302
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,700
When the.

303
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,400
Now we're around.

304
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,020
Hide all the women in town.

305
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,300
Hide.

306
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,240
Hide all the women in town.

307
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,940
When it blows its.

308
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,380
When it blows its.

309
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,380


310
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,400
When it blows its.

311
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,340
All you girls.

312
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,120
Make no mistakes.

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,580
He's a troll.

314
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,540
He makes no mistakes.

315
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:35,000
He takes them out.

316
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,800
Out on the nice mud.

317
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,520
The town of the Bronsons.

318
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,220
Say I'll see you around.

319
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,920
When he's straightened up.

320
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,120
They all bend down.

321
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,660
He don't bow to bad water.

322
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,220
He don't push it all around.

323
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,640
Comforts.

324
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,060
He wants it all the same.

325
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,780
He Mama'll give up on it.

326
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,900
This colorful world has been with us for seven years.

327
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,320
If itayıme, the birthing chair of the creatures who lost that a thousand years ended and

328
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,640
braves and underwater squared it, beautiful planet we are.

329
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,240


330
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,240


331
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,540
Woman.

332
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,220
I'm dumbfounded.

333
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,300
I'm dumbfounded.

334
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,300


335
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,300


336
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,300


337
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,340
I'm mad.

338
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,340


339
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,340


340
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,340


341
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,680
Nope, nope, nope.

342
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,880
Censorship and Libraries.

343
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,480
A free exhibit in the plaza-level community showcase at the J. Eric Johnson Central Library.

344
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,320
Said it right that time.

345
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,820
1515 Young in Dallas.

346
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:40,160
The Censorship and Libraries exhibit will take place during regular library hours from January 12th through February 22nd, 1987.

347
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,780
The exhibit documents cases of censorship of books in libraries.

348
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
In the last 10 years.

349
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,960
Copies of the banned books will be available for everyone, even little kids, to page through at their leisure.

350
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,700
For more information, call 749-400.

351
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,160
No, 749-4100.

352
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,420
There we go.

353
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,900
Oh, and by the way, you can also catch Buck Naked.

354
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
And, uh...

355
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,660
Mm-hmm.

356
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,120
More drunk cowboys.

357
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,960
On the first Saturday of every month at Winedale's Tavern.

358
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
And I'm sure you know where that is.

359
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay, you gals out there.

360
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,060
We haven't gotten any, uh...

361
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,980
Uh...

362
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,660
Any more entries in the Win a Date with Cleve Duncan contest.

363
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,820
I mean, I'm not even gonna go into...

364
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,780
If you don't know who Cleve Duncan is...

365
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,500
Then, you probably don't deserve the date.

366
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,100
But if you do, go ahead and try, go ahead and try.

367
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,020
It's important.

368
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,560
It can be very important.

369
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,740
Whoop whoop!

370
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,400
Clint

371
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,640
It's really, really tough.

372
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,480
But even more surprising is...

373
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,780
페 발생

374
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,380
It's Don arvin arms?

375
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,220
Oh!

376
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,240
disease?

377
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,980
Slack faster, makes it go faster.

378
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,740
Then every hour I score to the bone.

379
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,940
He's the one I got, he's picking up your behind.

380
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,760
If you want to know the truth, then that's a fact.

381
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,920
Somebody scream, give me more slack.

382
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,220
Give me more slack.

383
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,420
Do you like slack?

384
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,520
I like it.

385
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,780
I say, I love slack.

386
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,680
I love it.

387
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
Do you want slack?

388
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,100
I want it.

389
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,380
Do you need slack?

390
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,380
I need it.

391
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,660
I need it.

392
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:41,840
I need it.

393
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,940
I need it.

394
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,820
I need it.

395
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,040
I need it.

396
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,100
Get down to the program.

397
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,480
Ride hard to hold my one.

398
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,780
I got the most in the nation.

399
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,480
I take it.

400
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,100
I got the most in the world.

401
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,200
I got the most in the world.

402
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,020
Yeah, he'll be hopping to the barbershop with more slack.

403
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,520
I got a half.

404
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:32,180
my slack. Give it to me. Yeah. Praise Bob. Hey. Boy, I mean, slack is better than red

405
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:39,160
bees. Right. 90.9 FM Dallas.

406
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:15,760
No, man. She was 40 feet wide. I went to her. I went to her grave. Everybody

407
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:25,120
threw flowers. Right through that. Great. The police came and got me and

408
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,780
put me in jail. I brought up a new gun and shot him to

409
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:40,300
jail. Oh, thank you, Tevis. That was a beautiful rendition of a classic,

410
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,120
classic childhood song. And there'll be more from the tiniest subgenius

411
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,920
prophet coming up. But friends, you know, we've been griping about those

412
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,700
who didn't pay their pledge, but we haven't really thanked those who had.

413
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,160
And well, the will of Dobbs and I got to looking at the

414
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,740
this board in here, this this poster that they've put up that keeps track of who what

415
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:15,520
shows are ahead and what shows are behind on the pledge drive. And friends, I I could

416
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:24,260
scarcely believe it. But the hour of slack is number five among all KNO in shows as far

417
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:32,160
as paid pledges go. And the other the four shows out of 80, what, 81 shows that I've

418
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:40,160
been on, I think. Yeah. Eighty one shows out of 81 shows, the four shows that made more money during that pledge drive.

419
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:48,540
The hour of slack were all on for like 10 hours a day. They're on every day. We did better than pajama party,

420
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:54,980
better than anybody. The the now the gospel shows, they got as much pledges as the subgenius show,

421
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,960
but strangely, only eight percent paid. Wonder what that means. Well, anyway, 50 percent of you subgeniuses have paid.

422
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,800
I think by now probably 50%.

423
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,080
And those who haven't, if you haven't gotten the calls already, you will.

424
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,620
You'll get that call.

425
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,600
And it's all being recorded, not only on magnetic media here in this century,

426
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,080
but on the Akashic records, the records of all things that have ever occurred,

427
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,060
even inside your brain, that's all recorded.

428
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,400
And we have access to those through our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

429
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,780
And friends, we're going to continue with the show.

430
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
I hope you're, once again, I hope you're in headphones.

431
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,600
This is a real headphone show.

432
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,760
How do we know you're not being a Todd Bob?

433
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,900
Oh, God.

434
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,980
What in the name of the world are you coming to?

435
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,200
Don't listen to him.

436
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,040
Don't listen to him.

437
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,120
Yes, you can find help.

438
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,360
You can be deprogrammed.

439
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,700
You can find out the truth.

440
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,640
They beat me every day.

441
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,560
I know you're a dumbass.

442
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,240
They force you to sleep on boards.

443
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,960
But that's the last.

444
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,260
No, he's not.

445
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,820
He's a bastard.

446
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,540
He's a witness.

447
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,840
He's going to reveal.

448
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,860
So, all right.

449
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,640
Let's stay in the house.

450
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Let's have geniuses came in.

451
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,880
They took all my furniture and sold it to buy me this neck brace that I can't take off now.

452
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,000
They said it was a living being.

453
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
I love that.

454
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,800
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

455
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,840
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

456
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,560
Here comes the frat.

457
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,820
At each corner.

458
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,360
At the mouth.

459
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,560
Insert a thumb under the upper lip.

460
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:13,040
Now slide the thumbs along the inside of the upper lip until they are positioned just below and to the side of each nostril.

461
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,340
The results are thrilling.

462
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,460
Everywhere these messages are heard, souls are being saved and sick bodies are being healed.

463
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,180
Don't send them your money.

464
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,340
They've got me locked up in there.

465
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,800
Ah!

466
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,500
Yes.

467
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,520
Please disregard that.

468
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,580
I've lost my message.

469
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,680
Refuse to send money to the church of the subgenius.

470
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,320
What do you want to do?

471
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,280
And I too fell under the power of me.

472
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,420
What?

473
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,160
You want to tell them what it is?

474
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,860
And I don't think they should know.

475
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,860
They're trying to shut us up, but there are some genius dissidents.

476
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,700
There are...

477
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,260
There are...

478
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,360
There are...

479
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,540
There are...

480
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,380
There are...

481
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:57,460
There are...

482
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:57,460


483
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,000
There are...

484
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,160
There are...

485
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,180
There are...

486
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,020
Stop right there.

487
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,800
There are...

488
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,940
Are wretches.

489
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,320
Where's my money?

490
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,740
There it is.

491
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,860
Oh come on, drive over or I will show you.

492
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,040
I don't know what happened to me in that ohne Xinul Philip Huo!

493
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,220
Well, that was aのlly not again.

494
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,500
And here it, Voixen?

495
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,200
Do you taste that?

496
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,200


497
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,860
And who will eat that talk of action?

498
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:12,860


499
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,820
It's none of your business.

500
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,620
Fear not.

501
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,660
Farming here is deed.

502
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,840
Just the rage.

503
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,120
Don't leave me here.

504
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,320
They make me safe.

505
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,360
Don't leave me here.

506
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,060
I understand, Sam.

507
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,760
Don't let them kill me.

508
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,740
Torture me.

509
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,700
I understand.

510
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,720
They torture me.

511
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
I don't want to be killed.

512
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,420
They torture me.

513
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,100
Don't let them kill me.

514
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,160
Don't let them kill me.

515
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,060
Don't let them kill me.

516
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,520
I hate this place.

517
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,840
...Parrot and Parakeet training camp.

518
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,020
They torture me.

519
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,980
They torture me.

520
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,900
I hate this place.

521
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,340
...Parrot and Parakeet training camp.

522
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,160
I hate this place.

523
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,840
Go ahead. I'll kill them.

524
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,160
This has been the subgenius.

525
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,340
Parrot and Parakeet training camp.

526
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm finding my legs.

527
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,560
God and man be a witness.

528
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,340
Even in the belly of the Thunderbird,

529
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,400
I've been casting out the false prophets.

530
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,780
I'm busting and blowing my o-ring.

531
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,420
I'm busting and blowing my o-ring.

532
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,420


533
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,420


534
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,360
Run.

535
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,680
Run.

536
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,900
Me.

537
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:15,800
The Ministry of Information, Deputy Minister Eugene Holtman.

538
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,180
Good evening, David.

539
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,900
What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

540
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,900
Bad sportsmanship.

541
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:32,320
A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues.

542
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,000
They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win.

543
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,140
If these people would just play the game, they'd get a lot more out of life.

544
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:49,400
Nevertheless, Mr. Holtman, there are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy.

545
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,700
David, in a free society, information is the name of the game.

546
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,740
You can't win the game if you're a man.

547
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,180
I'm short.

548
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,660
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister, 7% of the gross national product.

549
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,160
I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayer.

550
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,160
People want value for money.

551
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,260
That's why we always insist on the principle of information retrieval charges.

552
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,020
It's absolutely right, sir, that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention

553
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,280
and for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation.

554
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,720
Do you believe that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?

555
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,500
Oh, yes.

556
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,540
Our morale is much higher than theirs.

557
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,920
They're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out,

558
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,440
and pretty consistently knocking them for six.

559
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,600
I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

560
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,520
Watch.

561
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,320
Law-abiding citizens have to subsidize criminals.

562
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,280
But, Mr. Heldman, the bombing campaign is now in its 13th year.

563
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,000
Beginner's luck.

564
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,980
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

565
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Thank you, David.

566
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,040
And a very Merry Christmas to you all.

567
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,280
Know then that it is the year 10,191.

568
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,600
They're out.

569
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:22,960
They're out.

570
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:23,340
They're out.

571
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,500
They're out.

572
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


573
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


574
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


575
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


576
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


577
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


578
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


579
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,500


580
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,060
They're out.

581
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,700
They're out.

582
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:24,760
They're out.

583
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:24,760


584
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:24,760


585
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:24,760


586
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,280
There has never been a world without a Bob.

587
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,080
Just as there's never been a Bob without a Dick.

588
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,380
His corresponding evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs.

589
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,900
The demons you may see during the initial hallucinations are not real.

590
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,080
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

591
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,500
So, always resurface, for!

592
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,080
the hypnosis slowly different

593
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,520
well yes i i was gonna make i was gonna make serious funny noises

594
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,880
because because we all know that bob is the man that makes all the ladies go

595
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,260
it's all the men go well please take a little rest it ain't an own

596
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:34,780
laid-back universe dear friends it's a little rest universe an action-packed universe

597
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,640
holes between their shoelaces

598
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,400
just because enormous bioplasm when it stretches throughout

599
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,560
oh did you get some of that too yes it was delicious

600
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,540
he was a little short chubby guy and that's where bob got the idea

601
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:17,600
they say he came in with checkered pants on but i just don't remember he was allowed to eat all

602
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,900
challenging anything changes bob's big boy was a real person that's true

603
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:33,560
a real bob and this parable goes to show that there is indeed always a real bob

604
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,260
there has to be a bob dear friend even the things which you cannot possibly believe in

605
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:45,900
bob's big boy indeed turn out to be an actual historic person and as it is with bob's big boy

606
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,780
surely it is with the far

607
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,860
far more impressive and major deity we know as the Avatar of All Slack.

608
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,480
That's how we know him.

609
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,380
Others call him Pimp, Hormonger.

610
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,760
Others call him a demon.

611
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,920
Or your mama.

612
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,760
Indeed.

613
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,000
And the children of Bob are everywhere.

614
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,320
Bob lives on in his millions and millions, literally millions, of illegitimate children.

615
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,300
All of them pressing lawsuits against me personally.

616
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,440
Well, Doctor, I'm sure you're used to it by now.

617
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:27,380
When I took on the job as Sacred Scribe at the church, I had no idea what I was going to be getting into.

618
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,600
We had 500 employees in 1980.

619
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,160
Now it's just me and someone else.

620
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,120
Well, that's just the Reagan-esque spirit that's been introducing us togetherness for its own sake.

621
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,120
And yet they say that Bob doesn't even exist.

622
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,040
There are some who say that there is no Bob.

623
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,380
If there's no Bob, then where did all of those dead bodies come from?

624
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,320
What about all those ads in the 50s that he posted?

625
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,260
Well, it says right here, the body store.

626
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,680
Dead Bob's for any occasion.

627
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,980
Oh, put that away.

628
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,280
That's not impressing anyone.

629
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,320
No Bob too small, no Bob too big.

630
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:10,060
No, really, guys, all kidding aside, I must admit, at least the official Father Church,

631
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,060
the sub-genius foundation, which we don't expect any of you except the...

632
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,280
stinking Bobbies to cling to.

633
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,980
Nevertheless, we have the only true word of Bob, the original apostles.

634
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,380
And as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing about Bob being dead is a ruse.

635
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,880
Bob staged that whole thing himself.

636
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,740
It was fashionable in the 60s.

637
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,120
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

638
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,460
It's the same frontwards and back, friends.

639
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,280
And there's a reason...

640
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


641
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


642
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


643
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


644
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


645
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


646
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


647
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


648
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


649
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


650
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


651
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,520
Bob.

652
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,820
There's an O in the middle.

653
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,800
A hole in the middle between those two Bs.

654
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,260
It's symbolic, friends.

655
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:00,360
You can look through that, the center of that O in Bob's name and see the future and the past.

656
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,200
But the spice must flow.

657
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,620
Oh.

658
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,680
I mean, and here he is.

659
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:35,680

O'day, Hembrew let it leave my top-in!

670
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,460
A woman, age 93, was killed in a merry-go-round

671
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,920
when she and her wheelchair were thrown from the thing

672
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,280
in Sherman's amusement park.

673
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,160
The

674
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,300
Yankee diddle went to town riding on a baby

675
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,340
in the corner just in time to see the naked lady.

676
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,840
The Yankee diddle went to town riding on a turtle

677
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,180
in the corner just in time to see the lady turtle.

678
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,580
Yankee diddle went to town with a bag of peaches.

679
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,380
He rode so fast to coming back, he smashed a multi-piece.

680
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,580
Yankee diddle went to town riding on a pony,

681
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,960
riding on a rocket, bumped into the Alamo.

682
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,280
Alamo.

683
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,560
He was on the

684
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,660
paid on baby rocket.

685
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,260
You have reached the correct number.

686
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,060
However, your call has already been analyzed and rejected.

687
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,980
This matter is out of our hands.

688
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:39,400
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on earth and gain

689
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,740
control of the situation, we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

690
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:53,880
If this had been an actual phone call, you would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time, and message when you hear the tone.

691
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,180
Thank you.

692
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,720
Reference time. Praise Bob.

693
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:10,260
This is Robert Anton Wilson, and about my appearance for the Church of the Subgenius, Jeff Rosenbaum, who arranges the tours.

694
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,600
We'll be calling you about that because he's the one who has all the flight plans and the airline tickets and his controls.

695
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,560
He will be the one who arranges the dates. If you win, I'll be there.

696
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,260
I better shut up because I'm running out of time. Praise Bob.

697
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,820
Praise Bob.

698
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,680
Well, yeah, that's right. That was Robert Anton Wilson.

699
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,260
About ten of you listeners probably know who he is.

700
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,240
We have the chance of setting up a lecture and or show or whatever.

701
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:48,460
With Robert Anton Wilson, he's going to be coming through Texas to do shows, at least in Austin, at the Book People's Bookstore.

702
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,080
I know about that one.

703
00:42:50,200 --> 00:43:00,620
We could set one up here in Dallas, but we need about $450 or $500 front money, see, to get him in.

704
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,800
That's just the cost of the show, basically.

705
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,400
We also need a place to do it.

706
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
If anybody is...

707
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,460
wild and crazy about Robert Anton Wilson and wants to get real involved in bringing him to Dallas, then let us know.

708
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:23,220
For those of you who don't know, he's the author of Illuminatus and Schrodinger's Cat and several other cosmic science fiction books that...

709
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,360
Well, you just have to check them out.

710
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:37,840
But write us here at the station or write to Bob at EO Box 1403.

711
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,720
We'll be right back.

712
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,920
We'll be right back.

713
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,960
What are you talking about, man?

714
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,520
But hurry.

715
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,440
But hurry.

716
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,360
But hurry.

717
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,100
But hurry.

718
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,920
All right, it's Nick.

719
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,620
Give me a call.

720
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,100
Oh, too bad we missed you.

721
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,560
This is Mike and Pam in Chicago.

722
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,460
We didn't know if you had caught Pee-Wee's Playhouse this morning.

723
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,600
But Bob was prominently displayed on the bulletin board.

724
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,740
If you didn't get it, let me know and I'll send you off a copy.

725
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,000
Have a good one.

726
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,160
Bye.

727
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,920
How long have you been in the U.S. of A?

728
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,820
Three months.

729
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,400
Where from?

730
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,580
Hong Kong.

731
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,740
What happens?

732
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,700
You stay here a while?

733
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,200
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

734
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,600
Maybe.

735
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,260
Maybe.

736
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,840
Take your tie off, please.

737
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,360
Yeah, I know what you mean.

738
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,360
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

739
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,440
Wow.

740
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,260
Whoa.

741
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,800
Whoa.

742
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:01,820
Whoa.

743
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,340
Whoa.

744
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,360
Whoa.

745
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,940
Whoa.

746
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,800
Whoa.

747
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:05,860
Whoa.

748
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,120
Whoa.

749
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:06,740
Whoa.

750
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:06,760


751
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,220
Whoa.

752
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,540
Whoa.

753
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:07,800
Whoa.

754
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,120
Whoa.

755
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,360
Whoa.

756
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,180
Oh, my God.

757
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:38,100
Oh, my God.

758
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,820
Oh, my God.

759
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,380
Oh, my God.

760
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,460
Landsman.

761
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,360
Landsman.

762
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,820
Landsman.

763
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,540
Landsman.

764
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Oh, my God.

765
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,460
Landsman.

766
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


767
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


768
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,980
Oh, my God.

769
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,080
You want to hurt me and solve the mystery?

770
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,720
You're not doing it right.

771
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,380
I brought you slack.

772
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
What do you mean brought you slack?

773
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,960
Died for your sins. Nobody knows how many times.

774
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,800
The only thing that ever brought me slack was leaving Paul at St. Louis.

775
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,340
I'm not here, Bob.

776
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,000
I shared this message with you.

777
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:29,300
I was the only slack I ever got out of this damn church and it cost me $3,000 to have him shipped back.

778
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,000
Well, most people don't fear Bob. Don't fear him a bit.

779
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,480
Oh, they think Bob's always going to be their buddy.

780
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,460
And then as soon as they think Bob's going to be their buddy, they think Bob's going to be their buddy.

781
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:38,460


782
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,200
Bob's dead.

783
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,880
They turn around. They think he ain't looking anymore.

784
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,160
They turn around and go to the pinks.

785
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,580
Going to the pinks, every one of them.

786
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,940
Oh, friends, he's just testing you.

787
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,060
He's been testing you for two years.

788
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,860
He knows if you've been bad or good.

789
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,700
Oh, yeah.

790
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,660
But more people are frightened of Gary than frightened of Bob.

791
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,740
Anybody want to go to an amusement park?

792
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,260
Why does this situation persist?

793
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,840
Well, it's because of the general loss of faith.

794
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,460
Companies that modernize and viewing their children as their own.

795
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:08,460


796
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:08,460


797
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,600
The fact that one can no longer support the fragility, superstition, and fanaticism of an earlier time

798
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:20,280
when one might well have believed in the smiling, pipe-smoking, benevolent figure known from the book of the subterranean.

799
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,320
That's right. That was really beautiful.

800
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,440
Very touching, Al.

801
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,520
It was just beautiful.

802
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,600
Could you repeat that?

803
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,800
Everybody welcome.

804
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,340
Now I'm here to talk about the conspiracy again, as usual.

805
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,700
But I'll talk about a different conspiracy this time.

806
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,040
The conspiracy within the Church of the Subterranean.

807
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,360
A drug of a great extruder.

808
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:00,160
There is a conspiracy that's a way of our breathing in.

809
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,280
And I think most of you know what I mean by the conspiracy.

810
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,780
Oh, really?

811
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,220
Yes.

812
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:05,460


813
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,220
The conspiracy is a conspiracy that he calls back.

814
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,960
It will be a world we can't stop.

815
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,560
All is well, Lord.

816
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,920
And it's coming again.

817
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,520
All is well, Lord.

818
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,020
All is well, Lord.

819
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,860
All is well, Lord.

820
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,120
All is well, Lord.

821
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,240
And it's coming again.

822
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,900
And we don't want the answers upon us.

823
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,580
And we need more to be honest.

824
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,580
All is well, Lord.

825
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,900
All is well, Lord.

826
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,320
All is well, Lord.

827
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,340
And it's coming again.

828
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,780
It's coming again.

829
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,300
All is well, Lord.

830
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,820
All is well, Lord.

831
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,100
And it's coming again.

832
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,200
Yes, I am the purple flower of hell, Connie.

833
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,240
Give me wide birth when I drop my drow's mother nature's spools.

834
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,580
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

835
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,680
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon.

836
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,700
Which in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

837
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,280
and carnage, insanity, and destruction

838
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,960
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

839
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,800
Bob brings a new destiny for America,

840
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,140
a time of cataclysmic economic change

841
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,860
that will offer untold riches and power

842
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,860
to those in the know,

843
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,460
while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes

844
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,280
fry in hell on Earth.

845
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,140
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

846
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,660
will usher in a spiritual rebreath

847
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,100
and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

848
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,460
supernatural bridges,

849
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,360
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

850
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,900
that will transform the lives of those

851
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,640
who dare to seek them and pay for them.

852
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,360
That's right.

853
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,200
You're lucky to live in the end time.

854
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,180
Here's more!

855
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:25,960
Here's what he brought.

856
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,280
Wise up!

857
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,740
They're out to get you.

858
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,140
Moving podium.

859
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,760
Prod.

860
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,780
And having once prodded moves on.

861
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,260
I'm not moving.

862
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,820
You know, the subgenius is not just below a genius,

863
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,460
whatever that may be.

864
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,420
The subgenius does not pretend to super knowledge,

865
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,700
but to subknowledge.

866
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,880
Knowledge.

867
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


868
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,000
Knowledge.

869
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,140
Knowledge.

870
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,180
Knowledge.

871
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,260
Knowledge.

872
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,040
The underthings.

873
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,940
The underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

874
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,700
The foundation garment, if you will.

875
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,740
Underlying reality.

876
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,740
You see, the subgenius is a strange beast indeed.

877
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,040
Give me a chance.

878
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,980
You'd be a fan of sound effects while you're at it, would you?

879
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,080
Oh, yeah, and some show stretchers.

880
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,480
And listen to him.

881
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,340
I need some show stretchers back.

882
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,200
Yes, friends.

883
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:34,920
How about something to eat?

884
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,800
Little did many of you know, but this isn't the only subgenius show.

885
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:54,040
In fact, there's six weekly subgenius shows now in New York, Beijing, New Jersey, Richmond, Virginia, St. Louis, Dallas.

886
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,100
Come on, hurry now.

887
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,500
We have to catch the last one.

888
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,040
I gave the anti-virgin a high-protein tonsil wash.

889
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,060
I'm a bacteriological weapon.

890
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,320
I'm armed and I'm loaded.

891
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,180
I'm a fission reactor.

892
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,700
I fight plutonium.

893
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,320
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

894
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,720
When they plug me in, the lights go out.

895
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:19,660
In Hong Kong, I weigh 666 pounds with zero gravity.

896
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,980
Come and get me.

897
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,660
I don't ever die.

898
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,900
I don't ever die.

899
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,760
He's not dead.

900
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,180
He's not dead.

901
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,220
He's not dead.

902
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:47,580
He's not dead.

903
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:47,700
He's not dead.

904
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,440
He's not dead.

905
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,460
He's not dead.

906
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:49,780
He's not dead.

907
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,640
He's not dead.

908
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:04,860
Soon they'll begin to fold space, far off in the control rooms of Spice Gas, traveling without moving.

909
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,960
Ivan Stang, 15, shows scars after being attacked by an alligator near West Palm Beach, Florida, Monday.

910
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:23,860
Ivan and a friend were swimming in the lake when suddenly he was grabbed by the head and pulled underwater by a giant sharp-toothed saurian.

911
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:35,400
I couldn't see anything but teeth and didn't know what had hold of me until the gator let loose and swam away, said Ivan, who suffered wounds requiring 41 stitches.

912
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,560
This is supposed to be a religious show.

913
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,880
Now what is the interpretation of this parable, my friends?

914
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,620
The alligator is the worldly mob.

915
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,920
The rabble, who always seek to devour and assimilate the holy men of the Church of the Subgenius.

916
00:57:51,060 --> 00:58:01,280
The lone swimmer, buoyed up by the fluid element, represents, upon the other hand, the striving outward force of the Church of the Subgenius,

917
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:08,560
which requires 41 stitches, the same number as the number of bullet holes in Bob's bullet-reddled body.

918
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,240
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

919
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,180
What are we going to do?

920
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,860
Wouldn't you like revenge?

921
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,600
Revenge on these mediocrities?

922
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

923
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:26,180
These pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens, these normals who have made normality the norm?

924
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,740
Well, no, I wouldn't like revenge on those people.

925
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,140
I'd like revenge on you, Ivan, because you've taken one too many $20 check from me.

926
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,260
I've never got...

927
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,500
I want my slack.

928
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,440
Let's see your Subgenius membership card, hmm?

929
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,080
Now let's not get into the...

930
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,080
I mean, say the end times came a little bit soon, Gary.

931
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,900
I have my...

932
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,960
I mean, I don't know if you'd make it on the escape saucers of the sex goddesses without your little Subgenius membership card.

933
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:51,860
I'd sure try.

934
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:55,760
Ah, this is a great example you're setting for the people out here.

935
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,180
See, I've got my Bob-a-mirror card here.

936
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,380
It says that I paid up to 1997?

937
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:08,700
You see, Gary is the Rasputin of the Church of the Subgenius, often sought for, but rarely encountered.

938
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:14,720
And it is this self-same learning for slack which separates us from them.

939
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,600
You're not the hip.

940
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,900
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness, yet he never feels cheated.

941
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,460
He thinks it's natural.

942
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,760
He thinks it's fine.

943
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,940
Who... big deal.

944
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,440
Who cares?

945
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,340
Well, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Sang.

946
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:37,080
And, uh, we've been getting some calls tonight from people who apparently never heard of the Church of the Subgenius before,

947
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,760
don't know anything about it, don't know that there's acres and acres of reading material available,

948
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,700
don't know...

949
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:50,180
which is up at least to the level of the incredible mixing you're hearing on this show.

950
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,300
Uh, and you can write for information.

951
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,680
That's all we can tell you on this station.

952
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,440
For very good reason.

953
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,000
Because you need to send your money to the station.

954
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,860
But, uh, you can send your letters of your questions, send your questions to Bob.

955
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,540
That's J.R. Bob Dobbs.

956
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,800
And, friends, that address is coming up.

957
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,160
As you stay tuned for Ron Lindsey's Soul Oldies.

958
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,100
Have that pencil ready by now?

959
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:31,400
Well, you need to write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

960
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,440
Oh, Ron just got here.

961
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,360
So, friends, your hour of slack is coming to an end.

962
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,680
But be ready for more slack.

963
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:43,680
More slack dripping and leaking all over you from Ron Lindsey's Soul Oldies.

964
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,940
Ha ha, yes.

965
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,200
I suppose we could get him, but...

966
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,040
they're nothing but half-witted cattle...

967
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:10,400
racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse and stampeding you along with them.

968
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,560
But what do you care?

969
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,940
Oh, you've got slack.

970
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:13,200
Slack.

971
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:13,860
Yeah.

972
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,760
Anybody want to get on the slack?

973
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:16,240
You've got slack.

974
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:16,800
That's them all.

975
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,380
Oh, get along, little bobbies.

976
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,760
Go head on down to Dobbs Town now.

977
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,160
Get on in that Dobbs Town corral, you little bobbies.

978
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,880
Ha ha ha.

979
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:28,780
Hmm.

980
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,580
Oh, what's up?

981
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,300
Oh, yeah.

982
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,040
Oh, there's a nice fat one.

983
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:40,740
Yes, he'll be a good trading commodity come the bargaining session with the exes.

984
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,780
Ha ha ha.

985
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,000
Ha ha ha.

986
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,020
First off, I noticed y'all don't talk about religion much.

987
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,280
I guess it's real hip out here in California.

988
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,060
It's a more humanistic approach to what's like this.

989
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,740
No, we believe in just letting the holy benediction of Bob flow out like pus and mustard.

990
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,920
Just don't underpin the true power of the show.

991
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,120
It's very fashionable to say Bob is a good man.

992
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,640
Oh, he was a prophet.

993
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,340
But, uh...

994
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,840
This is a chance.

995
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,020
This is a chance.

996
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,060
This is a chance.

997
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,840
I don't go for the wild superstitions.

998
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,860
Certainly not.

999
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,500
Very fashionable.

1000
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,200
It happens to be serious and crazy.

1001
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,180
Oh.

1002
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:22,620
Oh.

1003
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,120
Oh, so cold.

1004
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,040
But, silently, I slow to ease my spirit like Bob.

1005
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,520
In humble trust, my eyelids shiver.

1006
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,680
In reverential resignation.

1007
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,680
No wish to strive.

1008
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,720
No thought expressed.

1009
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,260
Only a sense of suffocation.

1010
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,500
With a groove I only got, we shall all be moved.

1011
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,800
Ready or not, here we come.

1012
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,220
Getting down on the one which we've been feeding.

1013
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,900
Can I get it on my foot?

1014
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,060
But, good God!

1015
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,000
Oh, there's more to come.

1016
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,280
Oh, turn my gas down!

1017
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:07,700
Oh, there's more to come.

1018
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
Oh, turn my gas down!

1019
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,360
We might find a way, but a new move shall take us to a better life.

1020
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:19,260
Oh, don't tell me now.

1021
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:25,620
I knew more of what you're talking for.

1022
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,580
You don't tell me now.
