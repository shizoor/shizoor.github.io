1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,700
Oh, what's that?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,940
Sounds like an air raid alert.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,260
That's peculiar, they didn't announce it.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,300
Turn on the radio, hurry.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,780
...as well as a press conference to introduce what is supposedly a creature from another planet.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,860
Professor Tomlin is about to speak, and we'll try to catch his word.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,360
And I'm quiet.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,240
Gentlemen, I wish to present to you...

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,120
The Self-Genius Power of Splash!

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
...is a machine.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,740
Probably the most dangerous machine ever invented.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,060
He is telepathic as well.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,700
He can read your thoughts like a book.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,680
He knows exactly what each of you is thinking at this very instant.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,740
Yes?

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,840
Do you expect us to swallow this nonsense?

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,620
Not without proof, gentlemen.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,560
It's life online!

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,740

And now...

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,460
Lead, follow, or get out of his way.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,920
Helping entrepreneurs find the secret to success on the web.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,720
With advice from Startup to Empire.

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,140
He's making money, making waves, and he's doing it all with that...

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,560
GoDaddy-esque fun.

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,580
It's Bob...

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,600
What was all that Bob stuff about then?

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,740
What was all that Bob stuff about then?

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,900
Bob stuff.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,740
Bob stuff.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,500
Bob stuff.

33
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,620


34
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,500
Bob stuffs.

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,900
Bob.

36
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,740
Bob.

37
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,700
Bob!

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,140
Bob Bob.

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:08,940
Bob.

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,620
Bob!

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,180
Bob!

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,080
I say, Bob, I think this calls for a celebration!

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
How about a game of cup and ball?

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,060
And a slap of tea at Mrs. Megan's pie shop?

45
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,500
Bob.

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,580
Bob.

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,100
Bob!

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,060
Bob!

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,200
Bob! Bob!

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,060
Bob! Bob!

51
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,680
Bob! Bob!

52
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,860
We're a couple of fine lads together, aren't we?

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,140
Let's get russet and talk about girls, eh?

54
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,160
Hey Taxi Bob, are you

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
picking up some... some...

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,020
some ladies?

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,540
Carrying them to their places?

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,940
I could, I could go over and

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,920
see, but I haven't been doing

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,020
that lately. What kind of line

61
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,720
would you give me if you were gonna

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,740
pick me up?

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Hey baby, do you wanna ride home?

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,900
Wow, that's pretty clever. Where's home?

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,040
Do you wanna ride home? That works?

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,060
Does that work for you?

67
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,480
I don't know.

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I get her either my home or her home.

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,020
Hey baby, do you wanna

70
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,680
ride home? I'm gonna try,

71
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,840
I'm right, wait a minute, where's my pen? I'm gonna write

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,920
that down. You gotta say it just like that.

73
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,280
That's it.

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,400
Oh.

75
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,060
Hmm.

76
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,740
What makes me feel funny in my mouth?

77
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,320
It's the sex goddesses.

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,160
Oh yeah, when you get the sex goddesses

79
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,700
on the cab, you really gotta watch out.

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,600
You gotta watch out.

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,760
We have our own sex goddess here.

82
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,640
Our ex goddess.

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,920
Ex goddess.

84
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,340
Ex goddess.

85
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,780
Ex. Ex. Ex.

86
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,540
Ex. Oh my god.

87
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,280
I didn't think of that before.

88
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Do you dare to know the

89
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,140
secret of ex, ex, ex,

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
ex goddess?

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,200
Do you dare to pass through the doorway

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,580
and do

93
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,400
ex, ex,

94
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,740
ex, just like we were talking about

95
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,560
Reverend Stang?

96
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,140
What shameful things happened to the women

97
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,020
in Dr. Tar's

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,680
tortured

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,240
This

100
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,060
is filled with terror, suspense,

101
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
and horror.

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,640
Dr. Tar's

103
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,200
tortured

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
will etch itself into your mind

105
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,660
with shock after naked shock.

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
Dr. Tar's

107
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,280
tortured

108
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,960
If there was torture, that's a crime.

109
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,120
If there was crime, there were criminals.

110
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,640
Who ordered the torture?

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,040
That's the problem.

112
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,500
It's political, and the right is going

113
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:53,200
Go do this for me.

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
And he'll just do it.

115
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,340
We are America.

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
I don't give a rat's ass if it helps.

117
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,280
We are America.

118
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,040
We do not fucking torture.

119
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,060
So the lawyers who would basically tell them

120
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,140
Go do this for me.

121
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,960
And he'll just do it.

122
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,020
It will be done.

123
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,180
Well that's a matter of opinion, Judge.

124
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,480
I mean a lot of that's opinion, right?

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,860
We've got Bob saying one thing, we've got a lot of people saying another.

126
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,200
You put them in a confined space with a caterpillar,

127
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,200
you push them up against a flexible wall.

128
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,380
We've had the former CIA director came out

129
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,680
with some kind of cushioning on their neck to prevent whiplash.

130
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,380
The CIA manipulates the Justice Department

131
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,880
into letting it do whatever it wants.

132
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
And I read these memorandums.

133
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,120
This is torture.

134
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,240
I mean that's where we are, isn't it?

135
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,200
It's that simple, isn't it?

136
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,020
But here's the point. The point is this.

137
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,940
We are America. We do not fucking torture.

138
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
The CIA manipulates the Justice Department

139
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,180
into letting it fucking torture.

140
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,760
Bob was trying to sell books and does a very good job of that.

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,260
I agree.

142
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,960
Hot poker through the eye, pulling your ass off the pliers.

143
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,140
So you read it, how was the experience?

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm only about two thirds of the way through them

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,420
and I'm having trouble getting all the way through them

146
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,460
because Shep, I've got to tell you,

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,420
as Judge McCall Tanner says,

148
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,880
You need to read them. You need to read them.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Absolutely. You know it when you see it.

150
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,100
What this is about is a series of dots

151
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,580
which people are now mentally connecting

152
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,860
in a backward fashion.

153
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm afraid that there's a lot of truth

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,680
to what you're saying.

155
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,040
It makes no sense whatsoever.

156
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,400
What we need right now is more information

157
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
about who, how, when, what permission.

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
We don't torture people. We don't torture people.

159
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,840
And the moment that's not the case,

160
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,880
I want off the train.

161
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
We're joining America.

162
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,300
And it's full of

163
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,660
lying, thinking cocksuckers that you can't trust at all.

164
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,120
Governors,

165
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,100
commissioners and what not.

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,660
And by God, that's just a new way of things

167
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,780
and you're just gonna have to get used to it, John.

168
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,200
Alright.

169
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,260
You're gonna have to accept it and learn to control yourself.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,860
You get no argument from me!

171
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,320
What is your opinion of Bob?

172
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,200
I refuse to go along with this

173
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,260
I want to know all your lies, lies,

174
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,480
lies, lies, Bob you wicked

175
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,560
wicked devil!

176
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,960
Shit!

177
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,300
AAAAAAAAAAH!

178
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,540
Lies, lies, lies, lies!

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,840
AAAAAAAAAAH!

180
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,380
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

181
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,780
Shit!

182
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,640
I love Bob, that's my favorite of all the pretenders.

183
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,220
Shit!

184
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,360
What do you have to say about Bob, the man, the legend, the saint of souls?

185
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,820
That's dick.

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,300
Shit!

187
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,600
Bob, sort of hurt me and I had to see a doctor.

188
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,660
Ha ha ha ha ha!

189
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,160
That's dick.

190
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,620
Shit!

191
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,600
Reptile Newt porn.

192
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,100
That's dick.

193
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,460
Reptile Newt porn.

194
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,800
Yes.

195
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,820
I can't have an opinion on something I've never met.

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,780
I can't have an opinion on something I've never met.

197
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,180
Never met.

198
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,240
We can sing some really dirty songs.

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,320
Oh, God.

200
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Get lost, creep!

201
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,760
Hello there, Bob!

202
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,540
Bob.

203
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,180
Bob.

204
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,980
Bob.

205
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,300
Bob.

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840
Bob.

207
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,420
Bob.

208
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,480


209
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Bob.

210
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,340
Bob.

211
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,360
Bob.

212
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,060
Bob.

213
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,360
Bob.

214
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,400
Bob.

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:21,740
Bob.

216
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,480
Bob.

217
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:28,800
Bob.

218
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,900
Well, Bob.

219
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,440
Welcome on board.

220
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,880
I like you, young Bob.

221
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,460
You've got balls.

222
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,080
Is he making fun of me?

223
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,920
That and more of it to come was by Dr.

224
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,320
Slackjaw, also known as Reverend Royal Decapitator, who also did many of the collages in this episode,

225
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,020
although not the ones just now, which were by Reverend Exister and Sweetness McGee of the

226
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,960
Ministry of Slack Show podcast.

227
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,180
Also, we heard the Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley with hosts Puzzling, Philodrum

228
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,120
and Dr. Howland, special guests Chaos, McBob, Kat, Princess Wee, and me, Reverend Ivan Stagg,

229
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
and Phineas Snarko.

230
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,220
Those shows are available in full, by the way, for the KPA.

231
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,220


232
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,280
And from QuiveringBrain.com.

233
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,560
The music in the background is by the Flyin' Ryan Brothers album, under the influence found

234
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,100
at Ryanetics.com.

235
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,180
R-Y-A-N-etics.com.

236
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,840
Friends, X Day is a-comin', so we're talking about that a lot now.

237
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,580
But before we return to that subject, we're going to take a short side trip to Austin,

238
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,620
Texas during the winter's subgenius family vacation.

239
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,120
Princess Wee is laughing because I have already said this once, but with the recorder not

240
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,560
on.

241
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,380
So we're digesting a fine, fine Waffle House meal.

242
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,040
Mmm, that food was restorative.

243
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,540
It was Princess Wee's first Waffle House experience.

244
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,940
I will live now.

245
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:18,200
We're heading for Austin, down the very, very boring highway of the city.

246
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,200


247
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,200


248
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,160
The I-35.

249
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,560
There could not be a more boring highway than the one from Dallas to Austin.

250
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,940
Except possibly the one from Dallas to Little Rock.

251
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,640
Anyway, we're going to visit the great G. Gordon Gordon, former bodyguard of Dobbs,

252
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,260
the late Bob Dobbs.

253
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,100
Or rather, the late several times and then resurrected.

254
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,500
I guess you could say he wasn't much of a bodyguard.

255
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,740
Um.

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,760
And, uh.

257
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
And Sphinx Drummond also lives in Austin.

258
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:59,860
We'll be visiting him and slacking off before we head out into the wilds of far west Texas

259
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,220
and rural New Mexico and all the state parks and stuff.

260
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,980
This will be our last visit with friends and family until we get to Los Angeles.

261
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,920
Where the liquor stores are big, grand, and majestic.

262
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,740
There are Lone Stars everywhere.

263
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,120
And lots and lots of elephants.

264
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,660
You see elephants on cars.

265
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,240
Are you talking about L.A.?

266
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,140
No, I'm talking about here.

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,300
Texas.

268
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,100
Texas.

269
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,620
I've seen.

270
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,140
The elephants are almost crushing the cars.

271
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,900
Yes.

272
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,720
And yet it's a fad in Texas.

273
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,400
They love to stick an elephant on the back of their pickup truck even though it almost destroys the suspension.

274
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,460
They're usually baby elephants.

275
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,140
Yeah.

276
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,300
And, uh.

277
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,560
And it's true.

278
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,620
All the liquor stores that I remember from when I lived here 15 years ago are still there.

279
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,980
Although nothing else that I remember was.

280
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,600
Well, they're huge.

281
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,280
They have these enormous signs and sometimes big figures.

282
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,220
Yeah.

283
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,860
They're giant liquor store cowboys.

284
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,160
Neon cowboys.

285
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,560
Well, the liquor stores in Texas are the size of many towns in other states.

286
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes.

287
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,920
That's what I was getting at.

288
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,040
But so are the cow droppings.

289
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,620
So, anyway, we'll report back in case anything interesting happens.

290
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,720
So it may be a long time before we report back.

291
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,780
Be our time.

292
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
Be instantaneous your time.

293
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,500
Praise time control.

294
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,320
Well, it sounds like the party just entered the room.

296
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,880
G Gordon Gordon is here.

297
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,000
G Gordon Gordon.

298
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,140
Big drum, uh, drumming.

299
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,440
All right.

300
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,460
Yeah.

301
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,340
Give them all my best.

302
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,000
All the best.

303
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,240
Just singing another to Rocknar.

304
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,140
Is this, is this the Austin Clench?

305
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,300
Oh, really?

306
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,440
Oh, yeah.

307
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,860
They're beautiful.

308
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,860
You know, speaking, well, changing the subject to Rocknar Winacorton, uh, I made a new Facebook

309
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,560
friend on Friday on my birthday.

310
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,560
Yeah, this is the life.

311
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,080
This, this, well, is this something that'll compare to your 24-hour marriage from the last

312
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,940
X Day I saw you at?

313
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,360
Uh, maybe.

314
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:19,780
Uh.

315
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,620
Rocknar's got a girlfriend.

316
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah.

317
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,660
Rocknar's got a girlfriend.

318
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,860
I hope it's a girl.

319
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,460
It is a girl.

320
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,240
I hope it's a girl.

321
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,880
It looks like it.

322
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,040
No, she's the, she's the CEO of Rocknar.

323
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,900
You know, on the internet, on the internet nobody knows you're a dog.

324
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,940
That's an old New Yorker cartoon.

325
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,540
Now, uh, um, this girl, I don't know if I can say the name of her kind.

326
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,420
She's a CEO of a company, and I don't know if I can, I'm not gonna say her name, obviously,

327
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,100
but she's a CEO of an offline to online dating company.

328
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh my God.

329
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,240
You, I've got men, you have scored.

330
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
She's probably a millionaire.

331
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,720
Dude, you're, you're dating a CEO of a dating company?

332
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,780
That's like, that's like having Bill Gates come over and fix your computer for you.

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,020
She has her pick of men, and she picked Rocknar.

334
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,440
Well, I did get my hair cut, and I was wearing my blue suit and tie.

335
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,520
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


337
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


338
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


339
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


340
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


341
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


342
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


343
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


344
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


345
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


346
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,520


347
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I bet you even took a shower, didn't you?

348
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,840
Oh yeah, I took two.

349
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,620
Whenever I go to court and I take a shower.

350
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,580
Rocknar went to court and he did right.

351
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,480
Crab bones.

352
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,260
They lost him.

353
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,220
I got to see Skull Rock at Joshua Tree National Monument.

354
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,700
My son said, Dad, I've always wanted to kind of go there, but I don't want to just see

355
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,520
a bunch of trees.

356
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,040
I know what a Joshua tree looks like, and I had to explain, well, it's called that,

357
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:49,660
but really the attraction is the twisted land formations and long stretches of desert.

358
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,660
The Joshua trees themselves, raising their arms to heaven as they are, most of them.

359
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,660
Well, the Ernesto trees are much more beautiful.

360
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,380
Ernesto's?

361
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,640
Ernesto's, yeah.

362
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,620
One nestles gently in them.

363
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,540
Well, we got hugged by a lot of those teddy bear jumping chollas.

364
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,840
Hugs, not drugs.

365
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,380
Really?

366
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,820
You got cholla?

367
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,120
Yes.

368
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,040
That's terrible.

369
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,520
Those things are nightmares.

370
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:21,460
Actually, we only, Princess Wee and I only had to pick spines out once in the whole trip.

371
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,340
You know how to do it.

372
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,480
You get two sticks and you just rip it off because if you touch it, you'll get them in

373
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,020
your fingers.

374
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,640
Yeah.

375
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,120
And then when you touch yourself, you get it right.

376
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:30,500
It's sad.

377
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,500


378
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,720
I'm from Texas.

379
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,640
I know how to handle a damn cactus.

380
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,860
Where are those jumping?

381
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,380
We eat cactus.

382
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
We eat cactus.

383
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,260
We eat cactus in Texas for breakfast.

384
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,340
We call it nopales.

385
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,260
That's right.

386
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,020
We had, Princess Wee had her first cactus.

387
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,460
No nopales.

388
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,400
When we went to visit G. Gordon Gordon.

389
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,380
You poly?

390
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,500
And Sphinx Drummond and Mrs. Gordon.

391
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,980
Oh, did you have migas?

392
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,100
Migas.

393
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,280
We had migas in Austin with the Drummond brother.

394
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,320
And we've got a caller from an Austin number now.

395
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,480
You're on air.

396
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,340
Hey, I've just been listening to your show and I just want to tell you, I think it's

397
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,860
pretty good.

398
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,000
I like what you all are saying.

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
And the way you say it.

400
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,420
Why, thank you.

401
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,440
That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me all year.

402
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,060
You say words all year.

403
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,940
I'm sure somebody, unless you're just really a bad guy, I'm sure somebody will say something

404
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,660
nicer before the end of the year.

405
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,380
And then this won't be the nicest thing anybody's said to you all year.

406
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,020
You know what though?

407
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,860
I got to tell you like why maybe I am a bad guy because I think that is the second time

408
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,980
I've told someone that's the nicest thing someone said to me all year.

409
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,180
And I think I'd probably say it again if I heard the first thing again.

410
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,840
Oh, man.

411
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,260
But the first thing I thought was on that level.

412
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,980
It was on that level.

413
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,140
Hmm.

414
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:53,900
Hmm.

415
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,720
Hmm.

416
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,360
Hmm.

417
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,900
It's just a friendly level.

418
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,140
That changes everything, man.

419
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,280
Well, the thing is though, like you're just a person that I don't know personally who

420
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,240
was calling up this radio show and telling me you like it.

421
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,380
Hey, that's a very nice thing to say to me.

422
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,900
And I like that.

423
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,560
I appreciate it.

424
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,300
Thank you very much.

425
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,600
And I hope to continue living up to the standard or living down the standard, whichever it

426
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,860
is.

427
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
He's a colonel.

428
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
We live up to our standards.

429
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,240
The guy that called in, he's a colonel.

430
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,520
I know.

431
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,880
Like a colonel of corn?

432
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,540
He used to be in the Swingin' Love Corpses.

433
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,800
He was the main vocalist and horn player at the Swingin' Love Corpses.

434
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,420
Hello there.

435
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,340
Is this true?

436
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,980
And that's how far he's fallen.

437
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,280
I think he's still here with us.

438
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


439
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


440
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


441
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


442
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


443
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


444
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


445
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


446
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


447
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,280


448
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,740
I think he's still here with us.

449
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,140
Is that true?

450
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,600
I don't know what the hell's going on.

451
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,220
I just want to say I'm enjoying the show a lot, but I don't think I have a lot to

452
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,560
contribute.

453
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,680
So I'm going to hang up now and-

454
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,740
Oh, no, no, no, no.

455
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,320
Don't do that.

456
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm good.

457
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,620
Why not?

458
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,620
I am.

459
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,500
I really am the main vocalist in the Swingin' Love Corpses.

460
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,560
Whatever.

461
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,860
Well, I heard a click.

462
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,800
I think they just lost the thing.

463
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,080
No, no.

464
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,520
No, he's still with us.

465
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,400
Still on his-

466
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,140
I don't think so.

467
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,200
I just need to listen to this other guy for a while because-

468
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,260
I don't think so.

469
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,260


470
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,260


471
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,640
I just need to listen to this other guy for a while because that's why I called

472
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:11,860
Ben.

473
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,980
I don't want him to hang up.

474
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,900
Bob.

475
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,760
Bob.

476
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,380
Bob.

477
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,860
Bob.

478
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,700
Bob.

479
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,640
Bob.

480
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,260
Bob.

481
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,740
Bob.

482
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,260
Bob.

483
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,340
Bob.

484
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,340


485
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,340


486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,760
Bob.

487
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,320
Bob.

488
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,640
Bob.

489
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,640


490
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:24,680


491
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:24,740


492
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,580
Bob.

493
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,520
Bob.

494
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:40,700
Bob.

495
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:40,960


496
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,740
Bob.

497
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,080
Bob.

498
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,720
Bob.

499
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,500
Bob.

500
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,280
Bob.

501
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,640
Bob.

502
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,160
Bob.

503
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,220
Bob.

504
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,340
Bob.

505
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,640
Bob.

506
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:02,660
Bob.

507
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:02,700
Bob.

508
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,260
Bob.

509
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,260


510
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:03,600


511
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:03,680
Bob.

512
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,020
Bob.

513
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,020


514
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,180
Bob.

515
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,220
Bob.

516
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,220


517
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,220


518
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,360
Bob.

519
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,200
Bob.

520
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,040
Bob.

521
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,940
Bob.

522
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,660
We're all going to go to hell because of you, Senator.

523
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,920
Oh, you were going to hell long before you met me.

524
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,320
Yeah, but I just now done found a girlfriend.

525
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,160
Thanks a lot.

526
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,200
It is safe to surmise that we are all going to hell.

527
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,580
Yeah, this is hell.

528
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,860
What do you mean going to hell?

529
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,460
Earth is hell without me.

530
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,940
If you're going to sin, you might as well be original about it.

531
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,660
We're the original sinners here on WCSB Cleveland.

532
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,460
Oh, that was the original seniors.

533
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,260
Get that in the bob.

534
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,260
What's the deal?

535
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,360
So what else are we talking about here?

536
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,660
What's the thing about the bob?

537
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,120
How much we covered my birthday?

538
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,660
It's all about you, isn't it, Rockhead?

539
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,820
Huh?

540
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,840
What?

541
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,780
Pete Bob?

542
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,900
I heard someone in the background in Austin.

543
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,820
Yeah, there's kind of a fair enough to call it a party

544
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,620
that's going on here in Austin.

545
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,240
At the Dostown 4.

546
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:22,440
Well, I recorded that streaming by laying this microphone on the keyboard.

547
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,720
It was tuned in on my laptop and surprisingly loud.

548
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,280
I just laid this right on the keyboard.

549
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,700
How's it sound?

550
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,800
I don't know.

551
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,120
Thank you.

552
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,660
Not as good as a direct recording.

553
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,860
Let's listen.

554
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,100
The whole thing is so incredibly stupid.

555
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,800
We're all going to be embarrassed.

556
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,260
It's so Escher-esque.

557
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,700
Maybe you won't.

558
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,640
I don't embarrass easy.

559
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,400
I can copy it.

560
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,280
Or it's stuck.

561
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,880
He's getting, still gets AOL.

562
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,860
Solicitations in the mail.

563
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,020
When you pull the pieces apart.

564
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,560
I do not get AOL.

565
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,580
That's what I keep old files and porno in.

566
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,440
I use them for rolling tries.

567
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
I use them for the containers.

568
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,140
Marvin says he's going to stay out of second-rate nursing home.

569
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,100
Because every time they send him one of those, remember the giant, for like 10 years, he

570
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,080
just saved them all unopened.

571
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,260
He has a stack this high of AOL.

572
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
How's that going to help?

573
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,280
Well, I don't know.

574
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,420
He's going to sell it on eBay.

575
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,760
You know, I don't know.

576
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,020
Ancient AOL mailings.

577
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,400
A complete set.

578
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,920
People will pay good money for that worthless thing.

579
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:39,920


580
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:39,920


581
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:39,920


582
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:39,920


583
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:39,920


584
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,780
I got every AOL promotional from time immemorial.

585
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,600
I got one every time.

586
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh, they came forever.

587
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,620
And I like these because these you keep, you know, you throw the AOL shit away and you've

588
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,980
got old, I mean, it's a nice little hard box.

589
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,960
I have a box of metal.

590
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,480
A bunch of metal boxes.

591
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,700
But these I like.

592
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,640
They're paper and you can put like two or three CDs in it, depending.

593
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,920
CDs?

594
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,920
No, you put your frappy in there.

595
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,900
No, you put your, you know, you put your, you know, you put your, you know, you put your

596
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,040
frappy in the little...

597
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,660
I forgot about that.

598
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,500
You have a strange idea of porno, Dr. Gordon.

599
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,120
What, that?

600
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,660
Yeah, those objects.

601
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,320
That's not porno.

602
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,400
Here.

603
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,800
Some people paint beautiful women.

604
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,860
I'll show you.

605
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,220
And then pop their legs off.

606
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,800
Some photograph beautiful women.

607
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,060
Here.

608
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,420
Most of them don't pop, cut their legs off.

609
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,540
Where are we?

610
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:35,960
I don't even know.

611
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,400
This guy makes these spiky...

612
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,900
That's good that most of them are dope.

613
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,880
Sex monologues.

614
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


615
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


616
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


617
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


618
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


619
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


620
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


621
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


622
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


623
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,880


624
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,780
You mean like 51%?

625
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,620
That's all so fat.

626
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Oh, wait, let me go see my...

627
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,940
When you say most, you mean like 51% or like 90%?

628
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,460
51.

629
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,320
So more often than not.

630
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah.

631
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm not looking.

632
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,660
Am I hitting the right button?

633
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,360
No, boss, it's always the same.

634
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,240
Here we go.

635
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,400
More often than not, then I always call him out.

636
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,700
You mean like 51%?

637
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,800
Stop pissing me off.

638
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,980
Hey, that's an obvious cactus vagina.

639
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,860
Yes.

640
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,840
It's called...

641
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:09,860
It's called...

642
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


643
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


644
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


645
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


646
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


647
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:09,860


648
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,860
The Sin of Marriage.

649
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,740
We'd put a big price tag on it with a title like that, it'll probably sell for thousands.

650
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,740


651
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,420
Yes.

652
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,180
Slow down.

653
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:35,980
So you've got a February 6th court date in the courthouse and it's 420 Blount...

654
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,840
What?

655
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,320
How do you pronounce that?

656
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:38,960
Blount Avenue.

657
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,180
Blount Avenue.

658
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,980
Blount Avenue, chewy for the

659
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,020
site refético.

660
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,320
Basically, it's Blount.

661
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,780
Blount Avenue.

662
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,200
Jimmy.

663
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,900
recreational.

664
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,460
May 21st, 2011.

665
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,140
The world will be coming to an end.

666
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,080
The world will be cracking apart.

667
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
And we're going to have massive earthquakes.

668
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,220
Judgment Day.

669
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,740
Don't forget.

670
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,740
There's billboards all up over the Bay Area.

671
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,400
Hey, wait a minute.

672
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,580
Hey, get those guys down from that building.

673
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,500
What was that date?

674
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,420
In Berkeley.

675
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
They're on top of your building.

676
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,180
What was that date?

677
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,020
Hey, you guys.

678
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,200
Hey, I'm standing right across the street from your station there.

679
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,880
It might be one of those armies of women.

680
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,300
Oh, really?

681
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,480
That's just maintenance.

682
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,120
It's moving around.

683
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,020
I'm going to take out my rocket launcher.

684
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,760
Okay, good idea.

685
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,820
That's some maintenance people.

686
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,880
Put that rocket away.

687
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
Those are plumbers.

688
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,100
We just hired them to fix the...

689
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,700
Those are the roofers.

690
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,720
Sink stopped up?

691
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,000
Call Pete the plumber.

692
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,880
Don't worry about it.

693
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,100
Really?

694
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,580
He won't be on issue at May 21st.

695
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,780
You've heard of Joe the plumber.

696
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,000
Pete Goldie is a plumber.

697
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,200
Is he a plumber, too?

698
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,240
Yes, in fact.

699
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,640
I want to write this down and put it in my...

700
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,120
They call him the tile doctor.

701
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,020
There he goes.

702
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,820
He fired his...

703
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
Wait, did I miss?

704
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,480
No, no.

705
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,420
I'm going to mark this down for May 21st in my...

706
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,200
End of the world.

707
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,680
Now, what time of day is that?

708
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,200
I want to make sure nothing intrudes on them.

709
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,540
Yeah, what time of day is the end of the world?

710
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,520
Is that going to be like before noon?

711
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,780
Am I going to have to worry about eating lunch that day?

712
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,940
This is doctor's orders.

713
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,460
Oh, I don't hold with this newfangled doctoring.

714
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,780
Plenty of problems.

715
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,440
I'll go to the wise woman.

716
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,140
Very well, then.

717
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,780
Three other...

718
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,120
Paths are open to you.

719
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,380
Three cunning plans to cure thy ailment.

720
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,340
Oh, good.

721
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,600
The first is simple.

722
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,880
Kill Bob.

723
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,820
Never.

724
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,840
Then try the second.

725
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
Kill yourself.

726
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,480
And the third?

727
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,120
The third is to ensure that no one else ever knows.

728
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,260
Ah, that sounds more like it.

729
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,780
How?

730
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,000
Kill everybody in the whole world.

731
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,280
What?

732
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,540
Listen, Bob.

733
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,280
I said, Bob.

734
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:29,960
I said, Bob.

735
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,760
I said, Bob.

736
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,440
I said, Bob.

737
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,200
I said, Bob.

738
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,500
Besides, I thought we were friends.

739
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,180
Well, we are friends, Bob.

740
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,640
Of course.

741
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,140
Good night.

742
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,380
Bob.

743
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,900
That's right.

744
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,840
Are they singing about Bob in the background?

745
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,060
The laying on of hands.

746
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,540
Yes.

747
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,960
Yes, as we do at the lake.

748
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,180
Eh, Reverend?

749
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,800
Well, we really weren't talking about the way you lay your hand.

750
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,060
I beg your pardon.

751
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm talking about our holy ceremony at Exeter.

752
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,160
As we waste our way into the future, it's better to give others slack.

753
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,460
As soon as we...

754
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,780
The bobbies come hopefully trooping into the water.

755
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,960
Moving forward to some obscure utopia.

756
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,700
At some distant time when we all shall hold hands together as one.

757
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,500
Even though the...

758
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,440
These simple children of nature have a great fear of old Sequaw.

759
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,520
Thinking as one.

760
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,560
Lost head of clunker at the bottom of the endless shaft.

761
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,820
We didn't have old Sequaw at the old Exeter place.

762
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,780
No, no, no.

763
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,280
Old Sequaw's a new feature of Exeter.

764
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,520
Unless he commuted from the frog pond.

765
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,840
Boy, it was a great Bob-tism too.

766
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,660
I kept my glasses on for that and turned on my mental recorder.

767
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,000
I'll have...

768
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,040
All memories to take me out to the end of my days.

769
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,460
The endless Bob-tism.

770
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,720
Or boob-tism in one case.

771
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:07,780
Reverend Back It On Up got boob-tized by having the breastages of Sister Decadence.

772
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,180
Which are sizable.

773
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,920
Commendable.

774
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,660
To save a week.

775
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,980
Those were dropped upon Back It On Up's little head.

776
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,280
And pushed her underwater.

777
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,520
And that was her boob-tism.

778
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,520
So great.

779
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,780
Quaint and merry.

780
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,700
And gay.

781
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,740
So gay and happy.

782
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,820
I've never seen a sad boob-tism.

783
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,300
No.

784
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,740
I can't even imagine that.

785
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,700
Boobs.

786
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,140
Bob's one O short of boob.

787
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,360
Yeah.

788
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,260
And everybody loves boob.

789
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah.

790
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,160
I'd like to crawl over an ocean of them on my belly.

791
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,880
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,280
A thank you Radio Synesthesia and WCSB Cleveland.

793
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,300
Before that we heard a billion clips from Royal Decapitator and the Puzzling Evidence Show as well.

794
00:28:51,300 --> 00:29:00,600
And now we go from talking about X Day to an actual recording from 14X Day Drill 2011 during a so-called live hour of slack.

795
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:11,440
The Grindhouse today, friends, if anyone gets completely bored with everything else that's happening.

796
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,600
And if you don't like sex with a beautiful live girl.

797
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,100
The Grindhouse, it's a...

798
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,840
Oh, the Turkish Superman rip-off.

799
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
It's a rough double feature.

800
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,080
Has anyone here seen the Superman, the Turkish Superman movie?

801
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,200
It's really amazing.

802
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:38,780
An old serial, part of a serial called The Phantom Creeps, number five, part five, that has a robot in it.

803
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,860
An ugly one.

804
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,220
Radar Men from the Moon, part five.

805
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,700
That's an early Commando Cody chapter play.

806
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,500
Devler Gilojur, or Iron Fist.

807
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,260
Which I assume is a foreign film.

808
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,680
Phantom Creep 6, Horrors of Spider Island.

809
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,000
Ah yes, the Horrors of Spider Island.

810
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:11,080
This is a German film and the horrors are not the exceptionally large spiders who bite the people who go to the island, but what the people turn into afterwards.

811
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,240
I've never seen that.

812
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,860
Yes, the Horrors of Spider Island.

813
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,820
And finally, the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed.

814
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:20,820


815
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,240
The zombies.

816
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,520
Oh well, if you want to wallow in bad film with that one.

817
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,540
It's a monster musical, folks.

818
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:38,260
And friends, the greatest thing about the Grindhouse showings and Dr. Dark's drive-in, Mystery Science Theater 3000 will not be there.

819
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,100
You'll have to be your own snarky silhouette to make your own comment.

820
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,460
You get to be the snarky bastard.

821
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,560
We need no mediator here.

822
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,940
We're at the church of the subgenius.

823
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,620
Uh...

824
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,440
Yeah, bring your own puppets.

825
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,560
Well there's our co-star, Father Joe Mama.

826
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,160
It's Papa Joe Mama.

827
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,920
He doesn't look very priestly today.

828
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,700
He's rushing, I see, from one of those sweat lodges.

829
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,580
He's rushing in haste.

830
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,680
Hail Papa Joe Mama.

831
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,960
Oh you, he gets to take his shirt off.

832
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,700
Well, uh...

833
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,660
Somebody's gotta bring your 80s.

834
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,800
Scoot in as close as you can, because we've hung Bob in such a way that he's not going to be able to see us.

835
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:20,800


836
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:20,800


837
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:20,800


838
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:27,080
He blocks whoever is the third or fourth, uh, big bullshitter.

839
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,940
Well that's the problem with this church. Bob is always blocking all the stars with his swinging corpse.

840
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,460
Of love.

841
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,040
These notes I'm looking at are my big rant sermon for Starwood.

842
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,440
Right, right.

843
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,560
I never get to do a rant here because it's all preaching to the saved.

844
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,780
I have a big binder of notes for ranting too, but unfortunately it's filled with...

845
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:50,780


846
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,660
notes of things not to rant about.

847
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,020
Well, look at those pages and think of the opposite of each quiddity and you can come out with something.

848
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,480
Oh, thanks. Changing the subject. Have you seen Cowboys and Aliens yet?

849
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,640
Uh, I saw enough of the trailer that I feel like I saw the movie, yes.

850
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,680
No, no, no, no. Watch the movie.

851
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,160
I mean that. Watch the movie. It is really a good movie.

852
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
Of course we can't make any calls to action.

853
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,260
Yeah, right. Get those toothpicks.

854
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,800
Rock on!

855
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,280
Okay, Robbie.

856
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,760
First we'll call the action.

857
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,760
The action is thang, though.

858
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,100
Have you ever read a book called The Bobliographons? The Encyclopedia of Slack?

859
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,460
That was the original Cowboys vs. Aliens, wasn't it?

860
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:40,080
It was Cowboys and Indians vs. the Aliens was produced by J.R. Bob Dobbs in the 1950s.

861
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:48,560
And believe you me, when we heard that Hollywood was making a movie by almost the exact same title,

862
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,840
Reverend Chris Lee and I both got a bit concerned and had our fingers ready to call a lawyer

863
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,200
when I then read that they had based that movie on a comic book neither one of us had ever heard of.

864
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,060
So I guess, you know, when it's Cowboys and Indians vs. Aliens time...

865
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,660
Which is what this movie is. It is Cowboys and Indians vs. Aliens.

866
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,500
Cowboys and Indians vs. the Aliens.

867
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,740
When it's steam engine time, you get steam engines.

868
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,860
What I like...

869
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,540
When it's the power of slack, I get steam engines.

870
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:18,540


871
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,980
I get to put my disease in you.

872
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,880
And my disease, I'm happy to announce, is now in everyone hearing my voice.

873
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,620
And mine is Cowboys vs. the Paleontologists.

874
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,080
I vote strictly on that ticket.

875
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:38,280
There was a series of books by Harry Turtledove about Nazis and Communists vs. Aliens.

876
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,100
Really?

877
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,980
I never heard of those.

878
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,860
I know he's an expert in...

879
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,420
Harry Turtledove is known for alternate histories.

880
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,940
Yeah, this is one where these lizard aliens visited the Earth sometime in the 1200s.

881
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,700
And they come from a planet where everything happens very slowly.

882
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,940
And all their galactic travels they had never encountered a civilization that evolved at a pace any faster than glacial.

883
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,580
So they come back expecting to be, you know, fighting knights in shining armor.

884
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,200
And then they discover that, you know, when they first get back to the planet in the opening, there's like,

885
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,740
Well, this is very strange. We're picking up wireless signals from TOSAV-3.

886
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,300
And like, what? How could they possibly have wireless?

887
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,860
Right.

888
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Wait a minute, that eluded me totally.

889
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,980
They breathe like bugs down there, those humans.

890
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,120
No, they went away for 800 years. They figured they could come back 800 years later and we'd still be riding horses and fighting with swords.

891
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,420
Oh, right.

892
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,400
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

893
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,100
Well, if they do come back 800 years from now, it'll probably be true again.

894
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,420
Yeah.

895
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,560
Wasn't it Einstein who said...

896
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:44,660
You know, sorry to say.

897
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,800
Wasn't it Einstein who said,

898
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,720
I do not know what weapon I'm using.

899
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:47,720


900
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,720
...日本's World War Three will be fought with but World War Four will be fought with sticks and stones?

901
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,840
Ah.

902
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,660
Well, if you think according to the prophecies of Nostradamus,

903
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,360
We're already in the middle of World War Three.

904
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,180
You can have my voice.

905
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,460
We are.

906
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,780
He says that World War Three archG question about 27 years.

907
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,380
Shutup.

908
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,420
Shutup about Nostradamus.

909
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,760
A form of yammering indeed.

910
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,900
I don't know.

911
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,700
NostroDAmus

912
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
NostroDPus opened up the third nostral.

913
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,720
We were martyred, too.

914
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:17,720


915
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,280
great-great-great-great-grandfather.

916
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,080
Nostril, damn us.

917
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,680
He was a lot like my great-great-uncle, Justice.

918
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,300
I mean, damn us.

919
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,000
That's right, that was your family that started the whole Mormon thing.

920
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,520
Yeah, yeah.

921
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,880
Yeah.

922
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,860
Oh, my.

923
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,860
Yeah, we're good at it.

924
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,260
The Mormon Menace.

925
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,400
Mormons have become very prominent in public life.

926
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,800
And the Mormon Church seems to be well aware of this.

927
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,920
They've got a new ad campaign out.

928
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,460
There's no doubt about it,

929
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,500
and I think the Church is really trying to capitalize on this moment,

930
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,560
and they're using this campaign to position themselves

931
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,420
in the mainstream of American society,

932
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,260
in which they're saying, you know, we're just like you.

933
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,620
We're bikers.

934
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,320
We're surfers and rock stars and moms and everything,

935
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,360
and we're Mormon.

936
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,060
And so we're just like you.

937
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,700
We're your neighbors.

938
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,520
We're your coworkers.

939
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,760
There's nothing to be afraid of.

940
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,300
We might have some distinctive beliefs, but so does everybody.

941
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
And ultimately, we're just like you.

942
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,320
My name is Jeff Tecker.

943
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm a father and husband of four,

944
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,700
and sculpt motorcycles for Harley-Davidson primarily.

945
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,180
And my passion in life is historic racing motorcycles.

946
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,580
I never give myself enough credit for having enough in life,

947
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,320
but I think that's false.

948
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,660
I strive for false balance because my family,

949
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,660
because I'm so polarized that I find refuge in the Church.

950
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,740
Lots of people just sort of talking about how normal they are,

951
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,900
how they're just like everybody else.

952
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,920
I think the two messages that the Church really wants to get across right now

953
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,500
is one, we're Christian, and two, we're normal.

954
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,760
Normal.

955
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,620
Norman.

956
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,960
God and Jesus.

957
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,280
Holy Ghost.

958
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,160
Flesh and bone.

959
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,020
Deep respect.

960
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,820
Deep bone.

961
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,820
God and Jesus and the Holy Bone.

962
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
And love for their prophets.

963
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,380
Bigotry and persecution.

964
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,380
Group mentality.

965
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,160
Cult.

966
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,300
Persecution complex.

967
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:29,680
Cult.

968
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,740
Or a siege mentality.

969
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Cult.

970
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,500
I got an alternate history story for staying.

971
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,160
Elvis versus Hitler.

972
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,480
In like an actual boxing match and stuff like that?

973
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,540
In the Moon Garden?

974
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,660
Sort of.

975
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,020
All right.

976
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,580
It supposes that Elvis was born 20 years earlier than he should have been.

977
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,540
He becomes the same.

978
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,160
He's a kind of musician.

979
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,740
Actually, he becomes more of a crooner, like Bing Crosby type,

980
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,080
but he's still a world-famous musician.

981
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,480
He rocks the house.

982
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,160
He's recruited by Frank Sinatra and the OSS

983
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,200
to take out Hitler on Hitler's birthday in a special concert in Berlin.

984
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,460
And the ending of which would be,

985
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,980
Elvis's grave isn't at Graceland,

986
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,520
but it's in Arlington National Cemetery because he died a hero.

987
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,400
He took out Hitler.

988
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,240
Wow.

989
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,040
Well, that would be an interesting story, wouldn't it?

990
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,900
Elvis versus Hitler.

991
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,380
It's only a joke.

992
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,040
I was under the impression that Hitler took himself out.

993
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,740
You know, you could make a short film about that.

994
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
Like, you could actually make that into a short movie, probably, for not too much money.

995
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
I've already written it, dude.

996
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:46,600
I wrote a detailed treatment called Harold and Maude and Kumar Visit Hitler.

997
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,240
And I'm not going to tell you anymore because it's actually a pretty good idea for a movie,

998
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,600
so I'm going to leave it at that.

999
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,740
Yeah, but you've got to include each of them.

1000
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,380
One of these days, Harold and Maude and Kumar go to Hitler.

1001
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay, I'll look at it.

1002
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,120
The main idea is they're going to buy his artwork real cheap

1003
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,760
and then bring it back to the future and sell it, you know,

1004
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,640
because it'd be a lot.

1005
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,080
But you've got to throw NPH into it.

1006
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,480
What?

1007
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:17,720
Really?

1008
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,040
Right, right.

1009
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,940
NPH.

1010
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,920
NPH.

1011
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,540
Neil Patrick Harris.

1012
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,040
Oh, okay.

1013
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,480
Well, of course, it's Harold and Maude and Kumar.

1014
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,860
Didn't he come out of the closet, Neil Patrick Harris?

1015
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,360
I'm sorry, I don't watch...

1016
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:37,360
I'm not quite as learned as you are in the world of...

1017
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,560
Or wide-nostril.

1018
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,620
...verily important sitcoms and television shows,

1019
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,600
so I often sound ignorant that way.

1020
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,040
Is it more important to be ignorant or wide-eyed or just wide-nostril

1021
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,720
as we bring it to the future?

1022
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:47,800
I agree.

1023
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,700
The perfumes and all those different concepts...

1024
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,820
What's important is to know that you're ignorant.

1025
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,060
As a genius pretender, so to speak,

1026
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,220
I'd like to know why, how, I mean, actually how,

1027
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,840
that it comes about.

1028
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,320
Television destroyed our greatest minds

1029
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,540
and it's too late now to turn it around.

1030
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,660
I can say one thing.

1031
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,200
If you think your IQ is anywhere close to,

1032
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
Dr. Seuss,

1033
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,520
Sinister's IQ,

1034
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,260
you've got another thing coming.

1035
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,380
I would say that...

1036
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,300
Well, he forgot more than you'll ever know.

1037
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,020
That's not true, Joe.

1038
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,080
His IQ qualifies him as a sub-genius.

1039
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,020
Yeah, I do not have a genius level IQ.

1040
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,260
Not that IQ means all that much anyway.

1041
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,620
He's got a good mammary, I'll tell you that.

1042
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,620
And quite a set of mammary glands to go with him.

1043
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,200
Oh, man.

1044
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
Some knockers on Dr. Seuss.

1045
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,080
He's a real sinister.

1046
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,720
That's what makes him so sinister.

1047
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,280
Circumcision is indeed profit if thou keepest the law.

1048
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,860
But if thou art a transgressor of the law,

1049
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,700
thy circumcision becomes uncircumcision.

1050
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:15,520
Therefore, if thy uncircumcision keeps the righteousness of the law,

1051
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,680
shall not his uncircumcision be unrighteous?

1052
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:17,680


1053
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:17,680


1054
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,400
Uncircumcision?

1055
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,140
Be count for circumcision.

1056
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,720
Yea, the uncircumcision that is by nature fulfilling his law

1057
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:33,720
shall judge thee who by letter and circumcision transgresses the law.

1058
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,640
I want some puzzling evidence.

1059
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,820
Well, who is this sexy voice with puzzling evidence?

1060
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,780
It is puzzling. The evidence I have is puzzling.

1061
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,380
Wow.

1062
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,940
Tell us about it. Maybe Dr. Howell can explain it.

1063
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,200
Oh, I would try.

1064
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,040
There is some jello and cotter pins all over the place.

1065
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,440
What? Jello and cotter pins?

1066
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,380
Yes.

1067
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,260
That means Bob has been there.

1068
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,320
That's the worst sign.

1069
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,220
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

1070
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,460
The people love it when Bob shows up and then leaves before they get to see him.

1071
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,940
Yes, and he leaves the so-called jello as well as cotter pins.

1072
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,040
It was like Outer Limits or something.

1073
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,180
It was. It was a journey.

1074
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,020
You know her first notice that Bob left jello and cotter pins behind him?

1075
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,320
To the Outer Limits.

1076
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,740
The late John Stakely, the science fiction writer who wrote Armor.

1077
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,360
Yes.

1078
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,640
Vampires with a dollar sign.

1079
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,440
Is he listening right now?

1080
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,020
No, he... well, from heaven.

1081
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,700
Do we know he had some knowledge of the corporations and jello before?

1082
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,860
What, a friend jello?

1083
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,500
A friend jello, though.

1084
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:45,960
A friend jello?

1085
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,040
Friend Jellica.

1086
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,400
There's evidence of jello and cotter pins before now.

1087
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:50,780
I see.

1088
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,280
It's...

1089
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,680
Yeah, it's sticky.

1090
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,940
Jello by...

1091
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,540
It's sticky and sweet.

1092
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,680
It's sticky, but it's not the brand name product.

1093
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,340
It's usually grape jello.

1094
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,300
The last couple of X days, we found the cotter pins with grape jello around the pulpit.

1095
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,040
Grape jello in the morning.

1096
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,840
And the pulpit knocked over.

1097
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,260
Like Bob had come up there and went,

1098
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,360
I'm casting the money changers out of the temple.

1099
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,660
Ain't changing enough money into money for me.

1100
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,080
And he kicked the pulpit over.

1101
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,940
The very heavy pulpit.

1102
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,860
Not the little pulpit.

1103
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,860
Not the altar.

1104
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,340
Yeah, the big altar.

1105
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,140
The giant thing made by X-Train.

1106
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,040
Holy dagons.

1107
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,760
The one you can launch a head from.

1108
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,660
It's so sturdy.

1109
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,440
Neck way lectulous.

1110
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,100
Neck portico acapit.

1111
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,920
Yeah, Dr. Hallis has watched Bobby's Hall thing up hills.

1112
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,540
I've seen them.

1113
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,240
Yes.

1114
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,700
Like Prince Geraldo.

1115
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,080
Dedicated their bodies to straining under the effort.

1116
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:52,800
Their young flesh quivering with exhaustion as they attempt to heave this massive Bob object up into its place of prominence.

1117
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,140
It's a sturdy pulpit.

1118
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,260
That's what we're watching right now.

1119
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,300
The first thing that we...

1120
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,660
Above the plotted plane.

1121
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,760
Ed said, I want to make you guys a pulpit.

1122
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,120
What's the first thing you need?

1123
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,900
And we said, it needs to be really portable so you can take it on a plane.

1124
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,880
So he made something that you can only carry in a van.

1125
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,680
Pulpit fiction there.

1126
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,260
So what is this about the rape jello?

1127
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,980
The leg jello?

1128
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,900
Imagine how heavy...

1129
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,620
You have to talk to Philo about that.

1130
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,460
He has that problem chronically.

1131
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,060
I didn't think she was...

1132
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,100
Imagine how heavy it would be if you asked him to make it heavy.

1133
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,940
Well, it's just going to be the volume and weight of a human leg.

1134
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,640
And I guess that's about all.

1135
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,280
Except of course to say that what is advertised as a jello may actually be...

1136
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,820
Something else.

1137
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,220
In the long run, it's always better to look before you leap.

1138
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:46,680
Yep.

1139
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,360
Watch out for the ass pick.

1140
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,800
For Goofball Radio, this is Dr. Howlandow.

1141
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Better to eat the jello than drink the Kool-Aid.

1142
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,420
Or a flavoring as the face may be.

1143
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,220
Eat the jello.

1144
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Eat the jello.

1145
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,500
Or not.

1146
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,300
Man, those sheep are like, they've eaten the jello.

1147
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
They'll believe anything.

1148
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,280
The hungry sheep look up and are not fed.

1149
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,760
With care.

1150
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,280
J-E-L-L-O.

1151
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,140
You still hear the crying of the lambs, don't you?

1152
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,740
And full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn.

1153
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,080
I'm calling on my cello phone.

1154
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,020
Cello?

1155
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,140
The jello phone.

1156
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,620
That's the softest, jiggliest form of smartphone.

1157
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,140
It's a mellow jello phone.

1158
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,420
Soft and jiggly and smart.

1159
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,740
I understand the connection is there.

1160
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:38,740


1161
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,540
But the jello phone is sort of wiggly.

1162
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,780
It's a little bit hinky, it's wobbly.

1163
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,340
But there's always room for more.

1164
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,780
That's the important thing.

1165
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,840
Room for one more, honey.

1166
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,560
Jello, of course, is just the conspiracy's name for hell.

1167
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,540
Hell.

1168
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,380
Oh, get it?

1169
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,940
In Spanish, it would be pronounced hail.

1170
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
But it is jello.

1171
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,440
It's like hell.

1172
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,780
Jello.

1173
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,820
Help me, Bob.

1174
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,620
I'm in hell, Bob.

1175
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:08,740
I'm in hell.

1176
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1177
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1178
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1179
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1180
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1181
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1182
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1183
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1184
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:08,740


1185
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,160
It's not what you said it would be.

1186
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,360
Where's my $90, Bob?

1187
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,540
Help me, Bob.

1188
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,180
Maybe we're dead, Bob.

1189
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,780
Maybe this place is hell.

1190
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,780
Did you ever hear of a railroad in hell?

1191
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,660
I got injured in the course of X Day During That Doctor Jam.

1192
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,460
Like, my hands were bleeding.

1193
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,680
After playing the game.

1194
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,120
I played the drums.

1195
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,140
What?

1196
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,680
I played the drums until my hands were bleeding.

1197
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,160
Literally.

1198
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,500
Cool.

1199
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,580
Oh my God.

1200
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,480
You mean the drumsticks were holes in your hands?

1201
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,600
I got some blisters from that.

1202
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:49,920
I don't know.

1203
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,060
Maybe I have to build up calluses.

1204
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,760
Or maybe I'm just holding the sticks the wrong way.

1205
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,540
Yeah.

1206
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,740
Oh, man.

1207
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,320
He shed blood for Bob.

1208
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:58,980
That's right.

1209
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,760
Well, I'm sure that Reverend Angry Larry set that up.

1210
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,800
Because for the first time, he didn't.

1211
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,660
Normally, Reverend Angry Larry, somehow, he would have been able to get the money.

1212
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,520
I don't even know.

1213
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,020
All right, we didn't see you two together.

1214
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,720
Do you?

1215
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,700
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, white

1216
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,460
men.

1217
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,360
open. He looks all

1218
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,120
scarred up and ugly like he does.

1219
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,460
He gave a lot for Bob. He gave

1220
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,600
his face for Bob.

1221
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,740
I just thought it was because he was from Detroit.

1222
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,380
What was that?

1223
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,440
I just assumed that

1224
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,620
was because he was from Michigan.

1225
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,500
Well, you'll get that in

1226
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,340
Michigan. That's true. Okay, Reverend

1227
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,060
Stang, I had a question for you.

1228
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,320
Yes. Okay,

1229
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,260
you might have heard earlier

1230
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,220
in the show, Dr. Spencer was talking about

1231
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,340
feeling let down because Bob failed to

1232
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,880
show again.

1233
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,180
He's done this year after year.

1234
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,160
I'm just wondering, what did Bob

1235
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,020
have to do to get you offended enough

1236
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,320
to leave the church as a subgenius?

1237
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,320
Now, what?

1238
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,940
Say that again?

1239
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,240
What would Bob have to

1240
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,080
do to get me to leave the church?

1241
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Right, exactly.

1242
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,160
All he would have to do would be

1243
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
to wish it for one instant.

1244
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,140
Just the slightest little whim.

1245
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,780
Oh, I'd wish Stang would go away.

1246
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:34,720
That'd be it.

1247
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,080
Yeah, that's

1248
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,060
one of the dangers of being

1249
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,020
that powerful. We all the time find

1250
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,400
ourselves saying, God, I wish this or that

1251
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,560
for a second there, but you don't really wish it.

1252
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,820
Well, with Bob, those fading wishes

1253
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,240
come true.

1254
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,940
That happened to me the other day.

1255
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,820
That happened to me the other day because I was

1256
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,620
staring at the power transformer that's right

1257
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,140
outside the house on the power lines,

1258
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,540
and I was just kind of putting my psychic energy

1259
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,640
into it, thinking, wow, wouldn't it

1260
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,180
be cool if that power transformer

1261
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:01,700
blew?

1262
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,900
Two days later, we heard a loud

1263
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,960
pop outside in the middle of the night

1264
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,500
and 1130 at night.

1265
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,740
Power went out in my neighborhood because that

1266
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,040
power transformer blew.

1267
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,860
Oh, that wasn't kind of blue

1268
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,720
I was hoping you would say, but

1269
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,820
I was expecting

1270
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,800
a different kind of blow from the

1271
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,380
transformer, but...

1272
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,220
Wow, man.

1273
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,500
Those transformers are more than meets the eye.

1274
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,140
You've got to be careful.

1275
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,840
You've got to be working for Michael Bay on those transformers

1276
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,120
movies.

1277
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,040
You know, Autumn went to see that...

1278
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,760
I will defeat you!

1279
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,040
Optimus Prime.

1280
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,880
Autumn went to see that and said that

1281
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,740
they stole my artwork for

1282
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:43,980
transformers.

1283
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,760
Oh, you ought to see those.

1284
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,820
If you just skip past all the human

1285
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,900
parts and just watch the robot fighting,

1286
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,320
it's psychedelic

1287
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,580
as hell. It's great stuff.

1288
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,880
And they do look

1289
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,060
very similar. They're so detailed.

1290
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,360
Some of them have like

1291
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,780
10,000 moving interlocking

1292
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,120
virtual parts.

1293
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,360
Oh, there's a character

1294
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,620
just like you in Transformers 2.

1295
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,500
He's like

1296
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,400
a Decepticon who's

1297
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,620
so old

1298
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,380
he's been damaged and he's

1299
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,020
become...

1300
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,580
He's become

1301
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,260
deprogrammed and he's joined

1302
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,580
the Autobots.

1303
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,580
But he's

1304
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,500
got a Scottish accent to begin with.

1305
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,800
So he's like Sean Connery.

1306
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,980
He's actually...

1307
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,680
He transforms into a...

1308
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,980
stealth bomber

1309
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,940
that's in an

1310
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,720
aviation museum.

1311
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,760
And the hero comes and awakens him

1312
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,380
and he unfolds and he's this

1313
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,740
cranky old

1314
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,240
revolving-haired bearded...

1315
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,420
He's like a transformer that reminds you of

1316
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,860
Ian Anderson.

1317
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,360
You know, kind of this...

1318
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,900
Did you throw Tully in Anderson?

1319
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:57,480
Yeah.

1320
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,840
An old shaggy-haired guy with a beard.

1321
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,760
He has almost a cane

1322
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,560
type of thing.

1323
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,600
And he's...

1324
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,700
Cantankerous.

1325
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,340
Whoever voices him is great.

1326
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,360
And he's

1327
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,740
one of the good guys

1328
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,740
who used to be a bad guy.

1329
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,920
You know, a Decepticon.

1330
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,160
But he's kind of...

1331
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,580
Be nice to your little furry friend.

1332
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,200
That's great. Yeah, Transformers 2.

1333
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,560
I haven't seen any of them.

1334
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,660
The animation is astounding.

1335
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,580
Everything else about him is just

1336
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,660
about what you'd expect.

1337
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,620
You know, kid stuff.

1338
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,540
I'll send me pawns and days.

1339
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,580
Show you some...

1340
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,940
I'll suffer my infinite wrath!

1341
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,160
You little spinal cord-based organisms.

1342
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,040
Bugger it!

1343
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,100
Behold!

1344
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,100
The eternal glory of

1345
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,120
the Empire!

1346
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,940
Prepare for about systems override!

1347
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,800
I tell you, this guy did not age well.

1348
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,360
There's really nothing

1349
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,840
more satisfying than getting to

1350
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,120
make music at all.

1351
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,880
And then getting to make music with musicians

1352
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,860
you know and respect.

1353
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,500
That just compounds the...

1354
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:05,980
awesomeness.

1355
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,160
Well, I will try to have that

1356
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,700
Sunday night X-Day jam

1357
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,100
rendered and flensed

1358
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,120
and available in all media

1359
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,400
as soon as possible.

1360
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,180
Rendered unto the sinister...

1361
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,680
You were amazing, Rob.

1362
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,620
I keep on...

1363
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,020
Stop, stop.

1364
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,720
His bloody hand was cool.

1365
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,580
The blood splattering.

1366
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,860
I wondered who had bled all over the stage.

1367
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,120
Well, apparently I wasn't the only one

1368
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,820
bleeding on stage.

1369
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,180
I'm not sure if I should say this or not,

1370
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,840
but Pisces mentioned something about...

1371
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,580
something about...

1372
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,580


1373
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,580


1374
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,580


1375
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,580


1376
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,580


1377
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:35,880
something happening.

1378
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,040
Like there was like blood fueling the whole thing.

1379
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,080
Cool.

1380
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,620
See, we don't have a fan of these cult...

1381
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:42,900
No.

1382
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,420
...rock and roll shows.

1383
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,400
No, it was true blood.

1384
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,420
It's doctor music

1385
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,380
because the doctors are surgeons.

1386
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,760
They use knives of sound

1387
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,040
to slice the flesh

1388
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,120
and cleanse the blueness of the wound.

1389
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,700
Oh, yes.

1390
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,060
The patient's dying.

1391
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,960
We better bleed him some more.

1392
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,600
I'm on a mission.

1393
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,900
He got fired.

1394
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,000
What do you want?

1395
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,560
Look, we just...

1396
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,160
We just want to talk.

1397
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,240
I have no time to talk.

1398
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,800
I'm on a mission.

1399
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,660
I'm a mercenary doombringer.

1400
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,060
What planet am I on?

1401
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,720
Earth.

1402
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,340
Earth?

1403
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,900
Terrible name for a planet.

1404
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,840
Might as well call it

1405
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,660
Dirt.

1406
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,480
Planet Dirt.

1407
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,320
Oh, that was the former Decepticon

1408
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,180
representing Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

1409
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,160
here on Hour of Slack number 1,355

1410
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,680
from the Church of the Subgenius

1411
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,580
about which everything can be learned

1412
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,140
including all past shows

1413
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,260
at subgenius.com.

1414
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,720
If you look at the front page,

1415
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,480
there are buttons,

1416
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,560
buttons for all kinds of stuff.

1417
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,380
For instance, radio

1418
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,120
leading to all subgenius shows.

1419
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,640
Videos, graphics, books.

1420
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,240
We have a whole book online

1421
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,380
that we did with people like

1422
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,240
William Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson,

1423
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,280
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob.

1424
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,420
And under events,

1425
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,020
you can learn about the X-Day Festival

1426
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,380
and Starwood,

1427
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,960
both coming up in Southern Ohio

1428
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,680
this July 5th week

1429
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,480
in hopes that this is the year,

1430
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,000
the last year for the humans,

1431
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,360
the year Bob called

1432
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,640
1998.

1433
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,840
You said 98.

1434
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,700
I mean, for me, that's a huge year

1435
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,580
because it was written

1436
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,400
and involves 1998 as being this sort of

1437
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,900
crossroads of time-space

1438
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,760
where this was like a major shift

1439
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,120
in time-space.

1440
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,200
Who's the guy who does

1441
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,340
the time travel technology?

1442
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,360
I was listening to an interview with him

1443
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,960
where someone called in asking about

1444
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,000
if they had noticed

1445
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,860
a shift in 1998.

1446
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,920
And he said, actually,

1447
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,580
we have a lot of,

1448
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,480
we hear that a lot from people

1449
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,640
and we think there might be something to this.

1450
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,920
We have some evidence to suggest

1451
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,800
that 1998 involves some sort of time travel

1452
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,700
or time shift.

1453
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,680
When are you going to X that tractor up your...

1454
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,120
Well, now let's not get personal here.

1455
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,280
X-ing requires practice.

1456
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,540
You can't just X something right away.

1457
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,120
You have to work up to it.

1458
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,860
You can X it up and X it when?

1459
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,980
Well, X is the third time.

1460
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,560
It's the third to the last letter of the alphabet.

1461
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,540
Z?

1462
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,000
And because of that,

1463
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,120
I said the third to the last.

1464
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:11,620
Y?

1465
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,920
X.

1466
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,060
No, Z.

1467
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,560
Y.

1468
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:14,880
W.

1469
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,800
We're talking about X, not Y.

1470
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,280
Don't you see anything?

1471
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,080
Why?

1472
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,720
Do you see nothing?

1473
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,200
I'm trying to make this into some kind of

1474
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,040
Abbott and Costello routine, I think.

1475
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,380
First the X's come, then the Y's come,

1476
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,040
then the Z's come and clean up.

1477
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,900
Costello.

1478
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,700
Well, that's true.

1479
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:38,340
It is an organic mathematical sequence of preordained events.

1480
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,580
Now, there's no point in kicking against the traces there.

1481
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,240
That's the problem with knowing the future.

1482
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,280
There are no answers.

1483
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:46,680
I'll take my nose.

1484
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,500
We just don't know what time or year it is now.

1485
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,580
Let's see, I'll take that one and that one.

1486
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,640
So we have no point of reference that's accurate.

1487
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,380
We know what's happened in class.

1488
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,600
Ye know not when the master comes.

1489
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,460
I'll take that one.

1490
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,580
Right, and that one.

1491
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,320
Prophecy becomes a bit of a problem because it's...

1492
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,460
I've picked all my nose now.

1493
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,160
...not always accurate.

1494
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,640
You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose,

1495
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,340
but you can't pick your friends' noses.

1496
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,160
Not in a state park.

1497
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,940
You can choose a nose from this table of noses here.

1498
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,880
Who would want to chew a nose?

1499
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,960
Only a desperate individual.

1500
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,460
Well, you know there's a website out there for it.

1501
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,340
A Donner pastor.

1502
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,900
There's a nose chewers website out there somewhere.

1503
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,600
Yes, that's the NoseChewer.com.

1504
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,080
NoseChewer.com.

1505
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,800
NoseChewer.com.

1506
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,140
NoseChewer.com.

1507
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,580
That's a domain name that I'm going to try to get real quick.

1508
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,140
While the demand is low.

1509
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:51,480
I just read on Scrub Genius, I read that Reverend Popo discovered that the domain name largemanhood.com

1510
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,680
was not in use and he bought it and re-mirrored it so it goes to subgenius.com.

1511
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,760
So anyone who types in largemanhood,

1512
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,460
it goes straight to subgenius.com.

1513
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,060
That's great.

1514
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,800
That just saves us a little bit of organization.

1515
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,600
It only cost him like 50 bucks a year for that.

1516
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,760
Praise Reverend Provo.

1517
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,060
How much does it cost to renew a domain name now?

1518
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,840
This is Provo.

1519
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,120
About, it depends.

1520
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,280
About six arms and a leg.

1521
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,040
Yeah, yeah, it depends on what kind of a domain it is.

1522
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,580
Once it's gone, it's gone.

1523
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,880
Subgenius.com.

1524
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,740
I think I pay about 35 bucks a year.

1525
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,680
60 bucks for two years.

1526
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,380
But then there's a monthly fee on top of that.

1527
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,240
Oh man.

1528
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,680
So we need every donation that's allowed to be discussed on the public right now.

1529
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,940
Which is none.

1530
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,640
We can't discuss it at all.

1531
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,100
All you can do is donate to your local radio station.

1532
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:53,060
But the good thing about none, the good thing about nothing is you can ask for all of it that you want.

1533
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:59,880
On the other hand, on pirate radio, you can make outrageous requests for money and perhaps...

1534
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,520
But we can request nothing.

1535
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:06,380
And we want you to give us all the nothing you can to send in your donations of nothing.

1536
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,580
As much as possible.

1537
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:11,600
Open your heart and open your arms wide and...

1538
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:19,560
Inada creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded masking tape.

1539
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,120
You're supposed to wash your problem?

1540
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:27,160
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools to dusty depths.

1541
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,380
You should clean your problems off.

1542
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,360
Keep them problem free.

1543
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,020
Out, out, brief phylo.

1544
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,160
Your problems should be free to...

1545
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,720
Show us but a walking shadow.

1546
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,400
A poor, extremely poor player who struts and frets endlessly.

1547
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,720
His hour upon the stage.

1548
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,360
And then is heard only in real life.

1549
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,780
She can go on like that for hours.

1550
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,620
Tale told by an idiot.

1551
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,440
Full of sound and fury.

1552
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,320
Why would you stop something so sweet?

1553
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,420
It's like the sound of angels laughing.

1554
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,240
Great.

1555
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,920
Another religious nut.

1556
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,360
Hmph.

1557
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,440
Welcome friend.

1558
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,660
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

1559
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,820
You believe in...

1560
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,080
Mob?

1561
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:12,880
Yeah, sure.

1562
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,640
That's what you do in here.

1563
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,600
What I'm...

1564
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,280
A doing here.

1565
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:16,680
Mob?

00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,620
That's what you do in here.

1567
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,360
What I'm...

1568
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,040
A doing here.

1569
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:19,380
Mob?

1570
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,360
That's what you do in here.

1571
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,100
What I'm...

1572
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,780
A doing here.

1573
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,100
Mob?

1574
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,140
That's what you do in here.

1575
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,820
What I'm...

1576
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,520
A doing here.

1577
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,040
Mob?

1578
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,560
That's what you do in here.

1579
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,360

A doing here.

1586
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,320
What I'm...

1587
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,320


1588
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,240
That's what you do in here.

1589
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:33,740

1600
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:40,820

00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:40,820


1602
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,260
Thud.

1603
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,580
