1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,020
Instead of making your dollars shrink by investing in United States savings bonds,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,540
why not make them grow with interest by spending needlessly when prices are high?

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,260
Here's the way it works.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,380
Seventy-five dollars invested now each month will in ten years turn into an income of one dollar

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,040
for as long a period as you forcibly fought forces of evil each month for a fact.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
But now...

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,700
The Soul Genius!

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,020
Our house!

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,480
What?

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,940
Savings plan.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,960
What sort of life, if any, inhabits these other planets?

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,760
Human life like ours?

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,760
Or life extremely lower in the scale?

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,380
Or dangerously higher?

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,240
You know, our next guest is Reverend Ivan Stang.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,820
He's with the Church of the Subgenius.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,000
And it's a church that's been around for quite a while.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,820
Saved a lot of people from...

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,640
I don't know what it saved them from, but it saved a whole lot of people.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
I think it helped a lot of people get married.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,720
And helped a lot of people get married.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,000
They are now claiming that the end of the world is coming soon.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,500
And specifically, I think, on July 5th.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,840
And just like any good organization, they're trying to make some money off of it.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,940
And...

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,320
Uh...

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,880
So, I don't know...

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,700
We'll talk to the good...

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,240
Good Reverend, are you there?

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,500
Yes, I'm here.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,240
Praise Jack.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,560
Thank you so much.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,040
The end of the world is coming.

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,160
It says the doomsday is coming for the 15th time.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,480
I've missed the first 14 of them.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,780
I don't want to miss this one.

37
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,540
Tell me what I need to do to be there and be hip about it.

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,240
Well, Jack, I was just looking at...

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,020
I was looking at your description on Wikipedia and your website.

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Uh-huh.

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,240
And I feel like I should be interviewing you.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,760
You're certainly weird enough to...

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,020
I would think you'd probably get a free admission to the X-Day end of the world.

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,620
X-Day?

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,660
You know, it's going to happen everywhere, but we figure we want to be with our friends and sex partners or whatnot.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,180
Right.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,020
You know, when the world ends.

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,400
I do believe in theories, Doctor.

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,420
But when you tell me flying to another planet is a possibility, you're out of the realm of theory.

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,340
You're in a dream world of the impossible.

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,240
Even if the world were to end, would it be less unpleasant to die out in space than here on firm ground?

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,200
The world will not end.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,260
Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society, an attempt to corner the newspaper headlines.

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Read all about it!

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,720
The end of the world is just around the corner!

56
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,520
Read all about it!

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,100
Get your...

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,020
People tend to let go of their inhibitions when they know everything is coming to an end.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,860
Well, you know, I like to base everything on cartoons that I watch.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,100
And one of them that I love to watch is called Squidbillies.

61
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,820
And at the end of the...

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,180
On their version of the end of the world, everyone got nude and all the Christians.

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,100
Went up to heaven.

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,120
Rose up.

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,260
Now, the members of the Church of the Subgenius, will they float up nude or clothed?

66
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,560
Or will they remain on the ground to take care of business down here?

67
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,620
Well, that's a delicate subject.

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:55,400
What we suspect will happen, according to prophecy, is everybody who has bought a subgenius ministership and an ordainment...

69
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,380
Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,500
Right.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,060
...in the church.

72
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,200
It may be a little disconcerting because they'll all appear to be bursting into flames and screaming and yelling.

73
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,940
But their beautiful naked spirit will rise up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

74
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,220
Out of the flames.

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Which, by the way, are unichromosomal.

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,520
We call them goddesses because they can reproduce, but they can appear as anything you want.

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,380
So, you know, if you want your sex god or your sex goat, for that matter...

78
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,780
Right.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,860
...whatever you want.

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,220
This is only available to dues-paying subgenius ministers, however.

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,080
Right.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,400
I mean, we're crazy, but we're not any crazier than, say, the Jehovah's Witnesses who have predicted the end of the world numerous times.

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,340
At least we do it on a regular yearly schedule.

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,640
And at a good time of the year and a good place, too.

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,540
You know?

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,780
It's in a campground in rural New York in Amish country.

87
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,380
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,380
But the campground is regularly used by...

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,660
By neo-pagans.

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,200
Oh.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,360
And it's a nudist campground if you want to be naked.

92
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,980
Of course, only the ones who shouldn't be ever do, but that kind of goes with the territory.

93
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,320
Right.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,700
And we will be in that territory soon enough, dear friends, because X-Day is a-comin'.

95
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:24,840
This hour of Slack show, number 1,258, is composed almost entirely of people on other shows

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,280
talking about...

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,980
About X-Day.

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,380
We've heard some just now from the Jack Jett Show on Rational Radio in Dallas, Texas.

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,940
We'll also hear snippets from the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley

100
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,020
and from the popular British podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now.

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,940
Reverend Susie the Floozies, Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from WREK Atlanta will be exploited.

102
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,920
Used.

103
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,960
Used.

104
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,180


105
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


107
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


108
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


109
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


110
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


111
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


112
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,380


113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,420
And, well, you'll see.

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,100
Many of our listeners are unbelievers.

115
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,760
They think this show is cute or funny.

116
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,700
But they don't believe in Bob and they don't take X-Day seriously.

117
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,980
Maybe this upcoming recording will change that.

118
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:26,300
It was recorded at the 2002, or 2003, X-Day drill ceremony in...

119
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Hamburg, Germany, the epicenter of the Euro subgenius movement.

120
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh, no, what?

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
That's Amsterdam.

122
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:42,840
Anyway, this is an actual recording from Hamburg, Germany of a live subgenius devival sermon

123
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,060
preached by the great minister, father, or rather, Papa Joe Mama.

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
The great minister, Papa Joe Mama.

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,780
The great minister, Papa Joe Mama.

126
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,380
The great minister, Papa Joe Mama.

127
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,380


128
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,380


129
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:04,780
I want you to put your hands together and scream like maniacs for the infamous, evil

130
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,960
Papa Joe Mama.

131
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,000
Papa Joe!

132
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,680
Papa Joe!

133
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,560
Papa Joe!

134
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,140
Papa Joe!

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,580
Papa Joe!

136
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,560
Papa Joe!

137
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,320
Papa Joe!

138
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,500
Papa Joe!

139
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,720
Papa Joe!

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:25,840


141
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,360
Papa Joe!

142
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,360


143
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,240
Papa Joe!

144
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Papa Joe!

145
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,620
Papa Joe!

146
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,620


147
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,620


148
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,620


149
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,280
Hallelujah ladies and gentlemen.

150
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,140
Very well.

151
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,820
Dear Bob Dobbs.

152
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,780
Ubrames!

153
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,660
You asked what time it is, friends, and I'm here to tell you what time it is.

154
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,520
It's five minutes till midnight!

155
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,960
Aye aye!

156
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,380
Yes, dear friends, the end times are upon us.

157
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,360
The proof that all these were brought to the world was no time.

158
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,360


159
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,360


160
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,400
is everywhere around.

161
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,160
Despite the conspiracy's best efforts

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,440
to comfort and reassure you otherwise,

163
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,300
their sinister control

164
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,400
in existence is fast coming to a close.

165
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,820
Best of all,

166
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,620
they know it.

167
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,780
Like the pilot announcing over the intercom

168
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,080
that the engine trouble is

169
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
nothing to worry about.

170
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,780
The more they urge everyone to remain calm,

171
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,080
the more obvious their own panic becomes.

172
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,320
They all see the fulfillment

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,100
of Bob's prophecies unfold.

174
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,060
A world on the edge of Armageddon.

175
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,440
The conspiracy's desperate last-ditch efforts

176
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,620
to pull itself out of its nosedive.

177
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,340
And Bob's bold plan

178
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,660
to re-establish freedom and slack

179
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,360
in the conspiracy's aftermath.

180
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,120
Do I hear a praise bar?

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,400
Praise bar!

182
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,220
Praise bar!

183
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,620
Who would have ever imagined

184
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,680
that the countdown to July 5th

185
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,360
would have begun

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,520
on September 11th?

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
See how the world's armies

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,740
converge upon the Middle East

189
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,240
in a futile attempt

190
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,860
to maintain the status quo?

191
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,260
Who amongst us seriously believes

192
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,440
a conspiracy will ever allow itself

193
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
to completely win this war,

194
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,560
then turn around and restore

195
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,460
the civil liberties

196
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,120
they so jealously snatched away?

197
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,160
Ah.

198
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,300
There shall always be

199
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,140
at least one

200
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,300
terrorist who gets away.

201
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
One that's big enough

202
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
and bad enough

203
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,580
to justify the continuation

204
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,020
of the newly expanded police state.

205
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,140
If not,

206
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
make it even bigger.

207
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,860
But we,

208
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,960
the subgenies,

209
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
we do not

210
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,260
and we are not

211
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,540
intimidated by a conspiracy show of force.

212
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,280
We recognize

213
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,340
only one,

214
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,400
only one supreme authority.

215
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,540
Not the faceless,

216
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,920
nameless men in black.

217
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,480
No, sir!

218
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,740
No!

219
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,440
But a smiling face

220
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,780
named J.R. Bob Dole!

221
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,320
Yeah!

222
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,280
We, we,

223
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,240
we will follow that face

224
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
to the ends of the earth

225
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,420
and well beyond

226
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,940
after this planet is no more.

227
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,820
That time is coming soon, my friends.

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,460
It's five minutes till midnight!

229
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah!

230
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,820
Look at humanity.

231
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,840
And America alone.

232
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,180
The so-called land of milk and honey.

233
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,160
700,000 people

234
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,200
owe 30 billion dollars

235
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,860
in high-interest credit card debt.

236
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,780
They'll never pay it off.

237
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
But of course,

238
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,760
they're not supposed to pay it off now,

239
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,360
are they?

240
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,980
No, sir!

241
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,220
The conspiracy wants them to remain in debt

242
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,140
perpetually,

243
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,140
running down that endless treadmill.

244
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,400
Bob says no!

245
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,460
It's time to get off!

246
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,620
It's time to get off

247
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,000
like you've never gotten off before!

248
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,820
It's five minutes till midnight!

249
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,400


250
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,940
In the last month alone,

251
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,860
American Post delivered

252
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,360
three billion pieces of mail.

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,160
Three people died from anthrax

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,620
from those legends.

255
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,040
So now the peak public

256
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680
is terrified that they are next.

257
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,340
That's a one-in-one,

258
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,740
one billion chance

259
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,660
that you could get infected

260
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,140
and be killed.

261
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,340
More people have died

262
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,940
from spontaneous combustion,

263
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,540
just unexpectedly exploding into flames.

264
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,020
Yet millions,

265
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,960
millions still believe

266
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,240
that they're in desperate danger.

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,700
This is called mass hysteria.

268
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,560
The first step to complete social breakdown.

269
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,260
The rats are ready to flee the ship,

270
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
whether it's sinking or not,

271
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,960
it's five minutes till midnight!

272
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Yeah!

273
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,800
He who knows the future,

274
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,940
owns it.

275
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,940
He who knows there is no future,

276
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,640
rents it to others.

277
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,960
Yeah!

278
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,040


279
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,340
Ah, Bob Dobbs said, and I quote,

280
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,340
the world ends July 5th, 1998.

281
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,120
Now the conspiracy believes that 1998 is over

282
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,240
and that they are now safe.

283
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,740
They don't believe in time control.

284
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,200
They don't believe in exes UFOs.

285
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,740
And worst of all,

286
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
they don't believe in Bob!

287
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,860
And for that unforgivable blasphemy,

288
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
they shall surely die!

289
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,140
It's five minutes till midnight!

290
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,220
Yeah!

291
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,040
For centuries, humans banged their heads

292
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,300
against the walls trying to find the answers

293
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,340
to life, happiness, and peace on Earth.

294
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,020
But that answer sadly never came.

295
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,180
You want to know why?

296
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,140
Yeah!

297
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,480
Because the answer's not here, friends.

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,860
They're looking in the wrong place.

299
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,720
That answer isn't on Earth at all.

300
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,200
It's on Planet X.

301
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,260
And there's only one way to get there, friends.

302
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,980
And it sure as hell ain't by brown-nosing the boss.

303
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,520
Or by trying to stockpile the most numbers

304
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,560
in your bank account.

305
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,900
No, sir!

306
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,140
The only way to find paradise

307
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,980
and avoid hell on Earth

308
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,020
is to possess a ticket aboard an exes flying saucer.

309
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,320
That ticket cannot be bought, friends.

310
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,940
It can only be bought if

311
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,640
you must trade true love and affection for Bob

312
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,500
plus a $30 love offering

313
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,200
to the subgenius foundation.

314
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,900
Now, some people wonder,

315
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,660
can I really afford it?

316
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,260
The answer, of course, is

317
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,500
can you not afford it?

318
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,960
Because, in the most simple of terms,

319
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,620
it's five minutes till midnight!

320
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,420
Ladies and Germans,

321
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,340
we cannot promise you

322
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,580
that you will walk out of here with all the answers.

323
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,480
But we're hoping to at least provide you

324
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,400
with some of the more vital, life-changing questions.

325
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,260
One of them is this.

326
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,880
Do you wish to live after July 5th, 1998?

327
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,040
Yes!

328
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,640
If the answer is no, however,

329
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,480
just keep serving the conspiracy.

330
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
Those exes saucers will arrive here

331
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,200
and rain death upon you and all your pink friends.

332
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,980
But if, however, the answer is yes,

333
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,500
well, in that case, I suggest,

334
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,480
and that's assuming, of course,

335
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,200
you prefer an eternity of slack

336
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,640
and want to enjoy a space journey

337
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,660
aboard the pleasure saucers with Bob,

338
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,100
enjoying sex-star beautiful babes,

339
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
an abundant supply of have-a-fropped zippy-lops,

340
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,780
and, of course, good quality rock and roll,

341
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,220
and I'm not talking that 70s shit,

342
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,620
then turn your life over to Bob!

343
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,120
It ain't hard, friends.

344
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,040
It's easy and it's fun.

345
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,340
You'll get eternal salvation and slack at no extra charge.

346
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,020
But best of all, best of all,

347
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,820
you'll feel a thrill instead of a chill

348
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,420
when someone asks you,

349
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,000
uh, what time is it?

350
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,420
And the answer is,

351
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,820
it's 5 a.m. still midnight!

352
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,200
Narrated in the words of our great Bob Avery!

353
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,940
Hallelujah!

354
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,700
Hallelujah!

355
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,720
Are you scared?

356
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,340
Boy, I know I am!

357
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm so scared,

358
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,580
I think I'm gonna pay my $30 again

359
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,540
just to make sure I get on that Exit spacecraft!

360
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,240
I paid my $30!

361
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,320
Hallelujah!

362
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,500
The subcommittee didn't believe a word we told them.

363
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,840
At least they didn't ridicule us.

364
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,800
No one believes us.

365
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
How will we ever interest enough private capital?

366
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,040
It's hopeless.

367
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,140
I believe you, Bob.

368
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,480
I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship.

369
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,140
At my age,

370
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,400
I'll settle for the satisfaction that I contributed

371
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,660
toward salvaging something from our old world.

372
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,700
Hey, I'm older and richer than you are.

373
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll arrange a lease on a large enough camp,

374
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
one of the government's old proving ground sites.

375
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,900
Why, between Marston and me,

376
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,260
you'll have enough to start construction.

377
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,000
Wonderful, Spiro, wonderful!

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,960
I'll arrange the details for our next meeting.

379
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,320
Right!

380
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,140
Hello, Reverend Stang.

381
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,480
Thanks so much for coming on the show again.

382
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,440
We really appreciate it.

383
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,260
Always good to have you on.

384
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,140
Praise Ken and praise Kim.

385
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,680
Both co-hosts with one syllable names starting with a K.

386
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,700
Yep, that's there.

387
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,940
In order to confuse subgeniuses.

388
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah, that's our cunning plan.

389
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,700
Not really, it's pretty easy to confuse them.

390
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,300
I was gonna say,

391
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,940
it's not even working very well, so...

392
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,540
Yeah, true, true.

393
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,940
We're not doing too well on that one.

394
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,420
So, we've just, you've just finished X Day,

395
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,300
and I assume, unless we're talking to you on some kind of interstellar Skype,

396
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,060
the sources didn't turn up this time.

397
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,700
Right.

398
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,640
This is actually the 12th time that we've waited on July 5th,

399
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,780
12 years in a row,

400
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,500
at the ungodly hour of 7 o'clock in the morning,

401
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,280
waiting for aliens to come in.

402
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,100
And, uh, save us from this planet,

403
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,860
and let us destroy everything we didn't like on this planet,

404
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,380
for only 30 bucks.

405
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,700
But, once again, it turned out just to be another drill.

406
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah.

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Uh, nonetheless, I'm sure we'll be out there, uh, next time.

408
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,380
Next time we'll be lucky 13.

409
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,240
Ah.

410
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,580
And, uh, you know, you cannot shake the faith of the subgenius.

411
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,640
Uh, it's, it's unshakable,

412
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,980
possibly because it's not even really there.

413
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,780
Ah.

414
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,620
That's funny. Yeah, there you go.

415
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,960
But you'd think someone that was, uh, so keen on Slack

416
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,980
would arrange a slightly later date to pick up the subgeniuses.

417
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,640
Well, that's the thing.

418
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,420
You know, we don't, we, we,

419
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,600
I think Bob's lesson from this whole X Day thing is that, uh,

420
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,500
we know not the hour in which they will come.

421
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:39,960
Mm.

422
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,240
And that means you better be ready any second now.

423
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,120
The world could end tomorrow.

424
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,660
Do you have that subgenius minister's card in your pocket

425
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,100
that will provide you with eternal salvation or triple your money back?

426
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,580
Yeah.

427
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,440
That's the question everybody must ask themselves.

428
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,600
Uh, you know, the fact that we gather like idiots

429
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,860
and wait at 7 in the morning every July 5th

430
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,180
on this rainy campground for saucers to pick us up,

431
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,220
only, and then the saucer's not picking us up,

432
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,220
only indicates that,

433
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,440
that this is not yet the year that Bob predicted the saucers would pick us up, 1998.

434
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,720
This must be before 1998,

435
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,440
and the conspiracy of the normal people has obviously been, uh,

436
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,420
diddling the calendars for hundreds of years,

437
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,220
just to embarrass Bob.

438
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,020
Yeah.

439
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,960
Our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

440
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,320
Yeah.

441
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,480
Who predicted all this stuff.

442
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,040
And, and, uh, we, we still have faith in Bob, or F.I.B. for short.

443
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,580
.

444
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,720
We, we steadfastly maintain the F.I.B.

445
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,240
The fib.

446
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,820
.

447
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,860
Of faith in Bob, yes.

448
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,760
Have you considered that maybe aliens don't like early mornings?

449
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,120
I, I, I, everybody has considered that.

450
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,460
Any more than any other saving individual.

451
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,960
I can guarantee you that the subgeniuses really don't like to get up at 7.

452
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,620
Yup.

453
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,880
Now, most of them have to get up at 7 in the morning five days a week to go to work.

454
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,960
Uh, for me, that's the only morning that I have to get up that early.

455
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,340
That, that's my sacrifice for the subgeniuses, is I get up there and let them throw rocks

456
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,280
at me when the aliens don't show up.

457
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,540
.

458
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,500
But I only have to do that one day a year.

459
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,320
So, you might say I have a pretty good job.

460
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,600
You know, I want to see that one that was 60,000 B.C. when there's really no, no humans

461
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,200
that are really.

462
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,700
.

463
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:32,700


464
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:32,960
.

465
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,380
Like humans yet.

466
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,680
.

467
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:34,820
Yeah.

468
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,080
.

469
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,000
They're almost human.

470
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,340
.

471
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,020
They're like ferrets.

472
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,300
.

473
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,740
People.

474
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,040
.

475
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
They're like cartons of milk.

476
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,180
.

477
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,900
This is the sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJC, George.

478
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:44,900


479
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,160
Each person has a face.

480
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,500
Their face is a carton of milk.

481
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:47,680
.

482
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,740
George, I don't think I'll ever listen to this show again.

483
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,580
.

484
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,820
No, no, you probably won't.

485
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,380
.

486
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,480
You know, I used to listen to this show, George, to get my news and I'd get my relevant information

487
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,340
for the day.

488
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,880
I would get my marching orders.

489
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,480
I'd be able to go out and face and cope with the world.

490
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:05,780
.

491
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,740
And yet now, George, George, when I listen to this show now, all I get is confusion,

492
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,460
chaos, and tumult.

493
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:13,820
.

494
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,860
.

495
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:15,860


496
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:15,860


497
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:15,880
.

498
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:15,920
.

499
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:15,920


500
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:15,980
.

501
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,980


502
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:18,980
.

503
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,120
.

504
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,620
.

505
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,620


506
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,880
.

507
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:20,880


508
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:20,880


509
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:20,880


510
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:20,880


511
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,100
.

512
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,540
.

513
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,540


514
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,540


515
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,540


516
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,600
.

517
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,260
.

518
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,460
.

519
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,620
.

520
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,760
.

521
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


522
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


523
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


524
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


525
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


526
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


527
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


528
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


529
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


530
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


531
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


532
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


533
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


534
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


535
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


536
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


537
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


538
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


539
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,760


540
00:21:50,760 --> 00:22:04,720
The two have a good relationship.

541
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,100
.

542
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,500
Yeah, because they're a nice band, really.

543
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
They are a nice band.

544
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,720
Yeah.

545
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,580
Like Jimi Hendrix was a nice band.

546
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,100
Who is that?

547
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,440
Who is that?

548
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,080
Who is that?

549
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,920
That voice?

550
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,640
Roger Waters.

551
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,780
That guy yelling?

552
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,380
Yeah.

553
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,260
Is that Roger Waters?

554
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,700
Yeah.

555
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,560
It's going back and forth between Roger Waters and Jimi Hendrix.

556
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
Get your...

557
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,580
Show together.

558
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,040
If I could just get my show together.

559
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,760
If you can just get your show together.

560
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,940
Show together, man.

561
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,460
Come on.

562
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,400
Get me out of here.

563
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,260
I just want to get out of here.

564
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,440
Get my show together.

565
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,020
Get me out of here.

566
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,820
Get me out of here.

567
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,400
Get me out of here.

568
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm trying to get out of here.

569
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't want to get my drugs anymore.

570
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,400
I'm fine.

571
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,660
I'm fine.

572
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,000
So, uh,

573
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,160
8484425,

574
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,240
that was a short home movie of Bob.

575
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,380
You could be sitting there

576
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,300
listening to yourself talking on the screen.

577
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,400
It's crazy, man.

578
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,000
No, you're just sitting there

579
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,580
getting ready to push your own

580
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,180
special, individual

581
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,700
version of the dump button.

582
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,100
Yeah, but

583
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,140
not with Bo Derek.

584
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,780
Not with Bo Derek, no.

585
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,560
Because she's dead.

586
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
The humans are dead.

587
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,300
Did I not make that clear?

588
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,680
So now, this is this

589
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,100
X day. It's going to be

590
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,600
in New York on July

591
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,220
5th. Right.

592
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,540
And what will be taking

593
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,900
place on that date?

594
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,420
Mostly a lot of stuff that I probably

595
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,440
shouldn't talk about on the radio

596
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,640
because we don't need the extra attention.

597
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,800
But there will be quite a few

598
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,700
bands. This year

599
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,600
it seems to be mostly what you would call

600
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,760
Horror Billy

601
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,100
band.

602
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,960
We'll have the Naked Blood Wrestling

603
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,320
on a giant American

604
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,340
flag. That's kind of a tradition.

605
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,360
That's good. We've had some injuries

606
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
doing that, but we persevere.

607
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,440
We'll be doing live radio

608
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
all the way to the bitter end

609
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,000
or whatever happens.

610
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,500
Remember, we go out to this

611
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,460
campground every year waiting for the

612
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,260
world to end. It's just under the

613
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,360
expectation that maybe this year will

614
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
be 1998.

615
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,100
It's just like the Great Pumpkin.

616
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,500
Our guru Bob predicted that the world

617
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,120
would end July 5th, 1998

618
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,420
at 7 in the morning.

619
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,360
One of these years is bound to be

620
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,400
the real 1998. It will. And when that

621
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,180
happens, you guys are going to get such

622
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,260
awesome press out of it.

623
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,520
You know?

624
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,260
Mary Hart from Entertainment

625
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,440
Tonight. Everyone's going to want to

626
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,080
interview you because Gloria Compost,

627
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,240
Gloria Compost,

628
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,580
Olivia Newton-John.

629
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,660
Man, I can't. You know, I'm

630
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,440
jealous, Jack, because I was looking

631
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,720
at your website and there were pictures

632
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,520
of you with Charo,

633
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,460
Sean Young, the

634
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,960
dueling bankheads.

635
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,800
I had no idea.

636
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,300
You've definitely

637
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,900
explored the subterranean

638
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,520
tunnels, haven't you? Yes, I've been in

639
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,380
an aging TV gas bag

640
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,840
for some time now.

641
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,600
For about

642
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,440
two years.

643
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,580
Ten years. And I used to host a show

644
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,820
with Sandra Bernhardt and

645
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,640
she, you know, she is

646
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,440
Jewish.

647
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,300
Of the Jewish faith.

648
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,820
No way. And

649
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,500
I tried to convert her

650
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,720
every day of my life. I tried

651
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
to convert that woman, telling her,

652
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,200
you know, you killed the Jesus dude

653
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,380
and you're going to go to hell.

654
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
But she

655
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,540
is still just as catty

656
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,260
as she ever was. That's the way

657
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,540
she is.

658
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,540
You tried to convert her, too.

659
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,620
I didn't really know. That was the problem.

660
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,420
I didn't have anything

661
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,720
specific. I was just

662
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,220
trying to convert her away

663
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,780
from the Jew

664
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,520
business. What I really miss about Sandra

665
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,400
is Really Bad Cinema.

666
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,620
Really Bad Cinema. You've never seen that show?

667
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,460
No. She used to host a show called

668
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,500
Really Bad Cinema.

669
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,480
She would make these running

670
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,280
goofy commentaries about all these

671
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,060
50s and early 60s vintage exploitation

672
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,360
films. And it was flawed.

673
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,400
It was absolutely... I mean, you would go out and rent

674
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,640
these ridiculously awful movies just because

675
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,620
just because Sandra Bernhardt...

676
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,420
Well, I will tell you this about Sandra Bernhardt.

677
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,440
She has the prettiest girlfriend in the

678
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,140
world. Beautiful. Beautiful.

679
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,640
Beautiful.

680
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,380
The type of species with which we've been

681
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,640
experimenting is not satisfactory.

682
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,420
Size,

683
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,440
strength, the will to live. Essential

684
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,940
in what we're trying to accomplish here.

685
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,640
Lacking in these animals.

686
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,440
We have at hand the very elements that could

687
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,080
make possible the things we're trying to do.

688
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,860
I don't understand.

689
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,180
It's been proved beyond doubt

690
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,300
that glands can transform

691
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,340
physical matter into any size, shape, or

692
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,720
appearance. Yes, that's true.

693
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,460
We have here in this sanitarium

694
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,120
a rare case of follicular cyst

695
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,500
which induces the secretion

696
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,360
of unusual amounts of the sex hormones.

697
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,520
Miss Coleman?

698
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,780
Yes.

699
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,480
If we've been

700
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,500
able to create through the medium of glandular

701
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,440
extraction such specimens as we have,

702
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,480
what's to prevent us transfusing

703
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,200
these glandular extractions

704
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,420
from a human being

705
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,780
into a higher type of animal?

706
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,480
The authorities.

707
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,600
They wouldn't permit it.

708
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,740
I see you're not truly a scientist

709
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,640
at heart, Miss Strand.

710
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,360
Nor a

711
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,480
subgenius. And Miss

712
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,640
Strand will pay for that

713
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,900
flaw. John Carradine

714
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,600
will transplant her brain into the

715
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
gorilla woman body of captive

716
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,620
wild woman.

717
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,360
1943. The movie once that

718
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
clip was ripped.

719
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,400
One of the lesser

720
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,280
universal monster movies.

721
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,400
But because of that, now

722
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,180
all the more bulldada

723
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,620
looking. And the female

724
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,100
star who played the egg woman,

725
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,180
Aquanetta. Oh my god.

726
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,440
Enough said.

727
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,000
Anyway.

728
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
We have also heard

729
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,520
clips from When Worlds Collide,

730
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,920
the old movie, and from

731
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,200
the puzzling evidence show of

732
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,840
which more is coming.

733
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,960
But first, back to the

734
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,980
British podcast of right where

735
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,520
you are sitting now.

736
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,880
So how long does an average X-Day last for?

737
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,180
Usually about a little less than a week.

738
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,060
We'll start arriving at

739
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,180
the campground on Tuesday or Wednesday

740
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,940
and depending on when

741
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,800
the 5th of July

742
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,980
lands, we usually end up going

743
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,000
home dejected and

744
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,180
sad

745
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,980
and sick on Sunday.

746
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,460
But

747
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,600
it's well worth it.

748
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,120
Just because you get

749
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
to meet the other subgeniuses.

750
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,200
You know, in any

751
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,000
given neighborhood, there may be plenty

752
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,940
of other subgeniuses scattered around,

753
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,080
but you don't know them. You don't know who they are.

754
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,880
You can't tell them by

755
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,200
how they look. They could be any age,

756
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,460
any type of person.

757
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,080
And the smart

758
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,100
ones don't wear subgenius

759
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,420
t-shirts all the time.

760
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,680
Because that can affect your

761
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,260
income.

762
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,220
So we

763
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,760
but so X-Day is the chance for all

764
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,920
of us to get together and

765
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,660
essentially it's a migratory

766
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,720
mating ground.

767
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,840
And the mating really does happen.

768
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,660
In the old days, we

769
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,620
were accused of it being

770
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,280
what you might call a sausage

771
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,940
fest.

772
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,480
All boys group

773
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,700
of geeks. And it was in the

774
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,260
early years, but we started lying

775
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,780
and saying there were a lot of

776
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,460
horny girls around.

777
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,100
And build it and they will come.

778
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,740
Pretty soon,

779
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,980
there were lots of horny

780
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,200
nerd girls around to

781
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,360
meet the nerd boys.

782
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,340
And now there's little nerd children.

783
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,560
You know, we've been doing this for so long.

784
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
There's a second generation.

785
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,740
Children

786
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,120
who were raised in the church of the

787
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,160
subgenius, most of whom have not

788
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,320
been taken away from their parents yet.

789
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,360
And even the one

790
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,760
that did get taken away from him,

791
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,680
his parents is now back with his parents.

792
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,200
Yeah, is that Rachel?

793
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,120
Rachel Bevilacqua or Reverend

794
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Magdalene, as we call her and my

795
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,700
former business partner, Jesus.

796
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,900
They met it at X Day Drill in

797
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,200
1997. They were married there in 1998.

798
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,200
Then the child custody case took

799
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,240
them away from us for a long time.

800
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,100
How is that?

801
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,200
They did win the case and they got

802
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
that they got the kid back or they

803
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
didn't exactly.

804
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,240
Win it. But they have had the kid for a

805
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,220
while now and it's unlikely that the

806
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,380
biological father will be able to get the

807
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,260
kid back because he's even worse than we

808
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,520
are.

809
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,620
You say that they run about the the

810
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,100
mating ground of the subgenius. What

811
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,740
would the mating call of the subgenius

812
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,240
sound like?

813
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,760
It sounds well, it sounds like this.

814
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,720
I find myself strangely around and I'm

815
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,620
not even a subgenius.

816
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,020
Well, it's not for amateurs.

817
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,760
You can hurt yourself making that noise.

818
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,260
And now I did this inside of a house

819
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,000
with the windows closed so that

820
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,500
neighbors wouldn't come flocking to me.

821
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,340
Just imagine them bouncing off the

822
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,560
windows like birds now.

823
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,660
It's mostly bats right now bouncing off the windows.

824
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,800
They also respond.

825
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,140
Here on the show, this is the color of

826
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,600
the sun.

827
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,440
Meditation.

828
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,060
Oh, well, is that a soothing purple?

829
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,160
Mm-hmm.

830
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,360
So you can hear the sound of purple in the

831
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,760
background.

832
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, I'll be jiggered.

833
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,920
Into outer space.

834
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,140
At X Day, yeah.

835
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,840
At X Day.

836
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,620
Are you going to X Day this year?

837
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,980
I think so.

838
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,840
What about fuzzling? Are you going?

839
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,440
I think so.

840
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,960
Yeah, that'd be great.

841
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,720
Ride out on the train.

842
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,400
Train to X Day?

843
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
There's a train that goes all the way to Erie.

844
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,580
Didn't you say that?

845
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:25,580


846
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,620
And then you rent a car and drive 75 miles and you're there.

847
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,300
Wow.

848
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
Then you have to have a car, don't you?

849
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,320
But, I mean...

850
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,820
You have to rent a car in Erie.

851
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,100
Right by the train tracks.

852
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
You can rent a car.

853
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,080
They'd be so happy to rent you a car because there's no business and everything's sad in that part of the country.

854
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,660
But they don't know it's sad because they have a lowered...

855
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,780
Because of the toxic waste that's been in the area for so long, they have a lowered sense of expectation there.

856
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,780
Well, you know...

857
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,120
So they could... They...

858
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,400
Well, you know... They...

859
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,300
They're sad and austere to us is actually quite cheery and bright to them.

860
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,680
They lead very rich lives in Pobucker Junction, actually, which we can't even imagine.

861
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,120
They understand the concept of blissful ignorance.

862
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:07,940
That's true.

863
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,280
It's folly to be wise.

864
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,400
Best seen in the winter when it's gray and...

865
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,560
And then you see the little eyes looking, staring out from...

866
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,680
At the shiny car.

867
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,860
From the cars and from the...

868
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,020
They know it's a visitor.

869
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,940
From the windows in the homes.

870
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,040
Visitors have money.

871
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,380
And, of course, they're surrounded by men who are...

872
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,620
And, of course, they're surrounded by men who are...

873
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,640
Hutterites, Hutterites, and photosynthetic algae.

874
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,260
But in the country, there are the Amish, and an homage to them is in the works.

875
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,800
Omelets are available at the store in that little two-bit tank town.

876
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,940
I forget the name of it.

877
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,820
What is it?

878
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,460
Oh, Sherman, New York.

879
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,100
I own...

880
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Yeah, that two-bit...

881
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,640
Spit hole in the road.

882
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,460
That run down, beat up...

883
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,860
Car paper...

884
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,620
Big greasy spot.

885
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,160
Yeah, that bleeding piece of earth.

886
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,460
That smelly hole in the bucket of filth, we call...

887
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,660
That rhinestone in the rough.

888
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:10,800
Humanity.

889
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,940
Yeah, it's actually a lot of fun.

890
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:22,580
This last X Day, we had a special guest, Hal Robbins, also known as Dr. Hal, who is a...

891
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,680
Mm-hmm.

892
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,440
...entertainer.

893
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,640
...entertainer and a cartoonist from San Francisco.

894
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:35,140
We bring him in every year to prove that there's at least one subgenius left who is still intelligent.

895
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:48,280
And if you ever listen to my radio show, The Hour of Slack, or his radio show, the Puzzling Evidence show, or the Ask Dr. Hal show, you'll see what I mean.

896
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,980
Yeah, he just released a load of subgenius stuff, didn't he, for old videos and things.

897
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,120
He kind of knows everything.

898
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,060
He has a nightclub act called Ask Dr. Hal.

899
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,620
He also performs it at X Day, but he does it on a weekly basis in San Francisco, where he lives.

900
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,180
And you can ask that guy anything, and he will answer convincingly.

901
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,000
You should really have him on your show at some point.

902
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,880
Yeah, I think we might have to.

903
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,360
I'll give you his number later.

904
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
He definitely sounds interesting.

905
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,440
So tell us...

906
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,200
Sorry.

907
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,140
Go on.

908
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:27,240
So you're saying that the hardworking and super knowledgeable were disqualifying features of the Church of the Subgenius?

909
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,100
No, not necessarily at all.

910
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,900
Isn't he breaking all the rules?

911
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:38,180
When we talk about Slack and being a subgenius, that doesn't equate with laziness and stupidity.

912
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:47,320
It equates with freedom and happiness, which means for some of us, working hard at what we wanted to work at is Slack.

913
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,700
And I think that would be true of Dr. Hal.

914
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,200
And myself also.

915
00:35:52,520 --> 00:36:01,840
Some subgeniuses get Slack from sitting around watching television all day, and others get Slack from doing things.

916
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,120
But only the things they wanted to do.

917
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:13,500
The conspiracy sets it up so that you have to do things you never would have imagined yourself doing just to keep a roof over your head.

918
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,600
Well, as subgeniuses, we object to being forced to do that.

919
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,200
That's about all we can do is object.

920
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Because most of us still have to have jobs.

921
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,320
But the Church provides a certain amount of Slack in between.

922
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:45,360
I've noticed a lot of subgeniuses who have day jobs log onto the internet during the day and check out alt.slack, which is our news group, when they're being paid to be doing something else.

923
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,800
And that's the greatest Slack.

924
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,340
Stolen Slack.

925
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,240
The whole black market for it.

926
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,600
Hi, Gareth.

927
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,600
This message is for Reverend Ivan Hsing.

928
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,380
This is Monica over at Flash News.

929
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,100
Sorry I missed your call earlier.

930
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm interested in writing up a short story about the subgeniuses Armageddon coming up in July.

931
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,200
If you could please give me a call back soon as possible.

932
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,320
I'd really appreciate it.

933
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:09,840
Thank you. Bye.

934
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,540
Hello, this is Nipa Nardin.

935
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,880
Great way to second this message.

936
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,040
That, you know, you and me, those of us who are like...

937
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,700
...so-called subgeniuses, and I have our names on the list.

938
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,800
You know, see, it's the end times.

939
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,460
It's possible that some so-called subgeniuses are going to be left behind.

940
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:41,140
If you didn't have a dream that an alien invasion is coming and that you're going to be taken away from it, you might be, as a subgenius, left behind here with the rest of the pinks to deal with the conspiracy.

941
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,120
But I had a dream that I'll be taken and that an alien invasion is going to take place.

942
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,580
So if you are a subgenius...

943
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,740
...and you haven't had a dream...

944
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,900
...and think that it's the end times, that an alien invasion is going to take place and that you're going to be taken out of here...

945
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,640
...then you might be left behind as a subgenius along with the pinks and the pinks...

946
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,460
Alright, well, tell us what you get for your $30 ordination fee.

947
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,740
Well, the main thing you get is the right to board the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X and live forever.

948
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,460
Right.

949
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,940
Or as long as you want to live.

950
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,560
Doing it.

951
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,560
Doing anything you want.

952
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,540
Yeah, see that $30 shows up on the bar.

953
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:34,740
But in more practical, immediate terms, you get a nice folder with an all-inclusive, frameable excuse doctorate that excuses all sins.

954
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:43,280
You get a doctorate of the forbidden sciences, which includes many perversions and things that you've been appointed an expert in.

955
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,560
And just a million little posters and gigas and all the goofy crap you would get with any fan club.

956
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,540
You know, bumper stickers, pins, secret decoder ring.

957
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,140
Oh, now there you go.

958
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,540
Secret decoder ring.

959
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,580
You hit it right there.

960
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,040
It's the starter kit.

961
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,280
Do you get a priest coat?

962
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,320
After that, we get you hooked on the radio shows and the books and the comics.

963
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,900
Do you get a collar to wear on your shirt?

964
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,680
A collar to wear on your shirt, like a priest thing?

965
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,020
A priest coat, yeah.

966
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:17,180
Some do that. We don't supply that ourselves. We suggest you go to your local Catholic supply house.

967
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,460
Those are fun to inspect.

968
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,040
Catholic supply houses? Yeah.

969
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:31,360
Well, they're fun, like biological teaching supply houses. They sell weird stuff that you don't see at Walmart.

970
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:47,160
Ladies and gentlemen, the coordinates to this is 104.56, the exact longitude of the Roswell Crysat, and 33.28 multiplied by pi results in that one.

971
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,160


972
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,540
Longitude.

973
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,980
Somebody knew, the ancients knew this, and 19.47 times 3.38 equals 6480.

974
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:10,740
Between July 1947, listen to this now, between July 1947 and March 2012, there are exactly 64.80 years.

975
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,160
19.47 times 3.38 is exactly 64.80 years.

976
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:30,320
Exactly 64.80, and that's the exact date that takes you from July 1947 to March 2012 are 64.80 years.

977
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,860
This is not a coincidence, ladies and gentlemen.

978
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:43,300
This is significant that the United States recovered the debris and alien bodies of the Roswell crash on the 4th of July.

979
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,900
Oh, now, wait a minute. The 4th of July?

980
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,780
The very day that we're celebrating our liberty?

981
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,080
And they sent a message that we are still enslaved to them?

982
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,480
That these mighty ones, these fallen ones?

983
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,340
They sent it on the 4th of July, 1947.

984
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,280
America itself was founded on the same date in 1776.

985
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:12,020
This year was chosen by the elite behind the formation of America for a special reason.

986
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,140
This reason being that 888,

987
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,680
888 is the sum of the letters in Greek of the name of the Messiah.

988
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,200
Each Greek letter represents a number.

989
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:34,100
A second Messiah, 888, plus the first Messiah, 888, equals 1776, America's founding date.

990
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:42,740
1776 is a number representing a second Messiah or the King of the New World Order,

991
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,880
and it symbolizes the event of a God-man on Earth.

992
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:54,220
According to the Illuminati elite, as the first Messiah came to establish the Kingdom of Heaven,

993
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,960
the second Illuminati Messiah will establish a New World Order upon the Earth.

994
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:11,740
And that New World Order is this radio show, the Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the subgenius.

995
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,720
Subgenius.com

996
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,620
The word subgenius does not have an O in it, by the way.

997
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:29,220
Friends, that clip just earlier was found by Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur,

998
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,580
but that's all I know about it, therefore it must be something sacred, something holy.

999
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,500
Yes.

1000
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,180
Coming up, we also have such weird show mixes,

1001
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,520
as puzzling evidence as a guest,

1002
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:52,360
on Reverend Susie the Flusie's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse Show on WREK Atlanta.

1003
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,860
Imagine that.

1004
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,640
And more from our frequent caller, Bernard,

1005
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,800
as well as a poem by Ninslow, read by Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com.

1006
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,100
But now, let us return to Reverend Ken, and Kim,

1007
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,560
from right where you are sitting now.

1008
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,380
Can you tell us about some of the regular activities that happen the next day?

1009
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,720
Are they things that happen year by year, or is it just spontaneous?

1010
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,940
Yeah, every year we have a Bobtism in the pool.

1011
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,580
This campground is pretty developed. It has a really nice indoor swimming pool.

1012
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,840
And we...

1013
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,900
Usually myself and some other preacher, Dr. Howell or Dr. Legume,

1014
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,580
will get in the pool with all these mostly naked people,

1015
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,680
and dunk their heads under, baptize them against the conspiracy,

1016
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,220
in the name of Bob.

1017
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,260
I try to come up with a different little spiel for each one.

1018
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,920
And we will go through 40 or 50 people in about half an hour.

1019
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,740
It's a very...

1020
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,300
It's an assembly line type of holy ritual.

1021
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:17,460
And it's also unfilmable, because as I say, it's got a lot of naked individuals.

1022
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,520
You don't have to be, but a lot of them choose to, just because they can.

1023
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,400
That sounds eminently filmable.

1024
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,840
It was. For years we did do that.

1025
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,460
And if you look at our website, subgenius.com,

1026
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,600
the photos of past X days, up to about 2000,

1027
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,460
about 2005,

1028
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,900
you'll see a lot of nudity.

1029
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,820
After that, we discovered that the appearance of the nude photographs on the internet

1030
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,460
was cutting down on the number of ladies who would jump into the pool.

1031
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,220
So, since then we banned cameras from certain events.

1032
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,100
Another thing we do, besides the baptism and the 7am thing,

1033
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,640
is we will have beer tasting parties.

1034
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,720
Mm-hmm.

1035
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,500
Which can last quite a long time.

1036
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,060
We had a gang war last time, which...

1037
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,940
None of the subgeniuses can form gangs.

1038
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,580
Each individual is a separate gang.

1039
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,600
So it ended up being just a bunch of kids using toy store weapons on each other

1040
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,220
until they got tired of it and decided to raid the beer tasting party.

1041
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,960
So it's...

1042
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,720
To some extent, it's a bunch of grown-ups doing childish stuff,

1043
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,020
and looking for some hot action.

1044
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:47,300
In a situation where they're likely to both get hurt and get laid.

1045
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,220
And sometimes at the very same time.

1046
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,680
Isn't there like a Wicker Man-style burning of Bob as well?

1047
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:03,240
We have an effigy of Bob that is usually hanging by the neck from one of the rafters

1048
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,720
where we do most of the preaching.

1049
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,030
And where the bands play.

1050
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,310
There's a lot of rock bands at X Day.

1051
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,490
There's a bonfire event at midnight on Saturday

1052
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,790
where we burn a wooden symbol of Bob.

1053
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,770
It's kind of a logo icon thing we developed.

1054
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,890
Because it's easier to make than a face of Bob.

1055
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,490
It's kind of a stripped down pic-toe.

1056
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,930
And we burn that and drum and dance around like the pagans do.

1057
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,810
The pagans are a lot better at the drum.

1058
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,550
I'll grant them that.

1059
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,170
Probably less drunk, I would have thought.

1060
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:42,330
And we have to depend on the pagans to start the fire for us.

1061
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,810
We still haven't mastered the secret of fire.

1062
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:51,730
You know, Mrs. Reverend Angry Larry finally picked herself a church name.

1063
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,770
Reverend Lucy Van Pelt.

1064
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,790
She was so nice this past year at X Day.

1065
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,570
She took that naked girl out of my hands.

1066
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,450
I could not get rid of that naked girl.

1067
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,970
I could not get rid of her.

1068
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,450
A lot of us have that problem in life.

1069
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:11,870
That girl wrote to me and asked me to take the pictures of her being a drunken naked girl down off the internet.

1070
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,190
And I didn't do anything at all.

1071
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,190
Woohoo!

1072
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,030
I mean, she'd have to send another picture to show which one she is.

1073
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:30,410
Well, you know, the thing is, there was already somebody up on stage with a rehearsed, a naked person on stage singing.

1074
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,250
A professional naked person.

1075
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,670
A professional singing naked person, Fat Mandy, doing her act.

1076
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:48,230
And then this amateur naked person comes up and starts, you know, slurring and drooling and stumbling around and flirting with the cameras.

1077
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,790
I mean, she would, she was playing to the cameras.

1078
00:47:52,830 --> 00:48:02,110
And for her to then say, would you please not put my picture anywhere since I made you, since I got into all of your pictures against your will.

1079
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,650
Right, she walked in front of them.

1080
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,110
It's like, no, we're going to fine you by letting your boss find those on the internet.

1081
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:13,890
What it really comes down to though is that Lucy, Reverend Lucy Van Pelt, I could not get rid of naked chick.

1082
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:17,350
And I went to her and I said, does this belong to you?

1083
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:24,430
Because a lot of times things that get on the stage that don't belong there do somehow indirectly belong to them.

1084
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,670
And I said, does this belong to you?

1085
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,970
And she said, who is it?

1086
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,910
And I turned it around because it was, it was on kind of on my shoulder-ish.

1087
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,390
And naked girl's on my shoulder.

1088
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,330
She's looking, you know, at, at the butt.

1089
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:36,630
And then she says, turn it around.

1090
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,350
We turned around and she goes, nope, that doesn't belong to me.

1091
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,230
I said, will you take it anyway?

1092
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,410
And she said, sure.

1093
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,330
That's what they all say.

1094
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:45,790
Sure.

1095
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,290
I'm just saying.

1096
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,510
Will you take it anyway?

1097
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,010
I mean, how many times have you heard that?

1098
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,070
Well, it's not, it wasn't my naked girl.

1099
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,230
It's everybody's naked girl.

1100
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,330
Officer, it wasn't my naked girl, honest.

1101
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,890
I don't know how she got in the car.

1102
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:00,890


1103
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,330
I hear that all the time.

1104
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,510
I just wanted to.

1105
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,650
Well, then we'll have to take her into custody, son.

1106
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,210
It's our naked girl now.

1107
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,690
And that would have been funny.

1108
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,430
It's just not my naked girl.

1109
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:17,870
You know, I think my naked girl's a special, special, not special.

1110
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,930
Not my naked girl sounds like a TV show.

1111
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,490
Especial.

1112
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,910
Michael J. Fox makes his dramatic comeback in Not My Naked Girl.

1113
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,790
There's some really, really tasteless jokes.

1114
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,090
I'm not going to go there.

1115
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,890
However, I did make the suggestion to the rest of you.

1116
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,690
Hey, watch those horns.

1117
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:38,270
Nope.

1118
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,530
Okay, we're reloading now.

1119
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,410
Lock and load, kids.

1120
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,510
Fire in the hole.

1121
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,130
And they sure do, with the eagerness of the new year.

1122
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,070
Just a couple of hours into July 1st.

1123
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,230
Well, like I say, where I'm from, July, July.

1124
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,650
I mean, January 1st hasn't even happened yet.

1125
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,770
But I can cut that out.

1126
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,030
I don't think.

1127
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,270
How July hasn't happened?

1128
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,450
How do you know it didn't happen?

1129
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:00,850
I don't know.

1130
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1131
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1132
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1133
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1134
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1135
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1136
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1137
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:00,890


1138
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,070
I don't know.

1139
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,530
You know, it will happen.

1140
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,870
Just because somebody told you.

1141
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,170
Just because you think you looked at the calendar last night.

1142
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,290
Date in the newspaper.

1143
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:06,990
Oh, yeah.

1144
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,150
I believe everything in the paper.

1145
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,150
Sure, you made a lot of plans.

1146
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,450
How do you know it's going to happen?

1147
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,850
How do you know it even came true?

1148
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,990
How do you know even X day is going to happen?

1149
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,190
Well, that's one thing you can depend on.

1150
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:17,470
Uh-huh.

1151
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,730
And Y day, and Z day.

1152
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,130
They'll all happen and you'll be there.

1153
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,610
And you'll wonder, why didn't I send that money in?

1154
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,250
Oh, there we go.

1155
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,530
Took care of that guy.

1156
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:30,870
Yeah.

1157
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,570
And we're just cruising down Central Avenue, taking care of the storefront.

1158
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,690
We're going to go out to Little 500 Point and relax.

1159
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,870
Because it's New Year.

1160
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,190
Oh, yes.

1161
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,630
Another day, another chance.

1162
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:49,970
Another drink.

1163
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,190
Another bout of self-delusion.

1164
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,590
Don't you just love it?

1165
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:55,530
What?

1166
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,150
Girl, I've been at like a hot dog in the fire.

1167
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,450
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,710
Just let them pour that mustard all over you.

1169
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,050
I understand.

1170
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,310
Down here at the station, they're drinking the hair oil.

1171
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,650
It's really hit the bottom now.

1172
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:08,930
Wow.

1173
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,850
It keeps our coats glossy.

1174
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:12,670
Yeah, it does.

1175
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,570
How do you crawl out of that skin anyway?

1176
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,890
It's got like a big tube top.

1177
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:19,690
Oh, yeah.

1178
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,810
See, Susie the floozy's skins are over there on the other side of the station.

1179
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,130
There's only a third of them.

1180
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:24,950
I saved the skins I shed.

1181
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,630
That's right.

1182
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,510
It's disgusting.

1183
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,430
I can't even look at it.

1184
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,430


1185
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,430


1186
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,430


1187
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,430


1188
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,430


1189
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,530
I can't even look at it.

1190
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:29,530


1191
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:29,530


1192
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,730
I don't want to look over there, but they have a light on it here.

1193
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,690
So you have to watch.

1194
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,430
Wow.

1195
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,050
No one, everybody thought the Cheeto was the name of the woman.

1196
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:40,510
No.

1197
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,390
What is the monkey name, Jane?

1198
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,610
A thousand people tried to answer that one.

1199
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,230
Look at him.

1200
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,530
Hey, happy New Year.

1201
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:51,990
You too.

1202
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,070
Yeah.

1203
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,510
We're off the balcony here, waving to the crowds outside WRUK Atlanta.

1204
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,410
This has been Simulacrum.

1205
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1206
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1207
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1208
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1209
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1210
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1211
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1212
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410


1213
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:07,490
KPFA Berkeley, KPFA and KFCF in the wonderful Valley Mountain and Snow-capped Hills of Fresno.

1214
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,430
And KRAP in the Tri-City area.

1215
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,590
And KNON in Dallas.

1216
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,270
The cities where they try anything.

1217
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,550
WFMU in New Jersey.

1218
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,250
Mmm, praise, WFMU.

1219
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:23,990
I believe the first station to play some of these foreign tones.

1220
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,510
In the contiguous U.S.

1221
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,070
Yeah, yeah, we must continue with what we're doing here.

1222
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:32,770
It's a show.

1223
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,510
Slogging, trudging through the trees.

1224
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,830
I could call and I could hold the handset up to the microphone.

1225
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:38,830
You could be on the air.

1226
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,630
I don't even know what the number is down here.

1227
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,890
8-9-4-2-4-6-8.

1228
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:52,530
The problem is they're so slack-full they're just lying on the couch.

1229
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,450
And they can't get up and they can't get over to the floor.

1230
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,690
Because you're in California, you can.

1231
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:57,390
But they lie.

1232
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,890
And they love everybody.

1233
00:52:58,450 --> 00:52:59,570
Oh, it feels so good.

1234
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,130
And you can't call the WRAP number.

1235
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,790
You can just call 8-4-8-4-5.

1236
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:03,130
The year, you mean?

1237
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,050
Yep.

1238
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,710
It never stops.

1239
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,350
Well, last year stopped a little while ago.

1240
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,470
Oh, that's what they'll have you think.

1241
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,870
It's stopping right now in Missouri.

1242
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,670
And it will stop in just a few moments in Texas.

1243
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,650
And like I said, it's so sad.

1244
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,090
In California, they have hours to go before it stops.

1245
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,410
So where is the New Year starting exactly?

1246
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,410
I don't get it.

1247
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,790
Greenwich Mean Time?

1248
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,330
How does time work?

1249
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,630
Greenwich Mean is a snake town.

1250
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,150
Starting up the building and we're driving down the street again.

1251
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,770
Radio bikers.

1252
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,650
Now we have to go get our little radio tattoos.

1253
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,990
Hours of show?

1254
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,270
Christina's got her needle all set to go.

1255
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:49,450
Wait.

1256
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,570
Hello, this is Lisa Norris.

1257
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,430
And I just want to say, you know, as a comment, you know, that I'm a, I, I, that I know that

1258
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:02,490
I'm a weird, strange mutant and that weird things happen around me and they're happening

1259
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,990
around me now that the UFOs are turning in the skies.

1260
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,250
And I just want to say, I think that it's the end time.

1261
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:12,610
You know, that as a subgenius, you know, we, we know that the church of the subgenius is

1262
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:17,910
a UFO church, a UFO cult or church, whatever you want to call it, or UFO religion.

1263
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:23,470
And that if you haven't had a dream or two dreams that you, that this alien invasion

1264
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,410
is going to take place by now and that you're going to be taken away from it, that you, that

1265
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,110
you're going to be taken away from it as a subgenius may be left behind with the pink

1266
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,390
to deal with the pink conspiracy.

1267
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:43,150
Now here's a poem by young Reverend Nenslow, age seven, from Portland, Oregon.

1268
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,170
You might want to read it or it's kind of long.

1269
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,370
You might want to read some of it.

1270
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:47,810
Good God.

1271
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,570
It's a Nenslow poem of endless verses.

1272
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,370
Well, it's, it's a next day poem though.

1273
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,990
I'm filled with anticipation as I'm about to reach the end of the world.

1274
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:57,390
I'm filled with anticipation as I'm about to reach the end of the world.

1275
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,530
I'm filled with anticipation as I wait to go away.

1276
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:03,770
I'm going home to planet X for it's X day today.

1277
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,270
My life is put on hold as I throw away my past.

1278
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,090
I can't go on with my life.

1279
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,610
I give in to my fears at last.

1280
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,190
I never tried to chase a rainbow or tried to live a dream.

1281
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,710
I made very few mistakes.

1282
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,210
My heart was right, it seemed.

1283
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,530
Never wanted to be somebody.

1284
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,470
Just a soul just passing by.

1285
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,730
I had no grandiose vision.

1286
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,910
Was not aiming for the sky.

1287
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,450
But Bob had other plans for me.

1288
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,850
He yanked my feet up off the ground.

1289
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,570
He said, if you want to serve me, then take a look around.

1290
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:49,190
You see, there are many people in this stupid world, you know.

1291
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:53,830
And it's up to you to tell them exactly where to go.

1292
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:57,690
So you made a few mistakes, as oh so many do.

1293
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:03,490
But if you can send me thirty bucks, I can still use you.

1294
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,390
Exalt yourself and tell them of the mistakes that they have made.

1295
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:14,050
Then tell them of my smiling face and the price that you have paid.

1296
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,850
I will sell you purpose, provision, and a name.

1297
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,630
Your life will be confusing.

1298
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,070
It will never be the same.

1299
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,770
I have never been right here with you.

1300
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,190
Even when life was hard.

1301
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,650
I knew you couldn't make it.

1302
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:31,170
I knew it from the start.

1303
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:35,050
So keep on calling my name whenever you need a hand.

1304
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,750
And your dollars you must send to me as countless as the sand.

1305
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,730
I always will forsake you.

1306
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,070
I will always leave you cold.

1307
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:48,590
Especially when you make mistakes and are growing very old.

1308
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,050
Now take my words and tell them.

1309
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,570
And tell your friends of the message that I gave.

1310
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,930
And be my witness to the world.

1311
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,790
And dig your fucking grave.

1312
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,690
Reverend Nenslow, age six.

1313
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:10,070
Yes, that young man shows great promise in the poetic department.

1314
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:15,430
And you know his poos make better dobs heads than the ones that Little Vreede's paints.

1315
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:18,310
I know, it really drives him insane too.

1316
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,630
It actually did, isn't it.

1317
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,110
Hey you there I'm a big shot.

1318
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,070
Your heart's broken into two pieces.

1319
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,070


1320
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,070


1321
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,410
Oh my god.

1322
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:39,410


1323
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:39,410


1324
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,530
Oh you talk too much.

1325
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,730
Oh, just great dot.

1326
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:43,570


1327
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:44,210


1328
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:45,270
You ok?

1329
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,490
I'm alright.

1330
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,070
Uh-okay.

1331
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,330
There's gotta be a way of killing it.

1332
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,910
How do we do it?

1333
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,610
You can't.

1334
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,950
You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?

1335
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:26,870
The subgenius power of slasher.

1336
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,650
Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.

1337
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,150
You admire it.

1338
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,430
I admire its purity.

1339
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:43,050
By conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.

1340
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,910
I can't lie to you about your chances.

1341
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,050
But you have my sympathy.

1342
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:50,250
You have my sympathy.
