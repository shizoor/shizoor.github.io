Oh, Bob is my story, Bob is my song, Bob's my amphetamine.

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:40,920
All the day long, I won't rip my poster of Dobbs down, I'll feel no sadness or shame,

115
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,180
till I behold him in Dobbs town, Bob is his name.

116
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,100
She sings from somewhere you can't see, she sits in the top of the greenest trees,

117
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,880
she sends out a rumour of undefined love, it drips on down into the summer buzz.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,300
She's just a girl, she's just a girl, the girl you want.

119
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,900
She's just a girl, she's just a girl, the girl you want.

120
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,220
You hear me calling everywhere you turn, you know you're headed for the pleasure burn,

121
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,160
but the word gets stuck on the tip of your tongue, I'm the real thing but you knew it all along.

I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl, the girl you want.

124
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,420
I'm looking you in your mouth, wondering, I'm looking you in your mind, spinning,

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,360
why don't we just admit it all over, I'm just a girl you want.

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl, the girl you want.

127
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,900
I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl, the girl you want.

128
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,160
I say a good-bye to friends, to good-bye to something I can't save.

129
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,560
Say a good-bye to everythingroom, to the meaning of abattoir and happiness.

Again, an cheesy song which is, she's just a girl, and she's just a girl,

133
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,460
the girl you want.

134
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,900
She's just a girl, she's just a girl, the girl you want.

135
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:10,900

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,520
Come on!

145
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,440
Everybody, we're gonna get married.

146
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,980
In the J.R. Bob Dobbs way.

147
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm the Reverend Angry Larry.

148
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,900
So repeat every fucking thing I say.

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:23,940
Hey!

150
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,240
You...

151
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,240
You wanna get married?

152
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,820
Not to the guy up playing the guitar, you don't have to repeat that.

153
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,380
That's part of it, what I say, never mind.

154
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
Sex Mortis is on the drums, everybody give him a hand.

155
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,780
Okay, yeah, you can clap for him if you want, but I meant give him a hand.

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,580
Oh no, give him a handjob, that's what it is, sorry.

157
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Yes, give Sex Mortis a handjob!

158
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,180
Okay, you on the left, whichever one you are, the male or female.

159
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,780
Look at the male or female to the other side.

160
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,980
And say, hey...

161
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,800
I think your dick or your cunt is pretty hot, maybe we should like get together.

162
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,480
And have a really good time.

163
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,640
Don't make any babies or anything.

164
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,500
Oh no, wait a minute, sorry.

165
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:39,040
We need more babies to keep the subgenius church going, so fuck a lot.

166
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,260
Now the other person, look at that person and go...

00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,100
Oh yeah, that's pretty cool.

168
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
I would really like that.

169
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,840
Because we love Bob Dobbs, but secretly like dick Dobbs.

170
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,500
We're not pinks anymore.

171
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,280
We're part of this awesome church called the Church of the Subgenius.

172
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,000

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,940
Because without Connie there would be no anybody.

179
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,460
Well and the milkman.

180
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,560

183
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,920
Some people marry their like...

184
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,300
Shirt.

185
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,880
Shirt.

186
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,140
Some people marry their shirt.

187
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,060
Or their cigarette.

188
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,700
Or, yeah, or their genitalia which is kind of fucked up.

189
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,420
Oh yeah, and timing is a good thing.

190
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,780
So from now on you guys are duly authorized to do whatever the fuck you want with one another.

191
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,900
Stick the hole in whatever hole you want or stick the finger or...

192
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,840
In whatever hole you wish...

193
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,620
For 24 hours.

194
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes, or the Templo Devo.

195
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,020
Which is like this.

196
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,880
So you guys are all short duration married.

197
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,700
Everyone within earshot is now short duration married.

198
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,900
So...

199
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,900
I also want to do another ceremony really quick.

200
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,520
That I was thinking about earlier today.

201
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,240
Since we got that one out of the way.

202
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,960
All right?

203
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,560
Did we?

204
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah.

205
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,640
We're done.

206
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,480
You said...

207
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,120
One, two, three, four.

208
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,180
Now this ceremony is a little bit different.

209
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,280
I just wanted to show everybody the Templo Devo.

210
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,380
So it's in the other world.

211
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,260
But it's chilled out.

212
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,280
Okay.

213
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,680
It's the world outside of here.

214
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,780
One, two, three.

215
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,880
And I'm going to show you how to do it.

216
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


217
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


218
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


219
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


220
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


221
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


222
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


223
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


224
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,880


225
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,700
One, two, three, four.

226
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,860
There you go.

227
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,320
Okay.

228
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,220
So we're going to do another...

229
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,460
Okay.

230
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,660
Now that was the end of your marriage.

231
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,820
Now you may kiss the bride and or groom while we giggle like retards.

232
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,480
Go ahead.

233
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:01,700
Okay.

234
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,100
Go ahead and consummate your...

235
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,320
Go ahead.

236
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,880
Come on.

237
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,580
Fuckers.

238
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,240
Now some of you may be experiencing a bit of polygamy at the moment.

239
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,560
So if you are in earshot and you're not comfortable with the polygamy you're experiencing,

240
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm going to give you an out.

241
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,620
And we have a salve for that.

242
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,180
So here's the out.

243
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,040
For the first time that I can recall, we're going to do a short duration divorce.

244
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,120
Oh yeah.

245
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,860
So if you guys really don't think this is working out...

246
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,400
So if you guys are married in the real world to someone else, if you are married

247
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,220
to the person next to you in the real world and feel guilty about screwing around, you

248
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,720
can...

249
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,340
As of right now, you can partake in the short duration divorce.

250
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,000
Right.

251
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,580
Like you two.

252
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,140
You two can get divorced right now.

253
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,560
So all you have to say is...

254
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,640
I want you to repeat after me.

255
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:08,460
I am hereby short duration divorced.

256
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,100
And then insert whatever you were married to.

257
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,720
Right.

258
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,260
Okay.

259
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:16,920
So...

260
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,300
Thank you.

261
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,340
Now by the power invested in me by JR Bob Dobbs, you are all short duration divorced

262
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,520
from whatever you wanted to be short duration divorced from.

263
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,640
And so now you can all punch one another really hard while we laugh like retards.

264
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,180
Go ahead.

265
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,760
Come on.

266
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,120
So go ahead and consummate your short duration divorces.

267
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,320
Start socking.

268
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,120
Oh no, actually you're supposed to make out with the person next to you that you didn't

269
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,640
marry and you didn't divorce.

270
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,240
Right.

271
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,540
The whole point here was that you wanted to be able to screw around without getting in

272
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,760
trouble for screwing around.

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,280
That was the point of the short duration divorce.

274
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:54,880
Right.

275
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Well then you can do whatever you want.

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,720
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,740
So that's that.

278
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,160
Does someone have any more beer for us?

279
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,540
No.

280
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,760
We're going to have a beer.

281
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:40,900
Okay.

282
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:42,720
Thanks.

283
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,320
Bye.

284
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,560


285
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:43,680


286
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:43,980
Bye.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,020
Bye.

288
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,040
Bye.

289
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


290
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


291
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


292
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


293
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


294
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


295
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


296
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,060


297
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,040
Hey, Customers.

298
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:09,280
Are you ready to sleep in my awesome,giante shortor

299
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,760
bralette top?

300
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,500
Enjoy!

301
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,960
Did you enjoy it?

302
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,200
Nah Ha.

303
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,040
That's not the right word?

304
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,320
Now he's a happy guy

305
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,540
Now he's a happy guy

306
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,740
Now he's a happy guy

307
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,120
Well it's a random tune

308
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,360
On a game so weird

309
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,220
Unpredictable

310
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,480
Unpredictable

311
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,560
But it stops somewhere

312
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,700
Because time keeps ticking away

313
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,620
Time keeps on ticking away

314
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,580
Because time keeps ticking away

315
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,500
Time keeps on ticking away

316
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,240
Let me tell you about a man

317
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,280
A tragic case, love kicked in his face

318
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,140
He shriveled up and died from a broken heart

319
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Reincarnated as a work of art

320
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,440
He's got a brand new start

321
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,520
Hey!

322
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,340
Hey!

323
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,380
Hey!

324
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,280
Hey!

325
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,260


326
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,640
Now he's a happy guy

327
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,860
Now he's a happy guy

328
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,860
Now he's a happy guy

329
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,040
Now he's a happy guy

330
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,420
Now he's a happy guy

331
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:59,920
Now he's a happy guy

332
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,640
Don't be that guy at a party

333
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,860
That gets a girl hammered

334
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,900
Hoping for some action

335
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,380
If she has to be drunk

336
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,440
That just means you suck

337
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,200
Don't be that guy at a party

338
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,560
See someone sleeping in an empty bedroom

339
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,040
Thinks it might be fun to touch

340
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,000
Get this in your head

341
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,640
That ain't cool, man

342
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,040
That ain't cool, man

343
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,280
That ain't cool, man

344
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,600
And you know, and you know

345
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,620
Don't be that guy at the office that gotta make it clear

346
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,860
The office is always standing

347
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,240
These folks, they're just here to work

348
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,180
Don't be that guy at the office that takes a smile

349
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,520
As a cue to get all touchy

350
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,720
That just makes you some kind of jerk

351
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,400
Cause that ain't cool, man

352
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,540
No, that ain't cool, man

353
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,860
That ain't cool, man

354
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,160
And you know, and you know

355
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
That ain't cool, man

356
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,920
No, that ain't cool, man

357
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,620
Said that ain't cool, man

358
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,260
And you know, and you know

359
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,120
That self-control's a skill that's learned by five-year-olds

360
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,420
Even my dog learned to stay

361
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,220
So if you get the chance to get away with something wrong

362
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,280
Do us all a favor and do the right thing anyway

363
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,280
Don't be that guy on the subway

364
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,420
That uses the occasion to get a love on someone

365
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,660
Come on, at least act like you've evolved

366
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,520
Don't be that guy on the street

367
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,180
The guy who announces what he's doing

368
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,820
With that ass

369
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,360
That don't get you no points at all

370
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,760
Cause that ain't cool, man

371
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,040
No, that ain't cool, man

372
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,980
Said that ain't cool, man

373
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,600
And you know, and you know

374
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,540
That

375
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,800
Don't be that guy on the street

376
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,960
That just stands by and watches as the others

377
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,300
Behave in ways you know are wrong

378
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,180
Don't be that guy on the street

379
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,300
That holds his tongue for whatever reason

380
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,740
Go on, use words, your words are strong

381
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,980
That ain't cool man

382
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,460
That ain't cool, man

383
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,340
That ain't cool, man

384
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,260
That ain't cool, man

385
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,060
That ain't cool, man

386
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,640
All right.

387
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,640
Try that at home, kids.

388
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:46,600
Bye, kids.

389
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,140
Bye, kids.

390
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,340
The United Nations has killed more than 1,100 small people in the region.

391
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,720
The U.N.'s top human rights official says PR news may be a war crime.

392
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,920
This is PR News.

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Authorities in Tennessee struck yesterday, destroying at least 10 homes.

394
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,400
And people get out to see if any of that damage was caused by the National Weather Service.

395
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,540
The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency is defaulting on billions of dollars in debt.

396
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,220
With the clock face-to-face with court-appointed vultures.

397
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,820
On Wall Street, 22-16-9-2-1.

398
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,440
The Ukrainian government says this is PR News in Washington.

399
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,740
He was formed in primordial ooze.

400
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,400
When chemicals merged and something grew.

401
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,740
He split in two and then in four.

402
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,040
So now today, there's a whole lot more.

403
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,440
Viva Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

404
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,380
Tommy Amoeba, he'll make it all right.

405
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,000
Others evolved to higher forms.

406
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,000
The dodo bird and the dinosaur.

407
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
The human being.

408
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,540
And cockapoo.

409
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,780
Tommy remained to himself true.

410
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:06,600
Viva Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

411
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,140
Tommy Amoeba, he'll make it all right.

412
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,620
Viva Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

413
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,100
Tommy Amoeba.

414
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Viva Amoeba, Tommy Amoeba.

415
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:40,460
And the spiders from Mars.

416
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
Viva Amoeba.

417
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
Viva Amoeba.

418
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:50,860


419
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:50,860


420
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,380
The best TV western.

421
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,180
I want to be a aver.,

422
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Cra adapting this to Flash.

423
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,060
Bang, bang, bang.

424
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,780
Coming out in—

425
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
the best TV western.

426
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,140
that's amateur lowkey.

427
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,220
unfortunately you couldn't find a better blue but plain black.

428
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,560
Leave me a name, but I'll be the only blue.

429
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:16,580
Fuck.

430
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,200
The Best TV Western

431
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,480
All right, I'll throw you a corner and lie down on the floor where I could see you.

432
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,520
Now what does that mean?

433
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,860
Hurry up with that dynamite!

434
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,560
We shall be on a new riffle show

435
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,200
You really believe this, don't you?

436
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,260
This vast gun for hire keeps the power

437
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:08,800
Ah, yes dear friends, and with the delightful strains of

438
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,120
Armnedgy Front from live at 17X Day

439
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,620
Like a whole lot of what we just played

440
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:23,140
We'll have to let that go because coming in is lonesome cowboy Dave

441
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,020
It's the box I live in

442
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,200
How's your box, Dave?

443
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,100
My box is all tiny and smelly

444
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,520
Oh, so they're normal

445
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,260
Everything normal

446
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,680
Recording going fine, everything's okay

447
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,100
Normal?

448
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,140
Yeah

449
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah, no, actually things aren't normal right now

450
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,400
When?

451
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,920
I haven't done the credits yet

452
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,420
And we have a guest, or two actually, in the studio

453
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,580
Reverend Baby Bear is here

454
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,920
Hi

455
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,440
And Dr. Sinister came in kind of early

456
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,280
Hi

457
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,420
Hi Dave

458
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,780
Hi Dave

459
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:08,780


460
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,320
Hi Dave, lonesome cowboy Dave

461
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
This is Reverend Baby Bear, Reverend Baby Bear, this is lonesome cowboy Dave

462
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,020
Hi lonesome cowboy Dave

463
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,020
Hello

464
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,120
Hello

465
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,520
Hello

466
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,360
Once again, it's time for Talks About Box

467
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,000
What box do you live in and what?

468
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,660
The Universal Box

469
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,400
Actually, I do have to give credits though

470
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,300
Oh

471
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,800
Because I didn't time it right

472
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,320
Let's see, should I start from the beginning or go backwards?

473
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,040
I'll go backwards, okay

474
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,860
Ferdinand and Aiden Leigh-Murr did PR News and the best TV Westerns thing

475
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,000
We heard Tommy Amoeba, of course singing Viva Amoeba live at X Day

476
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,360
Such an inspiring song for single-celled organisms of all kinds

477
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,600
Evolution Control Committee did that hamburgers thing

478
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,960
Disruption devices, yeah

479
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,620
Yeah

480
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,380
That ain't cool, man, was Andrew the Impaled live at X Day

481
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,560
The song that he wrote, it's a great song

482
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,120
He was using a borrowed keyboard and it still sounds good

483
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,640
Happy Guy cover of Devo's song was by Occupant

484
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,280
Which sometimes Onan Canobite is part of that band, but I don't think he was that time

485
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,260
Reverend Angry Larry led the Short-Nuration Marriage and Divorce we heard

486
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,600
That version of Girl You Want, the Devo cover, was a great song

487
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,380
The other cover with a girl singing was a band called Frigid Touch

488
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,480
And that's from Reverend Toth Wilder's annual collection of Devo covers

489
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,560
Not necessarily beautiful, but be tight-tated

490
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:52,520
Dr. Howell did Bob Is My Story and the Mutant Mountain Boys did the opening gospel song Radiation Slack

491
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,680
So, now we can...

492
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,660
What a wonderful, wonderful way you have of saying

493
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Saying to anyone who is listening right now

494
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,960
Exactly what you don't understand

495
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You see...

496
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,940
There's a lot that I don't understand

497
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,580
That's because I'm a...

498
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,380
It's been thousands of years now for me, you know, understanding radio

499
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,620
Professional

500
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,760
When you understand that you do not understand, that is the beginning of understanding

501
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,720
Oh, okay

502
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,300
Well, let's hope it will...

503
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,480
You got that from Bob, didn't you, Dr. Sinister?

504
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,640
Is there anything that does not come from Bob?

505
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,440
Yeah, all kinds of...

506
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,340
Yeah, good luck

507
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,720
Paychecks

508
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,380
He just sucks it up

509
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,620
Yeah, he sucks it up

510
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,740
Refunds

511
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,320
None of those things come from Bob

512
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,920
He's a luck sponge

513
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,680
They go to Bob

514
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,740
No, they come from...

515
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,040
Yeah

516
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,360
Yeah, yeah

517
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,220
The Foul-Smelling Feet Foundation

518
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,920
Where they keep everything hidden

519
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,200
The Foul-Smelling Feet Foundation

520
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm familiar with that

521
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,600
Yeah, I should start one of those

522
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,140
If it hadn't already been done

523
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,520
One of those really secret, secret, secret, secret bank accounts

524
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,960
Where you keep your...

525
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,220
Um...

526
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,180
Pauly Roll

527
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,080
Hey, Baby Bear

528
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,500
What?

529
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,920
I've been meaning to ask you this question

530
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,800
I just remembered it

531
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,060
Okay

532
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
How did you get the name Baby Bear?

533
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,340
Oh, um...

534
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,740
Well, I was in a band

535
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,440
And my drummer was a very tall, very big, burly guy

536
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,420
And somewhere along the line, he was like...

537
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,460
He started calling me Baby Bear

538
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,720
And I started calling him Papa Bear

539
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,840
And it just sort of stuck

540
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,520
And we just called each other Peebee and Beebee

541
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,640
So...

542
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,220
That's disappointingly understandable

543
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,420
I'm sorry

544
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:41,660
I'm sorry

545
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,900
Disappointingly understandable

546
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,100
I picked it because it was a name I already respond to

547
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,280
So I figured it was a good church name

548
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,300
Yeah

549
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,940
I'm sure if you're not...

550
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,320
But couldn't you make it more salacious and, you know, relative to aliens landing and people

551
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,740
having dirt nostrils and all that kind of crap?

552
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,480
Yeah, no, it's way boring

553
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,400
Way more boring than that

554
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,420
She's not really a bear, in other words

555
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,880
In other words

556
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,720
But you know how fools talk like a bear, eh?

557
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,320
I just learned tonight that during that short-duration marriage that we just broadcast a recording of

558
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,020
Baby Bear was there and she married her shirt

559
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,980
I did, I married my shirt

560
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,360
Oh my God

561
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,100
A shirt that I wore for literally three months solid

562
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Three months, every day I wore that shirt

563
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,800
And that I married it at X-Day and now I haven't worn it since

564
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,200
You know that I've never been able to think of you the same way since you told me that you wore a shirt for three months

565
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,300
I've done that before

566
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,040
I do that still but I only wear it for half an hour every day when I go out to the post office

567
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,020
But it was a really, really good shirt though

568
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,940
But don't have good midi-fellows like myself crazy just to be around the area, you know?

569
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,800
You know?

570
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,640
No, Baby Bear says that she's a girl and she doesn't smell

571
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,200
Yeah

572
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,940
As if those two went hand in hand

573
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,220
Yeah

574
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,200
Which they do not

575
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,460
No, I didn't say that I didn't smell, I said that I smell good

576
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,660
Right, yeah

577
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,420
Because I'm a girl

578
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,360
Like a cartoon pirate or something like that

579
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:16,020
But not, being female is not a guarantee for good smelling, in fact

580
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,880
Only if it's a man smelling that aroma and he's been told that it's from a woman

581
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,840
I don't know, look man, have you ever had an Asiago cheese pizza?

582
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,680
Enough said

583
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,820
Are you talking about my grandmother?

584
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,600
Princess Wee knows what I'm not saying

585
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,200
It's a Jedi mind trick, you tell them first that it smells good and they believe it

586
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,340
This is not the stench you were looking for

587
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,180
Plus it was a really good shirt, did you see it?

588
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,100
No, well yes I did but I don't remember seeing it

589
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,880
It's fabric oriented, Robert Stang has a problem with things that are fabric oriented

590
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,000
Did you notice how professional she is when she has to cough she turns her head away from the microphone?

591
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,200
Yes

592
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,440
I wish Viola Drummond would learn something like that

593
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,520
They even have cough buttons there

594
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,700
They do?

595
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,020
Yeah

596
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,800
So they can cough without turning their head?

597
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,740
Yeah, or I think you might, I never tried it so maybe if you press the button it forces you to cough, I'm not sure

598
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,060
The button just said cough

599
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,800
Yeah, your navel, anytime you rub your navel too hard your eyes are gonna explode

600
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,760
It's weird, never mind it doesn't often happen but

601
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:34,880
Listeners, the WCSB pledge drive radiothon is coming up and we need a cough button in this, in fact we need at least four of them

602
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,980
That's right because Ebola is coming

603
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,320
That's what I keep being told by people who watch television

604
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,360
Yes

605
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:49,880
The people who watch TV have been telling me I should be really scared of Ebola

606
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,460
Well you are duly scared and duly depressed

607
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,400
It's a good month to be scared

608
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,740
Yeah it is a perfect month to be scared

609
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,540
It's a good month to be scared? Oh yeah because of the pumpkin falling on everything

610
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,560
Right, a pumpkin could land on you anytime, it's raining pumpkins out there

611
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:26,260
Well you see them in the rural areas, you often do see them splattered on the road and it makes you wonder if a kindly old guy would like you know like you're used to spinning a beard and you're like bunch of nasty, I mean he's driving his Jeep full of pumpkins to the market in the little village there in central Ohio somewhere, I don't know

612
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,780
And all the pumpkins just fall off the back of it? Does that explain all the pumpkins in the street?

613
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:40,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and then some demonic characters or beings of some type came by and did the actual squishing or they you know wrote about it and stuff

614
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,260
Hey they're just teenagers man, you don't have to be that afraid of them

615
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,320
I am that, I'm beyond that afraid of them

616
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,720
Actually no wait I'm sorry I did, I got that wrong, you should be like terrified of teenagers

617
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,220
Unless you have a weapon

618
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,560
I am, I am, I am

619
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,220
Oh especially if you're one of them

620
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:05,120
Well there was a pumpkin riot this last weekend right? In New Hampshire or someplace or no it was near Boston

621
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,020
A pumpkin festival riot just the other day, I think perhaps it was yesterday or today

622
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,240
It's like the Tomatina of New England

623
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,860
I kept seeing headlines for it but I didn't actually read the articles so I have no idea

624
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:25,020
Well they, all the articles I skimmed were trying to draw comparisons with the Ferguson problems

625
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,440
Wow

626
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,620
You see

627
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,260
Wait Dave did you say that New Hampshire is the big tomatillo?

628
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,720
Somehow they were making it racial

629
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:39,200
In other words somebody shot or a pumpkin shot somebody or somebody shot a pumpkin and didn't get duly, never mind

630
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,700
No like if you have a gigantic pumpkin fight in a certain place in New England every year if this is what you're talking about

631
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,480
Yeah

632
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,600
That would be like the Tomatina

633
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,840
Yeah, profiling you know

634
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,360
In Spain where they had a big tomato fight every year

635
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,080
You mean like the jack-o-lantern there profiling?

636
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,220
Right they were profiling certain types of jack-o-lanterns

637
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

638
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,620
We had a new, we had a fresh new idea for our jack-o-lantern this year do you remember it Princess Wade?

639
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,380
Yes you decided to put the psychedelic atomizer of water in there

640
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:14,940
It's like a fog machine that will be inside our pumpkin so that he will be drooling out of his mouth and he's going to look like he's really hot

641
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:24,440
I think it's all the precious bodily fluids and your purity of essence at stake here right now that you have stored up for the last six or seven months

642
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,520
I'm not going to put

643
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm going to deposit in the little tiny baby jack-o-lantern

644
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:36,040
No, we hand that stuff out with the candy of course that's where the Ebola comes from that's so funny Ebola jokes

645
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,120
Let's politicize it

646
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,100
Hey now that we've made jokes about it let's politicize it

647
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,260
Obama wants everybody to catch Ebola because of slavery

648
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,560
In Texas it's easier to get Ebola than an abortion

649
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,460
That's a guy who had not heard that one

650
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,360
I made up

651
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,580
That's a good one that's a very good one

652
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:02,780
Yeah but now it's here now we can't just not funny now it's like right around the corner from us

653
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:02,940
It's not here

654
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,840
There's nothing funny it's massive pain and suffering and death

655
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,440
It's over 23 miles away to be exact from where you are right now

656
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,520
It's over in Akron big deal wait a minute we were in Akron two days ago

657
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,820
Darkest Akron

658
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,660
We should take my temperature Princess Wade

659
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,740
I've had to stop all of my favorite activities because of this whole Ebola thing

660
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,340
I can't like play around with it

661
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,560
I can't like play around in blood or like you know splash vomit on my face

662
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,320
You can't ask people to lick you or spit on you anymore

663
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,680
Yeah so what is he supposed to do for fun these days

664
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,120
It's not even fair

665
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:52,440
But that woman haven't you already heard of the profusion of costume factories that are turning out tons of Ebola victims or costumes with black blood and bubonic plague looking symptoms and you know jelly eyeballs

666
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:53,940
Unguil

667
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,440
Glass

668
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,820
And stuff like that

669
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:01,800
Yeah and like the CDC like the outfits like the hazmat things and all that

670
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,760
Yeah yeah hazmat suits yeah

671
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,760
I don't need these costumes I've been bleeding from random orifices since you know before it was cool

672
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,540
Are you talking about the single boy in the sky that controls all our thoughts

673
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,920
You've got to be such a hipster about it

674
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:22,960
I saw an onion headline today that said guy in hazmat suit doesn't want to see all that perfectly good food go to waste

675
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,700
Oh

676
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,680
He was carrying a bunch of food out of an isolation house you know quarantine

677
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,880
That's what a talent's comment to make

678
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,180
If you cook it at just the right temperature

679
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,160
When the world is falling asunder

680
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,140
Yum yum yum yum yum

681
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:43,580
I really wish that the conspiracy theories would get more creative about this whole Ebola thing though instead of just saying that the government's doing it that's boring

682
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,440
They're kind of running out of ideas the whole conspiracy theory movement

683
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,220
Everything is just oh oh Bobo did it

684
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,020
Yeah

685
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,920
That's not even fun

686
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
What's like you're supposed to say that

687
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,520
You know you sit there and like think up something more creative it's supposed to be creative

688
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,100
Well hey I know

689
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,080
Bush did it right

690
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Oh no oh boy

691
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,480
The thing we have to understand is that Obama did do it

692
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,780
He sat up late many many nights he had a big like one of those maps on the wall and stuff like that

693
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:17,740
And there were a few choice advisors but mostly he went around smacking the map you know like with one of those funny pointing stick things

694
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,340
And making absurd comments

695
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,900
When he's in that room does he have one of those mirror mirror glasses?

696
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,060
Yeah

697
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,100
And he has one of those goatees that he just strokes while he does evil things

698
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,400
Yeah yeah yeah

699
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,660
Yeah when he assumes his demonic appearance and the goatee pops out and stuff and he has hooves instead of horns

700
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:51,400
I can tell you guys that goatee as a goatee wearing hypnotist I can tell you that the reason for the goatee stroking is not evil it's just a nervous reflex

701
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,600
Yeah you would say that

702
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:53,880
What?

703
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,480
Yeah it's an innocent thing

704
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,900
As a guy with a goatee

705
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,280
Sure it is

706
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,300
That's the same reason I have to like restart my beard every couple of months you know

707
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,360
But Mesmer used to rape women

708
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,500
Did you know that the bullies and scandals in the old days of Mesmer was accused of rape

709
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,420
The great hypnotist Franz Mesmer?

710
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,700
Yeah

711
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,200
Oh no boy he was my hero

712
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,620
Yeah

713
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,880
How do you I've studied his technique for years

714
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,380
That's how I got all of you to join the church of the subgenius

715
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,360
No your techniques go back to the late 50s with these weird mind control experiments

716
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,560
Oh I use that little hypno disc

717
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,840
Yeah but that's

718
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,640
You know you get that from comic book ads for 50 cents stare into the disc

719
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,700
Do you have one on like one of the little doctor headbands like the little hypno disc you can see

720
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,860
No no I don't do that I just hold it in front of the person's eye and go gaze into the natural world

721
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,520
Oh I see

722
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,620
You're now in Sing Sing I am now in Sing Sing

723
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,420
And then I squirm like what's his face in Clockwork Orange and stuff and go

724
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,040
Try and close my eyes and stuff

725
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:14,260
Princess we and I oh and Baby Bear saw it too we saw a magician last night

726
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,200
Oh

727
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,820
And all magicians are hypnotists that's how they hypnotize the whole audience and think that these things are

728
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,840
And certified massage therapists are hypnotists too

729
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,420
As well

730
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,280
No no it's not certified

731
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,440
Actually at the party we were at last night there was a massage therapist in full living dead drag

732
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:41,840
Her face it was a probably nice looking young lady but she was wearing living dead makeup and was kind of stomach turning to look at

733
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,040
That was really disturbing

734
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,240
It was a good job it was a good makeup

735
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:53,820
Yeah walking by her doing body work on all these humongous people with big hurting bodies

736
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,000
And she's tiny and she's like putting all her weight into these masseuse moves and

737
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,500
That wasn't makeup

738
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,600
That was very disturbing

739
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,100
It wasn't as scary as the little double mean baby heads

740
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,280
Yeah exactly

741
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,640
It was scary it scared me

742
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,140
Dave you would have loved this party we were at last night there was a guy a sculptor selling double mean baby heads

743
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,640
On all kinds of terrible things like slugs

744
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:23,820
Yeah exactly

745
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,700
And cat owners

746
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,460
Yeah we bought one with a snail

747
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,660
I had to bring money home

748
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:26,940
I'm hungry

749
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,900
Yeah there were double mean baby headed dogs and double mean baby headed snakes and

750
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,840
Pigs squirrels

751
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:34,880
Yeah goldfish

752
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,220
Double mean baby heads coming out of eggs like crawling their way out of the well

753
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:39,520
Yeah

754
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,080
Oh no

755
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,120
Thecementhead.com

756
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,600
Yes

757
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
I looked at that today

758
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,340
Thecementhead.com

759
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,100
And it showed you can see the baby heads at thecementhead.com

760
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,260
There see we just did an ad

761
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,820
But there's our public service our PSA

762
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,280
PSA's are done

763
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,120
Baby head

764
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,700
Is that a PSA

765
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,120
Yeah that was a PSA public service for the guy who does the cement baby heads

766
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,860
You now know

767
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,600
Yes

768
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,140
I can't breathe no I'm sorry

769
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,500
Yeah I was just thinking like the one woman with the costume was just you know turkey

770
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:20,760
She should have had a turkey leg with some ketchup on the end of it and art a little bit of like ripped clothing and that's how Romero did it

771
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,800
There was a guy who had a giant bulldog

772
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:32,380
He had a butcher's cleaver that like constantly like squirted blood out of it and he was carrying a large leg of something

773
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,960
There's a big bone with meat on it and it looked like the quest item meat that you get in like World of Warcraft or something

774
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,860
And he had green hair that was sticking out like two feet from his head on either side

775
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,600
Yeah and he didn't win the prize

776
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,640
That was really an impressive costume

777
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,640
I would have judged him one of the best

778
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,840
Oh who won who won?

779
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,680
The dragon

780
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,960
Oh really?

781
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,660
The dragon

782
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,700
The furry one

783
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,320
The huge big furry dragon

784
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,220
The furry one of course it did

785
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,180
The furry dragon

786
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,780
Yes he was naturally

787
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,560
He appealed to all the different segments of the subculture then with that

788
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:14,460
And the best couple winner was two girls like a dark vampire and an angel type girl or something like that

789
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,120
Devil and an angel girl

790
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,980
No one even got my costume

791
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,160
No I sure didn't

792
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,820
You were dressed as a really good looking girl

793
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,340
You were dressed as a really obscure video game character

794
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,320
At a gaming convention

795
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,800
At a gaming convention

796
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,480
I didn't see a single person playing video games

797
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:29,580
Do you ever play Hotline Miami?

798
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,220
No

799
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,240
God damn it

800
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,200
What was it?

801
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,320
Hotline Miami

802
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,320
It was a little pig face

803
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,480
I was Jacket from Hotline Miami

804
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,720
He wears a bunch of different animal masks but the one from all the official art he's always wearing the pig mask so I went with the pig mask

805
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,700
And I even like modified my own jacket and everything and I sewed things on it

806
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,900
I didn't even put on a costume and didn't wear it

807
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,040
I had my monster hunting suit but I just blew it off

808
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:11,360
I was too busy looking for I was hoping to see monster high cosplay or the she hulk

809
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,500
I really had my heart set on that and I was let down in both cases

810
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,000
But you still found women to adore dear

811
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,480
There were lots and lots of wonder women

812
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,100
Yes

813
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,780
Yeah there were a lot of wonder women

814
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,860
Wonder women

815
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,680
How many?

816
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,480
Wonder women

817
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,560
How many might I ask?

818
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,620
Did you see like 10, 20, 30

819
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,520
More like 5

820
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,000
5

821
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,920
And they weren't all really women

822
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,040
Of course

823
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:44,960
That shows a limited level of concentration especially at this blessed time of the year when people in August start thinking of what they're going to wear at the fancon convention

824
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,620
I know where I'm going to see the she hulk and the monster high cosplay

825
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:49,980
I know where I'm going to see the she hulk and the monster high cosplay

826
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,540
The WCSB Halloween Muscarade Ball

827
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,700
At Cleveland Public Theater November 1st

828
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:04,520
The witches ball only had maybe about 50 people

829
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,860
No it was more than that

830
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:15,040
Well I mean in the actual costume and costumes whereas the WCSB ball would be more like a thousand people

831
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,720
Yeah

832
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,620
In outrageous costumes

833
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,980
But it's the same night as the organiser's party

834
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,700
The organiser's party

835
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,780
That's right

836
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,180
There's a such a wedding that same night

837
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,820
Reverend Organ Beard

838
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,920
And Reverend Cat Feather

839
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,960
Yeah Organ Beard

840
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,620
I don't like that name

841
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,880
They's getting hitched

842
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,880
And the worst thing is I know I've actually seen the bearded organ

843
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,760
On that one website

844
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,880
Or that one Facebook page

845
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,640
You don't have to be on Facebook to see it

846
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,340
That was like the first thing that I saw at my second X day

847
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,280
I got out of the car and Organ Beard was just like right next to my car just fully naked

848
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,940
Well at least he's a nice looking young man

849
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:02,240
It could have been I don't know Lonesome Cowboy Dave standing there that way

850
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,260
You know yeah right he could have been some kind of sociopathic extrovert

851
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:11,640
You know intent on being as bizarre as he could and basically

852
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,660
That sounds like a challenge also

853
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,320
Yeah look who's talking

854
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,780
If Lonesome Cowboy Dave would come to X day

855
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,640
Yeah

856
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,220
He could freak people out by standing naked next to their cars as soon as they arrive

857
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,580
Yeah

858
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,060
Dave come on come on Dave do it

859
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,600
No no no I don't want to do this you know

860
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,480
Oh yeah come on

861
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,900
Oh I know it's funny but I don't like to stop cars while I'm bare naked

862
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,100
Because I do look funny a little bit you know

863
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:43,380
I don't want to scare any small children or make anybody run away or you know

864
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,860
Or spend the night in jail

865
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,860
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

866
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,200
Because you know public nudity is fine but see he is going to the bathroom on someone else's shoes

867
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,160
When he is saying that

868
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,060
You can't go on somebody else's shoes if everybody's naked

869
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,500
That's not nice

870
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,260
Yeah that's not nice

871
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,360
It's impolite behavior

872
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,600
You try to go on your own

873
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,400
That's in the rules of etiquette under do not do

874
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,220
Yes

875
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:18,100
No let's do it let's go dancing around naked in the village square and urinate on everyone's shoes

876
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,940
Who's not naked

877
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,100
We're subgeniuses we can do anything

878
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:27,780
The only rules are just be your inner monkey but don't throw poo

879
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,440
Oh yeah right

880
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,520
Words to live by

881
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,900
It's a whole reason to be a monkey

882
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,280
Oh yeah right we should all aspire to be monkeys

883
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,960
I'm sorry maybe we should yeah you're right

884
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,220
Yeah sure we'll do that

885
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,380
I'm sorry

886
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,520
Oi

887
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:47,540

I'm sorry

891
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:51,860
I'm sorry

892
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,040
But who's the feistiest cartoon parrot of all

893
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,880
Cartoon parrot

894
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,160
No the pirate

895
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,080
Oh pirate

896
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:07,580
I get pirates and parrots confused because I think of birds with pirates on them and white birds

897
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:12,200
Right yeah big red or multicolored bird with a little pirate on its shoulder

898
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,280
Wait what's the

899
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,360
Yeah and if you were from Pittsburgh you would say pirate

900
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:15,360


901
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:21,620
And parrot at the same time you would say hey let's go watch the parrots you know

902
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,740
Yeah

903
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,240
Yeah

904
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,500
Yeah

905
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:24,680
Yeah

906
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:24,920
Yeah

907
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,960
Yeah

908
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:25,960


909
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,140
Yeah

910
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,740
Yeah

911
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:28,780
Yeah

912
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


913
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


914
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


915
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


916
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


917
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


918
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


919
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


920
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


921
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


922
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


923
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:28,780


924
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:58,780


925
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:58,840
Yeah yeah yeah

926
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:58,840


927
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:58,840


928
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:58,840


929
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:58,840


930
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:58,840


931
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,540
I think it was I didn't know it was really going to happen

932
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:09,540
I have friends who actually were extras in that movie which is how I heard about the turkey leg with the article of clothing and ketchup on it

933
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,740
Oh okay

934
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,640
Wait in the original in

935
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,920
I don't know if it was number one it might have been Might have been return of the dawn of the return of the return of the dawn

936
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,580
You know every bit actor that was in that movie

937
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,940
It was still filmed in western Pennsylvania over there

938
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,760
There's there's a Pittsburgh commercial that was in that movie

939
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:28,760


940
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:28,760


941
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:28,760


942
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:28,760


943
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:28,760


944
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:28,760


945
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,400
convention called Monster Bash

946
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,560
and every year

947
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,020
certain has-beens

948
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,580
and nobodies are like

949
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,100
on the celebrity panel of that.

950
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,720
If you were in Night of the Living Dead, no matter

951
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,660
how quickly you

952
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,620
were seen, you know, how short you were

953
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,660
on screen, man, you can be

954
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,440
a guest at that convention. You have your 15

955
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,360
minutes of fame every year. In fact, somebody

956
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,600
my age could easily just say, oh yeah, I'm that

957
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,760
guy in that one scene.

958
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,640
You get your 15 minutes of fame after

959
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,200
you watch the movie a hundred times.

960
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,040
Oh yeah, I spoke at the seminar.

961
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,060
I had up to 15 minutes.

962
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,300
Or just

963
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,820
pick someone with their face half ripped off and

964
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,820
say that you're them. Yeah. My favorite

965
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,120
was always Day of the Dead,

966
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,640
which isn't as popular.

967
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,420
It isn't really a popular choice.

968
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,020
No, it's not.

969
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,820
Dawn of the Dead is probably

970
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,920
most people's favorite. And I have a

971
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,680
great respect for the extras in

972
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,720
Day of the Dead because at the end scene

973
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,380
where everything starts going

974
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,620
bad as it always

975
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,640
does, all of those

976
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,360
guts, the sheep guts

977
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,640
that the extras had to interact with,

978
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,580
the freezer broke

979
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,560
and they were like rotted

980
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,580
and smelled terrible. And all

981
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,540
those poor people getting paid like

982
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,620
50 bucks had to sit there and shove

983
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,500
it in their face and like pretend to be

984
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,180
eating it.

985
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,320
And like that scene at the end where they finally

986
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,340
get the bad guy

987
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,600
and like they tear him all apart and like rip

988
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,440
open his guts and it's like just

989
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,140
rotting sheep's guts.

990
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,360
That movie has a trainable zombie named

991
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,300
Bob. Or no, Bub. That's right.

992
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,540
It's Bub. It's Bob's

993
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,940
little brother.

994
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,780
His special little brother, Bub.

995
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,340
And yet Bub was the most intelligent of the

996
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,440
living dead. He was somewhat trainable.

997
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,680
Yeah. He was a little bit introverted.

998
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,380
He had a really

999
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,220
weird protrusion in the middle of his

1000
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,880
forehead that he looked like a little

1001
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,620
teeny tiny baby eye.

1002
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,120
But it wasn't his third nostril. It actually

1003
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,180
was just some kind of

1004
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,880
sack for

1005
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,180
taking transitions from different

1006
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,300
directions. Hey, I have a quick movie review

1007
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,960
I have to give.

1008
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,180
And I have to do it real quick because we've only got like

1009
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,420
three minutes left of the show.

1010
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,220
The other night, Princess Wee and I

1011
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,240
were so paranoid about Ebola because

1012
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,680
you know, it's in Dallas and

1013
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,300
Ohio, so we're going to catch it

1014
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,940
and die. It's following you saying.

1015
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,360
Yeah. Well, anyway, we thought, well, let's

1016
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,700
cheer ourselves up and watch

1017
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,960
World War Z.

1018
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,240
That's the big Hollywood zombie

1019
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,860
movie. Princess Wee didn't.

1020
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,760
She made me change to

1021
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,440
a comedy. I had a comedy

1022
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,600
movie that I didn't know much about. I

1023
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,340
downloaded this movie called Go

1024
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,220
Go Gone,

1025
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,580
made in India, and I

1026
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,340
read that it was a kind of a stoner

1027
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,400
comedy, sort of like Harold and Kumar,

1028
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,500
these, you know, lovable nitwits

1029
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,000
that have adventures like

1030
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,840
Costello and Three Stooges.

1031
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,420
Only they're high. Well,

1032
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,800
the plot

1033
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,140
suddenly turned into a zombie movie.

1034
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,360
We're trying to avoid zombie movies and

1035
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,520
by golly, it turned into a zombie movie

1036
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,320
only it was really funny.

1037
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,600
It was really gory and horrible like

1038
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,600
they're supposed to be, but it's a very, very funny

1039
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,960
movie. Go Go Gone.

1040
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,380
It's it's

1041
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,280
subtitled in English, even though they're

1042
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,560
speaking quasi English the whole time.

1043
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,220
That language, these

1044
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,460
Indian hipsters speak is itself

1045
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,460
an important and

1046
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,500
interesting part of the movie. And that

1047
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,160
has been my

1048
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,420
movie review. Go Go Gone.

1049
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,500
Go Go Gone.

1050
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,540
You can't avoid zombies.

1051
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,580
You can't avoid zombies anymore. It's impossible.

1052
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,620
You can't get away from it. When I was

1053
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,440
like 16 on Easter, we

1054
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,380
watched we watched a couple zombie movies

1055
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,600
in a row and we're like, ha ha ha. This is so funny.

1056
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,920
It's Easter zombie Jesus.

1057
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,400
We're hilarious. Technically, Jesus

1058
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,900
would be a lich, not a zombie.

1059
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,500
Well, we thought we were so clever

1060
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,540
and funny and blah, blah, whatever. And

1061
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,420
then like five

1062
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,280
years later, everything is

1063
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,420
all zombie. And then five years after that,

1064
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,340
it's still all zombie and we can't.

1065
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,360
I'm like sick of it. As soon as my mom started

1066
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,700
telling me what she was going to do at the zombie apocalypse,

1067
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,460
I'm going to go to Lowe's. I'm like,

1068
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,440
now it's not cool. I don't care anymore. We're done.

1069
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,340
We're done with that bed. It's over now.

1070
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,380
You killed it.

1071
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,440
Actually, one of my favorite

1072
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,680
pop songs from the 80s

1073
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,120
is called Mi Novio Es Un Zombie,

1074
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,020
which is

1075
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,220
a Spanish artist named

1076
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,820
Alaska about

1077
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,660
her having a zombie boyfriend.

1078
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:56,880
Wasn't there

1079
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,900
a whole

1080
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,600
song?

1081
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,880
A huge great genre of

1082
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,180
Mexican zombie movies?

1083
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,440
Well, there's

1084
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:04,780
a...

1085
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,280
Every country has

1086
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,140
too many zombie movies.

1087
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,960
The ones in Mexico

1088
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,220
sometimes had wrestlers also.

1089
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,480
They are really cheap to make.

1090
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,440
But really, friends, it's the end of the show.

1091
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,220
This is the Subgenius Hour of Slack, number

1092
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,120
1,488

1093
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,540
from the Church of the Subgenius

1094
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,360
at subgenius.com

1095
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,580
if you need to know anything else and you don't.

1096
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,880
Wait, no, I have so many things to say.

1097
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,360
No!

1098
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,960
Well, you're welcome, Mr. Grant, for synesthesia.

1099
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm positive.

1100
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,780
Palestinians say at least

1101
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,560
10 today, and Israel says

1102
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,140
5, including 4.

1103
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,580
Kerry is still trying to agree to a

1104
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,980
humanitarian ceasefire.

1105
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,000
We also believe, he says,

1106
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,240
that Spinal says,

1107
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,440
that lead to

1108
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,480
this process.

1109
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,100
It seemed to be PR News Washington.

1110
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,860
PR News Washington.

1111
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,560
The government says governments are improving,

1112
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,260
but treasuries are in more immediate danger.

1113
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,140
As was true last year,

1114
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,840
for only 80% of two years.

1115
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,100
On Wall Street, 21-16-9-2-4.

1116
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,420
The typical activity barometer

1117
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,300
measures chemical American machines

1118
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,300
to make electronic foundations.

1119
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,360
It's literally everything.

1120
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,740
President Obama is speaking out

1121
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,380
against young African fellows

1122
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,480
in Washington today.

1123
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,820
The president urged them to eliminate traditions

1124
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,480
and women.

1125
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,680
You've got great ass.

1126
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,600
I want to be your friend.

1127
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,620
The fellows applauded the president

1128
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,620
when he announced that their Young Africans

1129
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,260
program is being renamed

1130
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,680
after the Ebola virus.

1131
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,020
The fellows contracted the fatal illness

1132
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,460
at a hospital and sickened hundreds more.

1133
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,800
Top lawmakers from both

1134
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,780
parties say this is PR News.
