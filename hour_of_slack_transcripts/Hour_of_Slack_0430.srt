00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Mr. Mr. Pham Lam, now 90 percent of security is settled.

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,700

our world oh how exciting

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,140
ok standing by I got my arms open here

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,340
Ladies and gentlemen, eyes and ears.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,180
In these days of changing times, people are looking for an answer.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,280
One that will make them happy and their lives productive.

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,200
For creative artists, an expanding technology offers many such answers,

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,320
but often leads to far more questions along the way.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,640
However, there are exceptions.

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,280
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAT.

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,480
SWAT.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,380
Pull off where you won't get hit and park on the side of the road there

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,120
and lay your hands on the radio.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,560
Lay your hands on the radio there in the home.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,180
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

19
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,720
Money, money, money.

21
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,420
All right, Mr. Scientist, would you tell us a little bit about the explosion of a hydrogen bomb?

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,740
First of all, there's a tremendous mushrooming effect.

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,180
1900 years ago, Peter said, the heavens pass away with a blast, the noise thereof.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,900
Secondly, as it comes in a downward direction, it disintegrates, dissolves, melts everything, even steel.

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,720
A 500-foot steel tower in New Mexico melted to the ground so that they found nothing.

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
Now I want you to get this.

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,460
Peter said, the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

28
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,880
If you go to the library tomorrow and say to the librarian, I want to study the hydrogen bomb,

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,560
she'd say, sir, follow me.

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,620
Letter E, word elements.

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,880
Did you know that in your libraries around America, the atom bomb is created?

32
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,500
Classified under elements.

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,280
What'd you say, Peter?

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,340
The elements shall melt.

35
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,080
Brother, God gave Peter the exact word 1900 years ago.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
This is God's word, friend.

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
Don't let anyone fool you.

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,880
The future of your usefulness.

00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Slack.

46
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,120
Say your prayers.

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,160
You sick bastard.

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,040
Sometimes I just wish I could be this little normal.

49
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,840
Say your prayers.

50
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,500
You sick bastard.

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,500
Sometimes I wish I could be this little normal.

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,660
Oh, was that a pentagram on the floor?

53
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,120
Oh, did I have a human sacrifice?

54
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,000
Did I have a virgin tied to an altar here?

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,860
Did I drain a cow's blood from its carcass?

56
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,140
Did I leave its meat for the vultures?

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,560
Oh, did I sew those robes?

58
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,740
Did I spend the past three weeks organizing this thing?

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Was that me?

60
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,260
I don't know what come over me, you know?

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,780
Sometimes I just wish that I could be normal like my friend right here.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,780
You know, I've got a drinking problem that sometimes causes me to do these things.

63
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,980
I don't really know what it is that come over me.

64
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,240
Sometimes you can't adjust your mind.

65
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,320
That's because you can lose it talking about things that have no value.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,980
You know, I'm a normal person.

67
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,940
I'm a product of overcrowded public schools.

68
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,480
You have to understand, I'm a victim.

69
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,640
I mean, even while I'm stabbing you or cutting your throat, you have to understand, I'm the victim.

70
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,980
Let me pray for a minute.

71
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,800
Say your prayers and say something.

72
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:37,920
You sick bastard.

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,760
You sick bastard.

74
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,320
Oh, yeah.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,880
It's...

76
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,980
It's sick.

77
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,480
It's sick.

78
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,660
It is sick.

79
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,360
It's sad.

80
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,780
It's terrible what we do.

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,200
I know it is.

82
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,200
But I won't apologize.

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,480
Not for a second.

84
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,380
No.

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,920
No, sir, ma'am.

86
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,980
Because we got some preaching to do.

87
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,420
Just a little bit of preaching tonight.

88
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
We got lots of puzzling evidence.

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,100
Lots of show tapes of all kinds to hurt you with.

90
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,320
But you know, this is a religious radio broadcast, dear friend.

91
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:26,180
And we do want to talk to you about God as well as Bob.

92
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,980
Because, you know, if it's magic and mystery and grandeur that you want,

93
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,560
all you got to do is take a real close look at, oh, say, a handful of dirt.

94
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,480
And you'll probably find more there than your pathetic human mind.

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,800
Mind can comprehend.

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:58,960
If you can truly see its essence for a lump of mud when perceived in Dob's consciousness,

97
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,980
seethes with infinite potentiality.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,700
And with a lump like that, my friend, who needs God?

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,960
Just...

100
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,060
Just...

101
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,620
You can...

102
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,040
You can just forget about those invisible...

103
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,660
Beings and try to...

104
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,740
If you could just fully appreciate what's right up your nose.

105
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
Ah, yes.

106
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,640
Because...

107
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,700
Where?

108
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,620
We asked this question.

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,880
Where is God when little children suffer?

110
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,900
Where is God while Africa starves?

111
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Where is God when serial killers skin teenage innocent children?

112
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,640
Where is God when the

113
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,920
people who are killed by the Nazis are killed by the Nazis?

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:54,920


115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,060
Where was God when Hitler died rich and happy in hiding, laughing at us all?

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,100
Why did God let me cut myself shaving?

117
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,260
Is there anything even remotely fair about life?

118
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,120
I mean, we all die for cripes' sakes and in no time at all.

119
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,400
But one could shoot up in that vein literally forever.

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,720
And it's unfair to dwell only on the negative.

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,440
Let's look at the light side of God.

122
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,200
You know, since he works in mysterious ways,

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,360
you can blame anything on him and therefore consider it somehow good.

124
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,380
It was good that your child died of some...

125
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,480
horrible blood disease.

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,040
It was just good in a way that God doesn't want you to understand.

127
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,300
We sympathize.

128
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,860
It's human nature.

129
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,780
All people need a meaning in their lives and a little entertainment and religion

130
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,660
is the cheapest way to get it.

131
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,120
It provides an excuse to think that there might be justice and order in the universe.

132
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,300
Who wants to...

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,180
stare into the face of chaos.

134
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:34,400
But really, my friends, what is the difference between religion and narcotics or booze?

135
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,420
Either way, you're getting sedation from some outside source.

136
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:51,900
Both make you spaced out and put a weird gleam in your eye and a stupid smirk or nervous twitch on your face.

137
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,580
Help me, somebody.

138
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,020
Both make you want more.

139
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,080
Help me, somebody.

140
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:08,900
Both soothe the guilt circuit that Jehovah One programmed in because, after all, you're forgiven.

141
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,260
Those lucky faithful, they can't possibly be fooled.

142
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,180
And we subgeniuses now, oh, I'm afraid we can be easily fooled.

143
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:30,100
Unlike them, we have to constantly question our own beliefs to make sure we aren't either being tricked or tricking ourselves.

144
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,940
And sure enough, we catch ourselves starting to fall for smooth-sounding lies all the time.

145
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:58,020
But you know, as bad as we are and as hard as we try, we subgeniuses haven't been able to pull off a slight fraction of the crimes that have been committed in the names of gods not named Bob.

146
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,680
And now, we never said that Dobbs is the ace up God's sleeve.

147
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,300
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief.

148
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,400
Ah, but the false cults, friends, they don't think God's a smear.

149
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,440
God has a handkerchief.

150
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,820
Oh, no.

151
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,360
Oh, no.

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,540
No, because God is perfect.

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,660
God doesn't sneeze.

154
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,780
He has no snot.

155
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,300
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us.

156
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,860
And we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.

157
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,460
God, though, he's clean and pure.

158
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,260
And he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

159
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,880
Because we sinned.

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,040
Yes, we sinned.

161
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,740
We're bad.

162
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,860
We're sarcastic.

163
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,840
We're a threat to God.

164
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,700
Unless we sign a contract with his agent saying we won't be bad anymore.

165
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,840
Ah, yes, friends.

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,880
It's a mess.

167
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,380
You know, they censored the parts of the Bible where Jesus said you didn't need preachers or Jesus to talk to God and so forth.

168
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,380
His real main point, in fact, was that everybody was what, quote, capital H, unquote, E.

169
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,820
E.

170
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,660
Was.

171
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,400
Bob Dobbs, on the other hand, is not nearly so broad-minded in that respect.

172
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,540
Oh, he hangs out with sinners and weirdos just like Jesus did.

173
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,400
But he never said you could be the same as him.

174
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,940
No way.

175
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,300
Uh-uh.

176
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,400
You just aren't as lucky as Bob.

177
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,280
And you're not going to be.

178
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,080
So forget it.

179
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,460
You could admire Bob.

180
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,180
Oh, yeah.

181
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,100
You could memorize his every utterance, even Connie's shopping lists.

182
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,500
You can grovel and pay lots of church dues.

183
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,580
But you can't be Bob.

184
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,000
And let's face it, you may well be a worthless no-account burden on society.

185
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:53,000
Just because you're you doesn't mean necessarily that you're good enough to be invited to Bob's parties.

186
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,220
No, you're not Bob, my friend.

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,660
But you might be Jesus come again.

188
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,180
Jesus might already be on Earth and not even know it yet because he hasn't yet met his John the Baptist.

189
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,140
Oh, he could come again as a cop or a bag lady.

190
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,380
Or a Texas billionaire with big ears.

191
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,800
Or a rock star.

192
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,480
Or a third world peasant.

193
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,420
Or a salesman.

194
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,220
He could live next door.

195
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,420
I mean, how do you know your pudgy, quiet neighbor over there isn't the Lord living in meekness among us?

196
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,860
And many of us, though ourselves crucified in the past, yet have trouble with this concept.

197
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,280
And we keep thinking of the second coming as a hippie with a gentle voice like in those racist Sunday school paintings.

198
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,260
Of a god.

199
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,360
Of a giant with a white beard and a sheet for clothes.

200
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:53,480
And it never occurs to us that the Lord could manifest on Earth as, to say, a rabid, mutated freak dog with dozens of genitals.

201
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,820
Or a broken plaster Arnold Palmer golf trophy bust crudely smeared with bed enamel paint.

202
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,620
We keep trying to anthropomorphize God.

203
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,280
Uh-huh.

204
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,260
The second coming might be right here, right now.

205
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,100
And we'd be missing it, mistaking it for some disgusting mistake of nature.

206
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,960
It might be you.

207
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,160
And none of us will ever catch on.

208
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,660
You included.

209
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,760
Now, friends, here's a frightening statistic.

210
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,740
88% of Americans actually believe in God.

211
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,120
But only 30% fear Him.

212
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,500
That's what's wrong with America, my friend.

213
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:47,020
Don't these humans realize that the anthropomorphic deity they're emptying themselves into is actually Jehovah One?

214
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,500
An ancient, ravenous, alien space creature?

215
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,960
Rising in a pit of chaotic subatomic mega-tachyonic time variations?

216
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,960
Pretending to be God?

217
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,580
He cavorts with plasma angels from the Z dimension.

218
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,320
He's no benevolent father there for you to count on.

219
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,560
You're nothing but one of those.

220
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,580
A man who's got a man's life.

221
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,200
You've only got one of his crops!

222
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,980
He's planning to sell you.

223
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,380
Oh.

224
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,640
He listens to your prayers, all right.

225
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,900
That's how he knows what scares you.

226
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:27,700
Now, all of this was spelled out in plain English ten years ago in the Book of the Subgenius.

227
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:39,300
So, why, why, my friends, do they continue to cling to their barbaric superstitions when the word of God has been flailing around right there in front of them?

228
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,540
One week later...

229
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,880
All this time?

230
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,120
They just want the world to make sense.

231
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,940
Everybody does, but we seem to be the only ones who don't expect it to.

232
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,100
To the pink, anything that makes the world seem to make more sense must therefore be the truth.

233
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
Whereas we're just the opposite.

234
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,840
Anything that makes the world appear to make sense is a lie.

235
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:31,560
Yes, dear friends, and as J.R. Bob Dobbs said in 1956 while trying to comfort an orphan in the first home for slackless children in Wichita, Kansas,

236
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,120
Bob said, there is no God.

237
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,540
Not the kind you're thinking.

238
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,400
But if you're any kind of real American, you'll demand that he treat you as an equal.

239
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,500
Bob?

240
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,660
Bob?

241
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,920
What about slack?

242
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,520
What about slack?

243
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,480
That's your key, Frank.

244
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,980
That's what's my goal.

245
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,560
I need to find a way to get my kid to play with me.

246
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,840
Cara came down from the new home.

247
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,580
And as the person who quickly

248
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,360
caused this whole thing to happen,

249
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,500
& did it f strategist his own wish of somethings election

250
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,420
When someone during those election campaigns

251
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,100
As a vote,

252
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:34,680
only people can EVER vote.

253
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,180


254
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,520
not only is it soft.

255
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:36,520


256
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,740
Sorry, was I interrupting something?

257
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,540
Now we will see an example of the insecurity of the realm.

258
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,320
Hey, wait a minute. You are interrupting me.

259
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,880
Hello, Bob.

260
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,420
I need someone to talk to.

261
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,440
Hello, Bob.

262
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,020
It seems there's nothing I can do.

263
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,020
Hello, Bob.

264
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,420
I need someone to listen to me.

265
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm hitting all the locked doors and I need some help.

266
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,720
And I was hoping you'd have the key.

267
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,080
Hello, Bob.

268
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,260
Have you been listening to my thoughts?

269
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,300
Hello, Bob.

270
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,960
Hello, Bob.

271
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,540
And I'll tell you all the...

272
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,620
...thoughts I've got.

273
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,480
Hello, Bob.

274
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,320
Hello, Bob.

275
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,080
I can't seem to find the truth.

276
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,700
I read the books, I took the drugs, and I drank a whole bottle of Reluce.

277
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,440
Yeah.

278
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,700
Hello, Bob.

279
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,160
I seem to have misplaced my slack.

280
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,540
Hello, Bob.

281
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,160
Hello Bob, well I just can't seem to get it back.

282
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,040
Hello Bob, can you point out what it is I lack?

283
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:27,340
I've climbed to highest heights, hit the lowest lows, but now I'm on my back.

284
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,640
Hello Bob, are you still hearing me?

285
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,280
Hello Bob, give me a sign that I can see.

286
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Hello Bob, it's not that I've lost all my hope,

287
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,740
but I'm really tired.

288
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm really broke and I smoked up the last of my dough.

289
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,720
Hello Bob, am I coming through to you?

290
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:34,400
Hello Bob, I thought I already paid all my dues.

291
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,320
Hello Bob, I know that you can see me through,

292
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,200
but it's damp and dim and I can't swim.

293
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,660
What am I supposed to do?

294
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,460
Well, hello Bob.

295
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,180
Bob, I'm feeling...

296
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,180
I'm feeling better now you've listened to me.

297
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:06,500
Hello Bob, well the sun's out now and I can see.

298
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,860
Hello Bob, a great change has come over me.

299
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,140
My eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear, and I'm as happy as I could be.

300
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,220
Yes, my eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear,

301
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,980
and I'm as happy as I could be.

302
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,620
Hello Bob.

303
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,700
Bebe, Bebe blanked, then vibrated.

304
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,980
No, you don't.

305
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,120
You're not going to get me into that game, meaning the Earth game.

306
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,280
I'm staying the way I am.

307
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,240
Monroe continues.

308
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,320
I rolled and turned inward, I guess from an external point of view.

309
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,320


310
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,060
My eyes are like a mirror that I've found my perspective,

311
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,780
much of my response to my early OOBE states out-of-body experience.

312
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,740
States would seem ludicrous.

313
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,160
Now I can laugh at much of it myself.

314
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,040
At least I know the human school game can work.

315
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,780
But there are many unknowns.

316
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,840
What do you do after you graduate?

317
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,300
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Paul Cooley.

318
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,160
Evangel speaking to you from the Terminal of Life near the Gate of Death, where along with many

319
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:38,660
others, we will shortly be boarding the Interworld Airlines flight FINAL for the New Jerusalem. This

320
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,880
is the very first time that anyone in broadcasting has been given the authority to actually witness

321
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,380
and describe the flight of a departed soul and relay the information so that you can hear,

322
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,040
experience, and prepare yourself for this heavenly journey. The terminal is very crowded today,

323
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,960
and we are told that this is not at all unusual, for eventually all people of all nations will

324
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,260
pass through this point of separation. Let's listen to the dispatcher. Now, of course, this is a

325
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,800
disorganized religion, a non-organization for non-joiners. Praise Bob. If any two subgeniuses

326
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:18,600
are alike, one must die, preferably the weak one. All subgeniuses are different. There is no such

327
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,640
thing as a typical subgenius. We only have one single thing in common,

328
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,040
and that is that we have nothing in common with the human race, the conspiracy of the normal.

329
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
I did not. I did not.

330
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:05,920
If we have to fight and make them die, and we'll all come back over men, we'll all come back over men,

331
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,080
we'll all come back over men, or nobody will. Why?

332
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,420
Let's see, we've got another kid.

333
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,160
Praise Bob.

334
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,040
Girl, me, Bob.

335
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:35,300
I want to buy from Bob. I want to buy and ask the Holy War fulfilled. The pink boys and the normals.

336
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:49,000
If we have to, if we have to, we can make them buy, and we'll all come back home, and we'll all come out over men.

337
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,580
If we don't come out over men, there ain't no...

338
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,540
I'll be back, Bob.

339
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,400
...all Bob's gizms. They will fall.

340
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:09,440
We'll leave our lace of blades, and we'll all come back home, and we'll all come back over men.

341
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,520
We'll all come back home, and then you'll victory for us.

342
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,480
Amazing. So now, you lured the victims to your apartment.

343
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,820
What did they say?

344
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,580
All the decomposition.

345
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,780
A few days in the statement room.

346
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,480
I swear that I think I let fear be the preposterous part of today's dream.

347
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,980
Ok, in the meantime, we may end up in prison to have the truth failed, because they pressed some sentences against us, displayed some provocatives, and elected us to sauce T-shirts in horsesh lanterns.

348
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,300
Like�

349
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,380
Let's see, did you cooked properly?

350
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:51,300
Damn right, I did.

351
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,560
Nice.

352
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,800
Right, what about flying, then?

353
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:53,800


354
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,740
stew out of human body parts. What happened to the evidence?

355
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,440
I ate it up and spit it out.

356
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,960
What did your neighbors in the building say to you?

357
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,540
Can't you smell that smell?

358
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,220
What did you say when the police finally came to your apartment?

359
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,900
I think I'm in trouble.

360
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,820
What did the cops say?

361
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,320
You stupid dick.

362
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Well Jeffrey, it looks like... Hey, why are you staring at my crotch?

363
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,620
Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes you don't.

364
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,540
Oh no you don't. Well, that's the Jeffrey Dahmer story.

365
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,440
And this is your reporter, Billy West, speaking.

366
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,720
In 1799, the Directory overturned and caused quite a mess on the floor as Bonaparte was the first...

367
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,220
Fat.

368
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,240
Fat? Not at that age. He was little, but energetic.

369
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,560
Big in your look. Fat.

370
00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:12,680
He only grew fat in his elder years. At the battle of Waterloo, when the bloated Emperor desperately needed to find a toilet, but, puffed by fluids, was unable to concentrate and lost to the Duke of Wellington, the derisive name Waterloo has since been applied to many in English public obedience.

371
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,120
It's so quaint the way they introduce these teams on the show. Okay, go ahead, caller, what do you think?

372
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,260
Quick question.

373
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,640
Yeah, yeah. Quick question.

374
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,300
Question for puzzling evidence.

375
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,880
How do you record off-radio with your VCR?

376
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,080
You just plug in the female.

377
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,080
In?

378
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,280
Uh-huh.

379
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,700
Okay, you got the female. And you plug that into the...

380
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,800
There we go.

381
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,240
So good.

382
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,340
Hal's doing it with you now.

383
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,560
Does that really work?

384
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,680
Sure.

385
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,820
Oh, cool.

386
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:49,220
And you use your timer to record whatever you want. Now, do you have a Hi-Fi stereo or a regular VCR?

387
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,940
All right. Well, thank you.

388
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,600
No, no, wait a minute. That's a question.

389
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,680
You know, we fought the VCRs in Vietnam.

390
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:07,860
The battle's just beginning. Hold on, fellas. Here they come. We're fighting for America. It's got to be done.

391
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
Say your prayers, you sick bastard.

392
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,940
They construct walls. They become unlike into a juggernaut.

393
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:26,500
They're an impeachable religious force, a frenzy of neo-techno-border.

394
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,140
Wasn't it?

395
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,380
Yeah, I was laughing so hard.

396
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,540
I thought you were laughing.

397
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,440
We haven't checked the radio.

398
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,260
Irredeemable onslaught of youth wars in the past.

399
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,580
Good robe, friend.

400
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,180
Now, first, can we explain it?

401
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,320
How can we explain it, dear friends?

402
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,040
Well, we can.

403
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,920
Tell you what.

404
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,040
I'll tell you what you've been listening to tonight so far on the show.

405
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,120
That was a little bit of...

406
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,540
You just heard Pope Sternodocs, the Pope of Arkansas,

407
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:10,240
with yours truly many, many millions of years ago in the ancient days of forgotten lore.

408
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,500
And before that, of course, Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence,

409
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:23,740
tormenting callers to their subgenius-type show in Berkeley on KPFA.

410
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,140
Before that, you heard Cates and West doing the Jeffrey Dahmer story.

411
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,340
That's Bill Cates and Billy West.

412
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,020
And we've been playing songs tonight from that good old gospel album,

413
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,860
the very first Bob Songs album, Bob Songs number one.

414
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,480
It was, I Wanna Die For You.

415
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,740
Bob Songs number one.

416
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,180
That's such a touching song.

417
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,540
And by someone we only know by the name of Doug Three.

418
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,620
He sent us a tape of those songs about 12 years ago and then disappeared.

419
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,400
Maybe he's dead now.

420
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,300
Some choice clips from Flight, F-I-N-A-L.

421
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,000
And you'll be on that flight with all the rest of us someday, friend.

422
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,440
Friend.

423
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,300
Reverend Random Chance.

424
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,480
Reading from some very strange book about Mr. B.B. and the, well, I don't know,

425
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,140
Glass Madness singing Hello Bob.

426
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:32,340
And the long rant about God there from Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon,

427
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,680
chapter 13, the God chapter.

428
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,580
Just a tiny chunk out of that.

429
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,180
Have I done that one already on this show?

430
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,680
I can't, every time I start reading from that book, I think, oh, no,

431
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,280
I already did this rant on this show.

432
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,220
I think I was in the air last week.

433
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,920
It may be because I have to read the whole book every week or something.

434
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,080
Okay.

435
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:58,580
And a Chainer Hyperclean from Southland Corporation is saying your prayers,

436
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,160
you sick bastard.

437
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,840
On to the next question.

438
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,120
Satan, we must educate the masses.

439
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,540
That's.

440
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,580
Let's go for it.

441
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,640
Oh, God.

442
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,200
He's coming.

443
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,860
He's coming.

444
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,040
Oh, God.

445
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,040


446
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,040


447
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,040


448
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,840
We must educate the masses.

449
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,480
That's Satan is everywhere.

450
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,040
We are keeping the portal between the worlds closed, but it's a tremendous effort.

451
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,940
Keep the door closed.

452
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,140
Oh, if we fail, the Earth will be invaded by.

453
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,440
We need the help of Rhesus.

454
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,120
Son of .

455
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,260
We must be strong, my brother, and have the most powerful machine in the world.

456
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


457
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


458
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


459
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


460
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


461
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


462
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


463
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,260


464
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,100
It's too late. They're breaking through.

465
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,120
Wow, you know, it's not so bad now that it's broken through, you know.

466
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:08,820
The World Airlines flight FINAL, non-stop supersonic service to the New Jerusalem,

467
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,740
is now ready for boarding at the Gate of Beth.

468
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:19,220
Passengers holding confirmed reservations for this flight may proceed immediately to this gate through the blood-sprinkled concourse.

469
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:26,060
Because the exact time of departure is uncertain, you are urged to remain ready at any moment. Thank you.

470
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,160
The crowd seems to be milling about, most everyone talking, some praying, some laughing,

471
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,380
with only a few people acting as if they were paying any attention to the announcement.

472
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,640
They're making ready to leave on this flight.

473
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,720
Who are these that were listening to the dispatcher and responding to the announcement?

474
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,640
Well, with close observation, we notice that each one of them has a ticket in his hand.

475
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,460
Sir, can I see your ticket for just a moment, so that I can tell our audience about it? Thank you.

476
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,660
It says, issued from Mount Calvary by the Chief Agent, the Holy Spirit.

477
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,700
And it has been officially stamped with the blood of Jesus Christ.

478
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,900
Here you are, sir. Thanks again. God bless you.

479
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,460
I notice too that each of the ticket holders is carrying his own baggage.

480
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,220
I'm told each one is furnished with the baggage of grace and godliness.

481
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,780
No sad faces seem to be here to enter the gate of death.

482
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,400
Everybody is beaming.

483
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,900
One of the passengers seems to be singing.

484
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,880
Let's walk along with the portable microphone and see if we can pick up just a little of his song of praise.

485
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,200
Oh, the world looks better since Bob is my blindfold.

486
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,920
The world looks good to me.

487
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,460
Oh, the world looks better since Bob is my blindfold.

488
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,280
The world looks okay to me.

489
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,080
Oh, the world looks to you like some kind of big mess.

490
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,260
Put a Bob blindfold on.

491
00:33:51,920 --> 00:34:00,080
The world looks to me like a nice place to be, cause I got my Bob blindfold on.

492
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:11,000
Our friends live together at the Hall of Justice, a home for the mentally handicapped.

493
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:18,060
It is there that they while away most of their hours watching television shows or playing games.

494
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,020
Dinner is usually the highlight of the day.

495
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,720
The long line of retarded people moves slowly into the dining room.

496
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,120
Robert, Benjamin, Jonathan and Sally sit together at every meal.

497
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,680
Tonight is hamburger night.

498
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,800
Robert loves hamburgers more than anything in the world.

499
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,220
To the other retards this is just another meal.

500
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,600
But to Robert, it is a spiritual experience.

501
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,740
Hey, hamburger time.

502
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,680
Here I come, Mr. Hamburger.

503
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,060
Hey, you make me feel so good.

504
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,020
You my favorite food.

505
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,900
Hey, hamburger.

506
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Benjamin hits his head on the table and laughs hysterically.

507
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,240
Bam bam.

508
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,880
Bam bam.

509
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
I hungry, hungry, hungry.

510
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,060
Food no.

511
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,440
Uh uh uh uh uh uh hungry food.

512
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,960
Shouts Benjamin.

513
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,660
Jonathan picks a large booger out of his nose.

514
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,940
He turns to Sally and wipes it on her shirt.

515
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,260
Sally stares into oblivion.

516
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,820
What we eat?

517
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,760
Asks Jonathan.

518
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,680
Hey, hamburger.

519
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,920
Hamburger, hamburger on.

520
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,640
No, I think what we need to do at that point, that just, I had this song queued up and I didn't know when I was going to play it.

521
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,580
Now I know when to play it.

522
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,000
This is a pick a booger.

523
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,060
Yes, it is.

524
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,580
And it's played with a pick a booger beat by the swinging love corpses.

525
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,460
Cut it out.

526
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,880
If I Mad Libes pap-a-doodle pro.

527
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,660
Tell the lady to stop abruptly, she invited her CAD to dance to a neutron, crown-munрафiqued

528
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:40,660


529
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,640
One way or the other, it's a mixture of either wife or dog or brother.

530
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,280
Robbing in your car and you're looking at your neighbor.

531
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,000
Finding nuggets from his house is like a saber in the paper.

532
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,660
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on this thing.

533
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,380
It's a long, strabist thing still connected to the brain.

534
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,960
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

535
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,300
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

536
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:36,260
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

537
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,760
Pick a booger, booger, it's a new day today.

538
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,680
Hopping out of the movie, up deep inside his sinus.

539
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,360
He's a slave to the master of his royal sinus.

540
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,160
The kids all want a half-paisley infestation.

541
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,660
Cause a pick a booger, booger is the new sensation.

542
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,400
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

543
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,840
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

544
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,660
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

545
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,180
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

546
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,100
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

547
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,020
binnen will dig in your chest.

548
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

549
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,460
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

550
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,640
Jack have you some of that 7-S conveyor don't you?

551
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,220
Dirty Naval Service Mayor Br esto estoy a sacrificio.

552
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,420
what's right up your nose.

553
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,120
And that's

554
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,900
the Swingin' Love Corpses

555
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,840
doing Pick a Booger, which I know

556
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,600
is just about to end right here.

557
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,260
And do you know what led into that

558
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,580
was a little

559
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,620
bit of a piece

560
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,080
from TV Tards

561
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,920
by Abe

562
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,640
Lincoln and the

563
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,300
Swingin' Stinkins.

564
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,140
New tape we just

565
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
got in the mail.

566
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,360
And where are we

567
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,080
now? I suppose we're

568
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,980
back with, uh, possibly

569
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,000
here.

570
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,660
Best food in the world.

571
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,300
Hamburger's Bure.

572
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,140
You actually

573
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,960
understand yon bird's

574
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,160
name?

575
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,640
This is how the station speaks to itself

576
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
inside its own brain.

577
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,700
It's a gift of the

578
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,060
gods.

579
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,420
But I think

580
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,860
my voice does sound strange in my

581
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,420
own ear.

582
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,860
Okay, now the little caller's stuck inside a

583
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,860
basket. And I feel

584
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,480
circumscribed somehow or

585
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,440
imperfectly coming through.

586
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,740
My voice, the signal, it's being

587
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,340
jammed.

588
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,220
Must break through.

589
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,380
Must broadcast before it's

590
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,300
too late.

591
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,840
Eyes,

592
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,780
eyelids getting heavy.

593
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,260
Sleepy. Must stay conscious.

594
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,220
Must

595
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,000
reach console.

596
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,000
Got to keep going.

597
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,360
Must reach oxygen switch.

598
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,960
Heart pounding.

599
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,060
Short of breath. Can't take it.

600
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,360
Falling here.

601
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,480
Embarrassing body sounds.

602
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,700
Dimples.

603
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:06,940


604
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,940
Ah.

605
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,460
It's, it's, it's, it's.

606
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,260
Bob?

607
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,360
Bob?

608
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,660
The message is now part of and registered

609
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,460
in your subconscious mind.

610
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,640
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

611
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,920
What about Slack?

612
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,060
That's your key phrase.

613
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,340
It will trigger the entire message without

614
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,980
your being aware of it.

615
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,100
Oh, Bob and that blues.

616
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,240
One of these sounds is not like the others.

617
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,180
Oh, they're not washing.

618
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,040
One of these sounds does.

619
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,940
It's just singing.

620
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,940
Some of these sounds.

621
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,880
Which sound is not like the others.

622
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,200
Trying to be made by.

623
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,400
That's not like that one sound.

624
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,460
Oh.

625
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,100
Oh.

626
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,760
What about Slack?

627
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,180
How do you understand Lyme block.

628
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,180


629
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,620
You know some of the tearcritical young.

630
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:20,760
Manły old folks ordered Sloka,

631
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,400
a work by Tim Stubbs.

632
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,520
Deep換else.

633
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,100
It's addictive.

634
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,100


635
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,120
You've got to keep on instrument.

636
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,940
Should be a forever Ub acuerdo za곡...

637
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:26,940


638
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:26,940


639
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:26,940


640
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,340
Or ear therefore, ah?

641
00:42:34,360 --> 00:43:00,400
the pork barrel, we'll make a barrel of mun. Roll out the pork barrel, we got the taxpayers on the run. Roll out the pork barrel, bring our interest for cheer. That's why all the crooks are in Washington, cause the money's all here.

642
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:28,700
Roll out the pork barrel, my state's an atomic collider. Roll out the pork barrel, make my state highways whiter.

643
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,660
Roll out the pork barrel.

644
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,860
Roll out the pork barrel.

645
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,340
Go out free.

646
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,800
There's no limit to what we can spend.

647
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,960
That's why your government's so abroad.

648
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,980
Because we gave the money to our friends.

649
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,180
Let's go!

650
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,020
Let's go, friends!

651
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,100
Woo!

652
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,300
Fuck you, your government!

653
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,400
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border

654
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,700
Down to the border

655
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,500
Woo! Woo! Woo!

656
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,700
Woo! Woo!

657
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,460
Oh, boy.

658
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,860
Brain Rock Radio Theater, most aptly named.

659
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,720
Bunch of I just don't know what.

660
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,420
Out from WCSB in Cleveland.

661
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:26,540
Yes, only dangerous Dan DiDonato could ever come up with such a truly bad,

662
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,180
truly intensely bad song.

663
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,380
And speaking of that,

664
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,060
speaking of bad songs,

665
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,880
I'm going to finally get back to this edit of the band that dare not speak its name,

666
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,100
which is, of course, Puzzling Evidence, Gary Gbrogfran and Lies,

667
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,340
in this case with Dr. Howell,

668
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,080
and Negative Land.

669
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,400
This is the subgenius band that dare not speak its name with Negative Land,

670
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,180
not all of Negative Land, I think Don Joyce and maybe one of the other ones,

671
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,880
but certainly their tapes.

672
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,800
And I think that, man, this one like makes rock history.

673
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,760
I think, I believe that first we'll hear West Coast Head,

674
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:21,160
that wonderful ode to the giant fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer built on the West Coast

675
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,360
and lost in the Grand Canyon.

676
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,600
Honest.

677
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,860
And then finally, the cover version of Doctors for Woe Take Me.

678
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,900
This is Harry Gbrogfran doing Louie Louie.

679
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,760
Will we broadcast that or do we have to play it again?

680
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,300
Let's play it again?

681
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,700
Guys, let's play it again.

682
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,780
Let's play it right.

683
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,100
No, that won't be necessary.

684
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,140
That was just fine.

685
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:04,080
Because in the end, we all know what we've done.

686
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,840
We're talking to our agent in a foreign country.

687
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,220
Well, I wouldn't deny that what these musicians say

688
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,300
may have a little bit of the flavor and odor of truth.

689
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,080
But for the most part, it's the usual crunk of horse buggy.

690
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,440
And you can take it from me, Ralph Fielding Snell, radio commentator.

691
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,980
Let's go back and hear what the lively lads, the three trash heads are,

692
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,360
cooking up in their radio kitchens.

693
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:53,360
Remember, the big ultra-groovy contest is brought to you by

694
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,080
PC Shopping Guide for Christmas.

695
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,400
The annual guide for youngsters of 6 to 60,

696
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,580
or even a greater or younger age,

697
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,680
to buy the latest in high-fashion, ultra-expensive accessories,

698
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,680
which are good for the earth.

699
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,920
Full of doves and wood pigeons.

700
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,500
Now we rejoin the mopheads at their exclusive recording studio.

701
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,040
They're in the middle of a session.

702
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,060
Let's listen.

703
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,000
You have to ask me when.

704
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,560
It is the best.

705
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,600
It's that dirty old thing that we brought in from the west.

706
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,500
It's a west coast head.

707
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,700
Just listen to the ear sounder in the third movie,

708
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,900
where the arpeggio is well.

709
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,740
It's the best thing that you've seen anywhere.

710
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,660
It's the life of both the woodwinds.

711
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,600
It smells like it's got a bunch of hair.

712
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,800
It's the west coast head.

713
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,880
And it's the best.

714
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,560
It's got a nasty little brow.

715
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,880
It's got two giant eyes.

716
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,200
Yes, that is the brow, ladies and gentlemen.

717
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,760
Nasty brow.

718
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,600
They call him nasty brow.

719
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,660
The idol of all the teen fan-mags.

720
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,840
Rumored to be a U.S. Army intelligence officer.

721
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,720
Or a Oakland police officer in his carriage.

722
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,660
We may take the ability to talk for granted, but...

723
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,380
And why shouldn't you?

724
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Jane Orr of the Jane Orrians is cursed with the ability to do nothing else.

725
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,720
You talk every day of your life and you don't think much about it.

726
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,660
He will enable you overnight to relieve constant and even agonizing pain.

727
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,520
He's great. Yum, yum. Words.

728
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,020
But did you realize that millions of people suffer from voice problems?

729
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,340
Well, I try not to think about it.

730
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,700
These millions can't take talking for granted.

731
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,600
Come on.

732
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,520
And they shouldn't.

733
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:56,860
Do it.

734
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,120
For them, to talk is a struggle.

735
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,160
You know, I know what they mean.

736
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,220
But let's get right down to brass tacks.

737
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,220
Somewhat uncomfortable, actually.

738
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:12,940
Well, when?

739
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,840
You have a voice like...

740
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,740
Okay, there we go.

741
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,140
Because I believe in the subgenial program of musical mind expansion.

742
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,640
You're a religious fitness show in the name of yourself.

743
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,420
I feel smarter already.

744
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,800
I've been waiting.

745
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,280
I've been waiting that week.

746
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,560
I've been really careless because I'm a servant priest.

747
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,460
I've had a lot of audio.

748
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,100
Don't want to end up prompting.

749
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,340
Look out, dudes, because here comes Chubby.

750
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:47,780
Chubby.

751
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,400
Chubby.

752
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,520
Chubby.

753
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,520
Chubby.

754
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:53,880
Chubby.

755
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,540
Chubby.

756
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:54,560
Chubby.

757
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:54,560


758
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,440
Chubby.

759
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,440


760
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,440


761
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,860
Exquisitely bad.

762
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,540
Truly exquisitely bad.

763
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,440
Chubby.

764
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:11,260
Again, the musicologist can only stand in awe of these compositions,

765
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,540
which seem to take the entire science of musical expression

766
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,500
to a new Olympian empirean height.

767
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,400
What happened to them?

768
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,780
I'm sure you all recognize this beloved melody.

769
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,900
As the ever popular oldie but moldy goldie classic, I'll slap your chops shut, baby,

770
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,040
with a stilts and a wrench.

771
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:38,460
But did you know that the same haunting tune was also splatted over Rich's eczema cantata

772
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,700
number 12, opus 99 in C major?

773
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:47,580
Now you and your entire family, including kids from six to 60, can enjoy this and other

774
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:54,000
classic masterpieces of the world's longest playing music in your own home, whenever you

775
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,200
want.

776
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,420
Expose yourself.

777
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,180
Expose your youngsters to the impotent world of symphonic overkill, at any time and at

778
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,040
your own convenience.

779
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,160
Have another cup of terrible coffee.

780
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,860
And sit and listen to our jokes and songs.

781
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,700
We just opened up a new box of donuts from Caffè Neutrino in case anybody's hungry.

782
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,400
The coffee canto of Giovanni Robertini d'Avzina.

783
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,720
You only spend about as much as you would for a really good set of luggage or a year

784
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,220
of education.

785
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:25,400
But you can't get enough of the music.

786
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


787
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


788
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


789
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


790
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


791
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


792
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


793
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,400


794
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,240
You can't get enough of the music.

795
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,060
You can't get enough of the music.

796
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,860
You can't get enough of the music.

797
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,960
The most important thing about music is that it's about to be produced.

798
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,220
Ti-ti-ti-ta.

799
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,520
Ti-ti-ta.

800
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:54,680


801
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,000
Ti-ti-ta.

802
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:56,340


803
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:56,340


804
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:56,640
Ti-ti-ta.

805
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,720
Ti-ti-ta.

806
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,780
Ti-ti-ta.

807
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,800
Ti-ti-ta.

808
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,920
Ti-ti-ta.

809
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,820
to the Duke of Welland.

810
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,400
He lived in dire poverty and suffered from yawns,

811
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,680
jaundice, syphilis, gout, rotten teeth,

812
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,080
embarrassing body sounds,

813
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,420
and an unknown debilitating disease,

814
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,380
which caused bits of blindness, deafness, and madness.

815
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,380
The obsidious bothered 49 children by his second wife,

816
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,200
Connie Maria Anna Houdry-Torkel.

817
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,800
To support his large family,

818
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,500
he wrote 467 symphonies, 96 concerts,

819
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,780
67 concertos, 48 known motets,

820
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,620
19 operas, and two concerts in New York.

821
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,220
Pretty little song.

822
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,600
This is his most inspired work.

823
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,000
Nice little song.

824
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,580
Separated the fluff from the facts for you

825
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,420
the last couple days?

826
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,240
Oh, a fact is just coming in, gentlemen.

827
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,500
Told you what is truth versus what is not?

828
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,000
You mean what is lies?

829
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,180
I wanna get you out of here.

830
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,720
We have to go back pretty far

831
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,220
to get to the beginning of this musical group's

832
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,040
phenomenal success.

833
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,160
They said, Bob, we back in what we're doing.

834
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,520
Told ya.

835
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,580
Put on down, man.

836
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,920
All right, you pluridellic cats and chicks.

837
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,820
Time to spin some new rockin' platters.

838
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,940
This was their first novelty record,

839
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,040
which the lads reproduced and released in 1986,

840
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,540
Grotti the Tubo.

841
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,620
Turned all their heads.

842
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,680
Critics at the time pointed out

843
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,780
that no actual tuba music was used.

844
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,840
And now, it was.

845
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,040
We felt no fear.

846
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,300
We can all sing along.

847
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,840
Perfect.

848
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,420
Stand there by your radios and sing along.

849
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,780
Okay, here it comes, friends.

850
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,940
This is a song about a girl

851
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,160
who's not really a girl.

852
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,140
20 years ago, she started in Minnesota.

853
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,480
Released part goat.

854
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,300
An undetermined amount part goat.

855
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,240
But she's very pretty and petite and well-mannered

856
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,500
for someone who's part goat.

857
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,940
20cc sodium pentothal here.

858
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:04,220
All right, thanks.

859
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:04,700
Here we go.

860
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,480
We are now administering sodium pentothal.

861
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,540
One, two, three.

862
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,480
One, two, three.

863
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,160
Here is how you say so quick, so fast.

864
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,560
Oh, Louie Louie.

865
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,100
So quick.

866
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:21,380


867
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,020
So quick.

868
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,180
Are you a girl?

869
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:25,840
Yes.

870
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,580
So quick.

871
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,880
So quick.

872
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,140
Are you a goat woman?

873
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:29,700
So quick.

874
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,000
So quick.

875
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,580
Oh, Louie, Louie.

876
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,180
Are you a girl?

877
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,340
Or are you a goat?

878
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,900
Personal computers.

879
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,900
Louie, Louie, at the safe fair.

880
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,300
Louie, Louie, all covered with hair.

881
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,960
Louie, Louie, at a quarter of a stair.

882
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,180
They've got her in a tent over there.

883
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,920
Oh, Louie, Louie.

884
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Are you a girl?

885
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,240
Or are you a goat woman?

886
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,060
Communication work, satellites.

887
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,700
Yeah, I can remember the first time I saw you, Louie, Louie.

888
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,960
I was in the state fair there, watching the livestock exhibition.

889
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,940
And I couldn't believe it.

890
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,820
How beautiful you were, Louie, Louie.

891
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:38,340
And I had to crawl over the man with no arms and no legs just to get to you.

892
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,760
But then I knew you had to be all mine, Louie, Louie.

893
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,640
Velcro.

894
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:52,560
So I took you on home with me and I let you have the run of my entire yard.

895
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,140
Touch tone telephone.

896
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,900
I'll let you eat things right out of the refrigerator and the garbage can.

897
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,200
Bye-bye.

898
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,340
Analyzing your surgery.

899
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:05,040
And when I saw those little round pellets all around my toilet.

900
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,840
Apollo, do this for me.

901
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,140
I knew that you were something special.

902
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:16,000
And I've got to play a little bit of guitar, Louie, Louie, just to show you how much I

903
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,360
care.

904
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,920
Organ transplant surgery.

905
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,560
Fiber optic transmission systems.

906
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:29,940
This is my grandmother.

907
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


908
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


909
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


910
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


911
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


912
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


913
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


914
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


915
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


916
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


917
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


918
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


919
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


920
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,940


921
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,940
Disposable diapers.

922
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,360
Disc operating system.

923
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,680
Magnetic resonance imaging.

924
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,760
Louie Louie!

925
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,960
Are you a girl?

926
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,280
Tie-dye.

927
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,300
Or are you a goat, woman?

928
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,160
Microsurgery techniques.

929
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,900
Are you a girl?

930
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,480
Camcorder.

931
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,660
Who do you want to see this summer at the state fair?

932
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,120
Space shuttle.

933
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:27,800
Well, dear friends, have you ever, ever heard a version of Louie Louie to...

934
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,940
...that comes out of the mouth?

935
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:29,960


936
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,700
I guess you could possibly match the band that dare not speak its name, and now you know why.

937
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,840
The band that dare not speak its name.

938
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:45,440
And yet, you know that may sound terrible to you, but because they were with negative land, that puts it into the realm of high art.

939
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,460
Strange how those things happen, isn't it?

940
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,560
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

941
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,860
What's that?

942
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,920
That's Duane, what are you crazy?

943
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,360
BeeBee broke in.

944
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:10,500
in. Say, uh, uh, Ram. I opened. Yes. B.B. flickered. I take it back. You're not really a dumb girl.

945
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:23,700
I rolled. Thanks. I needed that. B.B. blanked. You did? That's a joke. Human fun. He turned inward,

946
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:30,700
then went on opening. How did you get a percept and start running this leaving your body game?

947
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:39,840
B.B. asks Monroe. I flickered. I don't know. It just happened. This is a strange but true story

948
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:47,940
which proves that history does repeat itself. You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

949
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:53,260
Hour of Slack. For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

950
00:58:53,260 --> 00:59:00,500
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready? Bob, Post Office Box 140306,

951
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:13,720
Dallas, Texas 75214. That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214. Stay tuned and praise Bob.

952
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,560
Oh!

953
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:31,360
The Subgenius Radio Program is a fully accredited tentacle of the Church of the Subgenius and has received a dispensation to use subgenius jokes and likenesses.

954
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,520
But there is...

955
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,260
We need your help.

956
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,660
Ecstatic experiences.

957
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:46,560
For those left behind, the parting is a sorrowful one. After all, for some, this is the last time they will ever see their loved ones.

958
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:53,240
But for others, those already making preparations, this is only temporary, and their departure...

959
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,560
...time is not too far away.

960
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,960
And now, if you listen, you can hear a comforting song of farewell from the passengers.

961
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,380
Come on everybody, stick your finger in your nose.

962
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,080
Take a bugger out and wipe it on your nose.

963
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,660
Don't know how you feel, one way or another.

964
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,440
You need to make sure you're happy, and wipe it on your brother.

965
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,060
Grab it in your car and you're looking at the lights.

966
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,580
My bucket's full of stars, but I can savor it today.

967
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,400
It's pulling, it's tugging, you're shaking on this thing.

968
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,180
It's a long time of screams, but you make me do the brain.

969
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,140
And I'm not afraid to say, I'm not afraid to say.

970
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,740
Pick a bugger, pick a bugger.

971
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,040
Pick a bugger, pick a bugger.

972
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,000
Everybody do it, pick a bugger.

973
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,000
Pick a bugger, pick a bugger.

974
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,720
Thank you, thank you.

975
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:50,920


976
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,440
And do you know what happened?

977
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,460
Again.

978
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,540
And do you know what happened?

979
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,960
Again, that big, bad, ferocious...

980
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,440
World of the future!

981
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,200
Probably.

982
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,280
And only two religions, guns.

983
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,280
I would listen to television and watch it.

984
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,220
And Cinderella lived...

985
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,060
Happily ever after?

986
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:18,740
Yes.

987
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,060
How did you know?

988
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,240
Because good little girls like Cinderella always live happily ever after.

989
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,440
Oh, saved my life.

990
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,700
Yes, sir, dear friend.

991
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,960
I'm happier than the morning sun.

992
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,780
That's the way it'll always be.

993
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,540
Ever since the day you came inside of me.

994
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,800
Oh my!

995
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,120
Oh my!

996
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,060
Oh my!

997
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:53,240
Oh my!

998
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


999
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1000
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1001
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1002
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1003
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1004
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1005
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1006
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1007
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1008
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1009
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1010
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1011
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1012
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1013
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1014
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1015
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1016
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,240


1017
01:01:53,260 --> 01:02:04,950
