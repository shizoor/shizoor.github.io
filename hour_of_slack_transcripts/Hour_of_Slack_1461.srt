00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,220
Welcome to Vox System. How may I help you?

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,760
The mind of man has always longed to know what lies beyond the world we live in.

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,940
Explorers have ventured into the deeps and the heights.

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,460
Of these explorers, some are scientists, some are mystics.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,840
Each is driven by a different purpose.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,960
The one thing they share in common is a wish to cross the borderlands that lie beyond

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,560
the subgenius power of slack.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,820
Stand by.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,780
Stand by, please.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,600
1-3-0

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,340
1-3

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,500
1-3-0

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,160
1-3

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,600
1-3-0

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,340
1-3

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,340


17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,680
1-3-0

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,600
1-3-0

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Okay, this is bad.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,940
Everyone's gonna know I don't belong here.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,840
Wait, nobody's noticing me.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,820
But how can that be? Don't they know I'm a...

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,580
They don't notice because I look just like them.

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,360
Wow, no dirty looks.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,280
Could it be a place where I finally fit in?

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh, this is so awesome!

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,920
I can't believe nobody's picking up my...

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,960
I thought so.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,340
Yeah, still got that new kid smell.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,580
What should we do to him first? Wedgie?

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,060
The Horses.

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,900
You see, sir, we kinda have this monster club, okay?

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,900
And we draw those pictures to put on our clubhouse walls.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,680
Correction, Mr. Crenshaw.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,080
You draw pictures during Mrs. Carlson's science class when you're supposed to be paying attention.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,620
Wait, I just wanna say one thing.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,480
I mean, Mrs. Carlson's a nice guy.

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,100
She's a nice teacher and all.

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
But she's boring and has an odd-shaped head.

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,460
That's why some of the guys call her Meow-mix.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,980
Because her head's shaped like a cat head.

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,080
But I don't circus. How rude.

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,360
I hear you!

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,460
I was a kid once.

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,380
I thought monsters were cool.

46
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:20,480
And maybe, well, gosh, maybe I'm just a big kid because Sean, Patrick, I think science is cool.

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,260
I dig it, man.

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,000
Now, I'm sure both of you know a great deal about monsters, but that's not the issue here.

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,100
The issue is science is real.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,700
Monsters are not.

51
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,620
Now, uh, what was this about a monster?

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,760
Come on, you can't expect us to believe that.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,200
Let's go over that again.

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,380
I believe you probably think you saw something.

55
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,580
You know, the human mind's a funny thing.

56
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,220
It plays strange tricks.

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,260
Are you guys trying to tell us that...

58
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,820
Aliens, space monsters, bring on some kind of brave new world!

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
And they're gonna whip your butt real good.

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,220
But they're really pretty, so you won't mind.

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,620
Yeah, they got big tentacles and flowers on their hats and everything.

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,960
Come on, you don't really believe all that stuff about normies, do ya?

63
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,600
Uh, yeah, I do.

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,460
Deuce, my mummy, my daddy, taught me a long time ago that they are not to be trusted.

65
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:50,120
classroom Hell with 라고

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,760
Find paper curry

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:51,760


68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,840
Simple question. Are you prepared?

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,840
Whoa!

70
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,000
Ooh, indeed!

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,720
Oh, my...

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:02,860
Ooh!

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
Watch it, Normie.

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,580
Oh, I'm part monster too, Manny. See?

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,220
Finally! Sweet music, thank you.

76
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,420
I have been trapped in that nerdy Normie for way too long.

77
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,840
Oh, man! Battery's low.

78
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,740
I better rock this school while I can.

79
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,180
What is Monster Zero?

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,180
The demon of our galaxy.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,580
Monster Zero is the reason we cannot live on the surface,

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,100
but must forever live underground like this.

84
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,200
Alert all units. Monster has begun the attack.

85
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,680
Everything is numbered here.

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,760
The monster is zero.

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,600
Emergency.

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,320
Emergency. Emergency.

89
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,240
The hydrogen oxide plant has been damaged.

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,360
Now, these have been meaningless to you

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
because you're not a monster fan geek.

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,280
You're a rock and roller or a writer type or something.

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,900
You're a girl. You're a girl.

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,520
So it wouldn't mean anything to you.

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,780
Because to you, a monster is just some fictitious creature

96
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,440
of a madman's imagination.

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,440
You...

98
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,100
Could a madman cough?

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,360
Like I am coughing now?

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,640
Could a madman shriek like this?

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,660
Could a...

102
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,680
Slap the cuffs on him. Janie's bleeding.

103
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,080
What was that crash all about?

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,300
Hmm, let me check it out.

105
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,220
Oh.

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,340
Looks like a Normie car.

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,380
And...

108
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,220
Um, hello?

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
Are you alive?

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,080
Oh, where is he?

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,520
Where am I?

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,060
Um, this is Monster High.

113
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,320
Um, I'm pretty sure you crashed your car here.

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,700
Um, I don't even know my name.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,720
I think I'm confused.

116
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,300
Uh...

117
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,700
Uh...

118
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,720
I guess I better take him home.

Um, hi. I'm Frankie.

130
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm a student at Monster High.

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,040
I found you when your car crashed.

132
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
Car crash?

133
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,860
Um, I don't know what you're talking about, but...

134
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,820
Mmm...

135
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:34,980
Whoa!

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,220
I don't even know you.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,940
Besides, you're a Normie, and I'm a monster.

138
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,480
But we don't go together.

139
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,860
Oh...

140
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,780
Okay.

141
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,080
Okay.

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,000
Some of you guys, I don't know, it's gonna be rough.

143
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,780
You're gonna have to make do with some of the squamous aliens

144
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,380
that pass themselves off as sex goddesses.

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,140
But as Hal was saying last night,

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,260
their pheromones are so strong, you won't care.

147
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,460
That's right.

148
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,700
They touched upon that in that movie Galaxy Quest.

149
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,660
The actor playing the actor who plays the Bones character

150
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,700
fell in love with an alien woman on that, and when he...

151
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,100
When she lost control,

152
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,180
and started squirting tentacles up out of her body,

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,720
that turned him on even more.

154
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,160
He was the subgenius of that movie.

155
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,760
Analy!

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,180
Who was it that told me?

157
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,300
I think it was Doc Fropp.

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,300
He said, I like my coffee like I like my women.

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,240
Analy.

160
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,240
Analy.

161
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,580
It was one I wasn't expecting.

162
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,700
Who goes there, friend or enema?

163
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,840
Guys!

164
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,180
Are you watching this?

165
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,100
Meet Joe Normie.

166
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,420
Pleasant, hardworking man of the people

167
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,780
nearly every day of the year.

168
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,660
Except one.

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,680
Halloween!

170
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,900
The night he and a thousand of his closest Normie friends

171
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,360
turn into a crazed monster-hunting goon squad.

172
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,320
Run for the hills, everyone!

173
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,800
This... this... this can't be right, but...

174
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,760
They will do anything and everything to make your life miserable.

175
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,480
Wait, what about Trick or Treat?

176
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,640
Glad you asked.

177
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,080
Uh, what?

178
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,160
What?

179
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't fall for any of their tricks or treats.

180
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,380
They are traps designed to lure you out of hiding

181
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,780
so they can haul you away.

182
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,080
No.

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,760
Lock your doors and stay inside.

184
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,080
If you are unlucky enough to find yourself outside,

185
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,760
do anything to avoid being discovered.

186
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,540
It's those monsters that attempt to stand up and fight back

187
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,740
who are the most at risk.

188
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,640
Don't let this happen to you.

189
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,960
Oh!

190
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,440
Oh!

191
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,460
Oh!

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,220
Oh!

193
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:43,600


194
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,440
Mr. Rotter, this film can't be right.

195
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
I mean, monsters forced to run and hide,

196
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,580
Normies coming to get us.

197
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,960
That is the unfortunate history of Halloween.

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Ah!

199
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,340
I assure you this is no laughing matter.

200
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,640
Halloween is only days away.

201
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,060
But... but my magazine said this is a fun time with costumes and candy and...

202
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,240
Frankie!

203
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,860
These Normie magazines are jammed full of lies.

204
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,440
See?

205
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,740
Even though the Normies may seem like they can be trusted,

206
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,100
all rules go out the window on Halloween.

207
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,140
Who knows what they might be capable of?

208
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,700
But I had an idea about that bonfire.

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,680
What if next year, instead of the Woodbusters building it

210
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
in the magnificent pyramid style that they've done,

211
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,840
what if it looked like one of those old castles in a Frankenstein movie?

212
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,480
And we'd get to be the villagers with the torches!

213
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,480
Haven't you ever wanted to do that?

214
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,760
Actually, I always wanted to be the monster on top of the thing

215
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,380
throwing boulders onto the villagers with the torches

216
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,700
or, you know, the hunchback pouring the lava down on them and stuff.

217
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,940
But only the Woodbusters get to do that.

218
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,160
Dun-na-na-na-na. Dun-na-na-na-na.

219
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,720
I am Holt Hyde, the Normie Slayer.

220
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,400
Dun-na-na-na-na-na.

221
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,180
Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! I'm in pain! Uh!

222
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,720
Shut up, Normie.

223
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,920
Why are you doing this?

224
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,140
Because Normies are vile creatures who will kill you on sight for being different.

225
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,520
Dun-na-na-na-na. Dun-na-na-na-na.

226
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,700
I hate Normies.

227
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,380
They're so stupid.

228
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,580
But that makes you the same as Normies.

229
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,280
I am nothing like you.

230
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
Get ready, filth.

231
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,300
Huh?

232
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,540
Please, I just want to go home and be normal.

233
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,860
Dun-na-na-na-na. Dun-na-na-na-na.

234
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
Shut up.

235
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,600
Dun-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

236
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,560
So you're Holt, the Normie Slayer.

237
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,980
Dun-na-na-na-na-na. Dun-na-na-na-na.

238
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,440
You're another Normie. I'll kill you, too.

239
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,920
Dun-na-na-na-na-na-na. Dun-na-na-na-na-na.

240
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,260
Oh, really?

241
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Dun-na-na-na-na-na-na.

242
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
You haven't been kind to humans.

243
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,740
So I'm going to show you what it's like

244
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,320
to be one.

245
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,120
Dun-na-na-na-na-na.

246
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
No! No!

247
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,560
No!

248
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,380
Dun-na-na-na-na-na.

249
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,580
I look out upon this field of faces,

250
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,060
this huge crowd, and I think,

251
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,020
how many here,

252
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,420
when they saw that monster movie,

253
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
was there a single one here

254
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,340
who was rooting for the humans to kill the monster?

255
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,120
I think not.

256
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,940
I think almost everyone here did the opposite

257
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,960
of what they were meant to do, and they went,

258
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,740
oh, great, the monster's destroying the town.

259
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,500
I hope he makes it to the next town to destroy that.

260
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,680
And at the end, of course, invariably,

261
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,400
at the end of a Hollywood pink movie,

262
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,520
the monster gets killed.

263
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,100
At the end of Independence Day,

264
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,080
which Hollywood released on X Day 1996,

265
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,820
at the beginning of our first X Days, who won?

266
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,620
The humans.

267
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,040
With some foolish computer code

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,300
that any alien could see right through in a nanosecond.

269
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,880
They...

270
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,800
How likely is that?

271
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,620
An America Online virus saved the humans from X Day.

272
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,840
Oh, yeah, according to Hollywood.

273
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,060
The one monster movie I've seen that shows hope

274
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,560
is the Cloverfield monster,

275
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,900
which at the end of which, you know that thing's not dead.

276
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,800
Excellent, yes.

277
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,840
All that's left of New York is the code name Cloverfield,

278
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,600
because there's no way else to truly describe the horror of what happened.

279
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,500
Yeah, they had to...

280
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,240
That was a movie that ended with hope,

281
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,020
the hope that every human died and that monsters inherited the Earth.

282
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,500
Because are we not those monsters that they fear?

283
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,620
Well, we are.

284
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,840
Where are the monsters walking among them?

285
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,060
The movie's even more subtle than that, Stan.

286
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,820
Some of us, it's obvious, like Reverend Skull over there.

287
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,800
You can tell just by looking at him, he's one of the monsters.

288
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,960
Then there are others who are a little bit more subtle in their monstrosity,

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,180
such as the big boss of this area, Reverend Back It On Up.

290
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,320
You'd never think that she was...

291
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,440
Aside from the gigantic cranium, you'd think she was a human being.

292
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,280
You'd hardly look twice at her.

293
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,540
Well, actually, most people probably, a lot of guys do.

294
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,080
Yeah, speak for yourself.

295
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,100
Sneak a second look.

296
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,420
But let's not get bogged down in the doctrine here.

297
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,640
We were trying to address the hearts and minds and glands, really.

298
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
Forget the minds, they're pointless in this church,

299
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,900
but the glands, the feeling of slack.

300
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,560
You can make a show.

301
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,380
You can make a show.

302
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,380


303
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,040
Walking down a darkened hallway

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,560
Everybody tends to look at you

305
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,160
It's not because you're different

306
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,360
It's just because you're so scary cool

307
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,580
A sinister style mystery with a smile

308
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,180
You're drop-dead gorgeous, drop-dead gorgeous

309
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,720
Skull keeps me in creeps, but when I'm with my peeps

310
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,700
I can't ignore us

311
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,840
Swear the ghoul kids rule

312
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,840
Monster, monster high, monster high

313
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,340
Monster, monster high

314
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,720
Come on, don't be shy

315
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,700
Monster high, a party never dies

316
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,920
Monster, monster high, monster high

317
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,300
Monster, monster high

318
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,720
Freaky, she can fly

319
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,400
Monster high, we're student bodies

320
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,080
Yeah, I'm the freak that's got me falling apart

321
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,200
Uh, Draculaura is stealing my heart

322
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,180
Cloudy and woofy make me hallow the moon

323
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,160
I'm gonna unify this mission, this lagoon

324
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,060
I'm Cleo the Nile, you so big, I'm gonna be the king of the moon

325
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,860
I'm the king of the sky, even though you act so vile

326
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,820
And Deuce has stone cold style

327
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,960
These are my boobs, my skeleton crew

328
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,820
A little strange, but so are you

329
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,020
Don't you wanna be a monster too?

330
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, freaky just got fabulous

331
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,560
Everybody wants a piece of you

332
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,700
Best eyes, best smile, let's be realistic

333
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,620
Most characteristic, most hip and horrific

334
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,560
A sinister style mystery with a smile

335
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,100
You're dropped and gorgeous

336
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,180
You're dropped and gorgeous

337
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,820
Cause high school gives me the creeps

338
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,760
But when I'm with my peeps

339
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,600
You can't ignore us

340
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,820
Swear the ghoul kids rule

341
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,840
Monster, monster high, monster high

342
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,720
Monster, monster high, come on, don't be shy

343
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Monster high, a party never dies

344
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,860
Monster, monster high, monster high

345
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,740
Monster, monster high, freaky, she can fly

346
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,400
Monster high, we're student bodies

347
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
M-O-N-S

348
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,160
T-E-R

349
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,100
Monsters, monsters, so bizarre

350
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,420
M-O-N-S

351
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,100
T-E-R

352
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,360
Monsters, monsters, yes we are

353
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,340
M-O-N-S

354
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,220
T-E-R

355
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,160
Monsters, monsters, so bizarre

356
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,440
M-O-N-S

357
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,140
T-E-R

358
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,680
Monsters, a party never dies

359
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,720
Monster, monster high, monster high

360
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,760
Monster, monster high, freaky, she can fly

361
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,320
Monster high, we're student bodies

362
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,260
We've got spirits, yes we do

363
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,280
We've got spirits, how about you?

364
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,280
We've got spirits, yes we do

365
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,300
We've got spirits, how about you?

366
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,580
Monster high, monster high

367
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,120
Monster high, we're student bodies

368
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,400
Monster high, monster high

369
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,900
Monster high, we're student bodies

370
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,620
Monster high, monster high

371
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,620


372
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,620


373
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,620


374
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,100
Monster high, we're student bodies

375
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,540
Find anything, Bob?

376
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,980
No, doctor, not a thing.

377
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,380
There you are. You see, there's no sign of any excessive radio activity anywhere in the area.

378
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,760
Odd, wouldn't you say, for something coming in from outer space?

379
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,960
I don't know what's odd and what isn't any more.

380
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,260
but I do know I expected you to be more open to the idea than the others.

381
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,120
You're a man of science.

382
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,120
And therefore less inclined to witchcraft, John.

383
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,660
Not witchcraft, Dr. Snell.

384
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,340
Imagination.

385
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,320
Willingness to believe that there are lots of things that we don't know anything about.

386
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,460
Look, there was a time when people thought the Earth was a level plane

387
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,260
between two mountains that were set there to hold up the sky,

388
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,700
and that the stars were lamps hung from that sky.

389
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,440
Then a better idea came along, and people were willing to listen.

390
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,120
Be realistic, John.

391
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,300
We've worked together before.

392
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,640
In the meantime, you can do an article for us.

393
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Yes.

394
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,480
Yeah.

395
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,120
Yeah.

396
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
An intense young man.

397
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,480
Yeah, and an odd one, too.

398
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,920
More than odd, Bob.

399
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,420
Individual and lonely.

400
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,860
A man who thinks for himself.

401
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,280
Report on the arrival of strangers from outer space.

402
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,820
There were so many strangely named, and yet appropriately named,

403
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,620
B, or psychotronic phobias.

404
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:02,820
Weird movies, none of which notably

405
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,240
like the ones mentioned in the films of the time.

406
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,540
He has silence and

407
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,760
Since details of myself in any boat is much greater than about theITY

408
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,140
over the hand you have fotos of stay-at-home

409
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,280
ranking.

410
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,540
Moment间

411
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,660
Yes, this goes to see if

412
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:21,660


413
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:21,660


414
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:21,880
be

415
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:27,980
Bersow

416
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,620
and consistently coped with the

417
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:50,860
And so you have fascist figures like Marshall Thompson in Fiend Without a Face running through the woods to blow up the atomic reactor, a typical muddle-headed solution, to stop the invasion of hopping, flopping brains and spinal cords.

418
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,720
That was actually a more unusual monster than others.

419
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,640
There are those who believe that something mysterious lives in the south of England.

420
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,500
Wherever there are lake monsters, there are people just like this.

421
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,260
Locals, visitors, scientists and investigators yearning to become lake monsters.

422
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,240
There's one man who supports a lake monster.

423
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,340
I feel blessed.

424
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,900
So long.

425
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,640
I love the desert because my favorite monsters come from the desert.

426
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:31,220
Giant ants, giant spiders, giant men, giant scar-faced men.

427
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,620
Giant.

428
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,660
Scar-faced men, yes.

429
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,100
Scar-faced spider ant wolves.

430
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,300
Generation.

431
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,660
Yeah, the mummy was brought back.

432
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,180
And as Ivan Stang was saying the other night, he's sort of pathetic.

433
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,100
He's a pathetic character shuffling along with one arm tied up in bandages.

434
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,600
But just like George Romero's zombies, he ultimately gets you.

435
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,640
However palsied and slow his movements.

436
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,440
Because he persists.

437
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:22,920
And even though he bumbles and bumps into doors and knocks into things and moves slower than your 80-year-old grandfather with a walker,

438
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,700
he eventually gets to where he's going, which is where you are.

439
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,920
And pretty soon you are no more.

440
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,160
But he can...

441
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,960
Continues to shuffle along.

442
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,200
Shuffling and shuffling.

443
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Baby stamp.

444
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,680
But there's a moment of pathos.

445
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm just scared it begins with one little baby stamp.

446
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,600
In even the crummiest mummy movie where they spill the tanner leaf tea on the floor.

447
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,720
And then all of a sudden it's not shuffle anymore, is it, Mr. Mummy?

448
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:57,000
It's down on the floor trying to lick up the tanner juice with his disintegrating non-existent tongue.

449
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,860
And pretty soon it's just another bundle of old rags and cloth.

450
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,700
And bones while the bovine hero and heroine embrace.

451
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,960
And the music comes up.

452
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,760
It's a terrible fate.

453
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,220
I'm sure it's only subgeniuses who are keenly aware of that moment.

454
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,800
Greater than any tragedy in Greek plays or in Shakespeare.

455
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:28,820
Where the monster meets his doom just as the normals embrace and find sexual satisfaction.

456
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,160
Like, say, one example.

457
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:38,180
The beast from 20,000 Fathoms has been horribly wounded already by a GI with a bazooka.

458
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,600
Now they make it worse by firing a radioactive isotope into his bloody wound.

459
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,460
And he shrieks and he bolts out of the burning Coney Island roller coaster.

460
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,180
And trots around and around on the sand like a dog chasing his own tail.

461
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,760
And finally he rears up on his hind leg and gives one horrible shriek.

462
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,160
Just at the moment that the romance begins.

463
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,920
The music comes up.

464
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,680
And the girl and the studly young scientist embrace.

465
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,380
While the stern Air Force guy, Kenneth Tobey, looks on approvingly.

466
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,460
Why does this have to happen at the moment of the death of the Rhetosaurus?

467
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,220
And so stark and alone and a monad with no hope of reproduction or survival.

468
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:28,800
He nonetheless shrieks out his final rattling barbaric yawp before collapsing to the sand.

469
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,960
And over his huge hump.

470
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,140
And over his burnt dead carcass.

471
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,620
The words THE END appear in giant letters.

472
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,520
Also the Warner Brothers shield.

473
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,640
Yes, this is a moment to make every subgenius react in awe and pity.

474
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,660
Which Aristotle said was the appropriate use of the drama.

475
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,340
Now you can take that and put that in your pipe and smoke it Eugene O'Neil.

476
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,320
Or whoever is supposed to be a really trenchant observer.

477
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,660
Ah!

478
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,940
I should have known you were a monster.

479
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,880
My father was right.

480
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,620
None of you can be trusted.

481
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,580
You think you're better than everyone.

482
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,200
I honestly can't think of one redeeming quality that you have.

483
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,700
Although...

484
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
What?

485
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,040
I really like that top.

486
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,640
Francisco Garibaldi?

487
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,340
Yes.

488
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,320
How'd you know?

489
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,200
I just love his line.

490
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,400
Me too.

491
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,080
I got this one on sale.

492
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,320
Shut up.

493
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,900
I bet all the other monsters at school try and copy your look.

494
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,720
I bet the normie kids are sooo jealous of your style and sophistication.

495
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,340
It is exhausting.

496
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,680
Tell me about it.

497
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,800
It's really kind of a...

498
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,840
Burden.

499
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,340
Finally!

500
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,300
Someone who understands how hard it is.

501
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,640
Don't you two have something more important to talk about?

502
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,900
Yes, like where normies keep all their delicious candy.

503
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,280
Now let's go over that again.

504
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,500
So you heard some kind of show or something?

505
00:23:59,500 --> 00:23:59,860
No, no.

506
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,620
Monsters.

507
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,580
You've got to believe me!

508
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,020
Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds?

509
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,440
Don't you think you're...

510
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,640
I know you're thinking, well this guy has to be locked up.

511
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,080
This guy has to be locked up.

512
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,640
Well I didn't say that, mister, but you've got the general idea.

513
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,740
Don't you know there aren't any monsters in this day and age?

514
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,380
You've got to call out the National Guard.

515
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,420
This whole town is lost, I tell you.

516
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,020
We put a man on the moon.

517
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,500
Time for monsters is come and gone.

518
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,020
I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

519
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,100
You've got to believe me.

520
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,480
Well now this thing you say you thought you knew.

521
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,480


522
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,480


523
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,480


524
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,840
You saw.

525
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,120
He was ten feet tall and dripping slime and had tentacles and wings all over him.

526
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,300
Oh, that was Mobius Rex.

527
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,940
He's not here though.

528
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,020
I did it because I thought monsters were out to get us.

529
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,600
To take what was ours.

530
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,420
It's an easy mistake to make.

531
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,440
A lot of monsters, even me, thought all normies selfish and cruel.

532
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,420
Now I know that's not true.

533
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,620
We have the same hopes.

534
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,020
The same fears.

535
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,380
The same dreams.

536
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,780
The same drama.

537
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,460
The same dreams.

538
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,820
The same insecurities.

539
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,360
The same taste in designer fashion.

540
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,240
Please, come on in.

541
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,900
Have fun.

542
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Be yourself.

543
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Be unique.

544
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,660
Be a monster.

545
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,500
That's beautiful.

546
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,140
Hmm, okay, yeah.

547
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,260
All right, yeah.

548
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,460
All right, the party's over.

549
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,500
I always wanted to say that.

550
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,480
Arrest every monster in here.

551
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,740
Take them all away.

552
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,260
I understand.

553
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,160
Well, if you're arresting all the monsters,

554
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,460
you're going to have to kill them.

555
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:29,780
I'm going to kill them all.

556
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:29,780


557
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,500
You can talk to me.

558
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,260
I'm a monster.

559
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm a monster.

560
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,960
I'm a monster.

561
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
I'm a monster.

562
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,900
I'm a monster.

563
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,040
I'm a monster.

564
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm a monster.

565
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,460
I'm a monster.

566
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:42,600
I'm a monster.

567
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm a monster.

568
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,180
I'm a monster.

569
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,260
Well, how about it, Sheriff?

570
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,020
Are you going to arrest us all?

571
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,560
Well, as Sheriff, well, would you look at that?

572
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,520
Midnight on the dot.

573
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm off duty.

574
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,400
Hey, is that Cheesecake?

575
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,220
Now, really, I must go.

576
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,460
Oh, he's here.

577
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,460


578
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,460


579
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,980
No, I've taken a liking to you.

580
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,960
But you promised.

581
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,520
No, no, no. I'm going to put you up for membership.

582
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,060
But I'm not a monster.

583
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,840
Dunsage, you're the greatest monster of them all.

584
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,660
Oh, Mr. Club Secretary, I want to propose my friend here as a member of this August assembly.

585
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,220
But he's a... he's a hume.

586
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:34,100
Yes, but can we truly call this a monster club if we do not boast amongst our membership a single member of the human race?

587
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,600
Nonsense!

588
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,100
What can he do?

589
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,320
What can he do?

590
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,840
In the past 60 years, humes have exterminated over 150 million of their own kind.

591
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,480
No effort has been spared to reach this astronomical figure.

592
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,200
And...

593
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,900
And the methods that they have used must demand our unstinted admiration.

594
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,200
You know, humes began with certain very serious disadvantages.

595
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,760
But these they overcame with wonderful ingenuity.

596
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,960
Not having a fang or a claw, or even a whistle worth talking about,

597
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:19,980
they invented guns and tanks and bombs and airplanes and extermination camps and poison gas

598
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,180
and daggers and swords and bayonets and booby traps.

599
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,680
And atomic bombs and flying missiles, submarines, warships, aircraft carriers and motor cars.

600
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:40,940
They have even perfected a process whereby they can spread a lethal disease on any part of this planet.

601
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,040
Not to say anything about nuclear power.

602
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,120
Oh, during their short history, you know,

603
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,720
humes have subjected other humes to death by burning, hanging, decapitation,

604
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:02,780
strangulation, electrocution, shooting, drowning, crushing, wracking, disemboweling,

605
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,720
and other methods far, far too revolting for the delicate stomachs of this August Ascendant.

606
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,600
I never realized he was so talented.

607
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,700
We don't like to boast.

608
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,900
I second the proposal.

609
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,440
A member of such a...

610
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,660
talented race can only be a credit to any Monster Club!

611
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,800
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

612
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:41,920
Maestro, to celebrate the installation of a new member, may we hear our song?

613
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,360
We are monsters, we are proud

614
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,420
We are monsters, singing loud

615
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,160
I've tied schools of horror, can't get out of my bed

616
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,520
Everybody's talking, but it's not in my head

617
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,920
They say don't be different, be like them instead

618
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,600
They can't keep us down, cause we're monster hybrids

619
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,380
The clock is striking thirteen

620
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

621
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,900
It's time to cheer for your team

622
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

623
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,240
You are the coolest school by far

624
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,560
So don't be afraid of who you are

625
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,100
Cause tonight we're gonna leave our fears behind

626
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,640
We're in it together

627
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,700
Stepping out and we're letting our fears fly

628
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,360
Safety is forever

629
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,320
We got a few there

630
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,360
Get this nightmare

631
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,800
Don't stop rocking your rides

632
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,060
We are monsters

633
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,280
We are monsters, we are proud

634
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,600
We are monsters, say it loud

635
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,040
We are monsters, we are proud

636
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,440
We are monsters, say it loud

637
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,960
Perfectly imperfect and we do it our way

638
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,120
United, not divided, won't get cast away

639
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,400
Go running, how bad I just gotta say

640
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,860
We're drop dead gorgeous each and every day

641
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
The clock is striking thirteen

642
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,600
Whoa!

643
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,580
It's time to scream, be your team

644
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,120
Whoa!

645
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,460
We don't have to say goodbye

646
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Cause friends like these will never die

647
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,740
Cause tonight we're gonna leave our fears behind

648
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,240
We're in it together

649
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,300
Stepping out and we're letting our fears fly

650
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,140
Safety is forever

651
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,880
We got a few there

652
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,740
Whoa!

653
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,900
Get this nightmare

654
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,400
Don't stop rocking your rides

655
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,680
We are monsters

656
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,800
We are monsters, we are proud

657
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,140
We are monsters, say it loud

658
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,680
We are monsters, we are proud

659
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,120
We are monsters, say it loud

660
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,040
Cause tonight we're gonna leave our fears behind

661
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,800
We're in it together

662
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,040
Come on and say it loud

663
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,040


664
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,040


665
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,380
Never let our fear in stride

666
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,400
Safety is forever

667
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,700
We're dropping on fire

668
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,660
We're dropping on fire

669
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:27,660


670
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:27,660


671
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,280
And we're Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

672
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,480
Always get it awesome

673
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,120
Always get it awesome

674
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,600
Perfectly perfect and we do it our way

675
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,220
We're drop dead gorgeous each and every day

676
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,680
We're drop dead gorgeous each and every day

677
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,280
We are monsters.

678
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,860
We are monsters.

679
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,640
Hi.

680
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,260
Hi.

681
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,120
Hi.

682
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,340
Hi.

683
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,660
Hi.

684
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:56,900
Hi.

685
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,040
Hi.

686
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,680
Yes, friends, and this week's Hour of Slack,

687
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,140
the main reason this show has the theme of monsters and Monster High

688
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,480
is as an excuse we can hear those two bubblegum songs again.

689
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,800
That one, We Are Monster High,

690
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,500
was voiced by a young, young lady named Madison Beer.

691
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:30,160
And we've been playing clips from the various Monster High movies,

692
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,320
Ghouls Rule and 13 Wishes,

693
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,820
and also a bunch of homemade amateur YouTubes

694
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,160
based on that Mattel toy franchise.

695
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,780
Which is actually done by a subsidiary called Nerdcore.

696
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes, Monster High.

697
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,820
We've been on a Monster High.

698
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,760
We also had some clips there from the movie Monster Club.

699
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,500
That was Vincent Price explaining how humans are the monstriest monsters.

700
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,000
And a little bit from Monster Squad.

701
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,700
And I hope at the end to have time for that disco monster tune.

702
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,660
You know, I didn't even think about playing the casket bastards tonight.

703
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,600
It just now occurred to me.

704
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,600
We're just going to have to do another monster show.

705
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,320
I guess so.

706
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,920
So, yeah, it's a, what else?

707
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,360
Oh, Puzzling Evidence Show.

708
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Lots of old and new Puzzling Evidence Show.

709
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,620
With, and Hour of Slack, and X-Day recordings.

710
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,580
All with Dr. Hal Robbins and Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

711
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,580
who is calling in right now.

712
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,560
And yours truly.

713
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,720
And Princess Wee.

714
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,460
And Phineas and Arthur.

715
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:42,540
And Marco.

716
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,300
And amateur, as I said, amateur homemade shorts.

717
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,720
And listen to that.

718
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,260
Well, I can't hear anything.

719
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,000
That's a shame.

720
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,740
Friends, we just spent a little while, which I'm going to edit out,

721
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,100
trying to get Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the air.

722
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,340
But let's just say,

723
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,640
the conspiracy is fighting against us.

724
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,760
And there's nothing I, or you, can do.

725
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,620
We actually had people donating,

726
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,280
trying to donate money to help buy Dave a phone.

727
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,060
But that's not what is needed.

728
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,620
And we don't need a new station.

729
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,760
It's just that the station needs a new brain.

730
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,780
And we'll get to that later.

731
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
But this time, not a criminal brain.

732
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,160
Not an evil brain.

733
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,640
Our assistant messed up so badly the other day.

734
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,360
And, well, we'll play Dave's song, Monster Club, later.

735
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,580
No relation to the movie Monster Club.

736
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,700
Or Monster High.

737
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,660
Or the great music of Bernard Herrmann.

738
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,620
Heard in the background.

739
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,320
I think.

740
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,680
I think that's what that is.

741
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,760
Friends,

742
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,300
friends,

743
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,140
yes,

744
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,720
monsters,

745
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,180
and subgeniuses,

746
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,220
and monster stations,

747
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,700
and freaky flaws.

748
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,580
Yeah, Princess, we and I got,

749
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
don't worry,

750
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,240
the hour slack won't be dedicated

751
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,980
to a children's Mattel toy franchise forever.

752
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,820
But we have found the visual puns to be clever.

753
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,960
And they have a very strange, subversive nature.

754
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,280
And not only that,

755
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,840
not just Monster High, but there's also several rip-offs of that, or knock-offs, you might say.

756
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,620
Bratzillas and what was the other one we saw?

757
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,460
Oh, the aliens.

758
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,440
You could have a series of four little sexy alien girls, like Alien High.

759
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:56,820
Yes.

760
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,220
I mean, it wasn't called that.

761
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,620
Ailey Lectric.

762
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,940
Ailey Lectric is the one that, yeah, you should see what she does when she gets turned on.

763
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,000
She's changing, glows all over.

764
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,200
And has a light display like a cuttlefish in heat.

765
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,540
But more glittery.

766
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,460
But yeah, as I was saying, there are no fat Monster High girls.

767
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,300
No.

768
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,320
And that may be because

769
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,740
all their bodies have to be made the same way for the clothes to fit

770
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,740
over there in China before they're shipped to Walmarts in America.

771
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,380
But, um,

772
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,180
but given that,

773
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,740
the Monster High stuff has some subversive elements to it.

774
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:45,220
There's a lot of anti-bullying messages that are kind of built in with the conflict between

775
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,700
the normies and the monsters, although mostly the monsters just pick on each other.

776
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,980
But there are a lot of correspondences with the Church of the Subgenius.

777
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,860
For instance, in where we say exploit your abnormality potential, in Monster Hunter jargon,

778
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,800
it's called cultivate your...

779
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Freaky flaws.

780
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:06,940
Yeah.

781
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,660
All the monster teens.

782
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,620
All the monster teens have their own individual freaky flaws, and they're encouraged to cultivate those.

783
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,840
In fact, what was the quote from one of them?

784
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,780
Love your freaky flaws.

785
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,860
Celebrate your imperfections.

786
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,600
They're what give us our individuality and make us perfectly imperfect the way we are.

787
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,660
And then it said, join the tween esteem movement.

788
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,120
And stop bullying.

789
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:35,780
Right.

790
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,200
Yeah.

791
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,200
We stop hate.

792
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,540
We stop hate.

793
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,640
Dot com.

794
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,240
Now, that was the only...

795
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,540
We only saw one of the webisodes that had...

796
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:50,120
Webisodes that had that overt message, and we stop hate dot com, which made me want to

797
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,260
make up a new Monster High Club name for myself, Reverend Westo Fate.

798
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,480
Because that's what it looks like when you see we stop hate all in one word.

799
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,280
So it's all about tolerance and diversity among monster types.

800
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:07,720
Yeah.

801
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,280
So, no one has been dwelling on the fact that these are still monsters.

802
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,400
In fact, most of them are the immortal supernatural kind that feed on human blood.

803
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,540
But you never see any of that in the cartoons.

804
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,780
So yeah, don't bully other monsters.

805
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,400
See, it's just like Church of the Subgenius.

806
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,520
It's the pink mainstream version of the Church of the Subgenius for slightly oddball girls

807
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,800
ages 10 to 14.

808
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,320
Yeah.

809
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:49,520
And as such, it's making vast hordes of gold for nerdcore and garbage pail kids.

810
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,140
No, no.

811
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,320
Garbage pail kids is what they owe an explanation to, friends.

812
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:00,280
Because those funny names they have is all like the garbage pail kids, Diven, Ivan, and

813
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,140
so forth.

814
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,240
I have that card at home.

815
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,220
Thanks, Susie.

816
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,360
Princess Wee's favorite monster...

817
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:13,960
Monster High character is Laguna Blue, daughter of the sea monster, who actually looks kind

818
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,020
of like Princess Wee, although she has an Australian accent.

819
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,520
What was the name?

820
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,880
We tried to make up our own name, Peep Peep Longstalking, but they didn't take that, and

821
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,460
we couldn't use Audrey Tistic.

822
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,260
But Princess Wee and I are going to try to sign on as Al and Alice Simers.

823
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,480
Grandparents of Gooley.

824
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,760
Some other names we came up...

825
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,160
And these are more like instances of monsterhood in real life, unfortunate ones.

826
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,880
I could also take the name Vida Ligo.

827
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,240
I have a friend who could be Bernie Victim.

828
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,440
Another friend who could be Dora Fism.

829
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,740
Sparky Parkinson's.

830
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,660
And then there's Monster Hunter, Hunter High.

831
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,240
Monster Hunter.

832
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,160
Which I knew I was a nerd when the name Greta Jaggi suddenly entered my head.

833
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:18,080
But really, what if it was like a high school of the monsters from the video game Monster

834
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,920
Hunter, only they're the monsters, so they're the Monster Hunter Hunters.

835
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,340
She would call it Monster Hunter, Hunter High, with Leila Giacchris and Gigi Knox and Duran

836
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,900
Duranboros and Barry Oth and so forth.

837
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,700
Yeah.

838
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,100
Very, very strange.

839
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,560
Princess Wee is in the other room, apparently trying to talk Dave down or explain to him

840
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,660
what's going on here.

841
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,640
Another thing we noticed that I would...

842
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,920
That kind of cheered me up.

843
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,020
YouTube is full of amateur videos made by mostly young girls.

844
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,920
Using Monster High dolls.

845
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,720
Some of them are stop motion and some are just kind of puppetry and some are a combination.

846
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,300
But it's obvious that these girls are going to the trouble of writing scripts and setting

847
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,200
up each shot and doing some pretty tricky voice acting and even sound effects.

848
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,620
We heard a little bit of that earlier.

849
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,720
And a lot of these amateur Monster High shorts had upwards of one million views.

850
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,840
So, movie makers.

851
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:35,900


852
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:35,900


853
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,080
This is my favorite movie of all time.

854
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,160
I've been making it since I was a kid.

855
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,260
It's something that was taken by teenagers and even little kids has come a long way since

856
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,160
I was entering 8mm shorts in the Kodak Teenage Movie Awards in the 60s.

857
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:54,240
Our favorite video featured Frankie Stein encountering Ken from the Barbie series with

858
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,900
amnesia after a car wreck.

859
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,660
Frankie Stein takes the stupid Normie to school and he falls insanely in love with her.

860
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,900
And she's politely fending off his advances with her.

861
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:05,900


862
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:05,900


863
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:05,900


864
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:05,900


865
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:05,900


866
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:05,900


867
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,540
when a very nasty pink Barbie shows up looking for Ken and freaks out.

868
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,480
Can't believe Ken's hanging out with monster kids and trying to romance them.

869
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,300
And we also found examples of Monster High cosplay,

870
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,080
and then we found Monster High porn or hentai.

871
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,300
So as you can see, we don't just eat that children's franchise.

872
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,040
We eat the hell out of it.

873
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,880
And we'll probably move on.

874
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,100
We may move on to Barbie.

875
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:41,580
I was shocked to discover that there's a Barbie series on the web

876
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,420
called Life in the Dreamhouse that, even though it's sponsored by Mattel,

877
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,720
is a complete snarky satire on the sheer pinkness of the Barbie universe.

878
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,820
And by that, I mean pinkness both ways, including the color.

879
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,680
I couldn't believe it.

880
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,160
Very, very weird.

881
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,700
Barbie is depicted as being...

882
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,180
Oblivious, stupid, thoughtless, and infinitely rich.

883
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,040
And Ken is depicted as the densest, stupidest pink boy that can't do anything right.

884
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,260
Truly mind-blowing.

885
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,000
And, uh...

886
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,580
Yeah, it was a very, very strange thing.

887
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,360
So, well, what's happening with poor old lonesome cowboy Dave?

888
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,180
He's just lonesome as heck, isn't he?

889
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:26,640
Yates.

890
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,380
Anyway, I'm going to play...

891
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
Monster Club.

892
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,280
Very unsuccessful.

893
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,780
By lonesome cowboy.

894
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,020
Boy, Dave.

895
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,440
And those of you who are not prepared or aware must take the golden vow now.

896
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,020
You will fight for something holy, whatever that might be.

897
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,920
Well, I can't agree with Riverd Stang that the world is a monster club.

898
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:23,320
I don't know who Recommended Winners will be condemned to a cured undying of those that were infected with that areль Theseunity

899
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,580
The rules of the j Judaize

900
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:24,580


901
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:24,580


902
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:24,660
I can't really probably hit this roof.

903
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,600
By the way, I thought about doing more in my life than water retention.

904
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,520
People thought I would go surging in my � принципе

905
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,700
But, I mean I do see that as a winning trait!

906
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,100
I think about the obrigado thinking

907
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,620
But then, you know, all have lost energy.

908
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:34,860
So, can I just fond of those drugs?

909
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:34,860


910
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:34,860


911
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm gonna be alright

912
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,740
You're crazy

913
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,760
I called 911

914
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,680
Had some cereal and I cried

915
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,060
This world is a monster club

916
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,160
And you must beware

917
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,460
There's plenty of crazy things

918
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,160
Terror and normalcy

919
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,540
Baby

920
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,460
I thought I saw a mummy

921
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,260
Crawling on my tummy and inside

922
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,300
You're crazy

923
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,620
It might be in my head

924
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,320
But baby

925
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,060
I don't wanna wind up dead

926
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,500
Baby

927
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,320
I swear I saw the werewolf

928
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,820
Drinking from my toilet last night

929
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,480
Baby

930
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,780
You're crazy

931
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,440
I know I saw it baby

932
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,280
Hold my head I'm gonna be alright

933
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,360
This world is a monster club

934
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,240
And you must beware

935
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,840
There's plenty of evil things

936
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,860
Terror and normalcy

937
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,600
Baby

938
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,820
I thought I saw a mummy

939
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,140
Crawling on my tummy and inside

940
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,720
You're crazy

941
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,300
This world is a monster club

942
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,360
And you must beware

943
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,540
There's plenty of crazy things

944
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:18,920
Terror and normalcy

945
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,080
Baby

946
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,180
I saw a mummy

947
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,760
Crawling on my tummy and inside

948
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,240
You're crazy

949
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,460
There's plenty of evil things

950
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,280
Terror and normalcy

951
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,880
Baby

952
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:51,260
I just realized I better not play that Phineas and Arco mix with the George Carlin stuff

953
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,440
because it might have naughty, naughty things in it.

954
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,340
So I'm going to mention that you're listening to the Hour of Slack

955
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,460
from the Church of the Subgenius.

956
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:11,280
And if you want to know more about that, you can check out subgenius.com.

957
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:18,820
I did want to play the funky old Monster Squad theme from back in the day.

958
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,340
It's a movie from the 80s that was fun.

959
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,540
It was little kids who were fighting monsters, but really the monsters were their friends.

960
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,040
And let's see.

961
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,120
That would be cut.

962
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,780
Number 34.

963
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,560
And here.

964
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,600
We're the Monster Squad.

965
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,300
Monster Squad.

966
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,860
We're back.

967
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,300
We're back.

968
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,940
Gotta get up.

969
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,880
Gotta get up.

970
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,160
We gotta work to do.

971
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,260
Work to do.

972
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,860
Every hundred years in the darkest night, the forces of evil come out to fight.

973
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,080
The amulets, they must destroy or spend forever in the dark.

974
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,760
Who can stop that deadly might?

975
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,020
Who will stand up for the right?

976
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,400
From the mouth of babes comes dynamite.

977
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,480
The Monster Squad's gonna groove tonight.

978
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,980
First came Dracula, now the Wolf Man too.

979
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,140
The Muppet and the Gull are swimming in the pool.

980
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,440
We need silver bullets, we need wooden sticks.

981
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,740
Normal stuff won't stop them cause they live on hate.

982
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,000
Speak some magic words from a virgin's lips.

983
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,280
Baby, that'll shake them, make them slip and trip.

984
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,560
There's no turning back, gotta fight the fight.

985
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,780
Yeah, the Monster Squad's gonna jam tonight.

986
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,320
Monster Squad.

987
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,320


988
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,320


989
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,500
We're the Monster Squad.

990
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,880
And the forces of evil.

991
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,520
Better run and hide.

992
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,800
Monster Squad.

993
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,680
We're the Monster Squad.

994
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,980
And the forces of evil.

995
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,720
Best beware of the Monster Squad.

996
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,960
Monster Squad.

997
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,440
Monster Squad.

998
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,660
Let's go over that again.

999
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,280
You say you saw some sort of monster.

1000
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,240
You know cryomorphology.

1001
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:07,000
Cryomorphology is the part of the geomorphology pertaining to the various processes and products of cold climates.

1002
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:08,660
Captain.

1003
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,520
There's one now.

1004
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,040
Captain.

1005
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
We are in the ear canal.

1006
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,600
Everybody be quiet.

1007
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,340
You can hear us.

1008
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,980
Funny little itching thing in the ear, Captain.

1009
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,920
I can't make it.

1010
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,600
What about the other ear?

1011
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,100
It shrivels with antennas.

1012
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,940
We put creatures in our bodies.

1013
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,880
Well, you know, it was just a show.

1014
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,540
They're show creatures, yes.

1015
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,340
Captain, it was Stag.

1016
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,180
He put the creatures in our ears.

1017
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,880
Don't make us ruin this show.

1018
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,120
Oh, no.

1019
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,820
Really?

1020
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,420
Well.

1021
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,340
That's kind of neat.

1022
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,020
Let's see what we can do.

1023
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,480
Let's work it.

1024
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,940
I'm going to pull the head of one of these little creatures out here and it will talk to us.

1025
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,260
Okay, talk to us, little creature.

1026
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,480
Get a little creature shy.

1027
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:54,900
There's one.

1028
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,020
Get it.

1029
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:56,380
Squash it.

1030
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,780
Aren't you supposed to say, help me, help me?

1031
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:57,880
Do it.

1032
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,720
It's back in Tokyo.

1033
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,240
Yeah.

1034
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,420
And that was true for you, Billy Bob, growing up?

1035
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,980
It was sort of a combo of stones and monkeys and Buck Owens?

1036
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:24,200
I subscribed to a magazine called Famous Monsters of Filmland, which the publisher was a guy named Forrest J. Ackerman who passed away recently.

1037
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,880
Hmm.

1038
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,360
Do you remember what you were listening to musically when you were a kid?

1039
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,960
They had a contest where you could build your own model.

1040
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:52,380
And it could be like a King Kong or it could be anything from something that you created yourself to like one of the monsters that was actually in the, well, you know, in some of the magazines.

1041
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,260
Like it could be Frankenstein all the way to Phantom of the Opera.

1042
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,860
And they made these plastic monsters.

1043
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,580
They made these plastic models in those days that you could buy and put together.

1044
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,960
But this was like a thing you could create your own world of it.

1045
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,420
You know, build telephone poles, make the railroad tracks and everything.

1046
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,640
And I actually did enter it once.

1047
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,540
I didn't win anything.

1048
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,160
But I gave it a shot.

1049
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,700
But it was pretty, it was a big deal for us kids in those days.

1050
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,860
I'm, and what, and where's the music?

1051
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:27,860


1052
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:27,860


1053
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,360
Where's the music fit into that?

1054
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,180
Music?

1055
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,440
No, it was a monster magazine.

1056
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,240
Right, right.

1057
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,620
But I'm, but...

1058
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:48,080
It manifests itself in the subliminal reality areas of the frontal lobes of the tape recorder and causes the person listening to the tape recorder to garner intense satisfaction from the commercial inanity on the nearby AM radio.

1059
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,560
These guys going on and on about this.

1060
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,480
TV commercials, the box in the back of Reader's Digest.

1061
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,900
Where do I send my money?

1062
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,740
To KPFA 94.1.

1063
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,160
Right here at 9.2.

1064
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,800
I'm going to...

1065
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,480
They're part of the conspiracy, you mean?

1066
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,340
No, no, this show is part of the conspiracy.

1067
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,940
KPFA fights the conspiracy.

1068
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,020
The fissions by which these brain removals are effected are too adroit to be given the name surgery.

1069
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:19,100
But nonetheless, the brain itself, complete, intact and living, is removed as part of the initial process.

1070
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,240
Yeah, that's, you're right.

1071
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,960
By Frankenstein, when he created his immortal being,

1072
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,440
incorporates a different view of what the brain actually comprises than...

1073
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,280
It's terrible.

1074
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,180
Pioneer.

1075
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,320
I started with my left pinky toe.

1076
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:39,980
The brain itself is not only a central ganglion, the part we think of as the brain, but the...

1077
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,240
Ganglion?

1078
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,220
...themselves in their neural net that's spread throughout the body.

1079
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:52,300
It actually exists in the remote regions of the limbs where the nerves stretch.

1080
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,780
Where?

1081
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,600
Classically, these organs are severed.

1082
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,540
Sure, brain stretching.

1083
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:06,840
...is allowed to protrude of each of the major nerves to attach electrodes later in the process.

1084
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,720
How can this not be? Oh.

1085
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:19,180
In the meantime, we feed our brainy friend with a solution of ash which floats in the serum in which the brain itself is stabilized.

1086
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,760
As most people know, the tissue of a brain is very...

1087
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,200
...very light and frothy, almost like a meringue.

1088
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,400
And this puffy mass can easily be crushed or damaged.

1089
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,820
The greatest care must be employed to lower the brain into the solution.

1090
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,800
And there he goes.

1091
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,060
And see, soon he's swimming about in his new home.

1092
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,880
We've also left him one eye to peer about.

1093
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,520
There it is.

1094
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,280
Don't be shy.

1095
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,240
There it is.

1096
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,180
And he can look and see his new world of the laboratory.

1097
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,680
So, oh, just a moment.

1098
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,960
I've got a call here.

1099
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,740
Yes.

1100
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,600
Could you take that, please?

1101
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,960
I've got a group here.

1102
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,180
Thank you very much.

1103
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,100
...consequently, they want to get in on the action.

1104
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,280
It's only human nature.

1105
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,360
I think we had to hang up on them.

1106
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,840
That's very rude.

1107
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,340
But, at any rate, back to our tour.

1108
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,420
And we're about to insert the brain now into the freshly prepared monster.

1109
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,260
Notice how scoured out the interior of the cranium is.

1110
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,940
That's because it has just been...

1111
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,080
...just been prepared to receive the brain.

1112
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,500
And here is one of Frankenstein's tricks.

1113
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,440
The graft node on the end of the major nerve group, starting with the olfactory nerve,

1114
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:42,220
the optic, the oculomotor here, the trochlear and trigeminal nerve here, the abducans, the

1115
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,020
spinal accessory, and the hypoglossal nerve.

1116
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:52,120
The foramen magnum accepts the stub of the spinal cord nerve.

1117
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,220
The spinal cord nerve is a mass.

1118
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,300
This is abnormal, but hey, it's a monster.

1119
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,460
That is a massive spinal cord.

1120
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,100
It's a monster.

1121
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,960
A lot of things are disproportionate.

1122
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,780
You know, that's why it's necessary for some scientists to make monsters.

1123
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,840
Because there's no time to perfect the, you know, every little cosmetic detail.

1124
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,400
That is not important for science.

1125
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,480
Science is immune to these foibles and fads.

1126
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,680
Not tricked and frounced.

1127
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,100
But the actual bare bones.

1128
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,400
The bones' glimmering gleam of truly revealed natural philosophy.

1129
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,420
Now, don't bother me.

1130
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,020
Never broken a bone.

1131
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,680
So here, you see, we add the blood serum.

1132
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,300
It must be kept at a constant flow and heated by our little electric motor to refresh the

1133
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,600
tissues of the brain.

1134
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:45,640
Because in the internal tissues, the oxygen exchange takes place, which, of course, underlies

1135
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,180
the process, electrical in nature, of cognition.

1136
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:57,600
The thought itself occurring in this perfused brain occurs as electrical flashes, as we

1137
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,760
can see on the monitor.

1138
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:05,880
Each flash represents the synapse, the neuron here, the closing, the gap.

1139
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,880
That spark is the actual spark of human consciousness.

1140
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:15,840
And, of course, we can alter these sparks at will by this feedback interrupter.

1141
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:16,720
See?

1142
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,040
Yes.

1143
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,920
You could say this brain was experiencing, well, something that most of us would rather

1144
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,720
not experience.

1145
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,940
Brain wave entrainment?

1146
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,840
We're not trying to push any particular philosophy here.

1147
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,940
This is simply a scientific demonstration.

1148
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,720
Now, we're starting the monster now.

1149
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,220
We're going to give him a few electric jolts.

1150
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,820
Zap that sucker.

1151
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:45,060
Yeah, well, you know, when you zap a monster, you have to be very methodical about it.

1152
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,880
Lower the cosmic diffusion.

1153
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,000
Oh, God, that's the thing.

1154
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000


1155
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000


1156
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000


1157
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,220
Do you know how much a cosmic diffuser can do?

1158
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:48,220


1159
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:48,280
The cosmic diffusers are just great.

1160
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,280


1161
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:48,800
They're a little bit different.

1162
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:48,800


1163
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,200
The cosmic diffuser used to be they had to do it in a rainstorm.

1164
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,400
And only such a rainstorm, thunderstorm, is cutting out.

1165
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,060
And there he did it.

1166
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,460
He broke the left end of the cosmic diffuser.

1167
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,260
Oh, God.

1168
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,340
So should I climb up and fix it?

1169
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,480
That's all right.

1170
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,420
Fritz and Igor are up there.

1171
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,740
They are clumsy stumble bums.

1172
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:13,100
Fortunately, we inherited an infinite supply of this high-tech lab equipment from Kenneth Strickfaden.

1173
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,960
And the crowd goes crazy today.

1174
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,460
They are just waiting to see the monster begin.

1175
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,840
So the Monster Olympics can start.

1176
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:26,660
And at the peak of the season, it looks like it's time to go out in this beautiful weather,

1177
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:32,780
enjoy some car crashes and back-slapping good bonhomie and fellowship, and start to play ball.

1178
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:39,200
Oh, and I'd like to say that this entire event is brought to you by Corinthian Column Cigarettes.

1179
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,700
Bring some of the grandeur of ancient Rome into your own drab life and light up a Corinthian Column,

1180
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,540
the only cigarette with marble flutes.

1181
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,660
And now back to center field where the giant demolition derby is going on.

1182
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:57,900
Broken glass, screams in the crowd, and the blowing of those plastic horns.

1183
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,020
There we go, another complete dinette set pulverized.

1184
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,840
And damaged.

1185
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,880
Donated by Montgomery Flea Market.

1186
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,580
It's just like a mini mall.

1187
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,040
They're winding up.

1188
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,840
Now we're ready to see that pitch.

1189
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,720
He seems to have something on his mind.

1190
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,460
I'm sure we're going to...

1191
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,080
Oh, there it goes!

1192
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,680
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that was a pop fly.

1193
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,700
See, someone let fly with a bottle of pop.

1194
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,260
Yes, they're collecting dues, apparently, for the widows and orphans.

1195
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,780
There's people standing up right now, folks.

1196
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,940
It's a difficult scene.

1197
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,900
In a moment, we'll tell you the results as they bring out the laundry on the field

1198
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,640
and prepare for the skid mark test.

1199
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,720
So...

1200
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,380
I'll just run this tape here.

1201
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,140
It was just as if I was there 20 years ago.

1202
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,380
This stuff is incredible.

1203
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,540
I was at a ball game or something.

1204
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,380
They were breaking a lot of stuff.

1205
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,240
We'll be right back.

1206
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:02,240


1207
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:02,700
We'll be right back.

1208
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:02,760


1209
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:02,760


1210
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:02,760


1211
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:02,760


1212
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,100
We'll be right back.

1213
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:53,720
We'll be right back.
