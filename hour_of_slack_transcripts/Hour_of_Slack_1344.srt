1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
Like to drop by the fantastic bag?

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,180
Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,080
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag!

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,960
Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack!

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,640
La la la, la la la!

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,800
La la la, Hour of Slack!

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,420
Slack!

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,940
It's great, faster than any other leading cleanser!

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,480
As well as leading cleansers!

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,280
As well as...

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,960
Bob!

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,580
But let's leave things of this world behind,

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,700
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,400
And so, once again, we find this deep-rooted contradiction within the Word of God.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,320
Who He Himself has said,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,820
I am everything, but yet everything is me.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,380
And by this very selfsame contradiction,

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,540
we know that we do have some measure of free will.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,340
Yes, free choice.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,580
And it's up to us to decide whether we're going to sin in the ways that God wants us to,

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,020
or if we're going to sin against God.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,540
But yet, since He is everything and everything is Him, or her, it, or everything,

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,280
one could say, well, everything is everything, so a sin might as well be a good deed.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,400
Helping a little old lady across the street,

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,080
might be a sin if everything is everything.

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Now, this is an acid-head sort of mode of thinking,

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,380
and I don't think anybody wants to go along with such a vague and, say the least, fluid philosophy.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,700
Because we have to have some sort of standard reference for goodness or evilness.

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,500
We've got to zero our meter on something.

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,640
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,620
Let there be slack.

32
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,100
Oh, that's crazy talk.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,500
I think Bob is just the guy with the pipe.

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,180
Friendship!

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,640
Are we controlled by secret forces?

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,260
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,840
Do people think you're strange?

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,160
Do you?

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,360
Then you may be on the right track.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,420
Give me slack, or give me food,

41
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,660
or kill me.

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,360
Give me slack, or give me food,

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,660
or kill me.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Kill me.

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,920
Kill me.

46
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,500
Kill me.

47
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,620
Kill me.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,200
It's time to be manipulated.

49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,560
Brother, I want to tell you something.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers,

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,660
dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,440
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,900
This world is hungry for reality.

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
They've had enough of Hollywood.

55
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,620
They've had enough of Nashville.

56
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,700
They've had enough of show business.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,220
They're hungry for the mighty power of the man that walked the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago

58
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,420
and raised the dead and cast out devils and healed the sick.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,440
And I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ is still raising the dead.

60
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,120
Oh, he's back from the dead.

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,220
That's right.

62
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,080
His grinning skull floats ever in front of your eyes.

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,440
And Jesus brought him back, and he's lusting for the flesh of the living.

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,080
And these things are coming and coming speedily.

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,200
We are near the very, very end of the church age,

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,960
and of course the Gentile time has already come to a close.

67
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,500
For the archaeologists.

68
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,580
Every day is a hair day.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,760
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name.

70
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,900
I got just what I wanted from everybody here today.

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,880
And everybody said,

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,600
NAMIET.

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560
NAMIET.

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,820
Now I reason because here is inflicted unbelief.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,760
NAMIET.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,620
Unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister.

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,340
Right now, man.

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,880
It's autistic.

79
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,400
It's satisfaction.

80
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,880
Secure my weapon, corporal.

81
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,560
Again?

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,360
Again.

83
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,620
Big day.

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,680
Did you get my present?

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,580
I punched a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer.

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:28,960
Hm.

87
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:37,360
The world owes me a living, and I want my money back in one lump sum right now!

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,640
That's the way you ought to wake up.

89
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,900
Friends, it wasn't your parents' fault.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,540
They were just as screwy as you.

91
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,520
It was the conspiracy's fault.

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,480
It really was.

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,300
Money, money, money, money!

94
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,540
Money, money, money, money, money!

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,420
Money, money, money, money, money!

96
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,100
Money, money, money, money, money!

97
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,060
Friends, the conspiracy has hogged fascism long enough.

98
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,340
We're taking fascism back!

99
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,020
For the people, man!

100
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,060
Fascism for the people!

101
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,360
Fascism for the individual!

102
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,340
It's what we call,

103
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,100
Patriopsychotic Anarchomaterialism.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,940
Money, money, money, money, money!

105
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,620
Money, money, money, money, money!

106
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,760
Money, money, money, money, money!

107
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,480
Money, money, money, money, money!

108
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,480


109
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,500
Some people realize that it's the best thing you can do.

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,500


111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,500


112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,500


113
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,500


114
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,640
Now I just want you to hang on one minute.

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,360
I want you to hang on one minute, please.

116
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,580
And I want you to hear something.

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,620
And I want you to hear it.

118
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,080
Good.

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,380
I just want to tell you people something.

120
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,840
There's some good people out here.

121
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,740
And you are insulting their intelligence.

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,420
And if you come to this country at our invitation,

123
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,020
and we have to charge you through no choice of our own,

124
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:24,920
right?

125
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,600
If you don't want to pay it, don't.

126
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,460
I've come.

127
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,600
I wanted to be firmly established

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,400
that any person that feels that strongly

129
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,460
has the right to come to this microphone and speak.

130
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,080
I cannot help the system that is here.

131
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,580
It is my job to entertain you.

132
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,600
The fact that there is an exchange from this stage

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,060
whatever it costs has to go out there in the form of music

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,240
is the way that the world is made up.

135
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,440
I cannot help it.

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,300
I have no control over that.

137
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,100
I can't even walk the street

138
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
because they never know who in the world they're going to be.

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,420
you call the police

140
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,840
Nothing good continues

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:08:07,260
But people talk about how hard their body can be

142
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,120
I can't offer up my life

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,200
What is the problem?

144
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,580
No comment on it.

145
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:10,580


146
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,840
You'll forget about them and you'll marry some blonde, dull, non-entity and bear a brood

147
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,500
of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are and

148
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,820
can't wait for you to die or leave so they can kill you or something while you sit there

149
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,720
exhausted, sweating blood, staring at the TV, pondering your incredible degree of debt,

150
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,580
drinking yourself into a stupor and going, what the hell happened?

151
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:19,160
I know money is a root of all evil, too funny thanks to some people.

152
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,660
It'll be a nickel, but I can't use that money, but it can drop some people out of their lives.

153
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,260
We're all just gonna have to, like, the police force, the lawyers, all the people that are

154
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,820
running the whole thing, these hippies with long hair are just gonna have to be killed.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,980
They're gonna have to braid their hair up, put on a hat, man, and become policemen, you

156
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,840
know, become lawyers, become doctors, you know.

157
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,140
But then we're the same as everybody else.

158
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,720
No, I mean, but with the idea.

159
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,280
I mean, with the idea that you want to change the system.

160
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,020
Oh, you can't defeat the system from within the system because then you're just part of it.

161
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,280
My dear, could you imagine?

162
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,700
I mean, Walt Disney is the...

163
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,180
Living in the ghetto, you know, a kid three years old using Mighty Mouse or Mickey Mouse,

164
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,440
whoever it was, for an idol, right?

165
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,120
You can't go kid...

166
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,820
Running across the room for a...

167
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,820


168
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Great rap singing was Mighty Mouse?

169
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,140
We can't...

170
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,260
Are you ready?

171
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,000
We can camera all of Walt Disney.

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,380
Well, I can bring almost all of it, or half of it.

173
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,800
Half of it.

174
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,480
Watch music for a short time.

175
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


176
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


177
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


178
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


179
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


180
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


181
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,480


182
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,940
All right.

183
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,620
Have a lot of egy.

184
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,380
Huh?

185
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,500
Everybody.

186
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,960
Got to have it.

187
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,780
I really need it.

188
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,300
Everybody.

189
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,220
How many things have I heard you say?

190
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,040
Come on...

191
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,700
Everybody.

192
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,760
Got to have it.

193
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,720
Some people really need it.

194
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,040
Everybody.

195
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,020
Lay down, lay down, lay down

196
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,700
I want to lay down

197
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,820
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let me run

198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,340
This is Pennywise. Joan, you're next.

199
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,100
This is Sue.

200
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,700
Hi Sue, how can I help?

201
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,380
Jim, I really have a problem with impulse buying.

202
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,300
I never have money left for anything.

203
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,520
Oh, boy.

204
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,480
Jim, I really have a buying impulse problem.

205
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,980
Well, buying, buying, anything, anything, anything.

206
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,900
Now wait a minute.

207
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,600
Go ahead and use some of that money to bring some happiness.

208
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,060
Jim, I really have a problem.

209
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,620
Jim, I never have money left for impulse buying.

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,200
A lot of people have that problem.

211
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,340
Take cash.

212
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,360
Good idea.

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,740
I feel we really need to buy right away.

214
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,680
After all, money is only paper and metal until you put it to use.

215
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,020
I never have money left.

216
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,560
But you've already decided to buy.

217
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,680
Impulse, impulse.

218
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,400
I really think it'll help.

219
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,240
Good idea.

220
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, thanks.

221
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,460
Okay, let's go to line...

222
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,740
Line four, this is Pennywise.

223
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm Jim Phillips and your name is...

224
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:40,860
Bob.

225
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,460
Hi, Bob.

226
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,420
What can I do for you?

227
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,920
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

228
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,620
Oh, this is Pennywise.

229
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,240
Line six, you're on.

230
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,400
And your name is...

231
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,620
Bob.

232
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,540
Caller number five, you're on the air with Pennywise.

233
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,420
I'm Jim Phillips.

234
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,980
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

235
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,520
Oh, let's go to line seven on Pennywise.

236
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,840
Hi, I'm Jim Phillips.

237
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,780
Bob, commercials.

238
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,620
Oh, oh.

239
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,180
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

240
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,600
Oh, well, listen.

241
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,160
I think your first responsibility is to yourself and your family.

242
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,720
The what?

243
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,620
Thanks for the call.

244
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,360
Hello.

245
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,220
You're on Pennywise with Jim Phillips and you are...

246
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,340
Bob.

247
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,800
Okay, let's go to line four.

248
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,780
This is Pennywise.

249
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,720
I'm Jim Phillips and your name is...

250
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,000
Bob.

251
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,280
Oh.

252
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,380
Commercials.

253
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,880
Hello, caller.

254
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,380
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

255
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh, and your name is...

256
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,220
Bob.

257
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,580
Bob.

258
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,240
Bob.

259
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,840
Hi, Bob.

260
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,820
What can I do for you?

261
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,560
The what?

262
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:28,960
Go ahead.

263
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,460
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

264
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,780
Oh, you sound frustrated.

265
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,480
It's because I am.

266
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
Well, I get you.

267
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,120
I, for example, love to build things with scrap lumber.

268
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,820
The what?

269
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,320
All right.

270
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,300
Thanks for the call, Carl.

271
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,680
Bob.

272
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,120
Oh, this is Pennywise.

273
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,220
Line six.

274
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,740
You're on.

275
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,160
Bob.

276
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,660
Yeah, Barb.

277
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,060
Bob.

278
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,580
Go ahead.

279
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Claims made in commercials.

280
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,280
Oh.

281
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,340
I get confused.

282
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,620
Why?

283
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,940
I get commercials confused.

284
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,980
Like magic.

285
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,820
The what?

286
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,560
Well, many religious people follow the biblical plan of tithing.

287
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,060
You may want to visit with your clergy about it, but of course...

288
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,380
The what?

289
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,760
The what?

290
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,500
Commercials.

291
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,020
Commercials.

292
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,840
I get confused by all the claims...

293
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
And your name is...

294
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,020
Bob.

295
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
Oh, that's a tough one.

296
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,020
A lot of people have that problem.

297
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,660
The what?

298
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,500
Truth in advertising.

299
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,920
I get confused.

300
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,160
Advertising, though, can be a really good source of information because of the truth in advertising

301
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,600
policy.

302
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,340
The what?

303
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,220
Because of the truth in advertising policy.

304
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:16,920
The what?

305
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,760
Truth in advertising.

306
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,640
The what?

307
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,540
Truth in advertising.

308
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,280
Truth in advertising.

309
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,880
You see, the law requires advertisers to tell the truth.

310
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,420
The what?

311
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,000
The truth.

312
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,480
The truth.

313
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,400
To tell the truth.

314
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,400
Truth in advertising.

315
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,600
Good point.

316
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:27,800
Oh.

317
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,920
So, listen carefully to the wording of an ad.

318
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,640
The what?

319
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,580
The truth in advertising.

320
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,440
The what?

321
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,640
Well, then you have to decide.

322
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:33,900
Yeah.

323
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,120
Fine.

324
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,600
goes both ways, right? After all. So, this is Pennywise. You're on the air. Hi, Bob. What can

325
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,080
I do for you? Yeah, Jim, this is Charlie. I've got a moral question for you. The what? Wait a minute.

326
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,140
Thanks for the call, Bob. This is Charlie. I've got a moral question for you. Well, that's a matter

327
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,360
for your own conscience, Charlie. I figured you'd say something like that. All right. Why don't you

328
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,160
give it a try this year? Okay, but they'll never catch it. Well, thanks for calling, Charlie.

329
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,680
Thanks. This is Pennywise. Line six. You're on. Yeah, Jim, this is Charlie.

330
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:16,140
Negative Land. Friends, before that rainbow bridge, some utopia and breaching from Austin

331
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,400
1998, all cut together by Potter Nostril. Before that, new cut-ups by Artemia Salina,

332
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:32,000
Fernanda Nandi-Lemur, and old cut-ups from the subgenius media barrage number five,

333
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,940
plus music from...

334
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,180
Saint N, memoir of the same coming. But what do you want?

335
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,520
I want to be a member of your church. I want to give all I got. I want to love Bob. I want to love

336
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,860
Bob. I was in a room just the other day in Dallas. Well, I did benefit from it, of course.

337
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,800
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys. Remember this. I've been five years in the

338
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
intelligence division.

339
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,700
Just kidding.

340
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:14,220
Now I don't want you, Dale, to getain a special 그러니까 I have no idea why don't I use

341
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,220


342
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,880
The

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,700
The

344
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


345
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


346
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


347
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


348
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


349
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


350
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


351
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


352
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


353
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,700


354
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,160
The

355
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,160


356
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,160


357
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,160


358
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,480
The

359
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,480


360
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:33,260
ciudadel sunday короткиу

361
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:40,560
monster is bigger than your invisible monster. And friends, that's what most religions are all

362
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,940
about. Yeah. And you may laugh at that, but I'm afraid to tell you that according to the latest

363
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:55,760
study I saw, over 87% of Americans believe that there is an invisible monster that will take care

364
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,220
of them if they kiss its ass. And friends, because of those idiots believing in that monster,

365
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:09,040
there is one. He certainly made a lot of laws that we've ended up having to live by. But friends,

366
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:20,160
you can fight back. Yes, we can turn the tables and declare war on God. Now, frankly, some people

367
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,080
might say that was real disrespectful sounding. You, I think you, most of you understand what we

368
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,200
mean when we say we're declaring war on God. Repent, friends. Repent. Repent. Repent. Repent.

369
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,520
Through spending. And you better do it quick.

And every jury has its prize. They bring the kids and show the why.

It makes them proud to be around and take their summer pickies. To drink at night in soul class

and end up feeling sicky. And we're all making money.

373
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:49,260
Lovely money. Rubbernecks with cash to burn. Export criminals return. They keep on coming, never learn.

374
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,820
They fill their diaries page by page and make it sound so thrilling.

375
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:12,140
They're hunting for the real thing. They're flushed and they are willing. And we're all making money.

376
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,500
Lovely money.

377

Want it, want it, want it. Pay, pay, pay.

378
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:42,760
The victors of the open wars. They take their tips and open doors. They stand up on the actual floor.

379
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,480
Actual souls. Actual souls. Actual souls.

380
00:18:48,280 --> 00:19:00,820
It makes them proud to be around and take their summer pickies. To drink at night in soul class and end up feeling sicky.

381
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm sure they are exercise practitioners. Grade 8 and 12 even they're homey naughty and announced they'd partake in some little games.

were taken smiling into the tower.

Rumour has it that the bloodstains of Charles I's decapitation

411
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,520
were never actually washed from the stones.

friends, it will be Bob!

420
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,580
Bob is coming, and he will burn away the hate,

421
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,260
he will burn away the radiation,

422
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,540
he will burn away the fire itself.

423
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,980
But you have to keep your hate burning, friends.

424
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,640
You have to feed that fire.

425
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,920
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

We've only got five!

And yet we dare to fight them anyway!

435
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,780

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,600
There is,

557
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,680
No time,

558
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,500
To mind your mind,

559
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,560
Your sense,

560
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,820
And paste them in,

561
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,240
This poor,

562
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,100
Poor rain,

563
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,840
And you'll be,

564
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,160
In!

565
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,840
The End

566
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
Bob sold it!

567
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,100
I smoked it!

568
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,680
That settles it!

569
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,820
Freedom, freedom,

570
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,360
Kindly loving,

571
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,660
You'll be,

572
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,900
Absolutely,

573
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,580
Loving,

574
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,200
Absolutely free,

575
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,500
Only if you want to be!

576
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,980
Dreaming on good sins of velvet and satin,

577
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,120
To music by magic,

578
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,040
By people that happen to enter the world of us,

579
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,440
Screams for cold jello,

580
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,540
The dreams as they live them are all mellow yellow!

581
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,180
And mind,

582
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,240
Your mind,

583
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,580
There is,

584
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,380
No time,

585
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,820
To mind your mind,

586
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,680
Your sense,

587
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,120
And paste them in,

588
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,560
This poor,

589
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,360
Poor rain,

590
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,800
And you'll be,

591
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,340
In!

592
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,520
The End

593
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,860
Uh, uh, uh, uh,

594
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,880
Potter Nostril cut that up, friends!

595
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Mothers of invention,

596
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,080
Some Austin Devival,

597
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,060
And that song, Lovely Money,

598
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,480
Was by the damned,

599
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,580
And now,

600
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,040
A rare Bob hymn,

601
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,640
From the clench of the red-eyed loon,

602
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,920
Minneapolis circa 1982!

603
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,520
My life has changed in many ways,

604
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,240
Since I first saw his face,

605
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,620
I know that Bob will triumph,

606
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,600
With our friends from outer space,

607
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,980
And though we suffer needy,

608
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,780
I know that it's alright,

609
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,660
Cause I know Bob and I,

610
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,380
But tell me what to think,

611
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,460
The church of the subject,

612
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,620
And the genius,

613
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,800
Will spread across the land,

614
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,480
With pipes in place,

615
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,940
Will both they march together,

616
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,160
Hand in hand,

617
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,160
This dark fist of removal,

618
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
Will strike a mighty blow,

619
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,600
And we'll be free,

620
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,700
Of the noble and the big!

621
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,820
So give to Bob, Bob, Bob,

622
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,080
And you'll see a whole lot better,

623
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,220
Sir Bob, Bob, Bob,

624
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,320
Send a dollar and a letter,

625
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,580
He will change all your behavior,

626
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,660
He's your short-duration savior,

627
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,140
He is Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob!

628
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,900
Woo!

629
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,560
Woo!

630
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,140
Woo!

631
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,320
You're a miserable parasite!

632
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,200
You're just after my money!

633
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,740
But let's leave things of this world behind,

634
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,620
And walk now down the path of Bob,

635
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
For this brief minute of slack,

636
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,900
From the church of the subgenius.

637
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,320
No intelligent person would be,

638
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,220
Uh, go far right to that kind of stuff.

639
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,460
Then what do we expect?

640
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
All this perversion and sex?

641
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,500
Are them oily pores in your back?

642
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,840
All we care about is slack.

643
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,520
Then let all the slack get out.

644
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,080
The devil has to be behind that.

645
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,340
Think I'd follow that? I don't think so.

646
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
I was about to grab the nearest object,

647
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,260
And smash the mirror into bits,

648
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,580
When I saw one with columns of numbers,

649
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,420
Running across it.

650
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,280
I fancy myself comfortable with numerals,

651
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,080
But these were beyond even me.

652
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
Fortunately, its words were not.

653
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,040
As cycles came and went,

654
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,160
In groupings of ten thousand years,

655
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,900
The sixth ice age receded,

656
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,700
Leaving behind denuded landscape,

657
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,240
And four continents.

658
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,180
By the four hundredth millennium,

659
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,120
The genetic separation was irrevocable.

660
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,160
Occasional mutations proved the rule,

661
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,220
Rather than overturned it.

662
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,480
Separated into Heloatus humanus,

663
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
And Morloccus dishumanus,

664
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,420
The former homo sapiens left no genetic trail,

665
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,440
By AD 492,900 years.

666
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,440


667
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,120
1633

668
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,840
The Lord had met Outsider's beginning.

669
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


670
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


671
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


672
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


673
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


674
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


675
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


676
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,780
Do I surprise you?

677
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,680
A little, yes.

678
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,580
We weren't always like this.

679
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,560
After the moon,

680
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
fell from the sky.

681
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,820
The Earth could no longer sustain the species.

682
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,340
Some managed to stay above.

683
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,460
The rest of us escaped underground.

684
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,980
Then centuries later,

685
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,440
when we tried to re-emerge into the sun again,

686
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,980
we couldn't.

687
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,000
So we bred ourselves into casts,

688
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,040
some to be our eyes and ears,

689
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,700
ears, some to be our muscles and sinews.

690
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,600
Oh, you mean your hunters?

691
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,440
Yes.

692
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,860
Bred to be predators,

693
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,780
but bred also to be controlled.

694
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,140
You see, my cast,

695
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,660
concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities.

696
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,140
You control their thoughts?

697
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,620
Not just theirs.

698
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,960
Heli.

699
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,280
So it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals?

700
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,380
That's their role here.

701
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,600
To be your food?

702
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,720
Yes.

703
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,880
And for those who are suitable to be

704
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,920
breeding vessels for our other colonies.

705
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,500
You see, I'm just one of many.

706
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,960
Is this the hour of slack?

707
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,720
No.

708
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,520
Yes.

709
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:00,680
Oh.

710
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:00,720
Oh.

711
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,220
Rocknard, you're not really Reverend Cardboard Box, are you?

712
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,380
These kids with their names,

713
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,020
Reverend Cardboard Box.

714
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,940
Hey, come on, homie.

715
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,860
It's a gang, okay?

716
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,420
Gang people, it's funny, weird names, weird costumes.

717
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,660
Cool tags, you know.

718
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,400
Got their handles, man.

719
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,540
Jumbo was here.

720
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,200
Every boy should be in a gang,

721
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,800
but a gang can be a bad influence

722
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,720
or a good and slackful influence.

723
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,880
Yeah, but Army's a gang.

724
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,940
Army's a gang.

725
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,140
It's a conspiracy of dunces.

726
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,980
Wasn't it?

727
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,440
Conspiracy of dunces.

728
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,240
Isn't it true that most of the people

729
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
in the Church of the Subgenius

730
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,420
are those like idiot savant innates?

731
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,240
Those people who don't really recognize

732
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,620
what they're actually establishing?

733
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,160
No.

734
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,280
No, half of them are like...

735
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,720
Dave, you're their patron saint.

736
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah, half of them are your people

737
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,280
who are the greatest thing in the world

738
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,120
at one thing.

739
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,340
Because I don't have the energy.

740
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,660
You're their patron saint.

741
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,500
I'm their patron saint, man.

742
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,000
They've been honoring you

743
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,040
or listening to you for 20 years now

744
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,860
or something like that.

745
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,360
Well, I'm about ready to start

746
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,620
dealing out some funeral parlor

747
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,560
holy cards.

748
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I mean, prayer cards.

749
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm going to start flipping

750
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,420
from the bottom of the deck

751
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,780
if these people don't stop bothering me.

752
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,080
Well, those are the voices in your head, Dave.

753
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,560
Those aren't real people bothering you.

754
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,720
How come they're...

755
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,340
Okay, well, then how come they're so clever?

756
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,080
How come they can make things...

757
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,900
Because you're clever.

758
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,300
Because you're a saint, man.

759
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,560
That goes with the territory

760
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,420
when you're a saint.

761
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,120
You're saying the mind stuff.

762
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,580
...is what drives the cosmic engine.

763
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,220
Yeah, Dave.

764
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,200
The phone calls are coming

765
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,300
from inside the house.

766
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,920
Oh, man.

767
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,500
I thought I had this place

768
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,900
nailed down tight as a drub.

769
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,020
What, your brain?

770
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,660
No, this house brain.

771
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,900
I mean, the higher...

772
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,820
No, it was a metaphor.

773
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,220
That was a metaphor, Dave.

774
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,900
That was a metaphor.

775
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,720
You did.

776
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,640
The calls are coming

777
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,700
from inside your house.

778
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,580
I thought we were going

779
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,600
to go into something else.

780
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,000
It's just that one cell.

781
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,260
It's that one beautiful cell.

782
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,300
That one brain cell you have, Dave.

783
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,180
And then why did you...

784
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,460
Treasure.

785
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:00,820
...tell me it's ours

786
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,940
if it's just a brain cell?

787
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,220
And if the truth is so horrible,

788
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,260
it will haunt your dreams

789
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,960
for all time.

790
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,040
Well, I think I'm used to that.

791
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,980
No, wait a minute.

792
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,280
No, you wait a minute.

793
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,440
I love that area.

794
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,240
And I...

795
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,840
Hello?

796
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,780
Yes?

797
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,940
Who is this?

798
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Who is this?

799
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,380
Who is this?

800
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,000
Who was he who wrote to us

801
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
pain and misery and terror

802
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,680
and sickness and death

803
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,300
and a headache that lasts all year?

804
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,220
That's what any deity

805
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,080
means to me.

806
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,560
Ding dong, the deity's dead.

807
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,180
Which old god?

808
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,180
The stupid Bob.

809
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,620
respect with here

810
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,280
And the smart Bob.

811
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,720
BOB

812
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,800
And the forked tongue Bob.

813
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,800
popping

814
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,440
And the straight deal Bob.

815
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,020
Are all

816
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,360
Gr dreaming

817
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,360


818
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,520
God finally.

819
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,800
But to rest along with the other silly superstitions

820
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,900
that have saddled mankind for centuries,

821
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,280
And keeping them low in their ignorance

822
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,720
And high in their expectations.

823
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,740
dig

824
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,400
Well learned

825
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,540
This could grab everyone

826
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:30,660
He knows

827
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:30,660


828
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:30,660


829
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:30,660


830
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:30,660


831
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,360
...is lining up for the punch, folks.

832
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:41,660
Yes, the bloody head of Arnold Palmer dictates what the pink, aimless, lifeless body of Arnold Palmer does.

833
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,680
No! We shall find the spirit of Arnold Palmer before...

834
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,500
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, kiss pussy!

835
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,840
Chew-buck-a-whoca-alab-a-mas-na-a-hey-ah!

836
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,920
Ah, yes?

837
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,100
Ha. Anteaters.

838
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,100
Black mud squirming.

839
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,100
Death.

840
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,020
Esmernir.

841
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,200
Irrumibim.

842
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,320
Blast-ah.

843
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,880
Cah-das.

844
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,380
We'll be right back.

845
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,620
We'll be right back.

846
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I'm a casualty of the battle of the roses and the war of the broken home.

847
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:47,300
I got busted for drinking while begging, carrying a weapon under my coat.

848
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,340
And I'm arrested for all the people.

849
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,860
And now I am a pirate on the bad dream boat.

850
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,660
And I'm alone.

851
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,780
I'm alone.

852
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,320
And now I'm not a star of the sun.

853
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,920
I am a man without a country.

854
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,120
I'm a boy without a home.

855
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:14,100
I'm a casualty of the battle of the roses and the war of the broken home.

856
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:33,140
I got busted for drinking while begging, carrying a weapon under my coat.

857
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,400
And now I'm a pirate on the bad dream boat.

858
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm a casualty of the battle of the broken home.

859
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,520
I'm a casualty of the battle of the broken home.

860
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,820
Oh, I see land divided down the middle.

861
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,620
And the sides are divided and divided again.

862
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,360
I see so many people lonely.

863
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,320
I see so many people lonely.

864
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,320


865
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,320


866
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:09,680
I'm a casualty of the battle of the roses and the war

867
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,760
Of the broken home

868
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,140
guitar solo

869
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,920
guitar solo

870
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,440
The Rainmakers, friends, and before that,

871
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,420
ESO Radio and some Media Barrage No. 5 excerpts

872
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,380
from the early 1980s with Doctors for Bob and Lies,

873
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,660
and now Glass Madness with a song,

874
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,800
followed by the latest collage from The Bishop.

875
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,540
My biz rock

876
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,380
My biz a tree

877
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,940

My biz a basketball

My biz a rugby ball

882
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,240
And my biz a golf ball

883
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,580

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,300

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


893
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


894
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


895
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


896
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


897
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


898
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,300


899
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,940
Another natural product made better by chemistry

900
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,560
Anyways is marijuana

901
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,520
Years of research where necessary in order to improve the saç

902
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,300
But it doesn't take long for the drug habit to make anyone over.

903
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,780
In all the colors of the rainbow.

904
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,140
A few years back, the United States of America had nearly gone crazy.

905
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,220
They were lining up dope peddlers and shooting them in the back of the head.

906
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,060
Just take it or leave it.

907
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Then it's chemistry to the rescue.

908
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,160
The answer is a simple one.

909
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,720
Just use your head.

910
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,420
But there's one sure thing.

911
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,020
If you use narcotics,

912
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,200
the horizon is unlimited.

913
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,880
Talk to someone who has had the experience.

914
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,720
All around us are the products of modern chemistry.

915
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,700
Heroin.

916
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,520
Morphine.

917
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:24,880
Red.

918
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,500
Crack.

919
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,300
Sleeping pills.

920
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,880
Something that came out of a test tube created in the chemist's laboratory

921
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,540
by a miracle of modern science

922
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,160
folded into a compact little package

923
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,380
many times as strong.

924
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,000
And the dope addicts say...

925
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,420
Yes, chemistry has changed the world we live in.

927
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,420
Something that came out of a...

928
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,000
test tube

929
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,900
is going to have been transformed into the destructive forces of useful life.

930
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,140
Most teenagers start off with marijuana.

931
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,160
Some of the boys smoke them.

932
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,940
You know, the ones with backbone.

933
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,660
My girlfriend Anne and I went around with Bob.

934
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,980
They both smoke pop.

935
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,100
That's jive talk for marijuana.

936
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,920
So I tried it.

937
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,280
Funny what it does to you.

938
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,460
Everything speeds up to a hundred miles an hour.

939
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,200
There was something intriguing and different when I came home high that night.

940
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,680
You're real sharp and you laugh a lot.

941
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,220
You're the biggest person in the world.

942
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,380
All you think about day and night is...

943
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,320
the radiance of sparkling colors.

944
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,120
And then you pass out, but when you wake up it starts all over again.

945
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,300
And that's the story.

946
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,900
Unbelievable, isn't it?

947
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,540
Chemistry takes a hand in such commonplace things as...

948
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,980
dope traffic in the United States.

949
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,160
It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics...

950
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,280
is a thing of beauty.

951
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,560
Carrying off the harmful fumes from other chemical processes,

952
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,080
there's always the gentle dew,

953
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,440
which cover the surface with a film of gritty, scratching particles.

954
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,360
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you.

955
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,080
It does.

956
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,760
Some young man may develop startling,

957
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,360
stupid, ghastly, tragic,

958
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,000
hidden secrets of nature,

959
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,400
the pioneer of tomorrow.

960
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,660
That's another mandatory.

961
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,820
I'm baked, man.

962
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,840
They're all laughing like lunatic demons and stuff.

963
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,920
I call this radio show because I'm baked.

964
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,000
I'm baked.

965
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,680
You are the inescapable result of your tragedy.

966
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,920
Just as I...

967
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,040
I'm the inescapable result of you.

968
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,400
Of you, of you.

969
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Marijuana, marijuana.

970
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,360
Ba-ba-dum.

971
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,420
Marijuana-

972
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,780

973

989
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:06,820

let's go

993
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


994
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


995
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


996
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


997
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


998
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


999
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,620


1000
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,580
life

1001
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,280
UK

1002
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,780
there iseling

1003
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,400

1004
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,780
what

1005
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,920
r

1006
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,000
paid

1007
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,120
grand

1008
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,820
bhundis

1009
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,560
silica serum.

1010
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,460
A new, completely new

1011
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,380
silicon brain.

1012
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,580
Sorry.

1013
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,060
It's so bouncy and glowy and round.

1014
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,380
Oh, I hear them.

1015
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,760
It's so smooth and

1016
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,260
unwrinkled in Dave's case.

1017
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,360
It's like a sheet of pudding

1018
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,300
without the curge on top.

1019
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,140
Oh yeah, that's the shmegma pie.

1020
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,380
Watch as we slice down.

1021
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,080
Watch on the webcam as we slice

1022
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,160
down into Dave's brain.

1023
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,120
It's like butter.

1024
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,040
It's so soft and yielding.

1025
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,440
It just fills right open.

1026
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,040
The moons of Jupiter, they just

1027
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,380
slide so...

1028
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,240
And it's as if there's nothing inside,

1029
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,320
just this goo.

1030
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,740
You know, this is not an intelligent

1031
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,000
or refractory lubrication

1032
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,080
machine if you'd like to pipe up your organs.

1033
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,060
This is me, and this is

1034
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,700
you, baby.

1035
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,500
This is a perversion of every natural law.

1036
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,140
And what is

1037
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,920
time travel?

1038
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,860
But you're pathetic.

1039
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,920
You're trying to control the world around you.

1040
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,960
Your futile effort to have a question answered.

1041
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,660
Do you think I don't know you, Alexander?

1042
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,640
I can look inside your memories.

1043
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,580
Your nightmares.

1044
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,780
Your dreams.

1045
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,060
You're a man haunted by those two most terrible words.

1046
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,680
What if?

1047
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,140
Mr. Dunn.

1048
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,100
What is it, Jimmy?

1049
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,560
I'm busy.

1050
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,800
Yes, sir.

1051
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,080
I know.

1052
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,480
Only, it's Sheriff Gillis.

1053
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,220
And he says he needs to talk to you.

1054
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,740
Ah.

1055
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,440
He says he needs to talk to me.

1056
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:26,140
The truth is, he's in pursuit of an immodest amount of that curious weed which you and

1057
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,340
your school chums seem to find so fascinating.

1058
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,060
Dob.

1059
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,020
Dob?

1060
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:32,860
Dob?

1061
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,080
This one's your professional lead.

1062
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,100
Yes, it is.

1063
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,700
opinion about a hunch I've got.

1064
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,760
A hunch? Something just keeps going around in my head.

1065
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,580
Will you give my preoccupation?

1066
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,580
I've replaced missing eyeballs with sawdust,

1067
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,160
and glued the lids together.

1068
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,580
I've used bent aluminum combs for dentures.

1069
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,380
I've used the back part of the scalp when there was no front part.

1070
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,540
And I've folded one hand over wadded-up newspapers

1071
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,900
when the other hand had no fingers.

1072
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,840
You find all this obscene?

1073
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,060
Do you know what is really obscene?

1074
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,580
Look at this.

1075
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,720
Look at the work I've done.

1076
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,620
This is an art.

1077
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,160
And I am the artist.

1078
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,460
One more time, I take it from the top.

1079
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,680
Say you never let me stop, stop, stop.

1080
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,180
One more hit, just a little pop.

1081
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,500
To get me on away until I drop, drop, drop.

1082
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,780
Can't come down, gotta be high.

1083
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,160
Say you never let me die, die, die.

1084
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,600
One more time, but just a little try.

1085
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,940
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high.

1086
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,260
Well, I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.

1087
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,500
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.

1088
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,040
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.

1089
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,280
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.

1090
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,580
Can't come down, gotta stay high.

1091
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,880
Can't come together, but we try, try, try.

1092
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,460
One more night, the feeling's on Godive.

1093
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,680
Gotta keep a bop until I die, die, die.

1094
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,960
Can't come down, gotta stay high.

1095
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,280
What'll I do without my high, high, high?

1096
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,720
Life's too fast, I need a lot of slack.

1097
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,080
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back.

1098
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,460
I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.

1099
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,740
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.

1100
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,300
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.

1101
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,500
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.

1102
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,640
On my high, high, high.

1103
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,060
On my high, high, high.

1104
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:34,960
On my high, high, high, mad.

1105
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,640
Gotta keep a bop until I die, die, die, die.

1106
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:44,980
What'll I do without my high, high, high?

1107
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,860
can' make a troubled eyes, I just don't want to die

1108
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,160
Presley Restaurant

You know, because that's where it's going to be in the future.

1116
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,060
The 14th

1117
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,060
420 will be 500.

1118
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,400
I brought a banana, but I can't find it.

1119
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,160
I lost it somewhere, and I'm hungry now.

1120
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,360
The show is just going on and on, and my hunger is...

1121
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,700
One of the best things to do for your brain.

1122
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,600
Really?

1123
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,420
The show is, yeah.

1124
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,940
I know.

1125
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,880
If you listen to the show, you are smarter by 23.5%.

1126
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,560
I like to do good things for my brain.

1127
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,640
I like to give my brain a good massage.

1128
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,340
Are you a break thinker?

1129
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,940
One of those shiatsu massages.

1130
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,480
Just open up my skull.

1131
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,580
Yeah.

1132
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,360
And start kneading the gray matter.

1133
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,220
Uh-huh.

1134
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,180
Sort of a self-trepanator, right?

1135
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,920
I don't use any fancy cutting tools.

1136
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,300
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade.

1137
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,200
I hear somebody's cell phone making that weird buzz.

1138
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,080
Yeah, you know who that is.

1139
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,620
That's my breathing.

1140
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,300
Hear it?

1141
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,020
That's my air tube.

1142
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,240
Oh, okay.

1143
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,280
That's the government listening to this show and all the other shows on KPK.

1144
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,500
Are you still in that iron lung?

1145
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:07,220
Um, I've upgraded to a new plastic lung.

1146
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,220
Oh, okay.

1147
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,660
One of those new fangled things.

1148
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,400
Now, friends, this church of the subgenius, this story of Bob,

1149
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,760
it could be the greatest joke ever told.

1150
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,800
But if and only if Earth can make it to the punchline.

1151
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,660
And we can do that, friends.

1152
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,200
If you...

1153
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,700
We'll use your own...

1154
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,020
Your own hate.

1155
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,560
You...

1156
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,960
Actually, you don't have to use anything of yours.

1157
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,700
As Dr. Legume said, use their hate and their fear.

1158
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,500
Pump up your mutant abnormality.

1159
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,300
Flaunt your weirdness and wag it in their slack-jawed, uncomprehending faces.

1160
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,780
That will do more than your vote.

1161
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,240
Wag your weirdness right there in public, friends.

1162
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,320
As St. Hendrick said, let your freak flag...

1163
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,840
Wave your freak flag high.

1164
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,280
You, it's up to you.

1165
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,040
Cause yourleyers have gotta fuckin' five minutes to şimdiutre the

1166
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,040


1167
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,260
You, it's up to you.

1168
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,520
You wanna charge with me.

1169
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,880
As dialogue, it'sash.

1170
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,500
You know you're not gonna bathe me with painful somber Baylor.

1171
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,040
Eat your fucking bacon.

1172
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,480
You wanna throw».

1173
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,320
UGH!

1174
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,100
I don't know.

1175
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:15,340
I don't know.

1176
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,740
And then you whisk back to the waterhole.

1177
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,020
I tried to play like Jimmy with my teeth.

1178
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,080
The dentist, when he saw them, said good grief.

1179
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,900
So when it is nearing Christmas,

1180
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,060
the present I always wish for is

1181
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,660
Jimmy Hendrix Strat!

1182
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,000
Oh, when he played it,

1183
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,240
it was a crazy sound.

1184
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:34,300
He played his bloody guitar upside down.

1185
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,280
I won't have seen him play the Isle of Wight.

1186
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,360
I gave a pinching halfway through the night.

1187
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,180
All right!

1188
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,320
So when it is nearing Christmas,

1189
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,500
the present I always wish for is

1190
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,220
Jimmy Hendrix Strat!

1191
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:02,380
Oh,

Subgenius.com

1251
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:44,700
Uh, uh, uh, where she has a three and a half year old toddler who's already been told to hate Bob.

1252
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,700
And to basically kill him.

1253
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,060
Bob.

1254
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,360
Jim, thanks for the call.

1255
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,280
You know, uh, it's funny because I called it.

1256
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,480
About a, uh, 50 years ago and tried to get a hold of Dr. Triggerberger.

1257
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:04,000
Because I guess there was some other doctor who was, um, possibly getting somebody for me to talk to.

1258
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,480
An official declaration of war against Bob.

1259
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,800
Shock and horror lingered.

1260
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,380
And there goes the torch parade.

1261
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,740
What sort of goings on is that anyway?

1262
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,300
Some sort of rites for the Temple of Vampires.

1263
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,240
Jack, you mean to sit there and say all that gang was vampires?

1264
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,040
How do I know?

1265
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,740
At least they seem to be priests of the temple.

1266
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,920
Yeah, robes and torches and stuff.

1268
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,200
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1269
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:46,380
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1270
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,560
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

Subgenius.com

1272
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:58,520
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1273
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:06,000
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1274
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,360
and help out financially as best you can.

1275
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,720
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1276
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,360
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1277
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,280
But some of you still have jobs.

1278
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,360
Even five bucks.

1279
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,700
Makes a big difference.

1280
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:27,220
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1281
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,620
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1282
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,740
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay

1283
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,380
Dobbs.

1284
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:43,900
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1285
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,580
