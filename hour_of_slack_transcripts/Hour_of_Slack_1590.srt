1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460
Favorite color?

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,480
Mmm, electric blue.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,220
You?

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,200
Black, definitely black.

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,240
Oh, but also pink.

6
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,460
Oh, oh, and sunlight.

7
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,020
You're a vampire.

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,960
Don't you burn in sunlight?

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,880
Not silly.

10
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,400
That's only in the movies.

11
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,600
Favorite song?

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,140
That's a no-brainer.

13
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,800
Flawless.

14
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,220
It's Tash's new hit single.

15
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,680
Who's Tash?

16
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,100
Who's Tash?

17
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,940
Have you been hiding under a rock your whole life?

18
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,860
Tash is the most coolest, most awesome, amazing, beautiful, amazing rocker.

19
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,720
I have all of her albums, and I've seen all of her videos,

20
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,940
even the super obscure one that she shot secretly in Tokyo.

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,820
Oh, she's a normie.

22
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,820
What's that?

23
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,900
Normie.

24
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,580
Normal.

25
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,480
A human.

26
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,980
Okay, big deal.

27
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,120
So she's a normie.

28
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,560
Don't you think it's a bit unfair that humans are the only ones who get to be normal?

29
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,840
I mean, who decided that turning into a bat and sleeping in a coffin was weird?

30
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,140
Tell me about it.

31
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,920
Just because I need a few steps.

32
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,800
Stitches to stay together.

33
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm still a person.

34
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,820
Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be normal?

35
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,160
I don't know.

36
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,980
Being normal never really vibed with me.

37
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,720
But it would be nice to do some normal things.

38
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,800
Like have friends.

39
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,660
Oh, and throw parties.

40
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,340
And hang at a coffee shop and order elaborate-sounding drinks.

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,060
It could be a coffin shop.

42
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,720
I love it.

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,860
And it could be right in the center of our little monster village.

44
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,580
Where?

45
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,720
Where monsters of all kinds could come to live together.

46
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,160
And go to school together.

47
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,060
A real school.

48
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh, we could call it...

49
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,180
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

50
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,760
Subgenius Hour of Swag

51
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,480
Oh, that's not true!

52
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,200
Subgenius Hour of Swag

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,420
Yeah, no, bad idea.

54
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,520
What about...

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,400
School for the scary, strange, and... and...

56
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,780
Generally unwelcome.

57
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,920
Or...

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
Or we could just call it...

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,220
Monster High!

60
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,260
Monster High!

61
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,460
So simple and yet...

62
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,620
So perfect!

63
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,760
If only we could...

64
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,440
But...

65
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
It's impossible.

66
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180
Nothing possible, just...

67
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,620
Challenging.

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,860
Subgenius Hour of Swag

69
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,940
I think I know most of it anyway.

70
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,600
My wife, Ivana, is a brilliant manager.

71
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,120
I will pay her one dollar a year and all the dresses she can buy.

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,180
I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is...

73
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.

74
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,540
I build the best buildings.

75
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,660
And I'm the biggest developer in New York by far.

76
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,040
While that's real estate and this is politics...

77
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,180
Are they really so different?

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
Usually, if I fire someone who's bad, I tell them how great they are.

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,420
Because I don't want to hurt people's feelings.

80
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,980
My fingers are long and beautiful.

81
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,400
That's been well documented.

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,140
Along with other various parts of my body.

83
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,880
My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.

84
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,820
The concept of global warming was created by the Chinese.

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,520
Sorry losers and haters.

86
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,760
But my IQ is one of the highest.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
And you all know it.

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,900
Please don't feel stupid or insecure.

89
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,940
It's not your fault.

90
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,320
And it's not a wig.

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,340
It's my hair.

92
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,340
Do you want to touch it?

93
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,440
McCain.

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,360
He's not a war hero.

95
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,620
He's a war hero because he was captured.

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,960
I like people that weren't captured.

97
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,780
Okay?

98
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,100
What I say is what I say.

99
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,640
Well, I do whine because I want to win.

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,080
And I'm not happy about not winning.

101
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,000
I fully think apologizing is a great thing.

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,420
But you have to be wrong.

103
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,940
I will absolutely apologize if I'm ever wrong.

104
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,340
The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

105
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,500
I love Hispanics.

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,500
That was Billy West as Zap Brannigan speaking the actual words of that orange guy.

107
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,620
The Monster High clips and songs used in this show are all from the talk show.

108
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,840
The 2016 kids movie, Welcome to Monster High, which appears to be something of a franchise reboot.

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,920
And now, Reverend Draculaura.

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,000
For those of you tuning in for the first time, I'm Draculaura.

111
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,020
I'm not like other people.

112
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,800
But then again, who is?

113
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,160
And it was conceived, gestated and decanted.

114
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,420
And born on X day.

115
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
ZAP BRANNIGA

116
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,300
Today, the moon reached full perigee.

117
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,500
227,411 miles from Earth.

118
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,240
and the planets are achieving their formation for X-Day.

119
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:38,420
The Earth will be exactly at Aphelion, 94.5 million miles from the Sun,

120
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,800
while Mercury moves to a superior conjunction.

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:57,860
The X-est armada will manifest itself precisely at 7 a.m. Central Standard Time.

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:10,680
And now the opening ceremony begins for this session of the endless hour of slack

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,760
as I,

124
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,300
Ivan Stang, moves to ring the ceremonial bell, always heard on these occasions.

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,240
The bell is heard over land and sea as the ceremony begins.

126
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,520
The invocation to the four quarters and elements having been made,

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,960
which today we would call states of matter.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,380
Ivan Stang sounds the gong.

129
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,380
Ivan Stang plays the gong.

130
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,240
Ivan Stang plays the gong.

131
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,480
Ivan Stang plays the gong.

132
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,240
Ivan Stang plays the gong.

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,320
Oh, come ye who are heavy laden, or just come in here,

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,980
if you're not doing anything in particular,

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,120
and prepare yourself for the awesome revelations

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,780
of the eternal hour of slack.

137
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,860
I can hear the bell.

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,280
I can hear the bell.

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,160
Hear it, Ivan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell.

140
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,260
Don't blame me. I voted for Bob.

141
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,320
Yeah, what about that, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea?

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,080
What are your priorities?

143
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,900
Don't you know this planet's had it?

144
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,940
Time to line up and get ready.

145
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,780
Line up. Sign up.

146
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,840
Line up and enlist today.

147
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,120
Pipes for industry.

148
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,160
Pipes for defense.

149
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,520
Pipes for industry.

150
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,320
Pipe down, pikers.

151
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,620
Yes, friends, X Day has begun.

152
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,460
19 X Day, the last of the X Days.

153
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,760
You are privileged to be here for the final time,

154
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,840
to be on Earth itself for the final, yes, the final time.

155
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh, yes.

156
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,620
And what do you do when you know it's the end?

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Well, that's up to you, my friends, because this is the church of the subgenius,

158
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,320
and only you know what slack is for you.

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,260
Yes, that's between you and your innermost voice.

160
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,940
You have to make these arrangements.

161
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,320
We can't do it for you.

162
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,040
After all, we're not running this church to coddle people who are members.

163
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,680
Well, I thought this was the victim's church of the kid globe.

164
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,380
We don't tuck him into bed and give him a bubble bath.

165
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,400
That's not what this is about.

166
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,020
No, we give Bob a bubble bath.

167
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,460
And then he goes out and gives a bum a haircut.

168
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,880
Yes, we've heard about that.

169
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,340
Always the same bum, I understand.

170
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,140
Well, we don't have to get that detailed about it.

171
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Well, anyway, it is true.

172
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,500
Bob is known to go out and give a bum a haircut.

173
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,640
But so far, this has been...

174
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,400
a wonderful ex-day.

175
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,320
We've already had the thunderstorm and rain.

176
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Which is described in your literature there,

177
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,400
and was written beforehand with foreknowledge of these as of other things.

178
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,960
That's right. That's how we know this is actually day four in the schedule.

179
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,780
And, friends, we got off to a great start last night

180
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,440
once we finally found the key to the sound booth,

181
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,660
which happened to be the owner's.

182
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,060
The owner of the sound booth was the key.

183
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,660
We got...

184
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,300
I watched the most wonderful show.

185
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,380
And perhaps we'll be cutting away to parts of that show

186
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,760
in this and future Hours of Slack.

187
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,820
But I don't know what you'd call that band last night.

188
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,940
It was a doctor band.

189
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,020
It was...

190
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,120
Fid Chooley, Reverend Anna Maul, lots of new people.

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,920
Dr. Shoggoth, and also many oldsters,

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,160
such as Walter Kosmack.

193
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,200
And, friends, that was a really inspiring show,

194
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,420
because it was so obvious that these young folks had been listening

195
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,080
to the Puzzling Evidence Show,

196
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,200
the Hour of Slack,

197
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,780
and Susie the Flusie's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,900
And other fountains of truth.

199
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,520
And they had taken the ball

200
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
and run with it,

201
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
and then kicked it out of the park,

202
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,060
over both goalposts.

203
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,120
It's so nice to see somebody step up.

204
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,460
You gotta watch that forward lateral.

205
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,140
They took it a little further.

206
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,380
They're younger, faster, and drunker.

207
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,340
And it was really, really an inspiring thing for me to see.

208
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,140
I was so proud that we had

209
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,520
had something to do with such

210
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,940
horrible noises,

211
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,520
but wonderful concepts.

212
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,640
It was really good and funny,

213
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,280
and the performers will be glad to know that

214
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,720
the recordings sound pretty good.

215
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,560
And you don't have to be parachuted into sweet-sounding

216
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


217
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,780
You have to get up to speed

218
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:53,060
and you have to find où to go.

219
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,680
So, and they put out some fun shows

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:05,800
for me.

221
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,500
Thank you.

222
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,140
Are you ready to rock?

223
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,020
Are you ready to rock?

224
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,220
Are you being a mountain friend?

225
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,260
Upset with my possibilities and my future and my days?

226
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,680
Are you having problems with how my life is going?

227
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,720
Now I just give up and have a good old spoonful of scrum, a big old bucket of scrum, a nice

228
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,280
quart just to get another scrum.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,960
Everything is fine now.

230
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,980
Where's Scott?

231
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,200
There's Doug.

232
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,000
There's Doug.

233
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,040
There's Doug.

234
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,720
There's Doug.

235
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,400
There's Doug.

236
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
There's Doug.

237
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,180
There's Doug.

238
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,100
There's Doug.

239
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes, pretty good.

240
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,500
Is that where I cut to a selection?

241
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,880
You cut to an incredible special effect.

242
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,200
Yes, that.

243
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,200
That's a selection.

244
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,880
There it is.

245
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,820
Good God, look at that special effect.

246
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,920
Incredible.

247
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,440
Ah!

248
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,000
It's so expensive, it hurts to look at.

249
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,560
Yes.

250
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,680
The more expensive the special effect, the better it must be.

251
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,580
Now that guy who smokes through his eyes, that's no special effect.

252
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,580
He actually squirts the smoke stream through his tear ducts.

253
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,280
But we all have our individual Bob-given talents.

254
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,800
Some of the Bob-given talents are unexplainable.

255
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,900
They may be useful in ways we don't know yet.

256
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm thinking actually of Mr. Sister's son who can't talk, but I know that there's something

257
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,600
that guy can do better than anyone.

258
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,580
It's just up to the church to find out what it is.

259
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,660
Maybe if we put him in front of a hundred monkeys, we might be able to find out what it is.

260
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:32,660


261
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:32,660


262
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,460
Now that's how rich we are with typewriters.

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
We'll end up with a book of the subgenius too.

264
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,640
This music is wonderful.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,980
This is the end of our journey of exploration and discovery over foaming seas of possibility.

266
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,920
The unfroppened voyage of J.R. Bob-dobbs.

267
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm just wondering if yawn background music is actually loud enough for anyone in the

268
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,420
audience to hear it.

269
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,640
So, we're here rhapsodizing about something.

270
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,360
about music that they can't hear as well as...

271
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,980
They can hear it.

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Look at them.

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
They have their thumbs.

274
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,660
They're putting their thumbs up.

275
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,580
Okay, well then...

276
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,000
And covering their ears and putting plugs in there.

277
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,880
Yeah, no, it's plenty loud.

278
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,840
Your headphones are weak.

279
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,120
Mine are very, very strong, though.

280
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,340
And they need to be.

281
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,120
So...

282
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,080
Very well.

283
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,920
Ah, yes.

284
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,720
Now, perhaps we could momentarily mention

285
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,340
the schedule of events.

286
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,080
Yes.

287
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,080
Yes.

288
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,680
People are quite anxious to know

289
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,460
when the Bulldada auction will take place

290
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,980
or other important ceremonies.

291
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,660
Well, this is just the first day.

292
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,520
According to the schedule,

293
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,640
a bunch of stuff happens in the cafe,

294
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,200
and then later, a bunch of stuff happens on the main stage.

295
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,080
That's the schedule.

296
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,180
And it's accurate.

297
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,780
It mentioned the rain, and then...

298
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,120
The rain is done with for now.

299
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,480
Yes.

300
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,420
That's...

301
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,300
We can check off.

302
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,960
That's a...

303
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,100
We can check off now?

304
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,980
We can check off the rain.

305
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,440
Well, that's actually how...

306
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,500
I've been checking off this whole time.

307
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,500
That's why we put this tablecloth on the picnic table

308
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,020
that our studio is on,

309
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,780
so people can't see below the waist.

310
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,500
I don't know why you didn't put the new, more...

311
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Look at that.

312
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,240
Impenetrable cloth.

313
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,880
Check that out.

314
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,540
Barbara Eden.

315
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,640
Well, that's nice.

316
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,060
Yeah.

317
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Price St. Martin.

318
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,600
We were just looking at a topless picture of Barbara Eden.

319
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,620
Let her show her navel on TV.

320
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,880
But we subgeniuses get to see things like that.

321
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,740
Mm-hmm.

322
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,600
Interposed with grotesque sights of horror and...

323
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,860
Well, it's the contrast that makes it so wonderful.

324
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,220
Mm-hmm.

325
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,560
That's why we love monster movies.

326
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,380
There's always a cool, hideous monster

327
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,260
and a beautiful girl

328
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,220
who falls down, usually.

329
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,140
But I like things that...

330
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,740
As Princess Wee says...

331
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,600
...take me out of it.

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,600


333
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,600


334
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,600


335
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,720
...of my ordinary life.

336
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Girls fall down.

337
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,180
Every now and then, you'll get a movie

338
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,360
where the guy falls down and the girl helps him.

339
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,940
Those are fun.

340
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,520
Well, as long as somebody helps someone,

341
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,680
that's the important thing.

342
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,020
In the subgenius movie,

343
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,360
lonesome cowboy Dave falls down

344
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,620
and Susie helps him up.

345
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,440
Well, that's art imitating life.

346
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,100
Right.

347
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,920
And speaking of that,

348
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,340
Susie is here now,

349
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,140
just arriving at Caffeina's.

350
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,820
We...

351
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,360
Oh.

352
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,220
There she be.

353
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,460
Here she comes.

354
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,920
What?

355
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,440
She's got eggs in her pants.

356
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,420
She's got eggs.

357
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,180
She pulled an egg out of her pant.

358
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,460
Perhaps we're going to have eggs Birmingham.

359
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,620
That wonderful delicacy.

360
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,720
Oh.

361
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,900
Oh.

362
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,380
Yes, the egg.

363
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,960
Symbol of beginnings.

364
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,400
And, of course, the Bavarian albuminati.

365
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,360
Those egg...

366
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,060
Worshippers.

367
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,820
Is that a reptile or bird egg?

368
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,120
That's a bird egg.

369
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,580
Oh, wait.

370
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,200
Her mic was not on.

371
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,860
Let's get mic on Susie.

372
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,500
Does this turn?

373
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,800
You know, the reptile eggs are more oblong and leather.

374
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,580
I believe an Amish farm woman laid this egg.

375
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,160
You know, it was a little starch cap.

376
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
What will hatch out of it?

377
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,860
A little Amish boy or girl?

378
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,740
I don't know,

379
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,160
but I hope I'm going to eat the hell out of them.

380
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,900
Oh.

381
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,360
I hope they haven't got none of those pilgrim buckles on their shoes.

382
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,020
The eggs require occasional turning, but not too much turning.

383
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,940
Yeah.

384
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,080
While, on the other hand, if you turn a dinosaur egg, you kill the embryo inside it.

385
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,740
Really?

386
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,300
You don't turn those eggs.

387
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,540
Yes, you leave the eggs.

388
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,300
I'll remember that next time I come upon a dinosaur nest.

389
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,660
Oh, they'd be sore, man.

390
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,480
Hey, we can come upon dinosaur nests.

391
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,800
They'll be a little more fun.

392
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:01,800


393
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,460
It's just a few days.

394
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,460
Yeah, he's got them on his property.

395
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,560
No, no, I mean on Planet X, or whatever.

396
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh, that, yes, of course.

397
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,660
Oh, I wouldn't do that to them.

398
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,840
You know, nobody ever asks what happens when we get to Planet X, or where it is or what

399
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,680
it is, or why it's called Planet X.

400
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,400
I advise to open that.

401
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,100
Ixnay on the Ana-X play.

402
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,080
I still think they should know about it.

403
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,460
Anyway.

404
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,680
Yeah, it's too late anyway, right?

405
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,380
Yeah.

406
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,300
They paid their dues to Bob.

407
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,400
They're going to be ruptured whether they want to be or not.

408
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,500
Yes, that is so.

409
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
One-way ticket.

410
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,560
One.

411
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,820
It's always best to prevent an eventuality as a possibility, or even a choice.

412
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,300
No one has been smart enough to buy the round-trip ticket.

413
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,100
The what?

414
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,420
Wait a minute.

415
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,740
The round-trip ticket?

416
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,520
Well, that's just...

417
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,720
That's another 35 bucks.

418
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,240
That's just kind of smart if you're going somewhere you've never been before.

419
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,880
Wow.

420
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,980
But this is the smart.

421
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,960
Where does that enter into?

422
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,300
Well, that's why I never bought one.

423
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,240
Yeah.

424
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,320
Duh.

425
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,100
La gringa estupida.

426
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Never a duh moment at Ixnay.

427
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,700
I use that line two shows ago.

428
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,660
I really shouldn't do it again.

429
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,580
Yes, yes, yes, Ixnay.

430
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,140
The promise of Ixnay.

431
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,360
The promise of Ixnay.

432
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


433
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


434
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


435
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


436
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


437
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


438
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,360


439
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,040
The promise of Ixnay.

440
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,400
Some people spend their time thinking about all the destruction and revenge they're going

441
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,160
to...

442
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,200
What's a present tense of wrong?

443
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,280
Well, you know, we never claim...

444
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,720
Anyway, but...

445
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,980
...to be a particularly well-adjusted group.

446
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,300
No, of course not.

447
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
We're better just because we're different.

448
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

449
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,800
Isn't that what you most wanted to hear?

450
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,840
Aren't we good at telling people what they most wanted to hear?

451
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,880
Until recently.

452
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,820
Yeah, well, some of that.

453
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,960
Well, that's a problem.

454
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,740
Yes, that's one for the recording angel.

455
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,640
All over and done with.

456
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,960
Oh, here's my show and tell thing.

457
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,200
Susie the Fruisy brought this while we're on the subject.

458
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,940
Does it ever end?

459
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,860
Barney Bear Comics.

460
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,920
Barney Bear Wakes Up.

461
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,740
It's Kitty's Christian Comics.

462
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,240
Right.

463
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,980
And you know when Barney Bear wakes up,

464
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,600
he's just going to start acting like everybody else.

465
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,000
That's their idea.

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,180
Well, he acts like anyone else in the morning would.

467
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,680
Morning would.

468
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,280
Someone's been sleeping in my baby bear.

469
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,740
He's a healthy bear.

470
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,360
But these pernicious comics are Christian comics

471
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,060
from Spire Publications,

472
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,900
created by Adler.

473
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,380
Al Hartley, who wrote such classics as

474
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,000
Hansi, the Girl Who Loved the Swastika.

475
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,140
That's advertised on the back.

476
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,280
Oh, yeah, that's one of these comics.

477
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,700
So it should be taken cum grano.

478
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay, here's the climactic part of this comic book.

479
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,680
If God can do this for a caterpillar,

480
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,920
just imagine what he can do for us.

481
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,760
Mom, Dad, I found the better part.

482
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,340
The better part of life.

483
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
Let's go, Dad.

484
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,320
I'm ready for my father's business.

485
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,020
And now their business is

486
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,540
telling tourists at Yellowstone about Jesus.

487
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,580
Keep your hands inside the cart.

488
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,380
God loves you.

489
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,080
He sent his son Jesus to give you a better life.

490
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,520
Jesus will be your friend if you ask him.

491
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,900
He wants to be with you for seven years.

492
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,740
Years.

493
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,300
The end.

494
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,100
That's the side of bear rape that doesn't sound good to me.

495
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,140
The seven-year part?

496
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,720
No, the Christian part.

497
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,100
Oh, well, we didn't...

498
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,200
I mean, now it's an unsavory concept.

499
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,980
Before, I was all down with it.

500
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,000
I was rubbing myself with bear attractant.

501
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Sorry, ursine species.

502
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,440
Only humans get saved,

503
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,040
and the bears shall burn in an eternal frying pan.

504
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,240
That's it, Dad!

505
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,860
Yes, only humans have souls,

506
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,700
according to Jehovah One's scribes.

507
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,320
Bears are going to have to look after themselves.

508
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,660
No exceptions.

509
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,000
What about subgeniuses?

510
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,200
Where do we fall into that?

511
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,600
According to them, do we have souls?

512
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,800
We're below the bears.

513
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,060
That's the way the bears like it.

514
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,860
We're removing ourselves,

515
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,580
as surely you among all,

516
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:56,900
Elfman.

517
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,240
You should know from that arena

518
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,560
to avoid the penalties of the Jesus crowd

519
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,680
and their apocalypse.

520
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,060
Yes, ours is one which contains an evasive maneuver, primarily,

521
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,940
but with the deal that Bob brokered with the exists,

522
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,280
we're sure to come out clean.

523
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,220
Duh, of everything.

524
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,460
Bob will clear you out, friends.

525
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,440
Are you clear?

526
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,900
Is your wallet clear?

527
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,840
We can make it clear.

528
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,220
We can audit your wallet.

529
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,100
If you ain't clear now, you'll be clear soon.

530
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,400
We're clear, we're here, get used to it.

531
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,720
Clear.

532
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,000
Right.

533
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,840
Alrighty.

534
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,520
Hey, look, Dr. Hell.

535
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,200
Look, a cassette tape.

536
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,080
When was the last time you saw one of those?

537
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,900
Boy, a quaint old time.

538
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,740
You can buy me a cassette tape.

539
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,240
But wait, there's more.

540
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,240
It's not really a cassette tape.

541
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:10,560
It's really a USB thumb drive disguised as a cassette tape.

542
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,540
Well, there you go.

543
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,760
You can take your cassette mix tape and put it on this thumb drive and still...

544
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,600
I would never find that in all my hundreds and hundreds of cassettes.

545
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,140
And you can buy these from Future Logic Development.

546
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,920
They're called the Future Logic Development Corps.

547
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,380
Corp.

548
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,160
Corpse.

549
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,260
Which happens to also be St. Andrew.

550
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,560
St. An-Juh.

551
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,800
Not to be confused with Andrew the Impaled, who is a different St. Andrew.

552
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,760
We have two St. Andrews here.

553
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:46,540
One of them, who sews your lips shut with surgical needles and thread.

554
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,220
The Infibulator, we call him.

555
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,140
And one who sells LP records.

556
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,100
And this interesting little Paola tape.

557
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,720
The Infibulator, we call him.

558
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,120
And this interesting little Paola tape.

559
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,120


560
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,120


561
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,100
a plug thing, plug subject

562
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,960
which I'm presenting. That's damnable technology.

563
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,080
Well, you can't stop

564
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,600
progress.

565
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,620
Oh, I don't know about that. We're settlers.

566
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,900
We settle for cable. I'll settle for

567
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,800
stopping Congress. There goes Bob.

568
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,740
Oh, yeah.

569
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,100
Reverend Baby Bear is

570
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,240
placing the Bob effigy.

571
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,120
That's not Bob.

572
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
I thought it was some guy with a box on his head.

573
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,660
I really thought it was a

574
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
living organism. What happened to his

575
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,620
hat that was

576
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,300
on the top?

577
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,060
This year's Bob effigy has

578
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,540
a more or less human-like

579
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,580
body, but his

580
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,260
head is square

581
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,540
and he has four faces round

582
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,100
about. Wow, it's like that

583
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,740
mythological thing, Pandildo's box.

584
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,540
Well, like the aliens seen

585
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,320
by the prophet Ezekiel

586
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,040
in the middle of their flying

587
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,900
wheel in the Old Testament.

588
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,440
They also were

589
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,280
multi-faced, facing

590
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,340
in different directions.

591
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,140
And you know, that was what

592
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,280
Ezekiel saw was not the

593
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,320
greys, but an advanced

594
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,480
Certainly. Actually, it was

595
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,180
a runaway exorcist. Far more

596
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,040
advanced than those diddlers,

597
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,660
certainly. Yeah, but

598
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,140
we got a four-headed, I mean a

599
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,640
one-headed, four-faced

600
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,120
Bob effigy with

601
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
strangely spindly

602
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,180
legs. And what a hat.

603
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
I can't wait to see him

604
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,920
bang. All of the victims

605
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,940
can't be chunky. It'll be a burnament.

606
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,800
He's a sporting fellow.

607
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,300
The burnament is

608
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,140
Saturday night.

609
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,520
That's the only thing on the schedule.

610
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,640
On the top, underneath the hat, there's a face.

611
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Okay, so he's got

612
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,600
five. I bet there's a face on the next stump.

613
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,280
I bet he's a six-faced Bob.

614
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,260
A six-faced Bob.

615
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,800
We need to make dice like that

616
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,540
for the subgenius game.

617
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,660
It's just a dog's head on either

618
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,380
face. Faces inside and out.

619
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,780
Oh my, that's too much.

620
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,480
That's a concept.

621
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,040
Always better than not enough.

622
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,420
He can see you from any direction.

623
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,940
I hope he burns

624
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,000
long enough to cook a hot dog on.

625
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,460
The last one did.

626
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,140
A mighty hot dog is our Bob.

627
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,860
Yeah, who was it?

628
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,960
Was it Reverend Fox cooked a hot dog

629
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,920
off of Bob's

630
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,760
dogs? His feet.

631
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,120
Wow.

632
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,100
Reverend Fox, I have a present for you

633
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,640
by the way.

634
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,620
Yeah. It's in his pants.

635
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,000
If you find it,

636
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,560
you can keep it.

637
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,580
Now it's staying. Really.

638
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,060
It's like, it's in the mystery

639
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,480
pants.

640
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,040
The mystery of the leaping

641
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,880
pants. Actually, what it is, is

642
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,900
I was going

643
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,920
through old trash. This is a page

644
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,060
from the last

645
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,880
of the hundred page stark

646
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,080
fist magazines that I published

647
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,180
and lost my ass

648
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,960
on each time.

649
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,600
And it has an article about a hypercube.

650
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,040
Now, if a 3D

651
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,900
cube can cast a 2D

652
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,540
shadow, then a 4D

653
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,920
hypercube can cast a 3D

654
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,100
shadow. And here's a picture

655
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,580
of the hypercube shadow.

656
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,960
We'll project that later

657
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,320
for our listening audience.

658
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,740
In 2D.

659
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,560
But I thought that

660
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,400
Reverend Fox

661
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,740
could use that in his hypercube

662
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,640
graphics.

663
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,520
If he hasn't already.

664
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,980
Here's another

665
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,120
interesting bit of plugola

666
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,240
or payola. This is something

667
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,560
I didn't know we sold.

668
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,280
It's a

669
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,780
puzzle.

670
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,700
That's your Bob crossword.

671
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,380
Jigsaw puzzle.

672
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,240
It's a jigsaw puzzle of the famous

673
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,780
45 Dobbshead graphics done by

674
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,980
Reverend Hartignition.

675
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,860
Guaranteed to give you a whacking

676
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,660
great headache.

677
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,540
I found

678
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,620
this in our cafe press catalog

679
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,600
and I don't remember.

680
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,780
I don't remember putting it there.

681
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,440
So you just went ahead and ordered one.

682
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,460
I bought one so I'd see what we were selling.

683
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,780
And I was so glad it's only 30 pieces.

684
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,040
So it's like it's a real subgenius puzzle.

685
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,040
A subgen... Most puzzles are like

686
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,640
a thousand, fifteen hundred pieces.

687
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,500
Yes, but since each piece

688
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,920
is almost identical,

689
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,860
it's not as easy as it seems.

690
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,320
Look at these huge pieces.

691
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,220
Wow.

692
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:14,880
Yeah.

693
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,760
That gives you a huge field

694
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,960
when you're through and can proudly

695
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,540
display it in your den or rumpus room.

696
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,920
Oh, did we also...

697
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,360
We also have the 45 Dobbsheads on a mouse pad.

698
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,900
Only one. This is the last one.

699
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,460
Everything Must Go by 1998, friends.

700
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,260
Everything Must Go by July 5th, 1998.

701
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,440
It's swag-tastic.

702
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,160
Yeah.

703
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,040
Hey, that's a new one.

704
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,180
Swag-tastic.

705
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,820
We'll have to play that back someday.

706
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,320
Yes?

707
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,260
Swag-tasm.

708
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,500
The motion picture.

709
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,240
Hmm.

710
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,900
What music is that?

711
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,620
What is this? Cut 21?

712
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,220
For the new Bob action figure toy line.

713
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,140
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

714
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,600
Oh, yes.

715
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,280
1978.

716
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,320
That one.

717
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
This is the 1978 version.

718
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,320
You know, I never really saw that one.

719
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,860
I'm...

720
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,600
The Donald Sutherland Body Snatchers?

721
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,120
Yes. I saw the one that was made after that.

722
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,700
And of course I saw the first one.

723
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,420
But that middle one, I guess I was too busy

724
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,880
to go to the movies when that came out.

725
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,100
Oh, that's...

726
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,200
It's actually not bad.

727
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,780
So I understand, and I would recognize

728
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,680
some of the locations and some of the people in it.

729
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,100
I understand.

730
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,940
I remember one line from it.

731
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,600
It has nothing to do with the monsters.

732
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,820
You're charging way too much at this restaurant

733
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,860
to have rat turds in the kitchen.

734
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,340
But, monsieur, that is not a rat turd.

735
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,160
It is a caper.

736
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
Well, if it's a caper, then eat it.

737
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,740
Wah, wah, wah. Busted.

738
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,620
That was a fun movie.

739
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,620
That was the first time we saw...

740
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,180
What's-His-Name.

741
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,880
What's-His-Name.

742
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Yeah, and What's-His-Name.

743
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
And What's-Her-Name.

744
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,360
And What's-His-Face was in that, too.

745
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah.

746
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,340
Yeah.

747
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
And then...

748
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,960
Well, it was hard to tell them apart

749
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,060
because they were just pod people.

750
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,600
Kind of blanks.

751
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,280
But Leonard Nimoy was in that.

752
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
And he was such a cold character

753
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
that you couldn't tell the difference.

754
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,140
Before or after.

755
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,240
Was he some sort of cult leader?

756
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,720
No, he was a psychiatrist.

757
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,920
Oh, okay.

758
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,400
And had noticed that there'd been an outbreak of people

759
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,460
saying, my husband's not my husband.

760
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,320
Well, now, sure, you may think you saw a husband.

761
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,020
It's not...

762
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,260
Not too reassuring somehow.

763
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,100
Hey, watch it.

764
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,400
We're starting to talk about old monster movies again.

765
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,360
It always becomes that, apparently.

766
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Yeah, you start...

767
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,120
How does that happen?

768
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:59,620
You start off on lofty, ascended subjects like J.R. Bob Dobbs, Slack, X-Day, Jehovah One,

769
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,060
and all that.

770
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,880
The important things.

771
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,820
And then you end up talking about invasion of the colossal faceless men.

772
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,820
But that's what brought us here.

773
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,720
That's what brought us to the church.

774
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,300
That is true.

775
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:10,760
That is.

776
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,680
It was my childhood religion, monsters.

777
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,220
That's one of our great commonalities.

778
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,280
They're a language in which one may speak freely,

779
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,340
unless you're a Christian.

780
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


781
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


782
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


783
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


784
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


785
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


786
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,340


787
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,440
And we are determined to rescue the monsters of the world,

788
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,180
the freaky, the beastly, and the downright weird.

789
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,340
Only, how do we find you?

790
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,140
Come on, isn't anybody listening?

791
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,680
Well, you're not going to reach any monsters like that.

792
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,100
No wonder your vlog doesn't have any listeners.

793
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,960
You're using normal internet.

794
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,200
Uh, yeah, that's how it's done.

795
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Uh, yeah.

796
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,760
If you're normal.

797
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,360
You gotta use the monster web.

798
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,060
There's a monster web?

799
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,940
Your TCP IP RIP ports are all glitchy.

800
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,700
Let me just take care of this for you.

801
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,540
Behold, the monster web.

802
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,380
Available anytime, anywhere.

803
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,540
Mind blown.

804
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,000
I think it's time to say to yourself

805
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,780
That I'm happy being me and nobody else

806
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,000
No, no, turn off the shadows

807
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,660
Let's feast the light

808
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,320
Don't have to be afraid, nobody's gonna fight

809
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,760
Come out, little ghouls, wherever you are

810
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,820
Don't have to hide from one another

811
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,000
We need each other, so come out, little ghouls

812
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,160
Together we're strong

813
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,280
Don't have to hide from one another

814
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,480
So won't you come along now?

815
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,520
Now, now, now, now, now

816
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,180
Everyone, come out to death

817
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,100
Be who you are

818
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,240
We're awesome monsters

819
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,400
Let's celebrate

820
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,680
We're better together

821
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,820
Forever and ever and ever in monster high

822
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,000
Hey, little ghouls

823
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,720
Where are you, little ghouls?

824
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,240
Come one, come all

825
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,180
We all have so much in common

826
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,720
Hey, little ghouls

827
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,720
Where are you, all my ghouls?

828
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,600
Let's have a ball

829
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,760
Come on now, it will be awesome

830
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,740
Everyone, come out to death

831
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,700
Be who you are

832
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,840
We're awesome monsters

833
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,940
Let's celebrate

834
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,220
We're better together

835
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,760
Forever and ever and ever in monster high

836
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,600
Everyone, come out to death

837
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,440
Be who you are

838
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,680
We're awesome monsters

839
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,740
Let's celebrate

840
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,960
We're better together

841
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,680
Forever and ever and ever in monster high

842
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,020
If you identify with the hero killing the monster, you're not the material we're looking for.

843
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,740
Yeah, the hero is the cardboard cutout moved into place at the appropriate time.

844
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,360
Go join the army or something.

845
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,340
Villains are the ones that make things happen.

846
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,740
Heroes only react to...

847
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,020
It's the villain who really causes us anything interesting to happen.

848
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,220
But the monsters, the monsters are the subgeniuses.

849
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,680
Yeah.

850
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,100
And Bob is the greatest monster of them all.

851
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,500
King Bob versus Godzilla.

852
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,340
Abbott and Costello meet Bob.

853
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,340
House of Bob-ula.

854
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:41,200
I noticed in that art montage that the bear one somehow didn't make it into that one.

855
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,480
Into that one.

856
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,600
What in that one?

857
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,500
Yes, the one that just passed of all the ones that were...

858
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,200
The ads and so on.

859
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:55,160
You like those Doc Savage covers converted into subgenius things?

860
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:55,480
Yes.

861
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,420
Onan did that.

862
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,080
Yes. How appropriate.

863
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,120
I love James Balmer stuff.

864
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,760
Yeah.

865
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,180
See, did I just pause it?

866
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,180
I don't know. You brightened it up.

867
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,720
Superior mutant.

868
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,060
Doc Savage.

869
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,700
Doc Sewage.

870
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,940
Or kill me, Doc Savage.

871
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,780
Are we doing that again? We're looking at pictures that the audience can't see.

872
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
Careful, kids.

873
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,240
Well, it's radio. They can come up with their own bloody mental pictures.

874
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes, the people here can actually see the pictures. So really there's very little to complain about.

875
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,880
I guess the Hidalgo Corporation was like the Captain Company.

876
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,540
Well, at least you got your stuff from there. Not from the Captain Company.

877
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,960
But back to monsters.

878
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,460
Are not the first stories monster hunt tales?

879
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,060
Of course they are.

880
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
The epics? The first known English...

881
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,380
It took humanity years to clear out those monsters.

882
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,420
Gilgamesh is a monster hunt story. Beowulf...

883
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:06,680
Grendel's attacks upon Heorot and his tussle with Beowulf when his arm was ripped out by the roots.

884
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,620
Me arm.

885
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,940
As every student of English literature does.

886
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:10,940


887
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,680
And then of course there are more modern day creatures like the Jabberwock and so forth.

888
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,720
Moby Dick is a monster hunt story.

889
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,560
Originally Mocha Dick.

890
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,700
Mocha Dick?

891
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,740
Yes. You know, changed for the book.

892
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,480
That's in bad taste.

893
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,780
Sorry, that's the way it is.

894
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,940
The actual whale that the story was based on.

895
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,140
Known as Mocha Dick.

896
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,540
Oh really?

897
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,160
Yeah.

898
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,340
I didn't know that.

899
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,380
Super huge whale. Well, you saw the recent movie.

900
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,700
In the Heart of the Sea.

901
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,260
Yes.

902
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,040
I sought that movie out.

903
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,660
In the 20th century, sperm whales were only known to grow about 40 feet long.

904
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:10,060
But it takes a couple hundred years for them to get as large as that whale was that sank the whaling ship Essex.

905
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:19,460
When they started whaling and sticking members of the pod, this giant monster came and stove the front end into the back end.

906
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:26,780
And then, if the movie is accurate, he continued to torment the survivors in the boats.

907
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,500
Yeah, he followed them across the seas.

908
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,800
Following them for miles.

909
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,660
Yeah.

910
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,060
Doing things to them.

911
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,140
Dogging them. Whaling them.

912
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,600
Yeah.

913
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,440
At the very end of the movie, spoiler alert.

914
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,380
Thor, God of Thunder, is standing there with a harpoon ready.

915
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,320
And the whale just swims right up to their little raft.

916
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,960
They're barely surviving it.

917
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,360
And he somehow can't bring himself to harpoon this thing looking at him with its huge eyes.

918
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,900
Yeah, the whale rolls over and just eyes him as if to say, look, if you guys quit, I'll quit.

919
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,100
And so Thor puts his harpoon down and the mighty whale swims away.

920
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,180
And everybody else says, what are you doing?

921
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,700
He was right there.

922
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,620
That's a fun movie.

923
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,000
It's a great monster movie, actually.

924
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,640
Not a lot of people would, I don't think it was.

925
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,720
A whale of a good movie.

926
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:30,440
Yes, the problem was that it came out at the same time as Star Wars and was forced off the screen by Wookiees and jittering robots.

927
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,360
Yeah, I rushed to sea in the heart of the sea, but I waited for the bootleg.

928
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,780
The Star Wars movie.

929
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,360
I've got my own copy of In the Heart of the Sea.

930
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,780
I saw the Star Wars movie at the new Alamo Drafthouse in San Francisco.

931
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,960
But you know about those, don't you?

932
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,680
No.

933
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,440
These are movie theaters where you order a dinner while you're sitting there.

934
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,980
But they insist that you don't damage the viewing experience.

935
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,680
And if you make a cell phone call, you're thrown out.

936
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:19,400
But the most interesting thing about it is to see the waiters coming duck walking between the seats so they won't get in anybody's way with the tray with your stuff on it.

937
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:27,900
And you order silently by checking off things in a little card at your miniaturized table which swings out by your seat.

938
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,220
And the movie costs about as much as a movie anywhere.

939
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,760
If you're elderly, attenuated, and blasted with antiquity,

940
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,000
you get a senior discount like me.

941
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,420
But once you start ordering this expensive gourmet food,

942
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,620
you're going to spend, you could get a $19 milkshake,

943
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,280
which is supposedly the best milkshake made anywhere.

944
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,220
But then again, what a dent in the wallet.

945
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,680
And other treats are available.

946
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,940
It's not just popcorn.

947
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,760
They make the money off the popcorn.

948
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,520
That's why they make the money.

949
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,360
The popcorn and the soda drinks.

950
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,940
The gevox of lamb in plum jelly or whatever they're...

951
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,780
Or in the dark, it's kind of hard to see what it actually is.

952
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,540
What? What? What? What? What? What was that?

953
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,080
Get in the pipe.

954
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,760
All right, we got our marching orders, kids.

955
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
That was a close one, yeah.

956
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,020
That was a big, it's a big pipe.

957
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:26,920
That's true.

958
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,800
There's a ladder.

959
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,800
A ladder goes up into the bowl.

960
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,500
It all started with that Bob Kane cover for DC Comics.

961
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:34,500


962
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,600
Where a giant Joker was going to smoke Robin and Batman in a huge pipe.

963
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,820
And they were feebly holding up their gloved hands to remonstrate with the Joker.

964
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:55,620
Who looked dementedly insistent with a giant flaming match on turning Gotham's crime fighters to ash.

965
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,500
It's hard to turn down that coffee.

966
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,720
I'm surprised I haven't seen a doctored version of that.

967
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,400
Well, I...

968
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,740
It's...

969
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,780
Somewhere I've seen that item repeatedly recently.

970
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,540
It's in my mind.

971
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,760
I must have seen it somewhere.

972
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,680
I built a giant pipe that you can live in.

973
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,800
It's four stories high.

974
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,400
The stem is a 50, 60 foot hallway.

975
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,120
I can move in there, you say?

976
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,920
If you're in the Minecraft universe, you can.

977
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,600
Oh, I see.

978
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,880
I built it in the virtual reality.

979
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,720
You really showed that old broad down the street.

980
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,900
He was living in the chute with all those kids.

981
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,520
That's right.

982
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,760
I got a pipe, honey.

983
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,600
I got a damn four-story pipe.

984
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,220
It's...

985
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,820
You'll have to visit someday.

986
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,200
My old family smells like feet.

987
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,860
You smell like fine shag and froth.

988
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,140
Rich rum-soaked shag.

989
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,360
I had not thought about that.

990
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,840
The old lady who lives in the chute.

991
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,380
Yeah.

992
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,220
Yeah.

993
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,040
It's not a new chute.

994
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,160
The athlete's foot is a problem.

995
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,340
I've got some cream for that if you need it.

996
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,220
It's like a boot.

997
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,920
Oh, I should mention, by the way, folks, I actually have...

998
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,160
We have a first aid kit and...

999
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,380
I got Bag Bomb.

1000
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,820
And pills.

1001
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,380
That's a first aid kit.

1002
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,560
Yeah, she's got Bag Bomb.

1003
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,360
I've got a magical cream that'll get rid of almost any kind of rash and it really helps with poison.

1004
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,980
Oh, I fell for that too.

1005
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,620
This isn't a joke.

1006
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:28,140
I'm saying this for real because we are at a campground and some of you are absolute idiots.

1007
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,020
And we'll bathe in...

1008
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,560
Hey.

1009
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,220
Or screw in the poison ivy.

1010
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,400
It's been known to happen.

1011
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,220
It happened to Sister Mary Squared one time.

1012
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,460
Nature boy said, hey, let's go into this lovely little grotto here and do it.

1013
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,360
She went to the hospital for that.

1014
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,640
So you've got Bag Bomb, you've got analgesic cream, which you will apply with your own hands.

1015
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,120
We've got analgesic cream.

1016
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,460
Right.

1017
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,880
We've got them kind pills.

1018
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,660
We've got the Jesus J-E-E-Z exclamation point.

1019
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,380
We've got those kind.

1020
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,860
We've got every kind.

1021
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
The kind pills, you might say.

1022
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:08,940
Ibuprofen.

1023
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,700
Them kind pills.

1024
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,960
Wasp attractant.

1025
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,900
In an emergency, you never know when you need that.

1026
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,640
You brought that?

1027
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,620
Sure.

1028
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,860
I always bring it to X Day.

1029
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,660
I thought...

1030
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,820
Why do you think they stay on you instead of me?

1031
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:29,160
There was one X Day where I seem to remember that somebody took the wasp attractant out of the car.

1032
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,740
Wasp attractant?

1033
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,300
Yeah.

1034
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,520
But then somebody else put it back, I guess.

1035
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,760
But I think it was even you who said, we don't need this at X Day.

1036
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,660
And now there you are flogging it.

1037
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,200
Yeah.

1038
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,160
Wasp attractant.

1039
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,080
You never know when you're going to need something like that.

1040
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,920
Attract yellow jackets also.

1041
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,420
Well, they are wasps.

1042
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,380
Oh, I had a great...

1043
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,060
I had a field day with those big red wasps at our Texas house.

1044
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,500
They must have a nest in there somewhere.

1045
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,560
They get born and then they can't escape.

1046
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:12,320
They bang their heads against the windows over and over again until they finally drop to the floor where, damn it, the hound dog eats them.

1047
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,920
Without getting stung?

1048
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,940
Oh, they're dead.

1049
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,580
But he loves them.

1050
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,380
He loves them.

1051
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,580
They're big.

1052
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,400
They could still get stuck.

1053
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,420
These are like this big.

1054
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,020
They could still get stuck.

1055
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:21,680
They're crunchy.

1056
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,040
They're very tough.

1057
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,560
They're difficult to kill.

1058
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,500
They are.

1059
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,980
I have happened to...

1060
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,300
Surprisingly difficult to kill.

1061
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,600
I had leather...

1062
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,000
Really thick leather gloves on.

1063
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,260
It just came in.

1064
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,900
There was a wasp bothering Wee Ma Ma.

1065
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,160
How awful.

1066
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,720
And I stunned it with a fly swatter and then I just decided, well, I'll just smush it with this glove.

1067
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,740
And I couldn't.

1068
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,920
Like his head was too hard to crush.

1069
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,580
I finally...

1070
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,320
I guess I...

1071
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,620
I think I threw him down the disposal.

1072
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,760
Now, I'm the kind of person who carries insects out of the house, honestly.

1073
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,960
A regular Buddha over here.

1074
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,240
Yeah.

1075
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,280
Yeah.

1076
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,320
I'm a Jainist.

1077
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,820
That's what Ed Kemper had to do with his mother's bitching vocal cords, putting down the garbage disposal.

1078
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:16,120
Venomous snakes and wasps, if they wander into the wrong place, my job is to hunt the monster.

1079
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:16,700
Sorry.

1080
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,840
That's just the way it goes.

1081
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,940
It's them or us.

1082
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,040
And you don't let...

1083
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,260
You don't...

1084
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,520
Oh, our music is gone.

1085
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,340
If music be the food of love, play on.

1086
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,360
But really, you know, it's like a moral decision.

1087
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,920
Every time you deal with a bug in the house...

1088
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,020
But you were so polite to Elroy yesterday.

1089
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,700
Him being a locust and all.

1090
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,420
Well, I don't...

1091
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,860
Both he and Stang are visitors.

1092
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,700
I'm not...

1093
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,060
I'm not...

1094
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,500
I don't have bug fear.

1095
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,540
I have bug love.

1096
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,740
I love bugs.

1097
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,600
Including that cute Volkswagen that can talk.

1098
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,440
I was afraid you were gonna mention that.

1099
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,760
You put eyelashes on the headlights so you don't feel so inverted.

1100
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,380
I love all life.

1101
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,440
I'm gonna rupture up all earth animals onto my escape vessel.

1102
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,940
On the Lovecraft.

1103
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:14,380
Including the thousands, untold thousands of tons of microorganisms that live underground.

1104
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,720
That far outweigh all...

1105
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,360
They weigh all surface life.

1106
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,140
Yes, outweigh all life on the surface of the earth.

1107
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,280
They are the weight of the earth.

1108
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,960
And they don't need sunlight to do their stuff.

1109
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,980
I work well at night.

1110
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,400
I must be microbial.

1111
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,560
Based on Spirochete.

1112
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,360
Stang ranch ambient sounds.

1113
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,860
We're at a campground.

1114
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,580
We don't need that.

1115
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,800
We're going to wallow in nostalgia now?

1116
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,780
No, no, no, no, no.

1117
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,020
Is that the farting of the earth sound on there?

1118
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,120
They're like the mudas noises that have been reported.

1119
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,040
Strange creakings, rumblings, and sounds that the earth makes.

1120
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,400
Restive...

1121
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,280
Low frequency noise.

1122
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,700
For all of creation is awake and complaining.

1123
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:44,180
I'm totally awake.

1124
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,740
vesomar Also awake.

1125
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,140
All?

1126
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,140


1127
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,140


1128
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,140


1129
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,140
Get a job out with degrees you should learn from.

1130
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,400
Like me?

1131
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
B PLAYER AT A CLUB.

1132
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,080

Thank you.

1140
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,460
Thank you.

1142
00:54:59,920 --> 00:54:59,980

1147
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,140
This is my very first

1148
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,680
All Monsters show.

1149
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,780
I'm so excited to be here

1150
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,740
just for you.

1151
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,000
Just for this occasion.

1152
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,800
Let me hear it, Monsters!

1153
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,820
We are the Monstars, Monstars, we are the Monstars

1154
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,460
Slippin' on the sea and I'm feelin' real good

1155
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,020
I'm just bein' me just like a monster should

1156
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,900
Let's have a good time, live your life out loud

1157
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,880
Visionary, legendary, bring that monster out

1158
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,120
We're gonna dance, dance, dance the Friday way

1159
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,060
We are, we are, we are, we're the Monstars, Monstars

1160
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:27,740
We are, we are, we are, we're the Monstars, Monstars

1161
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,500

1163
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,480
It's time to celebrate!

1164
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,240
Well, monsters, ghouls, creeps, and geeks, you heard it here first.

1165
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,780
Monster High is here to stay.

1166
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,780
And while we monsters haven't quite learned to live with humans just yet,

1167
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,200
I'm certain the day will still come.

1168
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:15,400
In the meantime, we have a pretty sweet monster ambassador for us out in the human world.

1169
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,260
Mom?

1170
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,940
For the first time in ages, monsters were truly coming out of hiding.

1171
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,440
One monster step at a time.

1172
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,240
Because, as you know, it's not impossible, just challenging.

1173
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,820
Hey, I'm trying to impart words of wisdom here.

1174
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,800
Can't you see?

1175
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,260
Don't be afraid of your glow.

1176
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,560
No more.

1177
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,020
No more hiding in the dark.

1178
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,960
You're alive, be who you are.

1179
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,520
And I'm gonna shine so that everyone knows.

1180
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,200
I'm on top of the world, gotta let you know.

1181
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,740
Feeling so amazing, just the way I am.

1182
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,280
Nothing is ever impossible.

1183
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,900
Feeling so amazing.

1184
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,440
Yeah.

1185
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,340
Just the way I am.

1186
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,620
Just me and me.

1187
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,560
I want everyone to see.

1188
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,420
Just me and me.

1189
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,400
I want everyone to see.

1190
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,820
I'm on top of the world, gotta let you know.

1191
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,400
Feeling so amazing, just the way I am.

1192
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,400
Just the way I am.

1193
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,600
Just the way I am.

1194
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:40,960
Mom?

1195
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,580
Mom?

1196
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,400

Mom?

1200
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:43,860
Mom?

1201
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:44,320
Mom?

1202
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,340
Mom?

1203
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:44,880
Mom?

1204
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,320
Mom?

1205
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:45,380


1206
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:45,460
Mom?

1207
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,540
We're the best.

1208
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:46,840
Alright.

1209
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:46,840


1210
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:46,840


1211
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:46,840


1212
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:46,840


1213
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:46,840


1214
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,600
