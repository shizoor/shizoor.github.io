1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
One, two, one, two!

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,400
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,200
Number 1,653 or 63 or 4, I can't remember.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:29,900
Anyway, yeah, we're here in Glen Rose, Texas, broadcasting from Tarzan's radio station.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,820
And this is going to be the greatest show ever.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,760
I just know it.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
I can feel it in my buds.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,860
Quiet in there.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,880
Quiet, dear friends.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,780
Quiet out there in the audience.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,200
Quiet.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,420
I can't hear myself think.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,740
Who is that?

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,940
Quiet out there.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,760
And I mean quiet.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,000
That was Icky Twerp himself.

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,800
Ah.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,940
That was the guy that introduced the Three Stooges and Popeye cartoons on Channel 11

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,600
and Fort Worth all through the 50s and 60s.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,980
And he was the horror host who hosted Nightmare, which showed the universal classic horror

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,080
movies and much worse things.

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,200
And yes, yes, yes.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,440
We're here to share our bountiful, bountiful slack.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,180
And try to make it a little bit more fun.

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,980
And try to remember what all the terrible problems are in the world.

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:33,080
Because for some reason when we start the show, we just seem to forget all those burdens

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,820
and all the troubles.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,600
Because it's the hour, the one hour where we get slack.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,060
Saw those troubles fall away.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,060
We're able to just soar with happiness and slack.

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,460
Slack.

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:50,480
So.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,320
Let's listen to something slackful right now.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,800
All right.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
Okay let's get out of this.

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,960
Gotta say something.

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,460
Gotta form.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,200
Gotta produce.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,920
Gotta record.

41
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,900
Gotta sell it.

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,920
It's okay.

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,920
It's okay.

44
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,540
It's okay.

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,920
It's okay.

46
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,180
It's okay.

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,960
It's okay.

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,480
It's okay.

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,060
It's okay.

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,280
It's okay.

51
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,360
It's okay.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,840
It's okay.

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:17,840


54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:17,940
It's okay.

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,820
It's okay.

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,080
It's okay.

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,120
It's okay.

58
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,580
It's okay.

59
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,160
It's okay.

60
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,160


61
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,160


62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,080
AHHHHHHHHH

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
Take the attention you might want to move

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,280
What?

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,040
AHHHHHHHHH

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,300
AHHHHHHHHH

67
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,760
AHHHHHHHHH

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Bob, this is the hour of slack

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,060
Praise Bob

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,980
Brace yourself

71
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,420
AHHHHHHHHH

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,160
Bob

73
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,900
AHHHHHHHHH

74
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,780

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,880
Good show to me Bob

79
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,320
Thanks

80
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,040
Good energy

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,460
Yeah

82
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,500
Okay I got it

83
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay I got it

84
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,940
Okay I got it

85
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,360
Okay I got it

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,800
Credit is due to Reverend Cool Hand Chris who did the collages we've been hearing

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,300
Now this is all in theory because I haven't actually put any of this together yet

88
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,760
This is a good thing

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,880
This is one of those shows

90
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,000
AHHHHHHHHH

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,340
AHHHHHHHHH

92
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,860
AHHHHHHHHH

93
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,020
Okay now that all the credits have been done

94
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,780
For stuff that we don't know what it'll be yet

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,740
Let's try Lonesome Cowboy Dave

96
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,480
Yes let's try Lonesome Cowboy Dave

97
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,960
I want to talk to him

98
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,060
AHHHHHHHHH

99
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,600
AHHHHHHHHH

100
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,300
AHHHHHHHHH

101
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:46,680
AHHHHHHHHH

102
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,100
AHHHHHHHHH

L-E-L-O

The low note

Pea

Pea

113
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,640
It's the day.

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,780
This is like the third show that the first thing he talked about was nostrils and nasal stuff.

115
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
I keep trying to do these things.

116
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,500
Not my atomic submarines or any of those police force alien, you know, elementatas.

117
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,720
Your discharges as opposed to your depth charges, right?

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,800
Yeah.

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,120
In a gastric sense, perhaps even more so.

120
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,300
Because the depth charge in your stomach is so much worse than the discharge that follows.

121
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Oh, wait.

122
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,560
No, I guess.

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,080
The eschewer.

124
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,740
The discharge is...

125
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,160
The variable eschewer, yes.

126
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah, I had some...

127
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,360
I ate some soup that had turned, I think.

128
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm starting to feel that little depth charge myself.

129
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, many soups do become Communist Party members after the Fourth of July celebrations.

130
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,740
No, man.

131
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,180
Joe McCarthy was framed.

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,900
He was framed, I tell you.

133
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,900
He was a great American hero.

134
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,940
Actually, I have an...

135
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,640
I have an...

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,180
I have an unfortunate friend whose obsession is that.

137
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,540
Thinking that Joe McCarthy was a hero?

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah, Joe McCarthy was a hero.

139
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,180
He was right about all the commies in the U.S.

140
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,140
The CIA knew it, and they were the ones who shut him down because they're the commies.

141
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:08,120
Yes, this particular friend is a very old and cranky Trump supporter.

142
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,100
Yes.

143
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,420
Yes.

144
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,620
Yes.

145
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,900
Very, very, very old.

146
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,840
Older than you and me, Dave, even though his birthday is a lot sooner.

147
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,720
He's a lot older.

148
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,420
Well, everyone's...

149
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,180
I guess that's the new thing that's going to be happening.

150
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,060
Everybody's birthday is going to be sooner than previously posthumed.

151
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,260
Meaning you're going to actually have to pretend you've been dead for 10 years,

152
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,420
and then they'll put you in a 15-year spin overdrive.

153
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,620
And I would think that would be something that the Church of the Subgenius,

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,480
if for God's sake, if for the love of Dobbs,

155
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,800
if they could put something together to stop this awful expressionism

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,140
and measurements of bad behavior.

157
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm getting so sick and tired of it, I think I'm going to...

158
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm not going to join the Republican Party.

159
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,280
But I'm certainly not going to join the Republican Party.

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,160
But what can the Church of the Subgenius do about this, Dave?

161
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,400
I mean, we're not as big...

162
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,860
I don't know.

163
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,360
We're not as big as the Republican Party or even the Democrats.

164
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,820
We're not even as big as the Scientology Party.

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,160
We are bigger than the People's Temple.

166
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,720
Of course, it's not growing anymore.

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,120
Yeah, the People's Temple, as they used to call it.

168
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,760
I remember that.

169
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,600
It was back in 1922.

170
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,540
That was a great band.

171
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,420
Unfortunately, that was the band of the guy I was just talking about.

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,200
But let's go past that.

173
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,260
Yeah.

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
My favorite band right now is Russian Robo Patrol.

175
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Russian Robo Patrol?

176
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,080
Yeah.

177
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
Russian Robo Troll.

178
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,020
Russian Robo Troll.

179
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:44,520


180
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,420
You know, that is a very, very popular band.

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,860
I hear them constantly.

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,740
In fact, almost every time I listen to the comments section, if anything,

183
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,240
anywhere, I hear the Russian Robo Troll band.

184
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,880
And they were giving out two tampons to you,

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,040
two fresh ones that hadn't been used before,

186
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,480
to both men and women.

187
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,760
And some guys, your limit was two.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,620
And some guys were taking...

189
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,920
And two, and they didn't even need one.

190
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,120
I certainly don't...

191
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't understand that at all.

192
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,560
It makes very, very little sense to me.

193
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,760
Well, but sell them on the black market

194
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,780
to really, really poor people

195
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,740
who can't get tampons any other way.

196
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,120
Yeah.

197
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,500
Because they're also men.

198
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,760
Or men, women.

199
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,220
Or women, men, women.

200
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,820
Kind of makes me cry.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,140
And everybody...

202
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,360
You know, right now, the law is down on women,

203
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,800
and men, women, and anything that's even slightly confusing.

204
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,860
They want to make sure everything's really squared off,

205
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,220
90-degree angles.

206
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,060
Clear delineation.

207
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,740
Blockhead.

208
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,180
Yes.

209
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,800
Yeah.

210
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,560
I saw another one of them, too,

211
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,720
had both like a female and a male icon in front of a restroom,

212
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,100
meaning anybody who ever got in there first could use it.

213
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,680
That's just as good.

214
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,760
Think what could happen.

215
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,200
A man could walk in on a woman

216
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,620
and see something he'd never seen.

217
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,940
Or vice versa.

218
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,380
Apparently, that's what the lock is for.

219
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,880
Oh, oh, oh.

220
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,300
Why do I always forget the lock?

221
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,560
On purpose.

222
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,220
I bet you do.

223
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,860
I see you look at a squinty little eyeball

224
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,880
staring at a bare-naked 52-year-old woman

225
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,440
with her eyes full of gossip and shocks

226
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,240
and cruel diatribes against her daughter-in-law.

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,800
Well, it's not me looking at them.

228
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,980
I just always wondered what they would think

229
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,620
of the way I do number three.

230
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:40,900
Number three?

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,360
Uh-huh.

232
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,960
I mean, I can't really do number three.

233
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,840
Bob, only Bob can do number one, number two, and number three.

234
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,560
And I don't really even know what number three is.

235
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,980
I know he has to stand in front of this machine and groan.

236
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,180
But I like to think, you know, I like to pretend that I...

237
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,980
What would a 52-year-old naked lady think

238
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,320
if she walked into the unisex bathroom

239
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
and there I was doing number three?

240
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,040
I could say something really gross, but I don't think I would.

241
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,440
Go ahead. We can cut it later.

242
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,820
Go ahead.

243
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
Well, it could...

244
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,460
Number three could be the diverter bag...

245
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,020
Emptying?

246
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,980
Emptying, yeah.

247
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,760
Well, it's a common usage...

248
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,180
No, no, because...

249
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,860
It's a common usage on radio right now,

250
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,100
on the above-ground radio.

251
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,080
I heard a commercial.

252
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,040
They said, I...

253
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,420
Well, it looks to me like number three,

254
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,920
or you can't tell whether it's one or two.

255
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,400
And the other guy was talking about being

256
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,540
less than 45 feet from the bathroom.

257
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,780
And it was some kind of, you know,

258
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,140
anti-diarrhea medicine.

259
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,960
And they called it number three,

260
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,760
right on the radio, on the AM radio,

261
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,420
on some stupid commercial.

262
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,780
Number three.

263
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,140
Number three being diarrhea.

264
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,920
Yeah, well, where can I get this medicine?

265
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,940
Quick. I mean, right now.

266
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,640
Hurry.

267
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,660
Oh, too late. Oh, man.

268
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,220
Well, you need your sausage...

269
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,380
Sausage flavor...

270
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,160
It was the dog. It was the dog that did it.

271
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,900
Buddy did that.

272
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,980
Oh, you're blaming it on Buddy now.

273
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,260
Yeah.

274
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,020
Oh, poor Buddy.

275
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,420
He didn't do it.

276
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,560
Did he hear us talking about him?

277
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,360
He's a good boy.

278
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,820
He's upstairs chewing on his rawhide.

279
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,940
Chewing on his rocks.

280
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,660
Booludin' booludin'.

281
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,340
He's got all the rocks he can chew on out here.

282
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,840
I got in trouble with a teacher for saying

283
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,980
he was chewing a rock,

284
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,460
but actually I was just a witness.

285
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,320
The guy used to stuff Clark bars in his mouth

286
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,620
when he'd go into the laboratory

287
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,120
behind the children's back

288
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,960
to go and get a specimen to show them.

289
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,600
And he'd go in there and he'd say,

290
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
in the geology part stuff that they were showing,

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,260
he'd go in there and he'd go get a rock and stuff.

292
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,540
And he'd stuff like a Clark bar in his mouth

293
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,860
and be chomping away on it.

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,340
And he walks back into the lecture hall and stuff.

295
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,860
He's tossing the rock up and down.

296
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,240
He's chomping away on something.

297
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,760
And somebody screams out,

298
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,680
Jesus Christ, he's eating a rock!

299
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,260
Well, now that may seem funny to us now,

300
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,760
but in the future that will just be,

301
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,100
you know,

302
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,580
that won't be much to eat.

303
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,180
But rocks.

304
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,780
And guess what?

305
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,640
We have to sell the rubes.

306
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,400
Plenty of.

307
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,060
That's about all we have is rocks.

308
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,740
But rocks, too.

309
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,380
The soft, squishy kind.

310
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,780
No, no.

311
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,280
No, we only have limestone.

312
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Every kind of limestone you can think of.

313
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,500
And they're great with vinegar.

314
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
When you pour vinegar on limestone,

315
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,140
it fizzes.

316
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,440
It does.

317
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,280
It really does.

318
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,900
He's not kidding.

319
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,580
After Twangies,

320
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,980
I remember that.

321
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,140
You know, we haven't done our hydrochloric acid experiments yet.

322
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,360
We've got the acid.

323
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,060
We have the rubber gloves.

324
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
I even have a gas mask that I've never used

325
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,860
just for dropping big, chunky rocks that I suspect

326
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,360
might have cool fossils inside into the vat.

327
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,720
We haven't done that.

328
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,560
That was an experiment we were working towards.

329
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,940
And, yeah, we haven't done the acid test

330
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,580
out here.

331
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,360
We haven't done the acid test out here at the ranch yet.

332
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,760
With the acid.

333
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,600
I mean the real hydrochloric acid.

334
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,920
It's watered down over there.

335
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,940
Yeah, because that's what you clean stones with, isn't it?

336
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,720
Yeah, it is.

337
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,160
Yeah.

338
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,120
But you can't use it like it's just regular detergent or something,

339
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
or you'll go blind or have it be cold.

340
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,380
You can't.

341
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,240
I know what you're really thinking.

342
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,180
No, you can't use it like LSD.

343
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,720
You can't use it like that kind of acid.

344
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,180
Oh, man, they told me there was too much acid in the orange juice,

345
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,800
and I thought it was LSD.

346
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,440
Actually, I suppose it would work if you...

347
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,980
If you put it on your tongue, it would just burn a hole in your tongue,

348
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,060
and you wouldn't trip.

349
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,580
But if you put it on the very top of your head in an undiluted way,

350
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,760
eventually it might make its way down past the skull and brain barrier,

351
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,920
and maybe you would trip a bit.

352
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,580
I don't think I want to try that.

353
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,620
You know, there are some forms of rock and stone cookery.

354
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,960
There's stone soup.

355
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,360
You've heard of stone soup, haven't you?

356
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,200
Yeah.

357
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,500
I have.

358
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,460
They use that on despots and trumps, don't they?

359
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,980
No, no, that's what the poor people use.

360
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah, stone soup is where you just have a pot and a stone and some water,

361
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,860
and then everyone brings, you know...

362
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
You get stoned on the pot.

363
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,300
Yeah, man, cool!

364
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,840
It's the con stone, dude!

365
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,540
Native Americans have been using that for thousands of years,

366
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,680
and everybody had their own soup stones.

367
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,860
They used to call them, and they'd be real pretty or really super good ones.

368
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,120
They'd just toss it in there, and automatically all the veggies cook right up,

369
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,640
like in five seconds and stuff.

370
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,400
Wow.

371
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,900
Magic stone.

372
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,800
In Bob's prophecy, there really is a magic stone that will give you everything you want.

373
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,360
It's called MWOM.

374
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,480
It's really the most sophisticated computery system imaginable.

375
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,660
It's nanobots that form the dust coating your walls, and they protect you.

376
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,680
MWOM.

377
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,740
If someone attacks you, it saps them and stops them.

378
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:07,840
You're insulting me.

379
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,700
It's a magic stone.

380
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,780
It's a magic stone that can stop them and cures their criminal tendencies,

381
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,400
and vice versa, if you have bad thoughts, it can zap you and make you normal again.

382
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,160
Or subgenius, as the case may be.

383
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,100
It depends on what you want.

384
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,760
It's a very beneficial AI that will control everything all the time, forever.

385
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,560
But it might be...

386
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,660
After X-Day.

387
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,040
And you'll never have to take more normalin.

388
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,640
Now, wait a minute.

389
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,580
You'd be taking normalin, but you said you would continue...

390
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,200
More normalin.

391
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,940
More normalin.

392
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,420
More normalin.

393
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,820
You wouldn't be taking more...

394
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,720
I'd take 50 milligrams every half an hour.

395
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,740
Oh, God.

396
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,280
Actually, I wish I could get more normalin, but they say I'm already normal.

397
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,180
The fools.

398
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,580
If I could get some more normalin...

399
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,380
No, they must not know.

400
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,700
You see, if you're not normal, it gets you really high.

401
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,040
If you're normal, it just makes you more normal.

402
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,560
Yeah, I was thinking if you could fool them like that, perhaps you'd get huge amounts of normalin.

403
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:07,560


404
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,120
I don't know how many dollars I'd get.

405
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm thinking about that.

406
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,100
I don't even know if there is one.

407
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,380
Well, in name only these days.

408
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,140
Well, righteously so, but I don't know what I'm talking about.

409
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,740
I don't either.

410
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,980
I really don't either.

411
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,540
I don't either.

412
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,860
I have never...

413
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,560
I've been afraid to get on the welfare system.

414
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,540
I could probably qualify, but I'm afraid to because then the man would have me wrapped up in a...

415
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,820
I'd be wrapped around his little dewclaw.

416
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,180
...beyond his radar.

417
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,920
Right, because you don't qualify for anything.

418
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,480
I wish.

419
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,100
That would be so great to not qualify for anything.

420
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
They'd leave you alone.

421
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,300
You wouldn't get any junk mail.

422
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,440
You wouldn't get bills.

423
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,220
You wouldn't get anything.

424
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,620
You don't qualify for anything.

425
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,180
Sorry, you don't qualify.

426
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,000
You can't have a job or be a slave.

427
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,820
You don't qualify for slavery.

428
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,100
Oh, no.

429
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,460
Gosh, I'll just have to go support myself.

430
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,400
How terrible.

431
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,080
How awful.

432
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,920
Listen to this music in the background.

433
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,540
You can't hear it.

434
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,520
Poor Dave can't hear it.

435
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,660
Dave can't hear it.

436
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,040
It's not in the good part now.

437
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:29,700
It's beautiful because it's charming classical music with a Jew's heart.

438
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,600
A Jaws heart.

439
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Jaws heart.

440
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,240
You can say...

441
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,940
Go ahead.

442
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,880
You can say that word.

443
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm sorry.

444
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,400
Right.

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,240
Go ahead and say it.

446
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,360
Jew's heart.

447
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,060
That's what it is.

448
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,460
It's a Jew's heart.

449
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:40,960
Right.

450
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,800
You and Howard Stern have the right to say that.

451
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,220
Just like the flower, the wandering Jew flower.

452
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,440
I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying that.

453
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,900
Do you have to say jaw, wandering jaw flower?

454
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:59,980
If you're an Anglo, you know, wasp guy, kinda, yeah, that's kinda what you're supposed to say.

455
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,760
That's just silly and you're full of bologna and cheese sandwiches.

456
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,420
Did you say bologna and Jew sandwiches?

457
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,980
I did not.

458
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think you said cheese sandwiches, right?

459
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,040
I did not say bologna and Jew sandwiches.

460
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,960
I said bologna and cheese sandwiches.

461
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,700
We really can't say that.

462
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,660
You're all quoting Willie Allen right now and I'm getting a very big headache thinking about it.

463
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,060
I know.

464
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,400
I understand.

465
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,100
Let's just move on.

466
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,700
Yes.

467
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,480
Let's move on.

468
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,660
I could say I felt nauseous, but you did it.

469
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:29,800
Oh.

470
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,400
I feel like a rumored Philistine, if you know what I'm talking about in sideways language.

471
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,720
I don't make any sense of why that's happening.

472
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
A rumored Philistine?

473
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,820
Is that what he said?

474
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:50,420
Yeah, meaning I'm a person of low intellect and so forth and don't support the arts.

475
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,060
I support myself with, never mind.

476
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,020
That's blasphemy.

477
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,180
Yeah, he supports himself with a supporter.

478
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,300
That is blasphemy.

479
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,700
I know what you mean by supporter.

480
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,220
I'm a supporter.

481
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,200
You cannot be making those claims about me.

482
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,040
He's got a lot of straps.

483
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,540
You need to be ready.

484
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,920
The supporter has a lot of straps, doesn't it, Dave?

485
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,880
And little buckles.

486
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,140
Well, yeah.

487
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,120
If you wear a jockstrap on your head and you take one of your sister's dresses and drape

488
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,300
it around your neck and drive through the neighborhood on your bicycle going geek, geek,

489
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,400
geek, geek, geek like that there, you know?

490
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,760
Yeah.

491
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,580
On your paper route.

492
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,820
On your paper route.

493
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,760
You could grow up to be even more warped than ever.

494
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,580
It's just like you pop.

495
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,140
You've seen too many pop-up cars.

496
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,760
Or cartoons.

497
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,300
How did he know I'd referred to Popeye cartoons on the little bit before we even called it?

498
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,660
Cosmic connection.

499
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,920
You see, that's the weird thing about Hour of Slack is you'll hear somebody say something

500
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,140
at the beginning of the show and in the middle of the show somebody else will refer to it

501
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,200
except that, and you think that it's connected.

502
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
But it's not.

503
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,580
It's just a coincidence.

504
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,900
But that person didn't hear it at the beginning of the show, right.

505
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,360
Yeah.

506
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,120
It's like some spasmodic dance that people do in their own home.

507
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,120


508
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,720
They're underpants and they don't even know they're part of a satanic ritual.

509
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,940
Well, it's like the background projections at a subgenius show.

510
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:13,440
It's got like a different little bad film clip or news clip or old still photograph or

511
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,700
bob art or something every half second.

512
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,100
It's just hammering, throwing a million images at you and some preacher is preaching up on

513
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,820
the stage and about every tenth image seems to perfectly fit what the preacher's talking about.

514
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,120
Absolutely.

515
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,040
Now, this is just pure chance.

516
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,700
But random synchronicities do happen.

517
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,300
But it works.

518
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,920
Random synchronicity, well, it's just random.

519
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,180
It's not synchronicity.

520
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,440
There's no such thing.

521
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,240
Yeah.

522
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,460
Sorry.

523
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,600
Sorry, everybody.

524
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,960
There's no such thing as synchronicity.

525
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,980
It's just coincidence.

526
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
That's all it is.

527
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
There's no plan.

528
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,200
You're the one who gives it meaning.

529
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,300
You're the one who makes the connections.

530
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,920
Your mind is the god that makes it all make sense.

531
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,120
Well, then my mind is God.

532
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,460
God.

533
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,060
Yeah.

534
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,800
God.

535
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,140
The face of God.

536
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,620
Is it the face you ever knew?

537
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:14,400
Man, that makes me want to play one of those Bob Walkenhorst songs that he wrote outside

538
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,540
of the Rainmakers.

539
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,960
The face of God.

540
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,520
No, child of God is the scariest bug.

541
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,580
No, the face of God is every face you ever knew.

542
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:21,900
I know.

543
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,940
But the child of God is the scariest bug I ever saw.

544
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,900
You're back on the child of God.

545
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,100
Yeah.

546
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,260
The child of God.

547
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,440
Yes.

548
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,780
Yes.

549
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,880
The Jerusalem cricket.

550
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,380
Yeah, you're freaking me out right now.

551
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,320
The Jerusalem cricket.

552
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,680
Yes.

553
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:32,920
Yeah.

554
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,900
Princess Wee has this weird fear of this simple, humble animal called the Jerusalem

555
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,420
cricket.

556
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,680
It happens to, by coincidence, not synchronicity, have a face that looks like a human skull.

557
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,600
And it's kind of a large-

558
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,500
Well, yeah, I think I've seen that.

559
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,300
I'm familiar with that.

560
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:48,520
Yeah.

561
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah.

562
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Pale cricket.

563
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,560
There's the death's head moth, too.

564
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,940
This is all just coincidence.

565
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,960
It's not Satan working.

566
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,200
It's not rock stars managing-

567
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,240
It's getting chills.

568
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,020
Intelligent design.

569
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,960
It's just a coincidence.

570
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,460
You're saying it's not David Bowie or any other-

571
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,320
It's not David Bowie or Boo.

572
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,460
... the reptile of early in 1980s.

573
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,400
It's not the-

574
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Wait.

575
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,280
It could be, couldn't it?

576
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,140
I mean, couldn't he have-

577
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,500
Hey, Dave, hold on.

578
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,100
Hold on, Dave.

579
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,640
... like if he were to get a zoning covariate?

580
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,520
Dave, you have to stop talking for a minute.

581
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:22,740
He can't hear.

582
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,240
I have to listen to something for a minute.

583
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,180
He can't hear.

584
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,680
... a man's voice.

585
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,180
He can't hear.

586
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,180


587
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:43,780
Dave, I had to stop and listen to theme from Summer Place, sung by Lolita in German.

588
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,700
The reason is it was one of my mom's favorite songs.

589
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,960
I thought it was a theme song from Lolita sung by a German dressed up as an animal.

590
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,480
No, that cut comes up next.

591
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,180
Oh, yeah.

592
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,720
I love that.

593
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,920
... on camera 3.

594
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,260
...

595
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,440
...

596
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,340
...

597
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,980
...

598
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,700
...

599
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:07,700


600
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:07,700


601
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:07,700


602
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,180
He's kind of matching up.

603
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,460
Yeah.

604
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,760
Again, it's coincidence.

605
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,940
It's not magic.

606
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,540
...

607
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,900
...

608
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,440
...

609
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,440


610
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,880
Not bad, Dave, considering he can't hear the music.

611
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,040
...

612
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,040


613
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,560
I thought it was a pretty good psychic meter.

614
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,060
You don't have to really hear it.

615
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,760
It's like we used to go play conscience at the Columbus School for the Deaf,

616
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,020
and they couldn't hear real notes or anything like that,

617
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,600
but the beat somehow got through into their tympanic eardrums,

618
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,400
and all their troubles were melted away like a candy bar.

619
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,380
Yeah, deaf people can dance.

620
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,200
Oh, they have dance parties. Absolutely.

621
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Deaf can dance. That was a very funny humorous phrase that went around.

622
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,520
You feel it in your gut, especially if they go to like a loud, heavy metal punk concert.

623
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,920
Or disco.

624
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,360
Yeah, you don't have to have ears for that.

625
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,980
You only have to have feet. You can feel it through the floor.

626
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,200
That's how I shot my hearings, how I wrecked my sight.

627
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,160
Oh, boy, I dreamed of that the other night.

628
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,820
I think people were like, once again, not passing out tampons

629
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,560
or revealing the secrets of the mighty third nostril.

630
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,020
They were actually going through everybody's papers,

631
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,000
like they were checking them out to see if they were in the right place at the right time.

632
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,320
That's kind of scary.

633
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,340
That is scary.

634
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,060
They are going through everybody's papers, checking them twice.

635
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
They're trying to find out who's naughty and nice.

636
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,320
Well, they're going to decide everybody's been naughty.

637
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,400
And they'll nicely squish us like a summer turnip.

638
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
Like a summer place.

639
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,000
But they're not going to let us.

640
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,800
Be naughty or nice.

641
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,900
They're going to keep that information on file until they need to move us into the Patriot camps.

642
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,220
But it's okay. We'll get snacks.

643
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,540
P's told us.

644
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,020
Yeah, let us.

645
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,520
We're in the Patriot camps. They're not that bad. We'll get snacks.

646
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,900
If P said it, then you could bank on it.

647
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,980
Anti-psychotic parallel bars.

648
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,320
They have little games and dances.

649
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,540
They single out the children sometimes.

650
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,840
And make sure that they get them.

651
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah.

652
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,000


653
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,940
And do the most important dance.

654
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,040
There's the shoharis, you know, the magnetic beings that scare the Indians around.

655
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,340
Sometimes.

656
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,180
Oh, it's wonderful.

657
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,420
I cried there.

658
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,760
I cried like a weeping little small baby person.

659
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,640
I know nothing.

660
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,540
I think he's thinking of something in his past.

661
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,860
I know nothing of these things.

662
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,960
He's disassociated.

663
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
He's been in the Patriot camp for so long, he doesn't even know he's in there.

664
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,540
Yes.

665
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,060
I think the magnetic camps are bad for the natives.

666
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,820
We've seen this with Dave before.

667
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,800
I guess.

668
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:07,440
When he was in that little spaceship for a thousand years in suspended animation, he thought he was in the radio station at WCSB in Cleveland.

669
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:16,240
And when he, when the other time he thought he was in the radio station in Cleveland, he was in hell for ten billion eternities.

670
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,560
I remember that.

671
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,780
Yeah, you remember that.

672
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,480
I'll never forget that.

673
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,360
I just kind of like, I totally forgot about that.

674
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,360
I think I was trying too hard to make it go away.

675
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,940
He just said, I'm dropping this from my memory quadrant right now.

676
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,940
It's tough being a big mammal.

677
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:43,540
Well, I can do no other monster other than be a big mammal because I was actually raped by, by, um, satanic devils and stuff.

678
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,460
He doesn't have a, he has no, he has to be a pig man because he was raped by his handed devil.

679
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:50,460


680
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,540
Oh, I see.

681
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:59,860
When you're a 12, 13, maybe 25 year old pig nose person, you have a lot of problems with, they just come out of everywhere.

682
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:06,780
Sometimes you forget to close the door and you, you know, give it a little jar because that's what it was meant to do.

683
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
And people, uh-oh, Buddy knows how it is.

684
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,160
Buddy knows exactly how it is.

685
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,440
Yep.

686
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,600
Sounds like he does anyway.

687
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,980
I wonder, yeah, I don't know if the audience could hear Buddy.

688
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,380
Yeah, if you could, then they could.

689
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,700
Okay, now what do we need to remember?

690
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,980
I have these notes here, and the first thing on my note says, it's a question.

691
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,900
What do we need to remember?

692
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,620
Why, when, and where, and who are also important.

693
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,760
Well, okay, first off, it's late February of the year the conspiracy calls 2018.

694
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,140
18.

695
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,540
Yeah.

696
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,140
Princess Wee has already had her birthday, so that's not what I'm supposed to remember.

697
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:56,680
Okay, the X Day, well, the world ends July 5th, assuming this is the year 1998.

698
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,700
And assuming this is the world, too, you know, you've got to remember that.

699
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:11,240
And we'll have the big X Day party as we await X Day at that secret place in Ohio that you can only go to if you're a subgenius minister,

700
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,140
and you can only be a subgenius minister if you do the thing that I can't say on the broadcast.

701
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,320
Public supported radio.

702
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,100
But what else do we need to remember?

703
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,980
We need to know what kind of food we're going to be carrying to the magnet party, because the giant locusts...

704
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,080
Oh, I don't have to worry about that. It'll be catered.

705
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,360
Oh, well, you know how they get gigantic locusts. They get angry and stuff.

706
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,020
You don't want to start arguing about the catering.

707
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,600
We actually are going to that party in about two weeks.

708
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,860
It's called...

709
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,960
South by Southwest.

710
00:28:49,480 --> 00:29:00,200
And our new friends in Austin who are making the subgenius movie are the original organizers of that.

711
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,640
And so we'll be partying with rock stars and movie stars.

712
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,020
But the thing is, Princess, we and I don't know...

713
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,180
We don't recognize any modern rock stars or movie stars as such.

714
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,800
So we don't, you know, go to the rock and...

715
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,800
We don't go to the concerts of today.

716
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,400
And we don't do the movies of today until tomorrow.

717
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,840
Oh, I know what we're supposed to remember.

718
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,000
Neighborworld.

719
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,360
That fabulous novel, Neighborworld, by lonesome cowboy Dave DeLuca.

720
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,080
The guy that I'm on the phone with right now.

721
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,360
Neighborworld.

722
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,820
It's incredible.

723
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:47,240
I can't believe that every listener of this show hasn't acquired their e-copy or print copy of Neighborworld.

724
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,820
The novel.

725
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,280
Because it's so neighborly.

726
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,160
It's groovy, man.

727
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,220
It's a little bit...

728
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
It's not neighborly.

729
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,060
Friendly.

730
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,140
It's just the opposite of that, Stang.

731
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,760
You misrepresented it.

732
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,200
It's supposed to be like a sinister but upbeat...

733
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,180
Stuff like that there.

734
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,640
Yeah.

735
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,740
Hey, you wouldn't believe this because you can't hear it.

736
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,600
But what's in the background right now is which disco...

737
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,140
I think recorded at some winter star or something.

738
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,900
Wait, this doesn't sound like which disco.

739
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,380
I don't...

740
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,900
Let me double check this.

741
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,280
That's not which disco.

742
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,640
It could be Starwood.

743
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,380
No, no, no.

744
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,020
It's got too much...

745
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,980
The guitar playing is too...

746
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,060
It's not of a Dave-like nature.

747
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,340
This remote control won't help me or tell me anything.

748
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,480
It's got a tanger on your neck.

749
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,820
It's squeezing you slowly like a boiled egg.

750
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,060
The display won't display.

751
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,980
Well, I give up.

752
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,060
Whatever the hell this background music is, it sucks.

753
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:56,900
It's terrible.

754
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,440
Okay, what else do we have to remember?

755
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,920
Oh, listen, friends.

756
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,520
If you've never heard the Hour of Slack radio show,

757
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,860
it's a great subgenius radio show.

758
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,440
It's almost as good as Suzy the Fleece's Bob Slack Time Funhouse on WREK

759
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,800
and Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA

760
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,440
and even that new one, this is Time Out for the Show.

761
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,980
It's Time for the Show, yeah.

762
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,320
Those cussing guys.

763
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,700
Yeah.

764
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,600
Yeah, so, you know, you should listen, folks, to Hour of Slack.

765
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,240
It's on subgenius.com.

766
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,780
That's telling them, Stang.

768
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,260
I don't know what the hell you're telling them,

769
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,680
but that's telling them, that's for sure.

770
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,760
I think you have one of those balding spots in the back of your head

771
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,680
and not in front of it

772
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,860
because that's what makes me always think of chimpanzees,

773
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,120
especially when I was little.

774
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,220
It was one of my favorite condiments,

775
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,460
like eating red pepper and relish and stuff.

776
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,400
Stuff like that and arguing with policemen

777
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,400
and people that used to come and take me back to summer camp

778
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,340
and they would keep me in their base.

779
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,280
You know, some of those colleges have basements

780
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,840
with torture devices in them.

781
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,840
That's scary to think of, but I believe you.

782
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,000
Why is it that I block Bernard,

783
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,900
but I let Dave be on the show every week?

784
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,500
Because Dave has the clarity.

785
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,900
He's a guy that...

786
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,500
I don't know.

787
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,940
I called and left four-minute messages

788
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,340
every ten minutes on my message machine for 40 years.

789
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,960
Oh, the guy that broke your machine.

790
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,780
Yeah, but he didn't...

791
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,100
Yeah, he broke your...

792
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,480
I don't think he cares whether anybody listens to him.

793
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,360
The main thing is he says that same message,

794
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,180
four-minute message over and over again.

795
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,280
But it's okay, Dave, because, hey,

796
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,060
I decided to stop reliving my life today.

797
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,180
No, I really did, Princess.

798
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,580
Okay.

799
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:46,860
Well, you...

800
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,240
Yeah, I...

801
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,960
I think I told you about this.

802
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,400
See, I've been reliving my life in still photographs.

803
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,160
It's part of my job,

804
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,260
because I'm trying to help those people

805
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,780
make that documentary about the church's subgenius.

806
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,640
We didn't have video cameras around in the early 80s

807
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,280
or all the time,

808
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,580
but there's a lot of stills,

809
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,520
and I had to dig them up

810
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,240
and scan them and make them nice.

811
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,660
And it's my life.

812
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,040
I've actually looked...

813
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,000
I've looked at pictures of my life

814
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,300
from 1953 to 2001.

815
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,820
And then I stopped reliving it tonight.

816
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,700
I got through the end of all the photos of 2001,

817
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,160
which was a damn lot of subgenius event photos.

818
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,300
Well, that's a good thing.

819
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,360
It's true, Dave.

820
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,680
You were in some,

821
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,000
because we did Euclid Tavern devivals in Cleveland in 2001.

822
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,640
Jeez.

823
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,020
But we also did Amsterdam.

824
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,460
Amsterdam.

825
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,860
Burning Man.

826
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,820
Winter Star.

827
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,560
Starwood.

828
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,300
X-Day.

829
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,120
I got to Tampa, Florida, I think.

830
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,280
All in 1991.

831
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,720
No, no, 2001.

832
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,440
2001.

833
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,760
What the conspiracy goes to.

834
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Where were we all in 1995?

835
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,880
In 1995, we were on the world,

836
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,560
the subgenius world tour,

837
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,240
and I was opening for GWAR at four shows

838
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,160
until they kicked me.

839
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,740
They kicked you off the tour.

840
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,520
They kicked you off the tour in Cleveland, didn't they?

841
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,380
No, no.

842
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,880
Cleveland was the first night.

843
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,300
I got pelted by garbage from the audience.

844
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,460
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

845
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,280
And I changed my approach

846
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,160
from a half-hour multimedia show

847
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,300
to about five minutes of me pretending to be the local DJ

848
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,260
who was saying,

849
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,320
Are you ready for GWAR?

850
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,820
I've been backstage partying.

851
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,300
I've been taking drugs.

852
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,740
I've been having sex.

853
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,960
Are you ready for GWAR?

854
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,280
By the way, I'm here to talk about Bob.

855
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,480
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of Subgenius.

856
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,380
Because we're partying for GWAR!

857
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,400
And Bob is more important than anything else

858
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,520
you'll ever hear tonight.

859
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,560
Because, yeah!

860
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,060
And that would work.

861
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,520
That worked.

862
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,080
That worked.

863
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,060
Until Odorous, the late Odorous Serungus,

864
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,640
realized that I was actually getting paid more

865
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,380
for that five or ten minutes of fakery

866
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,780
than he was for wearing this heavy, heavy costume

867
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:16,800
and wearing this heavy, heavy costume.

868
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,960
And singing for an hour and a half.

869
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,740
Because you had to split the money

870
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,660
with the slot manager and everybody else.

871
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:24,980
Yeah.

872
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,920
Well, they had a crew of 19 people.

873
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,760
Yeah, that's right.

874
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,240
Including all the bohabs and slaves that run around

875
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
Spraying blood and piss.

876
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,600
Changing the hose connections.

877
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,440
You know, from the pea-colored hose

878
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,060
to the blood-colored hose

879
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,060
to the white-colored hose.

880
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,600
Yeah, quite a crew.

881
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,020
Sick of you!

882
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm so sick of you!

883
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
And he would be spraying the audience

884
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,540
through a hose coming out of his groin

885
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,560
filled with yellowish, yellow-tainted water.

886
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,340
It smelled kind of salty.

887
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,780
I wish he had a baby that he pulled from her womb.

888
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,580
But yeah, that was what I did in 1995.

889
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,040
I filmed those concerts from the balcony every night.

890
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,140
And I've...

891
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,620
Saw some of them on the internet.

892
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,880
With no credit.

893
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,860
Anyway, Dave, in the course of assembling my life

894
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,060
in photographs,

895
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,760
I had a lot of fractions of other people's lives.

896
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,900
Like Princess Wee, who I'm married to.

897
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,860
You can imagine I had a lot of pictures of her.

898
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,360
There were pictures of you, Dave.

899
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,300
And I...

900
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,360
Everyone who's been interviewed in this movie,

901
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,060
I've been putting each picture,

902
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,120
each year,

903
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,380
of each person,

904
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,820
into that person's personal folder.

905
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,960
So that I now have a folder that,

906
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,500
for instance,

907
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,100
Princess Wee,

908
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,080
from when she was a little girl,

909
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,560
all the pictures I have anyway,

910
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,160
all the way through her subgenius career,

911
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,320
her Starwood career,

912
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,680
singing with revelry.

913
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,760
It's like a time-lapse thing of her movie.

914
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,320
And there's one like that of your life too, Dave.

915
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,120
It's shorter.

916
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,580
Because we didn't meet you until like 1992

917
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,220
or something.

918
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,440
It's been a year or so.

919
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,160
And most of the photos of you,

920
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,840
you're playing guitar with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

921
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,540
There's a few in the radio station.

922
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,000
And there's a few where you're confronting

923
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,760
the evil baby, baby head twin on the back of your head.

924
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,920
And the narcotic policeman's with you too, man.

925
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,520
Remember when we used to have to get that guy

926
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
the heck on out of there because, you know,

927
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,100
and nuclear weapons is not the way to prove anything.

928
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,740
But yeah, Dave, there's a Dave folder.

929
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,500
There's a We folder.

930
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,620
Of course, the biggest folder is my folder.

931
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,700
But a Philo, there's a really long, there's a big.

932
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,040
People brag like that.

933
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,120
I know, I can't help it.

934
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,580
Hey, look, I got a big folder.

935
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
If you got it, flaunt it.

936
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,460
Philo, Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell, Paul Mavridis, Susie the Floozy.

937
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,000
I can't wait to fast forward through those.

938
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,360
Listen, look, there's Susie in the background.

939
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,240
Is this Susie?

940
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,740
She's not Chinese, is she?

941
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:34,520
Oh, she's from the land of Moab and has come to the great process of fixing a nuclear face.

942
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,800
I really don't know what this is.

943
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,160
Now, you say that Dave can't hear, and yet it seems like he always can.

944
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,160
Well, it's the coincidence.

945
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,900
He just throws out something at random and it happens.

946
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,780
It's to match what is actually heard in the background that he can't hear.

947
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,840
This is either, I think this is Leo Kup or Rydio.

948
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,960
Well, what actually just happened?

949
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,480
Did something kind of paranormal or excitement actually happen?

950
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,380
No, actually nothing, no, no.

951
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,160
It sounds like two or three women that are making wonderful sounds that sound wonderful together.

952
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,100
I'm still like, ooh...

953
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,280
Oh, hmm...

954
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,700
Why is this so slow?

955
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,760
Oh, right now it's something real.

956
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,160
It meows so the whole time I'm at an awkward spot.

957
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,940
I don't even know if it's me but I already thank God.

958
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,360
Well, you should say, hey, I like to write the script that I wrote to Kandahar's family.

959
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,360


960
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,960
I can't write

961
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,160
At all.

962
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,340
That hand full of cardboard.

963
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,060
Going to mention me in the cries.

964
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,980
Thank you.

965
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,500
Thanks.

966
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:39,500


967
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:39,500


968
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,100
I can't believe she used her English.

969
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,240
I'm not sure if I'm not in it.

970
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,080
I may be in it.

971
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,140
Well, we'll find out when we look at the we folder.

972
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,260
It's not as big as the giant folder.

973
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,860
The we folder is pretty wee.

974
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,440
It's small.

975
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,600
Hey, voting happens in Texas in a couple of weeks.

976
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,060
And I have a Texas voters registration card, which is pretty hard to get.

977
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:28,940
Well, actually, if you're an Anglo-Saxon guy with a Texas accent and kind of a light brownish skin to very pale, getting a Texas voters registration is no problem at all.

978
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,680
And your last name doesn't end with Ia or Agiguez or Ayaz or anything like that.

979
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,760
It's real easy to get a Texas voters.

980
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:49,360
You know, there's nobody you have to bribe or you don't have to argue with any of the authorities or have any kind of like arranging with a local community.

981
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,940
Well, it's probably not a good idea.

982
00:40:51,180 --> 00:41:02,220
You probably shouldn't wear your hope and change button or your I'm with her button or any of those buttons.

983
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,740
Oh, I know what we forgot to remember.

984
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,560
What did we forget?

985
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,320
Bob.

986
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,040
Everything.

987
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,380
And Slack.

988
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,860
We totally forgot what the whole thing is all about.

989
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the guru of Slack.

990
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,720
All over the window written in blood.

991
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,860
Don't forget to talk about Bob.

992
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,560
Right.

993
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,300
Exactly.

994
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,480
They'll find out.

995
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,140
There's no use trying to hide.

996
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
They'll find it's blood.

997
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,160
You can't hide Bob and you can't hide from Bob.

998
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,580
Sooner or later, that pipe face is going to be in your face.

999
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,060
You just cannot escape from Bob.

1000
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,340
Bob.

1001
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,660
You can hide for a time, but you can't escape.

1002
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,340
Not really.

1003
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,840
He's a nebulous woman.

1004
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,040
They'll make you feel like you're insane just listening to this.

1005
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,940
I could hear that.

1006
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,840
There go the dead people again.

1007
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,800
There go the people going blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1008
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,940
Yeah, but they're having a good time.

1009
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,620
How can Dave hear that?

1010
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,800
It's not important.

1011
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,080
It's magic.

1012
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,040
Unless you're a purist.

1013
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,340
I don't see how he can hear it, but I think he can hear it somehow.

1014
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,720
Well, there's some more all kinds of weird background stuff on this.

1015
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:20,580
The next thing up, I think, is labeled Roundhouse End Frenzy,

1016
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,600
which means, oh, it's Starwood 29.

1017
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:29,280
So it'll be the craziness at the end of a really long night in the roundhouse at Starwood.

1018
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,780
Drumming and hippies and witch women with their shirts off

1019
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,520
and their arms up in the air.

1020
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,240
Relating like crazy Iraqi ladies going.

1021
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,840
And fending off the tornadoes and controlling the weather with their witch powers.

1022
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,900
Oh, God.

1023
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,820
Somebody told me that Bob was like, he said he was like Hugh Hefner.

1024
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,460
Hugh Hefner?

1025
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,300
No, you're thinking of Bob Mozik, the drummer in that band you guys were in.

1026
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,660
Oh, he's Hugh Hefner.

1027
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,420
Yeah, he's Hugh Hefner.

1028
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,320
Hugh Hefner?

1029
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,780
Cowboy.

1030
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
Cow play cowboy.

1031
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,820
Hugh Heffer.

1032
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,560
Hugh Heffer.

1033
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,220
Okay.

1034
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,280
Hugh Heffer creates small cowboys.

1035
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:17,940
That's my...

1036
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,540
Okay, that's my saying for tonight.

1037
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,020
Hugh Heffer creates small cowboys.

1038
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,060
Yeah.

1039
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,400
There you go.

1040
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,020
That's the title of this show.

1041
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,760
Hugh Heffer.

1042
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,340
It's the first time I've heard that one.

1043
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,960
No, that's not a very good title.

1044
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,540
We're not talking about it.

1045
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,320
That's a crappy title.

1046
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:32,620
Horrible.

1047
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,960
Well, it's a bastion of the English language skills.

1048
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,900
We're not just screwing around here.

1049
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,520
We're coming up with humble-headed poetry.

1050
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,340
Yeah.

1051
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,500
Yeah.

1052
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,460
Yeah, it's like poetry.

1053
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,100
It's art, man.

1054
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,600
It's art.

1055
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,060
Yeah.

1056
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,480
Yeah, what we're doing.

1057
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:53,960
It's art.

1058
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,640
What he said.

1059
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,200
Uh-huh.

1060
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,840
Yeah, that's what I thought all along.

1061
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,080
I always thought that.

1062
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,860
Humble-headed poetry.

1063
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,120
Yep, that's it.

1064
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,440
It doesn't have to be good or make sense.

1065
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,400
Or anything like that.

1066
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,060
It just is.

1067
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,780
You know, like, poetry is, man.

1068
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,780
It's like the word, like the logos of the grand.

1069
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,700
Yeah, except, you know what we're missing?

1070
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,680
What?

1071
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,220
A big price tag.

1072
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,360
That would make it real art.

1073
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,660
I thought it was.

1074
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,500
It's kind of free.

1075
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,960
A gigantic, throbbing member.

1076
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,380
Yeah.

1077
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:20,720
No.

1078
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,440
No, no, no.

1079
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,840
Just a gigantic, throbbing price tag.

1080
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,620
That makes, that identifies a work of art as good art.

1081
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,600
The big price tag.

1082
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,300
Whereas.

1083
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,900
I mean, look at this art we're doing.

1084
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,960
How much, how much is, how much are any of you listeners paying for this?

1085
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:44,020
Actually, I should say, thank you, all 10 of you who support the show by contributing

1086
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,420
like 20 bucks a month.

1087
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,660
Praise all 10 of you.

1088
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,640
No, there are, there are.

1089
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,700
And Popess Lilith, for instance.

1090
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,240
Uh-huh.

1091
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,180
Has been dropping 20 on our Slack for years and years.

1092
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:54,440
Sweet Popess Lilith.

1093
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,440
She is one of our best supporters.

1094
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,560
And she's a good woman.

1095
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,680
And, uh, I mean, there's just, well, I could.

1096
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,840
I don't want to embarrass anyone.

1097
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,920
And actually, I can't remember a lot of their names because I don't know them personally.

1098
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,860
Like my dafter, Lil.

1099
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,300
And besides that, like having an Eastern European Lil to them.

1100
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,340
And you can't pronounce whether it's a C comes first or a Z comes first.

1101
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,000
I don't know what you said.

1102
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,100
But I do know that I've been seeing.

1103
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,760
It's like this has been such a weird month.

1104
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,560
Going through all these old records and, and, uh, photographs.

1105
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,140
Mostly.

1106
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,980
Going through records looking for.

1107
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,300
Oh, I should have gone through the photo albums, not the record albums.

1108
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,140
God.

1109
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,520
I'm.

1110
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,900
Me so stupid.

1111
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,580
Subgenius.

1112
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,400
Anyway.

1113
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,000
That means I got.

1114
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,780
There are probably more pictures to scan.

1115
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,680
In the photo albums instead of the LP record albums.

1116
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,200
But.

1117
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,120
And anyway.

1118
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,600
I have seen an awful lot of old friends.

1119
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,160
Aging.

1120
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,660
Some of them.

1121
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,660
Like think of Reverend St. Andrew.

1122
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,160
Uh.

1123
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,180
Yeah.

1124
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,460
Now we first knew him in the nineties.

1125
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,060
He was like a long haired kid in Chicago.

1126
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,260
Well, now we know him again.

1127
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,080
He's a ball headed old daddy in Fort Worth, Texas.

1128
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,100
Now, how did that happen?

1129
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,880
He is bald because it's the same guy style that he's wearing.

1130
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,920
Exactly the same guy.

1131
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,020
He's not natural.

1132
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:22,680
Bold.

1133
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,320
He actually hasn't changed a bit.

1134
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,800
And he doesn't want to.

1135
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,220
Face looks exactly the same.

1136
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,640
He refused your offer to use the space time machine.

1137
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,960
The next time.

1138
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,420
Oh, no, no.

1139
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,400
He wants to use the space time machine.

1140
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,520
Who doesn't?

1141
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,720
Everybody around here does.

1142
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,360
Well, who doesn't indeed.

1143
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,340
But he didn't.

1144
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,620
So therefore he's weird.

1145
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,900
Unusual anyway.

1146
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,320
Oh, no.

1147
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,380
Weird and unusual.

1148
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,840
That's terrible for a subgenius now, isn't it?

1149
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,900
We better kick him out of the church.

1150
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,560
He's weird.

1151
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,860
Extremely bad for Princess We Are Doe.

1152
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:53,960
Yeah.

1153
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,700
What do you mean?

1154
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,160
I don't get it.

1155
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,600
We are Doe.

1156
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,940
What does that have to do with we are Doe?

1157
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1158
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1159
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1160
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1161
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1162
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1163
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1164
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:01,940


1165
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,160
We are weird.

1166
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,380
What?

1167
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,800
You mean what?

1168
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,900
We are Doe.

1169
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,820
Your name.

1170
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,940
It says weirdo.

1171
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,400
That's the first time I ever knew that.

1172
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,780
Remember how many times we've encountered people who said that?

1173
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,820
Oh, yeah.

1174
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,940
They saw your name written out Princess We Are Period Doe.

1175
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:20,940
Uh-huh.

1176
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,680
And didn't get that it basically just said weirdo.

1177
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:27,880
No.

1178
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,500
No.

1179
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,100
It's a coincidence.

1180
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,040
It's not designed that way.

1181
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,860
It's just pure coincidence.

1182
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,920
Well, then, why would they call me Princess Way?

1183
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,380
Because they're way wrong.

1184
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,320
It's like Chinese French way or something.

1185
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,460
Right.

1186
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,980
In Chinese it would-

1187
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,060
Or Wei Wu, you know, like the-

1188
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,580
Exactly.

1189
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:43,880
Yeah.

1190
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,560
The way her name is spelled W-E-I, in Chinese that would be Wei, and it's a common name.

1191
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,340
And there are Princess Ways in China, a bunch of them.

1192
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,160
But this is Princess Wee.

1193
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,080
Oh, a bunch of Mandarin.

1194
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,940
So, yeah, man.

1195
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,840
Everything's cool.

1196
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:01,840


1197
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:01,840


1198
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:01,840


1199
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:01,840


1200
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:01,840


1201
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:01,840


1202
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,580
Everything's gro- Oh, this is the- that roundhouse frenzy.

1203
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,500
It's not that frenzied.

1204
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,460
Oh, it's pretty frenzied.

1205
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,500
No, it's not very frenzied.

1206
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,020
There's no-

1207
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,020
Uh, I don't know.

1208
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,900
There's no shrieking or violins or people leaping over the fire.

1209
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,860
I can hear people leaping and shouting and moaning and-

1210
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,520
No, it's pretty tame.

1211
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,040
I bet it gets faster later, though, because this is like a 10-minute background track.

1212
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,600
But we're not going to get to the end of it.

1213
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,640
Because the show just doesn't last all that long.

1214
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,240
I think we're like 45 minutes in at this point, and I've still got to put some kind of music

1215
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:41,680
in here.

1216
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:49,680
And, you know, I'm tempted, as much as I have all this great avant-garde music, like the

1217
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,400
Psychoskeletons and Rudy Schwartz Project that I play every damn show anyway, and probably

1218
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,780
did already this one, I can't stop playing the Rainmakers.

1219
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,500
And the reason is-

1220
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:01,580
Yes.

1221
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,240
Because that songwriter, Bob Walkenhorst, is the greatest songwriter that ever walked

1222
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:06,640
the earth.

1223
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:15,860
His stuff is so great, I wake up every morning- we both do- with one Rainmakers or Walkenhorst

1224
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,520
song or another in our heads.

1225
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,860
It segues into another one later on, but-

1226
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,140
Well, we've done it to ourselves, dear.

1227
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,540
I mean, you just can't listen to one kind of music over and over and have it not be

1228
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,320
brain-warming you.

1229
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
It got us through the move.

1230
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,060
Absolutely.

1231
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,760
Because it was so swinging.

1232
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:42,300
And the reason we listened to that swinging is because the guy's lyrics are just so absolutely

1233
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,460
spot on.

1234
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,400
He hits the nail on the head every time.

1235
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:46,760
Sure does.

1236
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,000
It's so good.

1237
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:54,020
It's like, oh, you can have your Bob Dylan or your Elvis Costello or your Eminem or your

1238
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,880
Dave DeLuca.

1239
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,500
This- this- oh, your Victoria Ganger.

1240
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,080
I'm sorry.

1241
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,700
I mean, I love all those songwriters and I love the lyrics, especially of the amino

1242
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,260
acids.

1243
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,920
They have my second favorite lyrics next to the Rainmakers.

1244
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,880
But-

1245
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,620
But there's only one song.

1246
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,940
They have no mouth.

1247
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,660
No lyrics.

1248
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,720
They have no lips.

1249
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,300
They don't have lungs, I don't think.

1250
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,000
Anyway-

1251
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,920
All are stumentary.

1252
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,680
The point is, that's why I keep playing this Rainmakers stuff.

1253
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,780
I don't care whether my listeners are into that twangy stuff.

1254
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,300
I am.

1255
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,060
It means a lot to me.

1256
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:39,320
And I unearthed among my old records and documents I was going through, there was a

1257
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,680
letter from Bob Walkenhorst to me from 1990.

1258
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:50,560
It was because I'd gone to a concert in Dallas in 1989, free Rainmakers concert outdoors.

1260
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,400
I was such a big Rainmakers fan even then.

1261
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,760
I threw a copy of Book of the Subgenius up on the wall.

1262
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,360
The stage with a letter inside.

1263
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,880
And Walkenhorst picked up the book and held it in front of his face while he sang because

1264
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,960
his name's Bob too.

1265
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:14,580
Well, it turned out when I got a letter back from him about a year later, he was aware

1266
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,760
of Subgenius but didn't like it because he knew a bunch of subgeniuses.

1267
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,120
In college.

1268
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,960
Right, in college.

1269
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,360
He hadn't read the book or anything but he knew these nerds and it was like, man, I would

1270
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,740
never give you my address.

1271
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,820
They're super dorks.

1272
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,200
From that.

1273
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,620
But when I threw the book up on stage, it was stuck in the tour bus for the rest of

1274
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,780
that little tour and he and all the band members, which this thrills me because now I'm like

1275
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,940
a big fan of the drummer, Pat, and the bass player, Rich.

1276
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,220
It was a different guitar player then.

1277
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,320
Screw him.

1278
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,580
I need to send him a new book for Jeff Porter, the current guitar player.

1279
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:52,940
Anyway.

1280
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,240
Right.

1281
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:53,940
Right.

1282
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,920
So the bottom line is, it turned out that my hero, Bob Walkenhorst, actually loved the

1283
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,900
book of the subgenius, thought it was really good.

1284
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:09,060
And in 1990, in his letter back to me, he said that he was going to break up the band

1285
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:16,480
and try to do more, I don't know, he had done his Angry Young Man songs and he wanted to

1286
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,000
do stuff about slack and enlightenment.

1287
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,680
He said, you just may hate.

1288
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,360
Angry young woman this time around.

1289
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,920
He actually said, you may hate.

1290
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,060
I hate my new stuff.

1291
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:32,120
Now this was 28 years ago, but, or eight, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1292
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,880
Good God.

1293
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,740
Anyway.

1294
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,780
Good God indeed.

1295
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:42,940
Over the last two or three years, I actually, they came out with some albums that I missed,

1296
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,700
but Amazon reminded me suddenly that there were these, Rainmakers had gotten back together

1297
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,160
and there were like four Rainmakers albums.

1298
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,900
And I already had a bunch of Walkenhorst.

1299
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,740
Solo albums.

1300
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:04,880
But the latest thing I got was a, he had done, he's still doing Rainmakers with all four

1301
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,400
guys, but him and the guitar player, Jeff Porter have formed a band called Walkenhorst

1302
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,660
and Porter and have this album of rather serious, not angry songs.

1303
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:23,880
And every song on that album makes me cry like a damn baby.

1304
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,580
And I'm going to end the show with one of those songs that makes me cry like a damn

1305
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:29,940
baby.

1306
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:36,080
And if, if anybody cares or doesn't care or doesn't like it or likes it, I don't care.

1307
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,600
If six was nine, I don't mind.

1308
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,000
If all the hippies cut off all their hair, I don't care.

1309
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,060
I don't care if you don't wear any underwear.

1310
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,860
Well, but I don't care.

1311
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:53,860


1312
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:53,860


1313
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:53,860


1314
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,100
I care if Dave is there and Dave is there.

1315
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,100
So I'm happy.

1316
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:57,900
In his underwear.

1317
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,840
Well, you know, know about that.

1318
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,680
He may not have any underwear on.

1319
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:07,080
And he has quite a delicious pair of young titties, just like his grandfather.

1320
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:07,500
Okay.

1321
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,060
Anyway, I've got to cut to this, this heartbreakingly beautiful Rainmakers song.

1322
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,580
I don't even know which one it's going to be, but I'm going to cut to it.

1323
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,620
Dave, thanks for being on the show.

1324
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,020
And, um.

1325
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,840
I'm going to cut to it.

1326
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1327
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1328
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1329
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840


1330
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,680
Yeah.

1331
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,460
Uh-huh.

1332
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:34,800
Some days it's the comedy, others it's the crime.

1333
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,680
Some days riches turn to wine and rags turn to wine.

1334
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:48,620
Most of my days blur into a blanket of my thoughts.

1335
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,140
And it all adds up to something.

1336
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,820
No, I'm never going to be.

1337
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:53,820


1338
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,440
I'm never sure just what.

1339
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,100
I saw you across a parking lot.

1340
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,320
Some approaching storm with your hand in your coat pocket.

1341
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:14,220
Like you're carrying a gun loaded with possibilities.

1342
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,500
All meant for me.

1343
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,300
And you put me to the pavement.

1344
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,520
It was pretty plain.

1345
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:31,480
To see that everything I'd known before was weightless then and when.

1346
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:38,360
You leaned over me and whispered, you ain't seen nothing yet.

1347
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,280
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1348
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,940
Doo doo doo doo doo.

1349
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,960
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1350
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,680
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1351
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:00,340
I stood beside the canyon, saw you far across

1352
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:07,580
Smiling through our many secrets, like they just weren't worth the cost

1353
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,800
Or the anger, or the heartache, or the worry, or the fear

1354
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,440
We are pebbles in an avalanche, that's ringing in my ears

1355
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,960
That's how I shot my hearing, that's how I wrecked my sight

1356
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:35,120
Staring at the burning fuse, here down to the dynamite

1357
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:43,580
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

1358
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:50,540
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

1359
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,840
Whoa!

1360
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,140
Oh, women, women everywhere, but not a drop to drink

1361
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,780
You're the one that I thirst after forever

1362
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:07,800
Until I see you beneath your swirling surface

1363
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,880
Disappearing, bubbling air

1364
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,560
Am I swimming, am I drowning?

1365
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,160
What's the difference? I don't care

1366
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,420
Cause I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman

1367
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,960
Some days are a comedy, others are a crime

1368
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,600
But most are masterpieces of a ludicrous design

1369
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:40,680
Ridiculously beautiful, absurdly rich and dense

1370
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:47,580
I'm delirious with fever, it's finally making sense

1371
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,760
Doo-doo-doo

1372
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:56,300
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

1373
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:09,780
Nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee

1374
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,980
Nah-vee

1375
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,160
Nah-vee

1376
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,160


1377
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,160


1378
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,680
Dah-vee

1379
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,340
Nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee

1380
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,400
Nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, nah-vee, ah!

1381
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,400
Okay.

1382
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,940
Okay, we're back.

1383
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,440
That was the, well, not the Rainmakers.

1384
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,360
That was Walking Horse and Porter.

1385
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,780
And this makes me cry with happiness, not with sorrow.

1386
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,480
It makes me cry with happiness.

1387
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,460
That's a weird thing.

1388
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:05,400
Anyway, friends, you too can cry with happiness now that we're past the sinking hour of the broadcast section.

1389
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,320
We're just on the Internet now.

1390
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:15,620
And that means you need to send in your 14 bucks to buy Lonesome Cowboy Dave's novel Neighbor World.

1391
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,280
It's a softbound paper.

1392
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,460
Paperback or trade paperback size.

1393
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,600
218 pages.

1394
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,100
Oh, brilliance.

1395
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,640
It's even got drawings by Dave in it of some of the characters.

1396
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,180
Indeed.

1397
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,280
And.

1398
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,540
Beautiful tome.

1399
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:37,780
I remember the first time I looked on it, I thought this is indeed a Bible for the new age.

1400
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,300
This is going to set mankind free.

1401
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,140
And wasn't I disappointed?

1402
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,500
I know how you feel.

1403
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,480
I started the Eurasian Civil War back in 2023.

1404
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,200
I believe you're quite right.

1405
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:48,340
I thought it was.

1406
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,900
I was going to be just like in my bookie.

1407
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:56,320
And it turns out I was interrupted by time and motion back in 2023.

1408
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,360
Oh, yes.

1409
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,520
It's so heady.

1410
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,280
It's such a heady, heady book.

1411
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,880
A great tome, as they say.

1412
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,620
Well, it got some good reviews from paranoid, local paranoid schizophrenics.

1413
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:16,420
They said it reminded them of some semi-famous people, including the author of Neuromancer.

1414
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,480
And.

1415
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,660
Dave's so proud of that he got compared to William Gibson.

1416
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,000
And Anthony Burgess.

1417
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,920
I threw in the Anthony Burgess and the Federico Fellini.

1418
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,880
And the Fleischer Brothers cartoons.

1419
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,780
All of those are correct.

1420
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:36,960
And Franz Kafka.

1421
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,680
I couldn't understand that.

1422
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,760
And Woody Woodpecker.

1423
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,840
Well, that I understood.

1424
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,320
I still don't.

1425
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,600
I still don't understand how waking up and finding yourself turning into a huge cockroach

1426
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,000
is in any way have anything to do with what I was writing about there.

1427
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,200
A totally different subject matter.

1428
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,280
Well, but the mood is kind of similar.

1429
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,620
The general atmosphere has this sort of.

1430
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,660
Of being trapped, yes.

1431
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,120
Yeah.

1432
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:07,940
Yeah.

1433
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:14,580
Trapped like a Trump voter in a cage of his own making.

1434
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,080
Anyway, friends.

1435
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:22,020
The other thing you can do is send 35 bucks in for get your finally get yourself ordained

1436
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,300
as a subgenius minister.

1437
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,820
Get that great big giant pack.

1438
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,860
And it really is the.

1439
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:34,960
OK, the envelope we mail it in is a padded envelope, 15 inches by 11 inches.

1440
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,600
And it's about an inch thick when you get it.

1441
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:44,500
Because all the bumper stickers and decoder pins and and giant frameable documents.

1442
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,060
We don't throw in the frameable documents.

1443
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,520
You have to buy the frame at Walmart.

1444
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,960
But they're only a buck.

1445
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,440
If you look, if you really look, you find the buck 11 by 17 frames.

1446
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:03,060
If you know the right signs, the right hand signals to make and the right links, they'll

1447
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,180
let you know what you need to know to get it.

1448
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:06,860
Don't worry.

1449
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:07,260
Yeah.

1450
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,480
Walmart is kind of like the Masons, but a little bigger now.

1451
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,440
Yeah.

1452
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,520
A little more influential in politics than the Masons.

1453
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,920
But I think they're more important than the Masons ever were.

1454
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,600
Or have wanted to be.

1455
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,260
I think they've outlasted every single comfort zone.

1456
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:29,160
Anybody in this neighborhood, not this neighborhood world, which is another story entirely.

1457
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,200
My God, I just remembered the other thing.

1458
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,420
I remembered the other thing we forgot.

1459
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,700
You just talked right on top of Dave.

1460
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,140
I know.

1461
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:36,500
I know.

1462
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,780
But I'm right on top of him.

1463
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,860
Anyway, what were you saying?

1464
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,140
Dear, you remember.

1465
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:40,960
Remember something.

1466
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,660
I remember something really bad.

1467
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,640
Uh, oh.

1468
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,040
All of our friends that are in the neighborhood.

1469
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,040


1470
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,900
They're in total despair.

1471
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,380
And there's a bunch of them.

1472
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,140
That's true.

1473
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,320
There's the one that was in the house fire.

1474
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,740
There's the one whose Mexican wife got deported.

1475
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,760
There's the one whose kid is in prison.

1476
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,740
There's the one whose health is failing very drastically.

1477
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,320
There's the, man, there's just no end to it.

1478
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,020
There's just no end to it.

1479
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:17,360
That's true.

1480
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,840
We have a lot of friends who do not have as much slack as we do.

1481
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,700
I'm planning all these people are all dying on me.

1482
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,700
I was like, hey, where'd everybody go?

1483
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:29,720
Yeah.

1484
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,780
Well, Dave, we're still here.

1485
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,340
Strangely enough.

1486
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,740
Well, you just look dead, right?

1487
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,540
What's that Johnny Winter?

1488
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,040
Johnny Winter.

1489
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1490
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1491
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1492
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1493
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1494
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1495
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1496
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,040


1497
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,800
That's right.

1498
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,300
Don't fucking say about him.

1499
01:03:51,440 --> 01:04:02,800
This is Ron 자�ிعون INow索 בי TC 이게

1500
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,800


1501
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,800


1502
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,800


1503
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,800


1504
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,800


1505
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:02,800


1506
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:03,440
They.

1507
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,420
Run.

1508
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:07,860
Run.

1509
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,640
It's named Emergency kitties.

1510
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:11,640


1511
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:11,760
Damn.

1512
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,140
They're here.

1513
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:13,920
Enough.

1514
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,060
And with that, we should end the recording, I guess.

1515
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,420
Dave, thanks.

1516
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,480
We're going to quit now and go to bed.

1517
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,420
It's been fun, Dave.

1518
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,380
Have fun and go to bed and all that wink, wink, wink stuff.
