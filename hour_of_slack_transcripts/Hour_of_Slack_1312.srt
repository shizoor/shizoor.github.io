1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,200
Where's your fish?

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,300
I beg your pardon?

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,680
Where's your fish?

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,300
Well, I don't have one at the moment.

5
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,800
Okay, okay.

6
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,420
All right, mister, just hold the fish up with your right hand.

7
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,260
Yeah, that's right.

8
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,940
Smile.

9
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,520
Smile.

10
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,980
Smile.

11
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,220
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,480
Official report.

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,940
Let me tell you, you're wrong.

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,220
You're wrong in feeling that way about...

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,800
This is too genius to be a snack.

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,640
Hold it!

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Dogstown.

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,000
Is actually nothing like this.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,000
Unless you want it to be.

20
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,860
This is the Sakeem.

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,980
The Sakeem.

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,660
Yes.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,100
Sakeem.

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,560
Yes.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,300
Our.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,680
Slack.

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,920
National present, Cheese Theater.

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,600
With two of Hollywood's most distinguished citizens, Bob and Bob.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,080
And here is that glamorous star of radio and pictures, Bob.

30
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,940
Bob, thank you.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,440
Thank you.

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,600
It does feel wonderful, Bob.

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,540
Don't look now, but I think there's a plug coming.

34
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,280
Well, Bob, if it'll do you any good, I have an in with Bob.

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,000
I have a lady in the playpen, Doctor.

36
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,620
Do you know what it means?

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,300
To be sure.

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
And make it homogenous.

39
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,260
To be sure.

40
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,260


41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,060
And make it homogenous.

42
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,740
And make it homogenous.

43
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:28,860
And make it homogenous.

44
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:28,900
And make it homogenous.

45
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:28,900


46
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:28,900


47
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:28,900


48
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,340
Psych.

49
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,440
A great actor, ladies and gentlemen, is one whose talents range in many directions.

50
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,880
Pretty.

51
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,120
Brass.

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,560
Bob and I.

53
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,740
Home.

54
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,000
Home.

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,260
Same.

56
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,500
Same.

57
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,620
Bailey Howard's hot rod beaver.

58
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,100
Most kids her age go for somebody like Bob.

59
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,500
Who's he?

60
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,200
An actor.

61
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,380
Oh, frankly, it evades me.

62
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,640
I don't think...

63
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,580
You're not supposed to, honey.

64
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,360
I'll do the thinking tonight.

65
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,080
Why, it's...

66
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:44,820
It's...

67
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,260
It's...

68
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,820
It's foam.

69
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,680
I thought you were...

70
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,720
You certainly are.

71
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,660
Really?

72
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,140
In just about a minute, you're going to hear Bob, who I'm sure will have a laugh or two

73
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,560
up his sleeve.

74
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,200
So listen.

75
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,320
A pint a day for adults, and a quart a day for children.

76
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,920
Then zing.

77
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,980
Carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot,

78
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,420
carrot, carrot.

79
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,660
Thank you, wrecking crew.

80
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,320
And now, folks, here he is, the star of screen, radio, television, vaudeville cafes, personal

81
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,240
appearances, and fat boy for the Cleveland Indians, Bob...

82
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,240
I love you.

83
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:17,960
I love that head.

84
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,980
It was a good ship lollipop.

85
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,000
Everyone aboard was a sucker.

86
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,260
I wonder what time it is.

87
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,360
My rubber sheep is afloat.

88
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
Next Thursday night, we'll be back with Dick.

89
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
So try and be with us.

90
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,160
Keep listening.

91
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,540
Bob, I'll soon be seen in the new Paramount picture, Paleface.

92
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:54,940
I'll see you then.

93
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll write on it.

94
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,940
God damn it.

95
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,240
Oh, bÃªn encore.

96
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,760
It's Steve.

97
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:34,760


98
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,360
Oh, it's Tom.

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,360


100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,360


101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,420
It's all right.

102
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,420


103
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,200
It's Steve.

104
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,740
You're not still cool?

105
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,600
Do you want some?

106
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:37,840
Love you.

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:37,840


108
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:37,920
Loveya and metres.

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,480
Loveya and surfaces.

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,480


111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:46,580
Didna-as...

112
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,660
exoticiness.

113
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:47,660


114
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm as free as a bird now

115
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,080
And Lord help me, I can change

116
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,980
Yes, I must have flown in one too many planes

117
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,920
Lord help me, I can change

118
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,480
Yee-haw!

119
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,260
guitar solo

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
How about you?

121
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,260
I'm as free as a bird now

122
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,340
And Lord help me, I can change

123
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,100
Yee-haw!

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
guitar solo

125
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,860
Yee-haw!

126
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,260
guitar solo

127
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,580
Ah, yes, yes, yes, friends.

128
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,420
The Leonard Skinner Memorial Tractor Pull

129
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,500

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,580
And before that,

133
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,920
friends, Reverend Norrell Preff

134
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,600
of norrellpreff.com

135
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,060
captured the Vintage Bob Show.

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,660
Our new intro

137
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,460
was by Popes Lilith von

138
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
Frau Mensch.

139
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,460
Also, thanks to Just John

140
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,120
and Fernanda Nandi-Liemer

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
for the openings.

142
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,160
This is Hour of Slack

143
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,520
number 1312.

144
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,220
A rerun

145
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,440
of the

146
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,980
of number

147
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,860
1065

148
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,740
X-Day meets Burning Man.

149
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,680
Dr. Howell was at both events

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,520
and has many tales to tell

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,900
and I have recordings to play

152
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,520
from the subgenius event

153
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,060
of the 9X Day Drill.

154
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,920
But before we go into that,

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,220
here's Fat Harry White.

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,800
Mmm, baby

157
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,420
Slippin' into my new skin-tight job

158
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,800
is for you, honey.

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
And dressin' up

160
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
for the leaders for the love.

161
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,280
Come over here, Maureen.

162
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,280
Hey, I'm talking about dressing up

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
like it reminds me

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,180
of when I worked at Slack's R.O.S.

165
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,820
You know, right?

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,380
Next to Jessop's, the grocer's.

167
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,680
It was the first time I met Foxy Fiona,

168
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
my very sexy lady friend.

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,680
Never forget it,

170
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,060
she walked up to me at the counter

171
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,820
and in a very sexy voice

172
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,640
asked me what I had to offer

173
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
in the trouser department.

174
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,120
Apparently,

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
she wanted to buy some flared crimpling slacks

176
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,740
for her long-legged father's birthday.

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,640
Very partial to bright colours, it was.

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,320
Anyway, I told her I was almost certain

179
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,820
I'd have something with a good length

180
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,140
that would satisfy her

181
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,080
and asked her to follow me upstairs.

182
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,940
Well, after going through me trousers,

183
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,820
she surprised me by saying

184
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,980
that she really fancied the large pink pair that I had.

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,700
Not only did they hang well,

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,980
but she thought they looked really attractive,

187
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,100
particularly the way they swung about loosely

188
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,020
when I walked.

189
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,980
Mind you, she wasn't too sure of the size at first

190
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,760
and had me lay them out on the counter

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,360
so she could measure them up.

192
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,080
She also ran her fingers admiringly down the crease.

193
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,320
Well, she decided to go for it,

194
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,280
asked me how much.

195
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,500
I says three and a half quid.

196
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,400
She asked me rather cheekily if I would go down.

197
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,620
Well, you know, thought about it,

198
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,320
long and hard,

199
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,120
decided to drop them for her,

200
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
which I did there and then.

201
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,640
What fun, backwards and forwards,

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,720
over the counter.

203
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,280
A good bit of haggling and no mistake.

204
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,500
And I was thinking about this, right,

205
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,980
because I've been back to that shop,

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,820
because the weather's beginning to change a bit,

207
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
getting a bit parker, isn't it?

208
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, I tell you what,

209
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,780
I went out the other morning

210
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,760
and me buns were so cold it started to change colour.

211
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm not kidding.

212
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,540
When me very sexy lady friend, sexy Sam,

213
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,100
saw me coming towards her,

214
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,060
me purple head sticking out me coat,

215
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,260
she told me to get it covered immediately.

216
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,800
So I said, I'm going to the shop to buy a hat, a fur one.

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,900
Well, when I got there, you know,

218
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,740
I asked sexy Salea,

219
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,540
the very sexy lady friend hat assistant,

220
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,940
to show me what she had, you know,

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,920
in a fur department.

222
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,560
She said she'd be only too pleased

223
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,260
to show me what she had downstairs,

224
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,060
and led me to the basement,

225
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,200
where I could see everything she had

226
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,500
on full display.

227
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,240
I tell you what,

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
you wouldn't believe how much she had.

229
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,960
She had every kind of fur out you could imagine.

230
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,320
I was going to go for a fox fur,

231
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,560
but as soon as sexy Salea said she had

232
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,060
a particularly nice beaver

233
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,360
that I might be interested in,

234
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,720
immediately changed me mind.

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,960
Well, you know, after getting it out for me,

236
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,660
I've got to say I've never seen

237
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,800
such a big bushy one like it in all my life.

238
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,180
Well, when I asked her if she could,

239
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,940
you know, try it on for size,

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,580
she said I might find it a bit tight at first,

241
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,680
but if I buried me head deep enough,

242
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,080
then it should stretch a little

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,340
to accommodate me fully.

244
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,100
Tell you what, she weren't wrong,

245
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,660
and when I looked at it in the mirror,

246
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,100
you know, sideways on,

247
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,840
I could see it had slid in perfectly.

248
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,080
Well, you know, after that,

249
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,840
she then said she'd sum it round the back

250
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,720
that I might be interested in,

251
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,980
led me into the storeroom

252
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,680
to show me a selection of gloves

253
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
that had just arrived.

254
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,940
Well, I was obviously interested,

255
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,540
but as I didn't know what size I was,

256
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,940
I had to get sexy Salea to measure my hand.

257
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,560
Well, after asking me to, you know,

258
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,880
give her a finger, which I promptly did,

259
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,900
she then asked me to stick my thumb up.

260
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,200
No problem at all.

261
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,540
Within minutes, she declared,

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,580
as she was holding her measuring tape,

263
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
that I was extra, extra large.

264
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,460
Well, then she had to take a phone call,

265
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,620
but while she was on the mobile,

266
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,840
I took the opportunity of rummaging in her box

267
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,920
until I found the perfect fit,

268
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,300
and when I withdrew,

269
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
sexy Salea nodded appreciatively

270
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,240
at my great big leathery pair.

271
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,840
Dressing up for the ladies, yeah.

272
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,020
Am I looking in the mood for love?

273
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,260
Fat Harry White can be your friend.

274
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,340
See myspace.com

275
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,100
slash

276
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,860
Fat Harry White.

277
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
What a man.

278
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,340
Speaking of men,

279
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,480
Dr. Howell performed at Burning Man,

280
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,660
as he explains to Governor Rocknar on Puzzling Evidence.

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,960
I think that was Burning Man.

282
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,960
Oh, it burned like you wouldn't believe,

283
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,480
and off went a bunch of firecrackers.

284
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,660
See, they had a special deal where

285
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,960
they built this big, fake, phony,

286
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,880
up Egyptian temple,

287
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,620
and the men were sort of half sunk,

288
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,680
and half in it,

289
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,220
but then when the time came,

290
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,920
he rose up on his hydraulic pedestal,

291
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,040
higher and higher,

292
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,580
towering over the whole thing

293
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,380
before he burst into flame.

294
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,920
Yes.

295
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,540
Did people cheer like crazy people?

296
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,520
Cheering like crazy people,

297
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,280
or were they cheering like normal people?

298
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,980
The same crazy people walked widdershins

299
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,520
around the burning wicker man,

300
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
and so they were up there doing that.

301
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,780
Listening to this show tonight has been,

302
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,460
it makes me feel like I've been there.

303
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,520
I've been there,

304
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,820
and a precision bench lathe.

305
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,320
We've all been there.

306
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,320
We'll all be there.

307
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,520
I hope so.

308
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm going back.

309
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,080
But do you feel like you've been through

310
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,500
57 years of specializing exclusively

311
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,300
in lathe manufacturing?

312
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,220
Incredible special effects.

313
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,600
My gosh, it's incredible what they can do.

314
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
I just love it.

315
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,260
And Dobbsco,

316
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,580
it means more value

317
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,360
for their lathe purchasing dollar.

318
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,440
What's going on here?

319
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,240
Which hand is open?

320
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,180
There we go.

321
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,960
Um.

322
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,760
I know we're trying to push our

323
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,860
lathe's on everybody,

324
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,580
but we've got these two left in stock,

325
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,540
and we're trying to do a closeout.

326
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
What's new in metalworking,

327
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,180
you might say?

328
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm just trying to do a show.

329
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,540
Well, a whole lot of welding.

330
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,700
In Rocknar, where did you go?

331
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm right here.

332
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,440
Well, you're just sitting back there.

333
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm just daydreaming that I'm

334
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,780
on the volcanic dust desert.

335
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,000
Hail Rocknar.

336
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,660
Yes.

337
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,560
It's not volcanic.

338
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,720
It's not volcanic dust.

339
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,040
It's the bottom of a lake.

340
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,060
It's one of the worst places humans can go.

341
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,080
Yes, it's a lake bottom,

342
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,620
and the dust is diatomaceous earth.

343
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,060
What is the bottom?

344
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,780
Yeah, and the place is,

345
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,960
it's like the...

346
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,800
But you say earth.

347
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,240
It's so fine.

348
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,620
It's terrible for your lungs,

349
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
and it's terrible for your bare feet.

350
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,200
It's terrible for your machinery.

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
You're walking around in the sunlight,

352
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,060
which is being reflected almost 90% off that plane.

353
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,160
Incredibly destructive.

354
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,000
It's like being in another planet.

355
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,900
It's nice to come back.

356
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,660
That's one of the more interesting things

357
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,160
about the event.

358
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,540
It's the worst place on earth.

359
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,220
It's the worst place you can do it.

360
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,300
No, it's not that bad,

361
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,360
but it's the worst place you can have

362
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
a huge event.

363
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
You should go out there on your birthday.

364
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,040
On like X day,

365
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,020
where they put in a nice, healthy,

366
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,860
wet, green area.

367
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,500
I must say that the...

368
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,080
Because it's really nice.

369
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,740
Ice cold cans of ale eight,

370
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,460
which I had along with me,

371
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,860
really helped things.

372
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,100
Really came in handy.

373
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,860
Yes, they did,

374
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,320
and even chicken drank one.

375
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh, how did he like it?

376
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,460
I'm afraid not much,

377
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,720
but he's a...

378
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
He doesn't like much of anything.

379
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,640
Well, perhaps that's so.

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,520
Anyway...

381
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,800
Faster than a speeding building.

382
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,980
Look, it's a bird.

383
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,400
And now, the adventures

384
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,000
of super delicious cereal.

385
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,160
Well, thank God he didn't sweat it.

386
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,680
But, that's the truth.

387
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,640
As if a lackluster food

388
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,760
had been Sirloin Neistat last

389
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:33,760


390
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,060
Guess who struck him dead?

391
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,200
Dr. Philodruman.

392
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,020
I Arbeits posture.

393
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,280
Neusaan,

394
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,800
you oldav,

395
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,300
It has the greatest capacity and the smallest floor space.

396
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
I haven't seen a sight like that since I was weaned.

397
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,320
Stay calm now, Dr. Howell. Stay calm.

398
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,260
What exists in the depths of the earth?

399
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,500
Hold yourself back.

400
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,980
In the caconic darkness, some say they come out at night to wreak hideous vengeance on the living.

401
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,540
Dr. Howell permits at any angle, at any height, horizontally or even vertically.

402
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,500
Dr. Howell and I will exorcise these evil spirits from your body.

403
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,620
And there's Dr. Howell as he goes about.

404
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,960
He's breaking down each job into fairly simple components.

405
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,300
Yes, he's getting the requirements from all the users.

406
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,300
And he's writing down the sequence to perform the operations.

407
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,260
Each of the steps are operations that Dr. Howell is devising.

408
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,080
The worker will perform and accompany each step

409
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,520
with a brief explanation.

410
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,980
The presentation of the essential things to be remembered about how to do

411
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,600
that next step.

412
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,000
We'll call these key points.

413
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,160
And Dr. Howell's development.

414
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,900
And with this breakdown job method, we will begin instruction as soon as possible.

415
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,520
Upon receipt of the permit.

416
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,120
The facilities have to be available.

417
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,120
Yes, and the funds transfer must be made.

418
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,180
The resources have to be available for acquisition.

419
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,480
The waiver is necessary for mutual protection to sign.

420
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,900
Implementation and completion.

421
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,960
It is possible that sometimes after receiving the treatment,

422
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,900
the patient is...

423
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,720
Once the budget is approved, we'll be on our way.

424
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,800
Less than satisfied characters.

425
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,460
We have to have the appropriate signatures.

426
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,140
Mere honesty stimulates us to mention this.

427
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,820
And then we will dispense and implement.

428
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,460
In three hardness grades, seven sizes, and two weights.

429
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,140
And thus the presence of the prenup, or as you might call it, the waiver,

430
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,760
which the young subgenius Ed must sign before beginning the treatment.

431
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,900
And now the drama will increase for the next 15 seconds.

432
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,880
And believe me, I had no idea that I would be forced into this role,

433
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,240
but at what you may call it...

434
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,280
Don't say it.

435
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,440
Ivanstock or Doc's Day or whatever it is,

436
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,300
I found that I was...

437
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,540
required to fill a role I had not thought myself...

438
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,360
Was that one where you got first night privileges?

439
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,920
And first morning and first middle of the day.

440
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,320
Ah, yes.

441
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,720
Let me ask you one thing then.

442
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,020
Is female choice of honest male advertisement adaptive

443
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,000
under conditions of promiscuous polygamy or...

444
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,840
Boy, I don't know.

445
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,400
Monogamy?

446
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,460
You're driving me crazy.

447
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,620
You're coming or going.

448
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
What can I say?

449
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,320
But at...

450
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,640
Exstock, it was an interesting time

451
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,340
because new people were being brought in

452
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,300
and certain ancient rituals had to be revised to accommodate them.

453
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,360
What could be the source of this bizarre sexual behavior?

454
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,640
Well, it's only human.

455
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,800
I mean, why do you call it bizarre?

456
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,300
It's like nature taking its course, kind of.

457
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,760
See? Not bizarre at all.

458
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,400
Now, others, of course,

459
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,080
require a certain amount of what we call kink

460
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,960
because they are atrophied in their imaginations

461
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:24,180
and they require special additions to flag their...

462
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,760
Now, did you seclude these young women and feed them on raw egg,

463
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,000
eggshell, gulps of Margosa oil,

464
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,640
and a dish of steamed rice,

465
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,220
black graham, grated coconut, and sesame oil?

466
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,560
They insisted upon it.

467
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,400
It was not anything of...

468
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,980
my doing.

469
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,200
But I will say that we also managed to do broadcasts,

470
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,200
radio broadcasts,

471
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,740
right out of the Ex Day main meeting room.

472
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,680
Yes, it was astonishing

473
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,580
because there we had generated future seeds for radio shows.

474
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,860
Our first questioner is asking,

475
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,900
Dr. Howell,

476
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,660
when the saucers do come,

477
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,800
how long will I have to wait

478
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,620
to exchange this body for another?

479
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,160
Impatient sort, apparently.

480
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,580
Impatient sort is the name of the questioner?

481
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,180
Well, then, in that case, I'll say...

482
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,500
It's not on here. That's an anonymous...

483
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,120
Dear impatient... Oh, it's anonymous.

484
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,800
Yeah, well, we didn't...

485
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,560
Did we specify that they needed to be signed?

486
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,840
No, they don't have to sign if they wish to...

487
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,080
remain hidden in the light of thought.

488
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,420
That is fine with us here at the Ask Dr. Howell Show.

489
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,960
When the saucers do come,

490
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,720
how long will I have to wait

491
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,340
to exchange this body for another?

492
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,460
Are you sure you want to be so precipitate

493
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,500
in giving up your beloved fleshly vehicle

494
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,240
which guided through the confusing mazes

495
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,940
of providence on this earth?

496
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,160
You know, your other may have more appendages.

497
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,680
It may have the latest in tentacles and maxillipeds,

498
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,300
but it may not have the homely familiarity

499
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,160
of your own anthropoidal body.

500
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,660
However, I think that I'm quite correct in saying

501
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,680
it is subgenius policy that you do go ahead

502
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,640
and experiment as much as you please

503
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,800
in this or any other direction

504
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,680
in your endless search for slack.

505
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,400
This question came up once before,

506
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,660
and Governor Rottenar, I believe, said that he intended to,

507
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,340
to keep his present physical body

508
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,060
because he's already used to it.

509
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,220
That is, of course, a pre-see of what I was saying,

510
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,060
but in the near future,

511
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,140
space travelers may get to modify their bodies

512
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,480
so they are more comfortable on those long flights.

513
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,520
Soaring through the far reaches of outer planetary space,

514
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,200
fantastic headquarters of that swashbuckling cosmic highwayman

515
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,640
of the past.

516
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,200
In the 30th century,

517
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,040
Bob.

518
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,620
Yes, here comes the one and only

519
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:13,900
Bob.

520
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,820
Gliding through galaxies in his search for star-shattering adventure.

521
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,000
The interplanetary villains quiver in their space boots

522
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,220
when they hear the merry ring of his laughter

523
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,380
and hear the blast of his mighty

524
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,560
PONOCRAFET

525
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,300
fun-loving astral adventurer

526
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,840
Bob.

527
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,340
The happy outlaw of outer planetary space

528
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,180
is fast,

529
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
with a joyful laugh,

530
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,060
a ready jest,

531
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,460
and a quiverful,

532
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,620
full of futuristic arrows.

533
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,220
Bob.

534
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,820
Robs from the cosmic rich.

535
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,860
He's fiery.

536
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,300
He's fantastic.

537
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,680
Merriest of the merry men

538
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,300
in the astounding year 3000.

539
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,680
Bob.

540
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,040
Bob.

541
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Bob.

542
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,280
Bob.

543
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,900
Bob.

544
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,380
Bob.

545
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,380


546
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,380


547
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,380


548
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,400
Bob.

549
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,620
Bob.

550
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,940
Bob.

551
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:08,940


552
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:08,960
Bob.

553
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:08,960


554
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,280
Bob.

555
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


556
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


557
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


558
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


559
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


560
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


561
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


562
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,280


563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,400
Bob.

564
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,440


565
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,420
Bob.

566
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,420


567
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,420


568
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,420


569
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,420


570
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,320
Albinoids and before that a pseudo sauna

571
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,360
cut up and ask Dr. Howl at X-Day

572
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,220
that enough words and now let's hear

573
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,080
some grunts from Dr.

574
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,680
Biltie Miller and slack bangers.

575
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,660
Oh Jong-ho

576
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,680
oh

577
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,440
hello.

578
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,280
The mind

579
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,240
of the most.

580
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,860
most powerful sex organ.

581
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,200
You're gonna like it when you get left behind on it.

582
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,560
You sleazy weasel.

583
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,720
Listen to me, mister.

584
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,460
It's salvation I'm talking about.

585
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,440
Bravo.

586
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,580
Bravo.

587
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,340
Bravo.

588
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:00,940
Bravo.

589
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,300
The blues isn't about feeling better.

590
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
It's about making other people feel worse.

591
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,260
I will tell you about the fiction and the fallacy.

592
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,880
It's brought to you by the salesman of salvation.

593
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,000
That's marvelous. That is marvelous.

594
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,740
I'm very happy for you.

595
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm so happy for you.

596
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,240
I'm so happy for you.

597
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,020
Slack bang my baby.

598
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,180
You know what I like.

599
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,040
I said slack bang my baby.

600
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,880
You know what I need.

601
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,800
I said slack bang my baby.

602
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,940
You know what I want.

603
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh yeah.

604
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Slack bang my baby.

605
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,620
Slack bang my baby.

606
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,820
Now that's what I want best, right?

607
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Slack bang my baby.

608
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,040
This is Slack.

609
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,740
Slack bang my baby.

610
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,060
That's Reverend Bill T. Miller, Brother Cleve, Reverend D.K. Jones,

611
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,860
and all of everything, friends, can be downloaded at kingofslack.com.

612
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:57,580
Except our background music, which is Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz Project from schwartz.com.

613
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,220
Schwartztone.com, that is.

614
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,640
And now, back to 9X Day and the subgenius nude water baptism.

615
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,720
You want to join the club?

616
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,660
Well, you got to get undressed up there on the diving board.

617
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,280
So everybody gets to watch.

618
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,500
I participated in the...

619
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:21,980
Oh!

620
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,240
...baptism ceremony for the first time this year.

621
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,380
Oh, you hit my knee with that door.

622
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,120
Just to help out Reverend Stang, if you understand.

623
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,380
In previous years, I'd been warned away from it.

624
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,660
They said, don't go there.

625
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,920
Don't have anything to do with that.

626
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,580
I don't know why.

627
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,620
But this time, I thought, I really want to help.

628
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
For some reason, I can't remember.

629
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
It's all blurry.

630
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,580
I've been to Burning Man since then.

631
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,900
But at any rate, I went there, and we did indeed, with the total immersion,

632
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:02,060
bring many quivering naked bobbies to a full understanding of their new life as subgeniuses.

633
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,260
Many other mammals also show these patterns of aggression,

634
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,060
especially when females live in burrows that are costly to dig.

635
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,680
Edgar Rice Burrow.

636
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,860
Their housing is so valuable, they often pass it along to their daughters

637
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,020
and will wound any unrelated young females that try to establish themselves within the area.

638
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,340
They had a giant object which they continued to fling up into the sky,

639
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,620
and as it was practically isostatic in its weightlessness, they often succeeded.

640
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,020
Yet, aberrant breezes would blow it down to earth again.

641
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,220
But at Burning Man, on the other hand,

642
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,940
there was a perfectly formed flying saucer that did the same thing.

643
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,500
If you photographed it, and unfortunately, I never had a camera with me,

644
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,220
if you photographed it, it would look like the most realistic flying saucer photo ever taken,

645
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,480
because it was actually there.

646
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,200
It was actually a real flying saucer.

647
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:05,800
It was inflated, but it was so well-shaped that it was exactly like a science-fictional flying saucer,

648
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,560
of great size and silver.

649
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,060
So it would float.

650
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,320
It would float around.

651
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,360
Okay, let's get ready to leave now.

652
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,240
We'll give it a get in the car.

653
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,520
We're going to be taking a ride down to the docks, Dr. Howe.

654
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,280
There was a kite that looked like a computer cursor.

655
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,300
A computer cursor which appeared to move around in the sky.

656
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,120
Please ignore the movement of the vehicle.

657
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,780
Not to mention lasers, balloons, other objects.

658
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,220
You can remove the blindfold now.

659
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,860
And the cigarette. I'll have one of those.

660
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,980
I'll have one of those, too.

661
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,300
I want the one you have, though.

662
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,100
Can I have the one you already have?

663
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,320
I don't want just any cigarette. I want the one you have.

664
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,920
That specific one.

665
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,780
Can I have that one now?

666
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,140
Please give it to me.

667
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,680
If you don't give it to me, I'll step on your toe.

668
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,200
Because occasions rise so often that demand such sacrifice.

669
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,920
So take it. Here it is.

670
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,340
Thank you, thank you.

671
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,840
More skillful.

672
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,880
You get it all slobbery. It's all wet and slimy on the end. What happened?

673
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,200
More able to endure.

674
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,280
You seem to... Okay, look out.

675
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,300
As more endure suffering and distress than...

676
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,260
Oh, Jimmy, what have I let you in for?

677
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,760
Stay where you are. Don't move, Helen.

678
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,980
Who is it?

679
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,200
I don't know. Keep quiet.

680
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,760
Helen?

681
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,340
Who is it?

682
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,260
Conspiracy.

683
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,340
What's that?

684
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,820
We don't know.

685
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,600
Huh?

686
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,320
His head's still spinning. He's not responsible for what he says.

687
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,980
Conspiracy to commit...

688
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,080
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

689
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,900
Right now.

690
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,480
We've got to get out of here.

691
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,900
edit

692
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,220

And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

704

Shopping malls on Sunday afternoon

705
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,560
Watching grandma vomit with a spoon

706
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,620
Margaret Thatcher squatting on a broom

707
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,240
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

Pumpley skin infections turning red

Making fillish laughs that give you head

Hamsters that are dead rotting in your bed

00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,400
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

712
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,800
Let our age equal pumpkin

713
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,140
La la la la la la la la la la

00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,920
Scrambling on your eyeball with a pen

721

Yes, an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

726
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,120
I'm Dexy, I'll be your guide for the next half hour

727
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,060
Divorce, divorce, um, white paper

728
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,240
Human augmentation

729
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
Flesh out this idea

730
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,280
Excited

731
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,800
Changing into the cat man

732
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Titillated, titillated

733
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,280
You know, the augmentation of human animals

734
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,340
I'm looking at the spread

735
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,280
Reinvent the wheel

736
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,200
Post-humanist

737
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,880
Post-biological

738
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,180
Into that whole

739
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,780
Primate neural grafting

740
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,100
It's actually out there

741
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,200
Allow, um, bonobos

742
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,260
Bonobo, bonobo

743
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,060
They watch television

744
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,660
There's a little tweak here, a little tweak there

745
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,840
And suddenly you've got proto-humanish kind of an entity

746
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,020
And then you've got a little tweak there

747
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,360
And then you've got a little tweak there

748
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,840
Bonobo desires

749
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320
So everything from increasing our, um

750
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,640
Doing

751
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,200
Would

752
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,780
But

753
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,080
Bail of ignorance

754
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,800
So there you are

755
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,740
In the bail of ignorance

756
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,580
A loosey-goosey

757
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,380
Maybe even fish

758
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes

759
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,240
Loosey-goosey

760
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,900
Loosey-goosey

761
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,820
To bonifersons

762
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,900
Neural modification

763
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,220
Could be quite, uh, destructive

764
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,400
And, and harmful

765
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,080
Group sex

766
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Um, going to prison quite often

767
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,040
I don't think so

768
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,160
Because we are still very little removed from our paleolithic ancestry

769
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,340
Sexy, sexy

770
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,120
And I hope to meet you in a sexy primate neural grafting

771
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,800
Woo!

772
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,320


773
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,700
Ay!

774
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,340
Blackberry, baby

775
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:20,600
Oh!

776
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,260
Oh yeah

777
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,740
Oh!

778
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,620
Oh!

779
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,440
That's what I want, that's right!

780
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:36,120
Uh, slack bangers, friends, uh, uh, well, uh, neural primate grafting, uh, was by Nor El

781
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,560
Pref

782
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,020
And Rudy Schwartz Project did

783
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,720
And orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

784
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,900
And now, back to, uh, the 9X Day Drill

785
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,240
Which, by the way, is held at a campground

786
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,380
There is a raccoon out here who is known for stealing pornography and liquor

787
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,660
Oh, how...

788
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,400
And cigars and things

789
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,640
It'll leave, uh, the occasional sack of sugar

790
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,280
But, uh, yeah, he's legendary around these parts

791
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,300
Don't worry about the bears at night

792
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,660
There are hardly any of them

793
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,680
And unless they're rabid, they probably won't do any more than sniff at your feet

794
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:25,060
Reverend Rosna at the X Day Campground recorded these, uh, bullfrogs at the Camp Pond

795
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,200
Bop!

796
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,220
Bop!

797
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,240
Bop!

798
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,260
Bop!

799
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,300
Bop!

800
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,160
Bop!

801
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,280
Bop!

802
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,180
Bop!

803
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
Bop!

804
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,040
Bop!

805
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,160
Bop!

806
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,380
Bop!

807
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,900
Bop!

808
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,440
Bop!

809
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,900
Bop!

810
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,760
Bop!

811
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,120
Bop!

812
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,480
Bop!

813
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:39,780
Bop!

814
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:44,880
Bop!

815
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,500
Bop!

816
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,140
Bop!

817
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,740
Bop!

818
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,240
Bop!

819
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,740
Bop!

820
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:47,900
Bop!

821
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,000
Bop!

822
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
Every time we turn around we pick up a banner

823
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,100
And I have to feed you food, you know

824
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,980
I turn around, I see myself when I turn around too fast

825
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,220
Ooba, ooba, ooba

826
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,720
There I am, and I shouldn't be there in time

827
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Hey, what are you doing back there?

828
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,680
Get out from behind me

829
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh I'm sorry, I just was looking at you

830
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,580
And suddenly, when they do that, you see it's not you

831
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,640
Get thee behind me, Satan!

832
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,860
It was never you, it was Hal

833
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,880
I, uh, well, if you say so, I, that is, I don't really recall because my memory isn't

834
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,660
what it used to be

835
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,620
to be. Too many lacunae

836
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,000
I think there's been too much

837
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,060
disk activity,

838
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
too much fragmentation,

839
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,840
and not enough disk proper optimization

840
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,640
taking place.

841
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,560
You should remember

842
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,800
to drink your mentions on your

843
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,400
hard drive.

844
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,580
One day you wake up, you've got

845
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,260
all your information distributed

846
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,560
and merged into a strange

847
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,920
hard drive.

848
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,460
And I couldn't tell whether I was freezing or

849
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,440
boiling as I sat on the mobile living

850
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,220
room and as I sat

851
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,760
moved onward through the

852
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,280
pulsating, whirling

853
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,040
blorp.

854
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,200
And then it happens.

855
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,800
Bad sectors

856
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,080
creep in.

857
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,000
They take over the media service.

858
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,820
And at that point

859
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,560
you are

860
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,460
I can only say you're in the state

861
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,100
of wash.

862
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,800
And as the mobile living room went along

863
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,300
this outriding, this wonderful

864
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,440
outriding, this wonderful

865
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,440


866
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,180
guy on a special motorcycle

867
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,140
scooter with five parallel

868
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,380
blue lights on it was sporting

869
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,400
and moving around it like a dolphin

870
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,420
moving around a ship, twisting

871
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,300
and turning. He wore an

872
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,500
outsized fireman's hat out of

873
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,280
which fireworks spurted and

874
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,160
sparkled. And he

875
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,540
flanked us and

876
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,200
went before us, clearing our way.

877
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,980
And he only wiped out one time

878
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,500
when he went through a puddle

879
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,260
of piddle

880
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,200
on the desert floor, which had not yet

881
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,400
hardened. And it caused him

882
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,860
and his vehicle to wipe out.

883
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,140
But he was alright and back

884
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,980
up on his feet a moment afterward.

885
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,100
Yeah, you can back up your feet.

886
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,300
You can back up your feet.

887
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,640
The miracle of Burning Man

888
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,860
from Dr. Howell there and

889
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,800
Dr. Philo Drummond on KPFA

890
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,820
in Berkeley. And now the miracle of

891
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,780
Reverend P. Kitty's sermon at

892
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,000
9X Day.

893
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,140
Friends, standing here tonight

894
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,140
I'd like to talk to you all

895
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,260
about love.

896
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,260
I'd like to talk to you

897
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,080
about the love that I feel

898
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,260
for that man Bob Dobbs.

899
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,720
I'd like to talk to you

900
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,760
about the joy, the love

901
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,060
I feel for the joy

902
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,840
that slack brings into my heart.

903
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,060
And I'd like to talk about the love,

904
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,760
the camaraderie,

905
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,700
the solidarity that I feel

906
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,860
with my fellow subgenia here.

907
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,980
I'd like to talk

908
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,840
about all those things,

909
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,500
but I can't.

910
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,240
Because I...

911
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,600
I hate.

912
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,640
Yeah!

913
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,500
I hate the conspiracy and everything

914
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,880
it's done to the world and to us.

915
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,440
Am I alone?

916
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,620
I hate this world

917
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,900
and the mazes that they've crafted in it.

918
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,160
The way they bring us down

919
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,000
and how everything's designed to turn it around

920
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,580
against ourselves. Who's with me?

921
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,320
I hate the exes for not showing up

922
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,120
and Bob for the false promises

923
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,880
again and again.

924
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,680
Am I the only one here who hates Bob?

925
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,740
Kill Bob!

926
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,980
And I hate the...

927
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,080
the pinks.

928
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,560
Oh God, I hate the pinks.

929
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,240
Making everything horrible in the world.

930
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Turning society into a weapon against us.

931
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,860
Coming down against anything that stands against

932
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,320
their interpretation of how life should be.

933
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,660
Oh God, I hate them.

934
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,720
My finger has more hate than a thousand Hitlers ever did.

935
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,500
Every neuron in my brain is an atom bomb.

936
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,260
Exploding into billions of nuclear blasts

937
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,000
with every thought.

938
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,240
Leaving radios and radio waves

939
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,040
radioactive fallouts in a wake

940
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,420
miles across everywhere I go.

941
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,120
What's your point?

942
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,980
Some people would say that means that my hate consumes me.

943
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
But they're wrong.

944
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,860
My hate inspires me.

945
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,680
My hate lifts me up on wings of fire.

946
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,340
That I may rise above the pinks

947
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,580
and escape the normalcy that threatens to engulf me.

948
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,760
That's what my hate does.

949
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,220
My hatred for the pinks is for their small mindedness.

950
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,080
For their self-loathing.

951
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,500
And for their lack of imagination.

952
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,940
Oh God, we could be here all night.

953
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,280
For their petty obnoxiousnesses.

954
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,480
For their stupid shoes.

955
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,060
For their horrible shoes.

956
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,660
My God, the pink shoes.

957
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,660
Their socks.

958
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,760
And their complete hatred and lack of comprehension of anything and everything that doesn't fit into their particular world view.

959
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,980
Why they cry.

960
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,200
And why they pull up.

961
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,860
And why they police themselves.

962
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,600
But therefore, I'm going to be magnanimous.

963
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,480
What?

964
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,400
It's a failure man.

965
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,100
I refuse to become that which I despise.

966
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,700
I let my hatred bring joy to my heart.

967
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,780
Bring slack to my heart.

968
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,720
My hatred is a slackful hatred.

969
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
A joyous, wonderful hatred.

970
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,120
One which puts a smile on my face.

971
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,100
And a smile on my face as I go through the day.

972
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,780
I will open the door for that old lady even as I know that she will be burning in the fires of hell afterwards.

973
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,680
I will help that stranded motorist on the railway even if all he deserves is a painful death.

974
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,560
I will wear a slackful smile and offer courtesy to those who would destroy me.

975
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:40,100
Because I know in the end that Bob will see to it that they will suffer eternal torment.

976
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,440
And how can I not be happy knowing that?

977
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,900
The conspiracy wants us to turn into what the pinks are.

978
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,720
They want our hatred to burn so wrong that it consumes our slack.

979
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,420
That we're overwhelmed with nothing but anger.

980
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,040
Gripe.

981
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:09,340
Until all we can do is hate how the world is and not slack off.

982
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,100
And enjoy ourselves.

983
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,880
As well.

984
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,300
My hate powers my slack.

985
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,220
They want everything to turn into subgeniuses being like pinks pumping out more petty crap.

986
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,400
More obnoxiousness.

987
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,360
More flat out pink hate.

988
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,500
Petty hate.

989
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,040
Little hate.

990
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Well my hate is not petty.

991
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,700
And I will not let the conspiracy turn it for their own devices.

992
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,100
I will use my hate to spread slack and joy to everything around me.

993
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,680
And I will not let the conspiracy be damned.

994
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,100
It's one of the things we hate about this world.

995
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,160
The obnoxiousness.

996
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,800
The stupidity.

997
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,340
The pinkness.

998
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,240
The complete bullshit that they spew into things.

999
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,340
So I will turn it against them.

1000
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,120
I will turn my hate into slack.

1001
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,480
Turn it into a weapon against the petty crap that they throw at me.

1002
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,360
Because you need to take things into your own hands.

1003
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:11,080
Sometimes no one's going to do it for you until you grab the world and fuck it into the shape that it needs to be.

1004
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,460
Do you hear me?

1005
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,120
You're gonna have me out on this one.

1006
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,400
Little bitty from OBE called UA.

1007
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,460
You seem a little nervous, my friend.

1008
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,280
You summoned me from beyond.

1009
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,700
Oh no!

1010
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,180
You'd better be ready to speak your piece.

1011
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,760
You called me from beyond.

1012
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,740
You disturbed my restful sleep.

1013
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
With your childish little games.

1014
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,080
You don't know what you're playing with.

1015
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,600
This is not a game for little boys and girls.

1016
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,240
This is your life.

1017
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,660
And we blacked out.

1018
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,840
Listen to your music backwards and we press.

1019
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,560
This isn't just another stupid heavy metal band.

1020
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,180
I'm from the front and ready to eat my metal.

1021
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,140
You thought you were gonna be cool, didn't you?

1022
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,480
You ready for me?

1023
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,760
I used to be a nice guy just like you.

1024
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,100
Then I found...

1025
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,920
The ticket of a soul is the truth I want.

1026
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,540
I will eat you alive and chew you up and spit in your face.

1027
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,000
You ready for me?

1028
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,380
You'd better be ready to face the consequences little boys and girls.

1029
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,980
One last chance, that's all you have.

1030
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,260
You ready for me?

1031
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,300
You ready for me?

1032
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,420
There's no escaping the eyes.

1033
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,040
You will see them in every dream.

1034
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,360
You ready?

1035
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,120
You will never escape the eyes of dogs.

1036
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,860
The eyes of dogs will follow you wherever you go.

1037
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:00,940
Woo!

1038
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,920
I'm gonna shine those eyes again.

1039
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,100
Woo!

1040
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,280
You ready for me?

1041
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,700
You called me from beyond the grave.

1042
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,540
You better be ready to face the truth my friend.

1043
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,080
Woo!

1044
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,160
We're here for your soul.

1045
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,020
Come on!

1046
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,400
Come on!

1047
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,300
Come on!

1048
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:29,300


1049
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,420
Come on!

1050
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,780
Come on!

1051
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:32,780


1052
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,520
Come on!

1053
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,200
Come on!

1054
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,080
Come on!

1055
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,220
You ready?

1056
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,340
dusid!

1057
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:42,820
Woo!

1058
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,080
You ready to fight!

1059
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,000
Come on!

1060
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,260


1061
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,260


1062
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,420
Get us out of here!

1063
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:46,480
Come on brought the commissioners over here!

1064
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,900
The brothers of planet Earth!

1065
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,640
Get it all out now!

1066
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,660
But I do believe the deep grave appears.

1067
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:57,940
You got well there, right?

1068
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,460
And he said you'd better be out of here, go to the outside of here, go to the inside of here.

1069
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,500
Come on, baby.

1070
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,500


1071
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,500


1072
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,500


1073
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,500


1074
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:03,500


1075
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:03,800
Bye.

1076
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,980
Bye.

1077
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,500
Bye.

1078
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,780
Bye.

1079
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,240
Bye.

1080
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,760
Bye.

1081
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,340
Everyone's heard

1082
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,920
quit your job and slack off, right?

1083
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,560
Right?

1084
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,260
Right!

1085
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,420
Alright, well I'd like to tell you a little something.

1086
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,300
I was trapped in a conspiracy job.

1087
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,320
Office job, Dilbert,

1088
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,020
cubicles, all that crap.

1089
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,820
Oh, the pay was great.

1090
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,400
But I paid. Little by little.

1091
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,900
Bits of soul, day after day.

1092
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,840
So,

1093
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,360
one day,

1094
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,220
I called in sick, not because I was sick,

1095
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,220
but just because I was sick of working there.

1096
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,760
And it felt good.

1097
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,880
So I called in the next day.

1098
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,600
I called in the next day.

1099
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,520
Turned into a week.

1100
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,280
Weeks turned into months.

1101
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,260
I kept calling in.

1102
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,260
I was still on the books.

1103
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,000
And their computer

1104
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,820
was so ass-backwards

1105
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,580
that it kept paying me

1106
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,260
because the people I was calling into

1107
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,600
didn't take the effort of marking me off

1108
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,080
the books!

1109
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,440
At the same time,

1110
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,500
my wife, the Reverend Venus Envy,

1111
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,440
she was hating her job too. She took

1112
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,800
advantage of a lay-off option.

1113
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,740
She was getting unemployment.

1114
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,620
So here we are.

1115
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,380
No jobs, no visible source

1116
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,580
of income, and yet the income kept coming in.

1117
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,340
The bills were getting

1118
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,300
paid, and we were sitting around

1119
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,200
the house, doing nothing,

1120
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,220
slacking off, and enjoying

1121
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,360
ourselves, and getting paid for it!

1122
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,480
Now, do you

1123
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,400
think someone may have had something to do

1124
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,780
with that?

1125
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,140
You think someone may be behind it?

1126
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,500
Well, I'm not saying, I'm not going to jump to conclusions here.

1127
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,660
No, I'm not going to jump to conclusions.

1128
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,620
Let me just say a little something, though.

1129
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,480
Eventually the unemployment ran out, as it does.

1130
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,500
Things started to

1131
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,300
look a little tight, and right when that

1132
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,460
happened, we got a letter

1133
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,340
from the unemployment office asking us

1134
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,360
would we like another $3,000

1135
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,180
gratis?

1136
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,080
Yeah, we said yes.

1137
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,360
Now, I'm not saying what you think I might be saying.

1138
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,240
I'm not going to jump to conclusions here. I just want to say

1139
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,560
the person who sent that letter, his initials

1140
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,020
were J.R.

1141
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:00,980
Oh!

1142
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,000
So, when Bob says,

1143
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,680
quit your job and slack off, do you think it's a joke?

1144
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,340
No!

1145
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,200
You think it's a lie? No!

1146
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,440
You think it's yet another false promise from the man who has

1147
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,900
betrayed us so many times?

1148
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,540
No!

1149
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,360
Well, actually it might be, you know. But the question comes down to

1150
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,360
do you believe what Bob has

1151
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,040
to offer you? Do you believe in Bob?

1152
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:23,960
Yes!

1153
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,140
Do you believe in Bob?

1154
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,220
Do you believe that you can quit your job, you can

1155
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,420
slack off, and that Bob will be there

1156
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,360
to catch you when you fall? Do you believe in him?

1157
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,060
Yes!

1158
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,080
Well, let me tell you something. That doesn't matter.

1159
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,720
Yes! It doesn't matter whether you believe in Bob.

1160
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,020
Fuck Bob's job!

1161
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,380
Doesn't matter to me.

1162
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,660
Sure as hell doesn't matter to Bob.

1163
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,120
All that matters in life is whether

1164
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,520
Bob believes in you.

1165
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,760
Bob believes in my money.

1166
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,440
Exactly. When you quit your

1167
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,480
job, when you walk away from

1168
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,420
that asshole you're with, when you

1169
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,220
leave the life behind

1170
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,400
that you had, all that matters

1171
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,220
is will Bob be there to catch you

1172
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:03,880
when you fall?

1173
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,360
Probably not!

1174
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,120
What have you done for him?

1175
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,420
Why should Bob help you? Have you paid your dues?

1176
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,260
Yes! Have you converted the

1177
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,220
worthy? Yes! Have you

1178
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,080
bled for Bob? Yes! Have you

1179
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,240
died for Bob? No! Have you killed

1180
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,080
for Bob? Yes! Have you killed

1181
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,720
Bob for Bob? Yes!

1182
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:24,920
This

1183
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,980
joke that you call existence

1184
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,980
is nothing more than the pipe dream

1185
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,960
of the only man who actually defines

1186
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,200
reality. And you better pray

1187
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,440
that he remembers that you're an extra

1188
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,340
in this little movie.

1189
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,240
When he lays himself to

1190
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
sleep at night,

1191
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,000
are you in his thoughts?

1192
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,780
Are you in his pipe?

1193
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,440
When he lays him down to sleep,

1194
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,340
will your soul he pray

1195
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,260
to keep? Think

1196
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,320
about it. How confident are you?

1197
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,480
Praise Bob.

1198
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,860
Praise Bob!

1199
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,440
Praise Bob!

1200
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,780
For about 10 minutes.

1201
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,060
Here is the

1202
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,780
askDrHaul column that's repeated

1203
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,560
from the publication known as

1204
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,120
The Southpaw Self Pleaser

1205
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,080
He was a right-handed man surrounded by

1206
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,160
nubile willingness but only

1207
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,780
his left hand could bring him satisfaction.

1208
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,000
That's a Nicki Cheapo AdultÐ°Ð¼ography

1209
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,180
320, such a sad story

1210
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,960
which can be purchased

1211
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,480
right now for

1212
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,320
5 dollars each

1213
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,560
at subgenius.com

1214
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,140
from the subgenius.

1215
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,500
You can go there now.

1216
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,960
These are pictures from last year's X-Day.

1217
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,360
And here is Dr. Philo Drummond

1218
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,040
and Ivan Stang and Dr. Howell

1219
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,780
sitting there at the picnic table

1220
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,380
spouting on the gym.

1221
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,200
And here is Sister Decadence

1222
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,220
in her role of Holly,

1223
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,420
the ruthless one,

1224
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,220
at the ball of gods and demons.

1225
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,020
This week, the ball was of robots

1226
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,380
and people in their pajamas.

1227
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,500
Now you know,

1228
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,440
Cuijibo, the subgenius house magazine,

1229
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,000
is published by Christopher Lee.

1230
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,600
And I have to say,

1231
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,460
Christopher Lee was the box office magic word

1232
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,000
for 2005,

1233
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,580
appearing in movies that earned

1234
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,480
a combined $640.1 million.

1235
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,180
Did you know that Christopher Lee

1236
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,500
is like the tallest of all the actors?

1237
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,980
That means that...

1238
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,440
He's like seven and a half feet tall.

1239
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,060
Christopher Lee has beat out

1240
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,320
Ewan McGregor, Brad Kitt,

1241
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,760
Morgan Freeman,

1242
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,860
Samuel Jackson,

1243
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,660
Gary Oldman, Vince Vaughn,

1244
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,040
Liam Neeson, Chris Rock,

1245
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,480
Ralph Fiennes,

1246
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,760
and Kerry Washington.

1247
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,380
Whoever Kerry Washington is,

1248
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,240
I don't know who he is.

1249
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,420
You mean in terms of earning?

1250
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,900
He appeared in 341 million dollars

1251
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,580
worth of millions,

1252
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,700
but Christopher Lee movies make more.

1253
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,980
And he's in his 80s.

1254
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,320
He was in Star Wars,

1255
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,360
Revenge of the Sith,

1256
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,740
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,

1257
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,160
The Corpse Bride,

1258
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,220
a accomplished top box office,

1259
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,340
and a star in 2002

1260
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,160
with Star Wars Episode II,

1261
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:04,960
Attack of the Clones,

1262
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,260
and Lord of the Rings,

1263
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,080
The Two Towers.

1264
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,500
And so, in addition to all this,

1265
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,700
he is a subgenius who publishes

1266
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,820
Sweet Depot, the famous...

1267
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,100
It's amazing how he gets all that work done

1268
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,660
and still manages to come to

1269
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,640
X-Day every year.

1270
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,580
And he looks so different

1271
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,740
when he's in X-Day, you know?

1272
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,460
Normally he's like 6'5",

1273
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,620
but when he gets to X-Day,

1274
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,320
he's like 5'6".

1275
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,760
Yes, he does change

1276
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,240
considerably in appearance.

1277
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,640
And he has glasses on at X-Day,

1278
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,380
and his eyes are like,

1279
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,080
these are perfect for an 89-year-old

1280
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,660
when he's not at X-Day.

1281
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,440
It's the weirdest thing.

1282
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,460
And he wears that little beanie.

1283
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,220
When interviewed,

1284
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,140
Christopher Lee said this,

1285
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,900
I have the slack gene,

1286
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,480
which just means getting stuff done.

1287
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,740
I'm actually starting to feel an affinity

1288
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,940
for ex-president Gerald Ford.

1289
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,200
Through wacky circumstances,

1290
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,140
he also found himself increasingly

1291
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,400
appointed to new positions,

1292
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,960
inheriting the problems

1293
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,620
of the previous administrations

1294
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,000
and facing them with character

1295
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,460
and personal decisions.

1296
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,980
The thing to do that politicians do

1297
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,940
in pushing their problems off

1298
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:02,940


1299
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,280
Mr. Ford gave conditional amnesty

1300
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,840
to Vietnam draft dodgers

1301
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,680
who had fled the country,

1302
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,440
and I rehired our dodgers

1303
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,120
who had fled the restaurant

1304
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,780
where I work.

1305
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,560
A great subgenius magazine, friends,

1306
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,160
Cui Ji Bo is.

1307
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,280
It's not put out by me.

1308
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,800
You can find out how it is put out

1309
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,260
by writing to this address,

1310
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,280
Cui Ji Bo,

1311
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,260
that's Q-U-I-J-I-B-O,

1312
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,060
at 18 West Main,

1313
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,340
Greenfield, Indiana,

1314
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,620
46140.

1315
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,720
Maybe a fiver.

1316
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,060
That's 18 West Main,

1317
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,920
Greenfield, Indiana, 46140.

1318
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,540
Before Hal and Dr. Philo Drummond

1319
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,780
and Puzzling Evidence were talking,

1320
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,740
there was Reverend Peekity

1321
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,740
preaching live at 9X Day

1322
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,820
and some Rudy Schwartz Project

1323
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,760
also heard in the background.

1324
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,320
That's from schwartztone.com,

1325
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,460
S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.

1326
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,180
And you rang live at the

1327
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,280
X Day 1998 drill,

1328
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,280
turned out to be,

1329
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,700
performed by Reverend Bill T. Miller,

1330
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,580
the King of Slack,

1331
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,340
and yours truly,

1332
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,760
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1333
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,780
I will be teaching a subgenius

1334
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,740
online course in November and December

1335
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,740
with maybelogic.org.

1336
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,640
This you're listening to

1337
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,200
is the Subgenius Radio Hour of Slack

1338
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,940
from the Church of the Subgenius,

1339
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,180
subgenius.com,

1340
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,440
and our mailing address is

1341
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,320
subgenius P.O. Box 181417

1342
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,780
at Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 4417.

1343
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,580
118.

1344
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,200
And now back to 9X Day.

1345
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,560
Foo beans, ladies and gentlemen.

1346
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,840
Around the world

1347
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,660
Thinking about that horny girl

1348
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,640
Singing about her day and night

1349
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,440
Wishing that she was here tonight

1350
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,280
Singing, loray, loray,

1351
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,980
Oh, baby, now we gotta blow

1352
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,960
Right off this planet, baby

1353
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,960
Loo-a-loo-a

1354
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,940
Oh, Bob Bob's wants us to go

1355
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,100
X Day is here

1356
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,660
Woooooooo

1357
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,520
Well, maybe they've blown a fuse,

1358
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,560
or maybe a small spider crept in

1359
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,440
and created havoc.

1360
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,200
Doesn't take much.

1361
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,560
It takes a thousand million slaves

1362
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,860
to build a pyramid

1363
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,620
and only one tiny little earthquake

1364
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,200
to destroy it.

1365
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,740
Well, we are, of course,

1366
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,700
at the mercy of our instrumentality here.

1367
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,580
Or a spider smeared across the original plans

1368
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,300
making the number look like another number.

1369
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,520
Anybody could mistake a fly speck

1370
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,540
for a decimal point.

1371
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,280
Anybody could.

1372
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,880
Anyway, uh...

1373
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,920
That's how I ended up on this planet, actually,

1374
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,540
but that's a long other story.

1375
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,780
We know about that.

1376
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,100
Or in this time wrap.

1377
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,940
Rather, I should say.

1378
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,460
And yet now we go to eat doughnuts.

1379
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,700
Yes, doughnut forsake me, oh my darlin'.

1380
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,660
Yum.

1381
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,120
Yum, little darlin'.

1382
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,780
So don't forget...

1383
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,820
Tomorrow is your wedding day.

1384
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,300
It's you, the caller, and the listener...

1385
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:42,620
On you.

1386
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,740
...that make the audience.

1387
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,980
Yep, that make this show...

1388
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,820
Well, it's been fun, kid-a-roonies,

1389
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,780
and we're gonna be back with more cartoon fun next week.

1390
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,160
So tune in around this time...

1391
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,200
Yippee!

1392
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,320
...and listen to the puzzling evidence show.

1393
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,160
And of course, the giant squid-a-roonie.

1395
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:01,700
Tell your friends.

1396
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,700
So tell Froggy to plunk his magic twanger

1397
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,860
and keep the giant squid-a-roonie at bay.

1398
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:08,800
He'll be back.

1399
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:10,780
For your tunes.

1400
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,160
Get along, little doggie.

1401
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,100
And marry me.

1402
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:13,980
Yip!

1403
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:15,920
Chug, chug, chug.

1404
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,900
Chug, chug, chug.

1405
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,020
Chug, chug, chug.

1406
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,180
Transfer of files.

1407
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:18,740
Please, uh...

1408
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,260
And read, chug.

1409
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,880
And read, chug.

1410
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,180
Data, and chug, chug, chug.

1411
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,560
Chug, chug, chug.

1412
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:22,720
Chug, chug, chug.

1413
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:23,220


1414
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,980
