1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
What the hell do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,340
It should be painfully obvious by now that the world as we know it won't last too much longer.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,340
And what are you going to do about it?

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,140
Going to work or school? Coming home? Goofing around?

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,540
What will happen to your routine when it all comes down at once?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,680
No?

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,100
Good!

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,760
Bob can show you that the fact is it's too late.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,220
Things are going to hell on a fast train and about the only thing you can do about it is to just sit back and watch the show.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,680
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse and take much longer than you thought.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,460
Will you be ready?

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,360
Will you still be sane enough to laugh when that which must come to pass comes to pass?

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,660
Yes!

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,080
And J.R. Bob Dobbs can...

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,940
And show you how!

17
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,660
BEHOUR...

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,920
OF SLACK!

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,600
Our Bob Slack.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,720
You're listening to Bob Slack Time Funhouse.

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm Doc Ellis.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,480
And that over there...

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,460
Dr. Bug Bladder.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,840
And tonight, we're not going to scare you with any facts like we've been doing for the past couple of shows.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,220
Tonight, we're going to escape this dirty, dirty world.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,920
And revisit the world of Filking.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,600
No, wait. Actually, the complete opposite.

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,500
You subgeniuses out there are, by definition, probably at least aware of science fiction

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,600
because you're participating in a saucer cult or a parody of a saucer cult or a...

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,020
Whatever the recruiter said to you is absolutely true, as long as the money keeps coming.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,500
And speculative fiction is one of the avenues that people of above-average intelligence really get off on.

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,380
And a few below average.

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,980
Well, those are the writers.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,680
And now, with the advent of the internet, you never have to forget

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
your favorite science fiction moment.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,580
That's right. There's no need to ever grow up or move on.

37
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,840
Do you remember this one?

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,300
Off we go, step inside.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,740
Surrey for a magic ride.

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
Roaring for the other side, where only rainbows hide.

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,620
On the Great Space Coaster.

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,920
On the Great Space Coaster.

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,840
On the Great Space Coaster.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,080
On the Great Space Coaster.

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,580
On the Great Space Coaster.

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,920
Off we go.

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,940
You've got to realize that a lot of the innovations developed just for entertainment

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,280
have actually come to be.

49
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,280
People wrote stories of going to the moon before we went to the moon

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,120
and probably gave us the idea, hey, we could probably do that.

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,860
Arthur C. Clarke wrote a story in which there was a geosynchronous satellite,

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,860
meaning a satellite that remains over the same relative spot on Earth

53
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,280
and sort of turns with the Earth.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,700
And the battle suits from...

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,000
Starship...

56
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,400
Star Troopers.

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,380
Well, in the book they've got these awesome suits,

58
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,840
kind of like Iron Man suits, really.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,540
They allow them to fight these bugs.

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
Well, they left it out of the movie, but the point is,

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,540
over in Iraq they've got these full-body...

62
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,140
Steel suits.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,820
Yeah, basically.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,560
Steel suits.

65
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,380
Hey, Frank Herbert.

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,140
There we go.

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,440
And if you're a Frank Herbert fan...

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
My condolences.

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,680
My condolences.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,240


71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,720
My condolences.

72
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,220
My condolences.

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,480
My condolences.

74
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,180
My condolences.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,280


76
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,640
My condolences.

77
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,720
My condolences.

78
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,100
My condolences.

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,080
My condolences.

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:09,340
My condolences.

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,600
My condolences.

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:17,340
Troops to war have come,

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,760
I've gone mad,

84
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,300
There's a Wenneger rather in Mesk...

85
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,680
A baby beneficial for お友 Pollock,

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,420
A four pack

87
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,220
You like him.

88
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,220


89
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,220


90
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,220


91
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,540
Oh, man, he had a....

92
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,540
See us again.

93
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,580
The internet itself would be considered science fiction to people from 20 years ago.

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,100
I consider it juba.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,180
That's voodoo.

96
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,700
That's not science fiction at all.

97
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Arthur C. Clarke said that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Hint, hint, jesophiles.

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,060
For real?

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,100
Jesus was an alien and he had a ray gun.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,800
And them ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings went to Ringworld and Larry Niven told them they got ringworm.

102
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,620
And they went to Dr. L. Ron Hubbard for treatment.

103
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,660
And all he did was lead them ring around to Rosie and took all their money and his burdens and stationed in their butt.

104
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,620
Now I'm here to complain.

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm here to complain.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,460
Are you the only one who can blame anything?

107
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,760
Hey,NING tuna, you know if you need something, tell me I can come get you!

108
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,180
If you're going to blame anything, then do you know what I'm doing?

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,960
Listen now.

110
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:14,960


111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,000
Do things give me meaning because the

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,260
you have better research than I am.

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,180
I guarantee the facts.

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,180


115
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,140
Boris, you know it perfectly.

116
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,500


117
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,260
And truly.

118
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,640
They come from the cities, yeah, they come from all around.

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,200
In Klingon garb, Picard, or Star Wars rose, zap, phase, stun.

120
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,120
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

121
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,060
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

122
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,940
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

123
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,720
Yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:52,760
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,940
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

126
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,120
Say goodbye to the words of the original versions of songs.

127
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,120
Now everybody's singing about the Hobbit or the system songs.

128
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,000
Some are black and some are white.

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,120
Got 20 on the con suite floor tonight.

130
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,240
When they start filking, you know that just ain't right.

131
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,640
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

132
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,180
Yeah.

133
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,320
Yeah.

134
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,680
Voices from nowhere and voices from the smaller cons.

135
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,620
Following others' visions, turns their characters into pawns.

136
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,340
There's Tolkien, Weiss, and Hickman, George Lucas.

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,100
Filkin father!

138
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,520
And McCaffrey, Roddenberry, Chris Carter.

139
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,140
Filkin father!

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,840
Gestor, Shatner, Nimoy, and don't forget Elrond.

141
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,000
Filkin in the U.S.A.

142
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,220
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

143
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,160
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

144
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,340
F-I-L-K to the U.S.A.

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,780
Yeah.

146
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,160
Yeah.

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,540
Filkin in the U.S.A.

148
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,480
Hey!

149
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,580
Because being appreciative of science fiction and speculative fiction

150
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,040
doesn't mean you have to overanalyze everything.

151
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,560
It's pretty funny to watch Harlan Ellison on the Sci-Fi Network,

152
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,760
seeing as he was one of those guys who bitched long and hard about it being called Sci-Fi

153
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,120
and was a big proponent of speculative fiction.

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
But, you know, they dangle that cash out there,

155
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,160
and he said,

156
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,380
Hi, I'm Harlan Ellison, and this is the Sci-Fi Network.

157
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,500
I don't think he likes sci-fi because it was like hi-fi,

158
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,000
and it just sounds like a pop term.

159
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,720
It does.

160
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,340
And he wants it to be taken seriously.

161
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,460
If you think about it, all fiction incorporates elements of science.

162
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,740
Yeah, well, all fiction is speculative, isn't it?

163
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
I'll get insane if I want to do this.

164
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,560
Yeah, and so now you're these guys.

165
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


166
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


167
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


168
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


169
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


170
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


171
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


172
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


173
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


174
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


175
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


176
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


177
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


178
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


179
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


180
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


181
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


182
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


184
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,560


185
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,860
You what?

186
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,240
The actor didn't talk about To Remembran himself?

187
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,300
No.

188
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,560
What's going on here?

189
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,340
How do you know where we're from?

190
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,560
If you've been off-planet, then you know that space travel can be a real drag.

191
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,220
Next time you're headed off-planet, be sure to pack a healthy supply of dehydrated diet stimu-swill.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,860
I can't believe people still take that stuff.

193
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,140
I mean, sleep isn't a problem if you stay... focused.

194
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,520
What the-

195
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,880
A space object?

196
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,280
What's the ship's status, computer?

197
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,520
A U.S.O.

198
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,080
Computer, play back at homo sap speed any information you have on U.S.O.

199
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,620
Hey, it's great to be here with you, uh, it's great to be here supporting the troops, uh,

200
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,260
A friend of mine said to take my wife, please, he took her, and then she cut his s*** off.

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,540
Ugh, cut it off, that's just terrible.

202
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Well, maybe I can get us... unstuck.

203
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
Open pod bay doors, pal.

204
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,080
Why not?

205
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,540
Well, one small step for- oh, hey look! We're just wedged into the exhaust duct of another ship!

206
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,420
Ugh, fart. Gag. Can't. Breathe.

207
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:33,380
No, I suppose, wait. Unless I farted at the exact same time.

208
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,040
Inferno, Bobby, where? You are treading on sacred ground!

209
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,000
Woo!

210
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,720
Woo!

211
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:52,220
There's no ground in space? Strange. Perhaps this is some sort of space spook house.

212
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,560
Computer, do we have any ghost ships on record in this quadrant?

213
00:11:59,660 --> 00:11:59,920
Computer?

214
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
Mommy?

215
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:11,840
Step right up, my good... man. Welcome to the galaxy's finest house of horrors and space oddities.

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,360
My name's Mr. Horang. Welcome.

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,420
23 credits, please.

218
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,960
Ah, a human. What luck. Look, my ship is right out there, and...

219
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,640
23 credits, my friend. 23 credits is all that stands between you and the thrills and excitement of...

220
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,940
My ship?

221
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,280
Your ship.

222
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,120
Seems to be stuck.

223
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,540
Stuck.

224
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,880
In your ship.

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,860
Your ship is stuck. In my ship.

226
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,100
Yes.

227
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,380
What? But... but how?

228
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,340
Well, I think I started to fall asleep while piloting, and...

229
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,160
Your computer didn't warn you?

230
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,460
Well, sometimes I shut the nav guide off and fly, you know, by the seat of my pants. It's fun.

231
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,620
There's nothing fun about this, Mr... Mr...

232
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,580
Commander Stipple, Galactic Reserve Hospitality Battalion C.

233
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,880
And what are you going to do to rectify this situation?

234
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,480
I was hoping you could help me.

235
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,880
No. No, no, no. No, no.

236
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,100
How? How could I help?

237
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,320
Well, do you have a crane I could borrow? Or a wedge thingy?

238
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,720
You know what? I like you. You're a little space happy, a little slow, but you make me laugh.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
Great. So then...

240
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Here's a card. It's for crane service. They'll fly out and help you get your ship off.

241
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
Ichabod Crane's Headless Whores.

242
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,240
Gimme that. Wrong card.

243
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,940
Urine Luck. Traditional Irish... Pee Parties.

244
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,620
Okay, so I don't really have a card for a crane service.

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,120
Look, Stipple, the problem here is I can't let you in.

246
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,380
If I let you in without the 23 credit charge, I'll get fired.

247
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,100
And by that, I mean the boss will set me on fire.

248
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,240
But I've only got enough air in my ship for a couple of days!

249
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,340
Yeah, mmm... Not my problem. Goodbye!

250
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,920
Pish. Argo Fargo Space Ass.

251
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,600
Hell, I don't need him or his so-called Space Crane.

252
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,460
Space Ass.

253
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,640
I sure could use a little space tail.

254
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,880
Computer?

255
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,800
Hilarious.

256
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,860
Was the Mecha Orgo sent so stupid?

257
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,360
Or was the Stimulatron damaged in the, uh...

258
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,820
Oh, come on, I saw it.

259
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,960
It's not that bad. It's just a little crunch.

260
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,240
It'll buff out.

261
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
It will.

262
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,940
I do.

263
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,120
So, was the Mecha Orgo sent so Stimulatron damaged in, uh...

264
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,940
The Fender Bender?

265
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,400
Again, hilarious.

266
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,700
I'm coming back to the ship, pal.

267
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,860
And I'll be back in a minute.

268
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,800
I'll be unavailable for twenty to thirty minutes, if you know what I mean.

269
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,160
Open pod bay doors, pal.

270
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,740
And do not say anything to the other bots on the ship.

271
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,460
Okay?

272
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,120
Okay?

273
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,820
Open pod door.

274
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,640
There it is.

275
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,240
Can you see it?

276
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,720
Humpf.

277
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:45,720


278
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,220
Boop.

279
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:50,820
Boop.

280
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,320
Boop.

281
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Boop.

282
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:51,820


283
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,220
Boop.

284
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,780
Boop.

285
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,620
Boop.

286
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,820
Boop.

287
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Thank you.

288
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,380
Thank you.

289
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,380
Thank you.

290
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
Thank you.

291
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,680
Cantina, open bay door.

292
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,660
Cantina, open bay door.

293
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,420
Sorry, Commander, but bay door mechanism is malfunctioning.

294
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,880
Please use manual override button to your left.

295
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,200
Come on.

296
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Come on.

297
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,500
What a piece of space junk.

298
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,000
That's a little harder, Commander.

299
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,580
Oh.

300
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,840
Oh, yeah.

301
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,320
Oh, yeah.

302
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,020
Just a little harder, please.

303
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,300
Oh.

304
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:13,620
Oh.

305
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,400
Damn it.

306
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,060
Open this door now.

307
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,080
Go get her, Tiger.

308
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,660
Run.

309
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah, you go get.

310
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,300
Freeze box, show content.

311
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,580
Do you believe a poo that bad transfer was left open by the last pair of two?

312
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,440
Man, that was a blowout.

313
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,080
Please prove I don't open first pair of two.

314
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,980
This is really just, I mean,

315
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,360
it's not opening.

316
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,880
I don't believe it's a rat.

317
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,060
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,820
I don't believe it's a rat.

319
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,380
Yes, yes.

320
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,260
Yes.

321
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,860
I don't believe it is.

322
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,220
That's a little faster.

323
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,360
Yes, sir.

324
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,620
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:58,680
Yes, sir.

326
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,080
Yes, sir.

327
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,080


328
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Open this door right now or so help me.

329
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,720
All right.

330
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,260
I just had a little bit of failure.

331
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,640
So she's a rat.

332
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,540
I bet you'll do it.

333
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
Hello, sir.

334
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,560
Shying your shoes, brush your jacket.

335
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,700
Fancy a good rogering?

336
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
Get the hell away from me.

337
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,840


338
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,840


339
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,840


340
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,840


341
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,840


342
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,840


343
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,060
Bottler.

344
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,100
It was all made in good fun, sir.

345
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:17,980
Chip's bar.

346
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Give me a mojito and a sake and so help me if you say one.

347
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,940
Gonna get some.

348
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,680
Yeah.

349
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,240
Woo hoo.

350
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,340
Oh yeah.

351
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,020
Mm mm.

352
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,860
Come on.

353
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,300
Ow.

354
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,280
Ha ha.

355
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,200
Go get her.

356
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,620
Yeah.

357
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,240
Tell us all about it.

358
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,940
Ha ha ha.

359
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah.

360
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,920
Oh yeah.

361
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,380
Unbelievable.

362
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,840
Door open now.

363
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,840
Oh, no.

364
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:43,840


365
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:43,840


366
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:43,840


367
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,640
You're a little too aggressive for me, sir, but it may work with these sensor bolts.

368
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,680
I'll bet none of the other commanders in any of the other Starfleets have ever had to deal

369
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,720
with stuff like this.

370
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,980
Why me?

371
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:02,160
Well, in retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have shtupped Star Command's wife or his daughter

372
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,920
or Star Command.

373
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,900
Oh, yes.

374
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,220
Oh, ha.

375
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,320
Hee hee hee.

376
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,360
Oh yeah.

377
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
Mm mm.

378
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,780
Ahem.

379
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,580
It's Commander Stipple.

380
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,540
Well, I was just in the neighborhood.

381
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,500
Ha ha ha.

382
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,180
May I come in?

383
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,560
Just for a while.

384
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,200
Come on.

385
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


386
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


387
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


388
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


389
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


390
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


391
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


392
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


393
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


394
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


395
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


396
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


397
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


398
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


399
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


400
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


401
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


402
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


403
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,200


404
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,100
Come on, baby.

405
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,680
Great.

406
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,380
Thanks, babe.

407
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm a little, you know...

408
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,280
Yeah.

409
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,420
Say, how about a drink?

410
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,780
I have a sake or a mojito.

411
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,440
No?

412
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Well, then you won't mind if I...

413
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,340
Mmm.

414
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,260
Come here, baby.

415
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,020
Did you miss me?

416
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,360
Yeah.

417
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,840
Now I've missed you.

418
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


420
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


421
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


422
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


423
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


424
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


425
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


426
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


427
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


428
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


429
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


430
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


431
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,200


432
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,860
It's no big deal.

433
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:09,860


434
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:09,860


435
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:09,860


436
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:09,860


437
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,820
What do you say we...

438
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,700
Mmm.

439
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,940
Mmm.

440
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,460
Hold on, baby.

441
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,200
Let me get out my captain's log.

442
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,320
Not tonight.

443
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,640
Not tonight.

444
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,420
I need you.

445
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,120
What?

446
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,680
I don't think that's strictly possible.

447
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,560
That's hot under that bunk.

448
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,960
Hey, I found a half a credit.

449
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,560
Ha ha.

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,760
of the bunk there. Oh, hi, Stipple.

451
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,820
Good to see you again. You!

452
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,740
Yes, well,

453
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,140
I came over to tell you that I've decided to help

454
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,080
you after all. But you...

455
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Listen, Stipple. I was gonna get

456
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,220
fired anyway, so I thought maybe you and I

457
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,120
could knock a few back and maybe do a little

458
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,160
star hopping. How did you get

459
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,180
in? What were you doing with my moss?

460
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Stipple, let me tell you.

461
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,260
It's all part of an intergalactic conspiracy

462
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,120
to deprive you of busting that

463
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,700
nut that you've been building up.

464
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,320
What?

465
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,760
Relax, Stipple. I'm just yanking your chain.

466
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,460
Besides, this skit is

467
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,320
done. It's all just been part of

468
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,560
Robot Radio Theater.

469
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,780
But I'm not a robot.

470
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,940
Sure you're not.

471
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,620
This installment of Robot Radio

472
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,340
Theater has been brought to you by

473
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,100
new dehydrated diet

474
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,320
stimu-swill. Be sure to drink

475
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,280
only diet stimu-swill

476
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,440
or an intergalactic conspiracy will

477
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
deprive you of orgasm.

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,320
We'll make sure of it.

479
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,160
Goodnight!

We'll be right back.

502
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,920
Yeah, hi.

503
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,500
That's not my real name,

504
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,520
but that's okay.

505
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm having a little problem

506
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:36,660
with my computer.

507
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:36,680


508
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,560
with my, uh, my, uh, my, my

509
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,460
pleasure bot. There, I said it, my pleasure bot.

510
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,680
It's increasingly unresponsive.

511
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,160
I lubricate the pleasure bot.

512
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,520
I roll the pleasure bot around

513
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,760
as you're supposed to do to keep everything

514
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,660
loose. It's almost like

515
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,340
it's lost interest in me, but that's impossible

516
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,860
because it's programmed to love me.

517
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,860
What's going on?

518
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,480
Well, well, of course,

519
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,500
I mean, there's, there's, there's the three holes

520
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,700
and I got my thing and I put my thing in one of the holes.

521
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
I don't need no manual. I've been doing

522
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
this since I was a little kid.

523
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,300
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, I tasted

524
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,240
my position a few times.

525
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,320
Yeah, so I just

526
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,920
throw it out and buy a new one. What's your point?

527
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,340
Yeah, I got an attachment.

528
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,200
I got a damn attachment stuck in my

529
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,440
yang, if you know what I mean.

530
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,380
I got an attachment stuck in my

531
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,300
yang, if you know what I mean.

532
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,160
I got an attachment settled in My

533
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,320
Yang.

534
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,300
I, I, I drip the

535
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,720
beer in it and go out and

536
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,960
drink my precise

537
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:48,980
libidine.

538
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,400
Oh, my gosh!

539
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,400


540
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,400


541
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,400


542
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,400


543
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,480
after...

544
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:05,480


545
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:05,480


546
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:05,480


547
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't think there's much more in there yet.

548
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,720
Hey, Ben.

549
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,520
I'm sorry.

550
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,280
One is moral, one is not.

552
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,660
It's Super Ego and it bought.

553
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,240
Ah, now for some fine adult entertainment.

554
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,640
Remember, no touching.

555
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,420
The fat noise. I gots to have it.

556
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,100
It bought.

557
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,380
It bought. I can't take you anywhere.

558
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,620
You're embarrassing me in front of the ladies.

559
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,420
Guff you, pansy. Give me a dollar.

560
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,940
Well, all I've got are these sack of joeyas.

561
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,960
Look at the ladies. I gots to have it.

562
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,840
It bought. No.

563
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,760
Ladies, I have attachments.

564
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,540
I have special attachments.

565
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,900
Please, you have to respect these people.

566
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,040
They're just working a job like anyone else.

567
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,060
Guff you. Give me a ten spot.

568
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,700
I wish I had a lap.

569
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,700
Oh, I need to have a lap dance.

570
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,660
It bought.

571
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,840
Retract that tentacle.

572
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,880
Bouncer, you better step off.

573
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,660
Excuse my friend, sir. He's a little bit of a robot.

574
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,240
I'll drink all the liquor and have all the booty in this sh-hole.

575
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,120
It bought.

576
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,180
Moderate. You're embarrassing me.

577
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,300
People are looking at us. The Japanese businessmen.

578
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,640
Moderation is for pussies.

579
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
Seriously, it bought. I can't take you anywhere.

580
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,460
Ah ha ha ha ha.

581
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,740
Nom nom nom.

582
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,480
It bought. That's murder.

583
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,280
Get out of here.

584
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,180
One is moral, one is not.

585
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,600
It's super ego, and it bought.

586
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,060
Thank you.

587
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,880
Thank you.

588
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,200
Okay, well, I got a question, and I'm hoping that you guys can help me, okay?

589
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:05,400
Yeah, well, let's say that my robot didn't want to sleep in my bunk with me

590
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,740
because it doesn't sleep and it doesn't like to lay still

591
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,080
unless it's really sleepy.

592
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,620
It's really charging, right? Let's say that, okay?

593
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,000
That's not really the issue, okay?

594
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,100
My robot, my XF-7R, wants...

595
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, I'd like to think so, but it doesn't stay in my bunk all night,

596
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,380
and I think it's having an affair with my dog.

597
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,020
Okay.

598
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,540
I've never said it was a pleasure bot.

599
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,600
It's actually a culinary bot.

600
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,420
It's supposed to, you know, provide food products for me,

601
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,660
but one day I asked for icing, and I said,

602
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,040
well, this icing tastes familiar.

603
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,720
This tillier doesn't taste any like the

604
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,300
post π of that machine,

605
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,420
which is when the product crumbles it down and becomes bitter.

606
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:32,600
Well, that's one of thathighest and underneath theitéy review for Осiprijoeanx3.

607
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:39,520
employee contemporaries, at ease, eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats,

608
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:47,160
a patient better driver, a safer car, baby smiling in backseat, sleeping well, no bad dreams,

609
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:55,000
no paranoia, careful to all animals, never watching spiders done a plug hole, keep in contact with

610
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,020
old friends, enjoy a drink now and then, we'll frequently check credit at Morrill, bank, bowling

611
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:09,940
wall, favors for favors, fond but not in love, charity standing orders, fitter, healthier,

612
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,860
and more productive, a pig, and a cage, on antibiotics.

613
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,480
One is Morrill, one is not, it's super ego and it bought, ah it bought, it's been such

614
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,980
a long time.

615
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,340
Long time since I couldn't take you anywhere.

616
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,180
Remember when we first used to go to the candy shack when we were young boys?

617
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,840
Shut your wet human mouth, you're making me hungry, I want sweets and I need them yesterday.

618
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,760
That's exactly what you used to say.

619
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,040
Searching everything.

620
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,480
Hey, can I help you?

621
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,220
Yes, I'd like a modicum of moderately priced chocolate.

622
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,840
Give me everything in the counter, open up the counter,

623
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,980
move out of the way.

624
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Move out of the way old fellow, I will have you from behind.

625
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,300
It bought, no, you're embarrassing me in front of the old man.

626
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,500
I don't even know who you are, don't touch me.

627
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,920
What the hell is he doing?

628
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,220
Ah, never mind my friend sir, he's a little excitable for the sugar, but don't worry,

629
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,760
he's a robot.

630
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:20,200
Put candy in my orifice now, put it in, num num, num num, it bought wants more candy.

631
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,780
It bought, no, that's his head.

632
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,560
Errr.

633
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,600
Errr.

634
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,200
Errr.

635
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,980
Errr.

636
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,780
Ah yes, those were the days.

637
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,400
One is moral, one is not, it's super ego and it bought.

638
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,600
Yeah, from the director of Daddy Did Me and the production team that brought you

639
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:44,020
Full Cervix Station and auto-erotic ass fixation, comes a bottle buster of a summer vid feature,

640
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,520
it's Hump Bot's Mexican Vacation, starring JJ Coolsy as Ghetto Geppetto,

641
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,580
the robot mechanic who keeps Hump Bot equipped with all of the latest erotic attachments,

642
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,220
designed to make you at least one load lighter.

643
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,120
That's Hump Bot's Mexican Vacation, on paper vid now.

644
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah, hello, this is Gene from Poughkeepsie, I got my ass stuck in a can opener.

645
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,220
Well, you know, I'm living on a budget here, and I'm trying to get a little pleasure in

648
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,060
future, but.

649
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,560
I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot,

650
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:24,560


651
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,640
I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot, I'm a sex bot,

652
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,540
I tried to turn it on a little and it just eats up more, so, you know, that's not right

653
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,800
and there's no reverse, so if you could just tell me.

654
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,820
If I hold the can opener up to the phone, can you talk some sense here?

655
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,380
Yeah, that's what I got, I got the, uh, typical human, uh, deal going on down there here.

656
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,560
Uh, let's see, this is the, uh, sex plus, uh, 1700 can opener.

657
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,440
Uh, let's see, this is the, uh, sex plus, uh, 1700 can opener.

658
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,140
Yeah, it do the thing, it does the thing, yeah.

659
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,140


660
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,540
I just can't see what the hell he's doing.

661
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,240
What are you saying to me?

662
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,800
One is moral, one is not.

663
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,180
It's Super Ego and it bought.

664
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,220
Well, it bought.

665
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,180
Here we are at yet another Woodstock.

666
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,420
I smell cannabis.

667
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,420
They are illegal and we wouldn't want to do anything wrong or get in trouble.

668
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,280
I'm on my way, but truly makes me crazy.

669
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,360
I do what he says, folks.

670
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,200
I'm caught in the mud.

671
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:58,940
Help.

672
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,060
I have got to get some of that sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

673
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,260
Well, maybe two out of three.

674
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,400
If it's too loud, then you are too old.

675
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,600
Well, it's not too loud.

676
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,820
I've got my earplugs in.

677
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,860
You are such a pansy panty waste.

678
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,360
If you want me to damage my hearing, that would make you happy.

679
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,460
Why don't you hold that girl down while I set fire to this tower?

680
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,940
No, we need that tower for observation and filming.

681
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,080
I like to watch.

682
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,260
I like to watch.

683
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,300
Give it to it.

684
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:24,800
It bought.

685
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,300
It bought.

686
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:25,620
No!

687
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,180
Let me at it.

688
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,640
I gots to have it.

689
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,900
All right, you just retract those tentacles, mister.

690
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,780
We got to get out of here.

691
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,880
You've gotten us in trouble again.

692
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,220
Woodstock, woo.

693
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,220
Party till you puke.

694
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,640
That piece of paper I put in my mouth is making me feel awful funny.

695
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,260
I love that you have a .

696
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,800
Whoa.

697
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,060
One is moral, one is not.

698
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,480
It's super ego and it bought.

699
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,340
.

700
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,880
Domo arigato, Mister Robot.

701
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,180
Domo arigato, Mister Robot.

702
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,500
Buster, what are you doing?

703
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,760
Domo arigato, Mister Robot.

704
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,400
You must be more serious now.

705
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,480
You're wondering who I am.

706
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,480
Secret, secret.

707
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,760
I've got a secret.

708
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,480
Machine or magic arm.

709
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,420
Secret, secret.

710
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,320
I've got a secret.

711
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,460
I am the Modern Man!

712
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,080
Acting strangely, don't be surprised

713
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,060
I'm just a man who's needed someone

714
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,540
And somewhere to hide to keep me alive

715
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,840
Just keep me alive

716
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,780
Somewhere to hide

717
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,260
To keep me alive

718
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,920
I'm not a robot without emotions

719
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,640
I'm not what you see

720
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,960
I've come to help you

721
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,540
With your problems

722
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,400
So we can be free

723
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm not a hero

724
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,220
I'm not a savior

725
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,860
Forget what you know

726
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,420
I'm just a man who's

727
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,640
Circumstances went beyond his control

728
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,320
Beyond my control

729
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,500
We all need control

730
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,760
I need control

731
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,680
So we can't ignore

732
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:55,900
Control me!

733
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,120
I am the Modern Man

734
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,420
Secret, secret, I got a secret

735
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,160
Who hides behind a mask

736
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,480
That's how we work, that's how we work

737
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,060
So no one else can see

738
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,500
That's how we work, that's how we work

739
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,900
My true identity

740
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,120
Tomo arigato, Mr. Robot

741
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,320
Tomodomo, Tomodomo

742
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,700
Tomo arigato, Mr. Robot

743
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,980
Tomodomo, Tomodomo

744
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,400
Tomo arigato, Mr. Robot

745
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,680
Tomo arigato, Mr. Robot

746
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,020
Tomo arigato, Mr. Robot

747
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,300
Tomo arigato, Mr. Robot

748
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,560
Thank you very much, Mr. Robot

749
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,200
For doing the job

750
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,320
No one wants to know

751
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,780
And thank you very much, Mr. Roboto, for helping me escape just when I needed to.

752
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,040
Thank you.

753
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,420
Thank you.

754
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,200
Thank you.

755
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,560
I want to thank you.

756
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,840
Please, thank you.

757
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,960
Oh, yeah.

758
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,640
Thank you.

759
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,280
Bye.

760
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,880
Bye.

Bye.

762
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,320
Bye.

763
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,780
Bye.

764
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,980
Bye.

765
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,180
Bye.

766
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,240
Bye.

767
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,620
Bye.

768
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,480
Bye.

769
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:50,060
We hope you've enjoyed another episode of Amplitude Modulation Theater.

770
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,200

771
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,660

772
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,760

Perry and Kingsley performed Minuet of the Robots.

783
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,200

803
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,240
I'm truly proud once again to present my Rocketman.

804
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,180
William Shatner.

807
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,660
She packed my bags.

808
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,100
Last night, pre-flight.

809
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,860
Zero hour.

810
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,040
9 a.m.

811
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,020
And I'm gonna be...

812
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,160
high.

813
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,860
As a kite, by the way.

814
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,980
Oh, I miss the earth so much.

815
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,440
I miss my wife.

816
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,980
It's lonely.

817
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,660
Out in space.

818
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,220
I'm such a...

819
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:20,980
time.

820
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,240
And I think it's gonna be...

821
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,000
a long, long time.

822
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,520
The touchdown...

823
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,420
brings me back again to find I'm...

824
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,960
not the man they think I am.

825
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,900
Back home.

826
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,660
Oh, no.

827
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,460
No, no.

828
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,320
I'm a Rocketman.

829
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,960
I'm a Rocketman.

830
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,220
Rocketman.

831
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,220
Burning out his fuse out here.

832
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:54,980
Alone.

833
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,640
I think it's gonna be a long, long time.

834
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,960
To touchdown.

835
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,400
Bring me around again.

836
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,080
Fine.

837
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,120
I'm not the man they think I am.

838
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,480
Oh, no.

839
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,260
No, no.

840
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,660
I'm a Rocketman.

841
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,220
Rocketman.

842
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,160
Burning out his fuse out here.

843
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,660
Alone.

844
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:19,220


845
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,000
No, no, no.

846
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:38,580
Oh, my God.

847
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,040
I'm so stupid.

848
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,800
I'll never baby boomerang again until I'm our mother.

849
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:42,800


850
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:42,800


851
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:42,800


852
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:42,800


853
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm really just looking around, and I'm really, really, really worried that if I screw up,

854
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,000


855
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,500
Tui-oh...

856
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:46,780
Just come right back, pessoal.

857
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,300
We're laughing.

858
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,300


859
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,300


860
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,200
The last bottle.

861
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,200


862
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,200


863
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,120
And all this science.

864
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,040
I don't understand.

865
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,200
It's just a job.

866
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,780
Five days a week.

867
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,260
Rocket man.

868
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,960
A rocket man.

869
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,520
I think it's going to be a long, long time.

870
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,660
The touchdown brings me around again to find.

871
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,940
I'm not the man they think I am at home.

872
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,020
Oh, no.

873
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,180
No, no.

874
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,660
I'm a rocket man.

875
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,420
Rocket man.

876
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,360
Burning out his fuse out here.

877
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,080
Hello.

878
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,180
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

879
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,660
The touchdown brings me around again to find.

880
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,180
I'm not the man.

881
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,240
They think I am.

882
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,360
Oh, no.

883
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,220
No.

884
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,160
I'm a rocket man.

885
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,280
Rocket man.

886
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,640
Burning out his fuse out here alone.

887
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,100
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

888
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,760
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

889
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,180
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

890
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:27,000
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

891
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,600
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

892
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,500
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

893
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,060
The slammeal.

894
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,460
Su

895
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,380
Witt process.

896
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,220
H tc.

897
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:42,700
H c h?

898
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,800
C h.

899
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,860
Nothing.

900
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,900
A scale.

901
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:47,900


902
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,100
Please don't tell me how to do that.

903
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,900
It's sickening.

904
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,660
Oh, oh, oh.

905
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:55,060
Oh, oh, oh.
