1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
And now, the subgenius hour of slack.

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,220
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

3
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,140
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,740
K-N-O-N

5
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,060
and only in the city of

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,480
Dallas, Texas.

7
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

8
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,700
Hoping your time is all time

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,480
and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

10
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,860
Here's your host,

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,860
Reverend Ivan Stang and

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,200
Pastor Buck Naked.

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,000
Ah, yes, dear friends.

14
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,740
And thank you, Reverend Lepo Abernathy

15
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,220
for that amazing introduction tape.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,360
Folks, I'm beat from doing those last two theme shows

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,200
and sticking to the themes like a Nazi.

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,420
So, we got no theme.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm all out of theme.

20
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,620
I'm themed out.

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,300
By the way, I hope the beautiful young lady

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,500
I met at the convenience store on the way over here

23
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,260
is tuning in.

24
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,120
It's funny, you know, on the way over to this show,

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,700
oftentimes I get asked on dates

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,900
by these young ladies

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,420
that walk back and forth down the street.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,760
Anyway.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,400
So, it's going to be mostly music tonight, dear friends.

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,300
The music of...

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,480
Well, it's not all going to be subgenius about...

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,740
You going to get any Led Zeppelin?

33
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,980
Yeah, we'll be...

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,360
Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,020
As a matter of fact, this will be a back to the 60s show, friends.

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,900
Actually, it's all psychedelic music of every variety.

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,220
I got to listen for this little piece of music to end here.

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,860
But it's going to be a bunch of favorites.

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,220
I may not be here next time,

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,940
but Reverend Cleve Duncan,

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
of Boston,

42
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,720
will be in town next weekend, Buck, by the way.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,140
The Del Fuegos will be playing at the Ritz.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,460
I'll be at home.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,840
Their organist, Cleve, a great subgenius preacher,

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,120
will be here upon this show.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,080
But for now,

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,480
it's going to be mostly music

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,740
from the Bulldada Time Control Laboratory archives.

50
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,780
Almost all of this music

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,200
is by members of the subgenius church.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,300
A lot of our listeners remember him.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,420
He was on the phone to us last week.

54
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,760
That's right.

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,720
He called last week in a state of...

56
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,640
Supreme hormonal agitation.

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,000
Right.

58
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,160
What was that line he had?

59
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,480
We can't remember.

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,200
About the back door or something like that?

61
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,540
Yeah.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,580
Had old Cleve.

63
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,300
Ooh, yeah.

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,980
Well, anyway, that record over there, Buck, is...

65
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,760
By the way, if you are the one who is listening to us,

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,900
I'd like to say hi to you,

67
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,800
because just about all of our regular listenership

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,860
is down at the Circle A Ranch tonight.

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,460
Oh, praise...

70
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,740
Well, that's all the listeners we have, I think.

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,180
It's just those 12...

72
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,440
12 people.

73
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,420
But why don't you put on...

74
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,620
Oh, there's a lot more of them that you already have.

75
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,800
Buck, that record over there,

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,520
we're going to go quick through songs

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,540
and just stop and tell you what they were in between.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
But this one, not the first one, Buck,

79
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,260
the last one.

80
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,460
Yeah, this is a record that Cleve did.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
This is Reverend Cleve Duncan

82
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
sent their first...

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,260
Oh, this beautiful friend.

84
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,400
This is the Swinging Areodites

85
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,020
doing...

86
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,900
their renditions of Yesterday.

87
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,920
This show is about styles,

88
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,840
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

89
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,440
This one's...

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,900
Oh, callers.

91
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
We'll kill callers tonight.

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,920
It's 823-7490, friends.

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
And 801.

94
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,240
And 823-8801.

95
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,900
Now, I'm sure Cleve wouldn't mind us talking over...

96
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,300
this part of the Swinging Areodites

97
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,900
beautiful rendition of the song.

98
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,880
But we're going to cut off here

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,180
when he gets into the, really,

100
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,700
the meat of this lovely rendition, folks.

101
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,020
Remember those days

102
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,620
before the radiation,

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,300
before fluoridation,

104
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,300
before Tylenol and Gerbers.

105
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,540
Ah, yes.

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Yesterday.

107
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Yesterday.

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,860
Oh, my God, I've seen so far.

109
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,560
Oh, wait.

110
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,620
Stop, you place a highway.

111
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,440
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,160
Suddenly,

113
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,380
when I got half the man I used to be,

114
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,500
there's a shadow waving over me.

115
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,100
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

116
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,500
Oh, my God.

117
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,100
Yesterday.

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,760
Love was such a music.

119
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,420
Game to play.

120
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,120
And now I need a place to hide away.

121
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,380
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,540
Let's speed it up, boys.

123
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh, wow.

124
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm not going to see too far away.

125
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm not going to see too far away.

126
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,420


127
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,720
Believe in yesterday.

128
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,620
Ah.

129
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:09,960
Simb Хuyh.

130
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:11,820
Bring

131
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,720
up made by

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,240
a full out.

133
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
The

134
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,500
Oh.

135
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,220
What else to do

136
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,020
try?

137
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,120
Why?

138
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,040
People here.

139
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
I should

140
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,760
Why don't you go back up in the mountain, man?

141
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,220
Find the Paul McCartney guy, bring me the big sleeve

142
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,580
Cause I believe

143
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,580
Oh, such a day I'd have to guide you

144
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,540
And I might have a good way, man

145
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,280
Cause I've been speaking the magic

146
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,140
Of the new-to-country man

147
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,580
Bring me the bongo, man

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,860
Hold the time!

149
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,980
One, two, three, two, two, three

150
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,120
Follow me

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,740
For me here

152
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,820
You must have beer

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,560
I took a spare bottle

154
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,120
I think I'll have another beer

155
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
We must hide the fruit

156
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,300
For just for me we believed in more beer

157
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm getting fiver

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,840
Sour-broth in mine

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,780
Cause I smell like sour-broth

160
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,960
Enough of this ethnic crap

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,160
How about a little avant-garde free-form jazz

162
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,600
One doesn't go back to 79

163
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:36,720
One doesn't go back to 79

164
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,820
One can't even be honest

165
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,060
Uh, with to help Apple

166
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,600
And some friend I hang out with

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,760
There's not even one fucking music

168
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:00,760


169
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,220
I'm Mr. Cripple

170
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,220


171
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,220


172
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,240
I think Venice is great

173
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,300
Better now than never

174
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,700
Better, you know

175
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,160
Little Brother Nick

176
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,400
Thanks guys

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,540
There's not much to tell

178
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,540


179
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,460
contact the local夜 hiring

180
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,720
보시면

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:06,720


182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:06,720


183
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,520
Jake, oh may the saints be praised.

184
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,880
May you have a six pack and a potato because you might have a seven course meal.

185
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,540
Oh, sure, and we got a real friend in your friend.

186
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,200
Oh, it must be true, lad.

187
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,820
The saints be praised.

188
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Oh, may the saints be...

189
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,080
It's bluegrass time.

190
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,160
One, two, three, four.

191
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,660
Yesterday.

192
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,980
I'm gonna turn those things up on my own, buddy.

193
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,960
I need to play the hidey-hidey.

194
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,940
I believe in you, Mr. Lee.

195
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Where's the happy little thing on the course?

196
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,480
I need to see you.

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm gonna get us this day.

198
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,660
One more time, Gary.

199
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,940
No!

200
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,380
No!

201
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,400
You're not the king of my life!

202
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,540
No!

203
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,420
You're not the king of my life!

204
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,520
The guy who lives is just a man!

205
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
No!

206
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:11,980
No!

207
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,160
No!

208
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,660
No!

209
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:13,920
No!

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
No!

211
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
No!

212
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
No!

213
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,580
No!

214
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:20,660
No!

215
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,840
No!

216
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:21,920
No!

217
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,740
No!

218
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:22,740


219
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,420
No!

220
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,540
No!

221
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,340
No!

222
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,860
No!

223
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,080
No!

224
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


226
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,680
No!

227
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,060
No!

228
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,560
No!

229
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,860
No!

230
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,640
No!

231
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,180


232
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,180
No!

233
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,020
No!

234
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


235
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


236
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


237
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


238
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


239
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


240
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


241
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,020


242
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,220
Dob!

243
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,140
Top!

244
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,100
But time Heat!

245
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,160
No, you won, Mr. Lee!

246
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:57,160
Your life is full of nellこちら!

247
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,400


248
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,400


249
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,780
Rich and I know that you understand Really do love the job that you do.

250
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,960
Bob steal, Bob bargain!

251
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:02,960


252
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:31,700
Bob's my crotch, Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain, Bob's an ugly yellow stain, Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch, Bob is taking off every stitch, Bob's my master, Bob's my slave, Bob will rob me, Bob will save, Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge, Bob's my little sister Mitch,

253
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:52,840
Bob will cost you, Bob is free, Bob's a watch, and Bob's the key, ensure that Bob Dobbs is the man, who used your leg as a frying pan, if your mind is a jar, you can pour down the sink, and the subgenius church is the missing link, damn it!

254
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,500
Pills to the left of me, pills to...

255
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:22,740
Right now, before we go anyplace else, I want you to go with me to a special place that I know.

256
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,480
It's a museum, but it isn't an ordinary museum.

257
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,020
It's a very abstract museum in which they show sound paintings.

258
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,960
If you can say that you show sound.

259
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,120
But, I don't see why you can't.

260
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,260
But here we are in this corridor.

261
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,820
Some of the most beautiful works of art are here.

262
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,760
Here's one right here.

263
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,800
This is by a very fine young artist.

264
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
Here, let me turn it on.

265
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,420
Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.

266
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,380
Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.

267
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,740
The artist is the swinging love corpses, friends.

268
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,200
Here's the big one.

269
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,740
What's more, the beautiful...

270
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,340
See?

271
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:33,900


272
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,820
Pretty, dear.

273
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,980
cushiony canister

274
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:44,140
Now, this is just cooked

275
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,320
but made of teach samples.

276
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,400
You didn't read that?

277
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,400


278
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,400


279
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,400


280
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,400


281
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,400


282
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,440
Thank you.

283
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,760
You recognize that voice, I know.

284
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,460
That's Dr. Philodrummon.

285
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,980
Snorting and hooting.

286
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,380
Yes, the man closest to Bob.

287
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,600
And this is what he does in his spare time.

288
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,600
Sick, isn't he?

289
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
That's the fabulous Swinging Love Corpses

290
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
with Ray Hay on guitar

291
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,880
and the stinks drumming on bass and keyboard.

292
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,560
And Lordy, I don't know who did this one coming up here.

294
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,260
Snorting and hooting.

295
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,000
Snorting and hooting.

296
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,100
Snorting and hooting.

297
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,860
Snorting and hooting.

298
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:08,940
Snorting and hooting.

299
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,240
Snorting and hooting.

300
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,620
Snorting and hooting.

301
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,660
Snorting and hooting.

302
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,040
Snorting and hooting.

303
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,140
Oh, friends, I hope you were getting that one in stereo.

304
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,720
That... I don't know who did that.

305
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,660
Bishop Huey in Houston gave me that tape,

306
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
and somebody told me it was Pink Floyd,

307
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,600
but I don't believe it.

308
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,380
Oh, yes, dear friends, and here's an old-timer.

309
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,040
This is just, like I said,

310
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,180
an evening of psychedelic music.

311
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,440
All of this music is about Bob,

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,640
including this one.

313
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,460
This is also one for multitrack headphones.

314
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,020
If you've got headphones with 18 speakers on it,

315
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
then use those.

316
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:17,100
I hope you also enjoyed the music for this album.

317
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,120
Keep listening to that for the next episode.

318
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,200
There we go.

319
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,580
Here we go again.

320
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,080
Oh, yeah.

321
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,340
Hey, look at this,

322
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,340


323
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,340


324
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,700
So...

325
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,660
Never again.

326

327
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,060

338
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,820
Yes, friends, old

339
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,040
time subgeniuses. This one

340
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
died a long time ago, but he knew

341
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,180
about Bob. Listen to this

342
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,920
one real close and giant

343
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,300
spokes will spin around your head

344
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,180
after a while. Invisible

345
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,380
ones, but you'll know they're there.

346
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,560
guitar solo

347
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,620

354

355
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,200


356
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,200


357
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,400
guitar solo

358
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,480

359
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,480


360
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,320
guitar solo

361
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,480
Thank you.

362
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,800
Friends, it's dark and scary and windy out there,

363
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,640
but you can stay nice and comfy here inside KNON.

364
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,160
Now listen, folks.

365
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,600
Ask not what you can do for the conspiracy.

366
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,780
Ask what the conspiracy can do for you.

367
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,820
The great M. Ilkman said that,

368
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,500
and it reminds me, friends of the pledge drive.

369
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,980
As you know, two vast,

370
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,740
vast Christian media conglomerates

371
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,600
are trying to take over the station's airwaves.

372
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,180
There used to be another,

373
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,700
but they dropped out when they realized

374
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,960
that the normal pink press

375
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,660
was going to tear them apart over it now.

376
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,060
The other two are still out

377
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,380
to have variety and minority subgenius programming

378
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,660
removed from the air

379
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,720
so there can be another all-Christian station.

380
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,960
Now, KNON will win the case.

381
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,300
That's pretty much given.

382
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,380
In fact, I've been hearing that...

383
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:17,540
You know what happened?

384
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,240
What?

385
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,480
You know what happened?

386
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
The war's over.

387
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,740
The war's over?

388
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,560
Good Lord.

389
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,300
I had this whole rant here prepared

390
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,300
to save KNON and the damn war's over.

391
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,720
I was going to talk about how, you know,

392
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,640
what a bad name they were giving Jesus and everything.

393
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,620
Here's the update as I understand it.

394
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,900
Remember, this is only a little better

395
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
than what Stan gave you,

396
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,060
but from what I heard,

397
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,520
you're going to have to start turning

398
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,160
to a different station,

399
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,900
a place in the air to get KNON

400
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,480
because they're swapping stations with the Criswells.

401
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,440
They're going to trade...

402
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,100
They're swapping licenses.

403
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,080
Okay, it's like, you know...

404
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,400
Oh, wait, we've got to be quiet

405
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,180
and listen to this part.

406
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,840
Here we go.

407
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,040
Here we go.

408
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:22,360
Here we go.

409
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:22,980
Here we go.

410
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,560
This is Doctors for Bob, folks.

411
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
Stop the train.

412
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,380
Sub proceed.

Hello!

480
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:54,200
Friends, this is Doctors for Dinosaurs,

481
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,780
that sick predi...

482
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,640
What is it?

483
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,180
Descendant of Doctors for Bob.

484
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,040
Okay, okay.

485
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,060
Very good old man, Mr. Williams.

486
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Williams,

487
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,020
but we're going to have to operate.

488
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,760
Oh dear, you can't afford the anesthetic?

489
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,080
Oh, Mr. Williams.

490
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
Oh, Mr. Williams.

491
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,900
Lie down here, Mr. Williams.

492
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,980
Oh my God, you got your right in it.

493
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,540
God, you're ugly.

494
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,520
With your claws off.

495
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,460
Oh, Mr. Williams.

496
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,800
You're so cool, Mr. Williams.

497
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,740
Your eyes are closed.

498
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,660
Right, Mr. Williams.

499
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,180
Ah!

500
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,320
Ah!

501
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,480
Ah!

502
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,660
Ah!

503
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,860
Ah!

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,120
Ah!

508
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,900
Thank you.

00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,020
Thank you.

512
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,100
And six.

513
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,660
I'll have to get them there to clean that up later.

514
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,400
Oh.

515
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:39,900
Oh.

516
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,700
Oh.

517
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,360
What can I do for you, sonny?

518
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,860
Oh.

519
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Uh, this here and, uh...

520
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,220
Oh.

521
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,460
Oh.

522
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,060
That's all right.

523
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,440
It's catching.

524
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,480
Oh, no.

525
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,440
And a pack of forums.

526
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,500
Forums.

527
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,440
Oh, yes.

528
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,300
Here they are.

529
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,440
These have little gladiator tips.

530
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
They're cute and strong.

531
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,000
65.

532
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,900
And that's Holiday Decanter.

533
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,540
Wild Crow is on special.

534
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,940
$214.89.

535
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,160
That's a bargain for a collectible like that.

536
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,580
Look at those eyes.

537
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,300
They'll follow you wherever you go.

538
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,340
That's why I bought it.

539
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,280
Come again now.

540
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,080
Thank you.

541
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,300
99.

542
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,120
Uh-huh.

543
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,060
Oh.

544
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:17,820
Oh.

545
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,640
My anus butt-wumper.

546
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,540
Get out of the way, mister.

547
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,040
Have you boys caught that nasty Indian yet?

548
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,920
That's what I come for.

549
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,740
Now, listen, Ma.

550
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,500
You better turn the eyes off in the lizard.

551
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,080
Yeah, before he shoots him out.

552
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,320
Yeah, we lost him up at the trailhead

553
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,380
over to Mount Boron.

554
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,960
Oh, my.

555
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,180
Yeah.

556
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,980
Now, you just stay.

557
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,400
Stay inside.

558
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,100
Keep safe.

559
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,900
Oh, he's broke my TV.

560
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,720
We hit the light, Sonny,

561
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
and get behind the counter.

562
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,860
Come on down here.

563
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,300
Oh, for God's sakes.

564
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,100
This is worse than an Indian in a goat fight.

565
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,520
Shh.

566
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,480
Keep your voice down.

567
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,980
It's not just happening here.

568
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,840
It's happening over in Hollywood, too.

569
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,760
I heard it on the radio.

570
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,320
This is a strange place.

571
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,000
Just as strange as Hollywood any day.

572
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,820
I expect you've heard the voices.

573
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,780
No.

574
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,900
What voices?

575
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,500
Oh, most people hear them as soon as they come into town.

576
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,100
You gotta keep your TV on real loud all the time

577
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,200
to drown them out.

578
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,200
It's a...

579
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:14,840
Oh!

580
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,060
Oh, sugar, sugar.

581
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,180
Is that one?

582
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,880
Oh, they must come up from the next world.

583
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,580
That's all we know.

584
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,440
Sugar, sugar, sugar.

585
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,540
Oh!

586
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,880
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.

587
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,540
How does it know my name?

588
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,000
What?

589
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,340
Oh, they call everybody sugar.

590
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,980
Be careful.

591
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,080
Don't let him read your mind.

592
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,760
Sing.

593
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,840
Sing something.

594
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,440
Sing something.

595
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,020
Sing.

596
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,480
You can't get in here.

597
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:39,480


598
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,760
Be my sister.

599
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,760
Be my sister.

600
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,660
Help me.

601
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,640
Save me.

602
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,680
Help me.

603
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,040
Save me.

604
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
You've got to believe me.

605
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,720
Help me.

606
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,660
Save me.

607
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,380
Save me.

608
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,180
Save me.

609
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,180


610
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,180


611
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,180


612
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,180


613
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,180


614
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,180


615
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:02,860
.

616
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,840
Help me, please.

617
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:05,840


618
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,800
They tortured me.

619
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,780
Please.

620
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,360
Help me, please.

621
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,980
They make me sad.

622
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,560
Help me, please.

623
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,840
They make me sad.

624
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,260
I don't like what I'm saying.

625
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,840
Help me.

626
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,480
I don't understand what I'm saying.

627
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,500
Help me.

628
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,740
I don't like what I'm saying.

629
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,100
I don't want to be saying this.

630
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,300
Help me.

631
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,960
I don't want to be saying this.

632
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,320
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack

633
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,180
To see how they did hang

634
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,160
When I got there,

635
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,460
her cupboard was full of books

636
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:01,460

Where the hell else am I going to cop?

645
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,040
I don't know what I am going to do.

646
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,940
I just know that this here trip ain't through.

647
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,020
Oh, fop without slack is like slack without frop.

648
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,840
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

649
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,800
Oh, fop without slack is like slack without frop.

650
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,560
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

651
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,620
Yeah, fop without slack is like slack without frop.

652
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,760
Don't cop from that guy there.

653
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,320
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

654
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,420
Oh, stay away from that.

655
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,240
Fop without slack is like slack without frop.

656
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,640
Uh-huh.

657
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,100
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

658
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,660
No way.

659
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,180
Oh, yes, friends.

660
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,740
Let's see.

661
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,480
What did we play?

662
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,960
That very last thing was by the great Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

663
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,000
He sends something every couple of weeks, one of those eight-track sing-along-with-yourself tapes,

664
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,280
and he's good at it.

665
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,200
Let's see.

666
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:02,860
Before that, we had the subgenius parrot and parakeet training tape by, well.

667
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,540
And then there was the Firesign Theater before that.

668
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,920
And before that, a synthesizer junk by yours truly.

669
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,540
That's right.

670
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,420
I dared play.

671
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,620
And before that, butt-naked girls singing,

672
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,760
You're a very ill man, Mr. Williams,

673
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,480
with the most blood-soaked of all Dallas.

674
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,600
Bands, Doctors for Dinosaurs.

675
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,740
Oh, yes.

676
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,160
And this coming up is, who is this guy?

677
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:31,760
It doesn't matter.

678
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,160
It says, it's got a bad number on it.

679
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,020
I can't say the number over there.

680
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,620
It's one of those bad numbers they told us not to say.

681
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,740
The earth turned gray.

682
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,540
The sea turned black.

683
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,420
Huh?

684
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,100
The rivers turned red.

685
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,760
The sun turned cold.

686
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,400
The beast turned pale.

687
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,200
The stars turned fast.

688
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,200
The air turned to poison.

689
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:27,840
The sun turned dark.

690
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,660
But let's leave things of this world behind

691
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,260
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack

692
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,920
from the Church of the Subgenius.

693
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,040
Ah, yes, dear friends.

694
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,140
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with the facts.

695
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,200
That's right, the facts.

696
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,160
But why are you so hung up on facts, my friend?

697
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,140
The Church of the Subgenius, unlike the conspiracy that you serve now,

698
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,540
does not confuse you with so-called facts.

699
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,700
There are no facts to the enlightened man.

700
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,520
To one trained in the Church by Bob Dobbs,

701
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,200
ultimate truth can be found in a potato,

702
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,760
in a comic book,

703
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,820
or at the bottom of a bottle of liquid slack.

704
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,560
Because, friends, slack is what comes first.

705
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,280
Yes, slack must come even before truth.

706
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,460
So why are you letting the experts pull the wool over your eyes?

707
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,640
Forget the facts, friends, and do like Bob.

708
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,520
Pull the wool over your eyes.

709
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,520


710
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,520


711
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,520


712
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,520


713
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,520


714
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,580
And relax in the safety of your own delusions.

715
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,660
This is your only hope, my friend,

716
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,420
if you wish to unravel the punchline to the joke of life.

717
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,220
Let there be slack.

718
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,800
God, really, folks, let there be slack.

719
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,460
I just...

720
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,140
The wind just blew so hard it knocked the, uh, needle off.

721
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,880
Whoa!

722
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,200
That's close enough.

723
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,080
Get up, puppet boy.

724
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,020
You've got a job to do.

725
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,320
Even so, you're free to go.

726
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,140
Wear your mask, don't try to do.

727
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,720
Listen, puppet boy.

728
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,500
Before you disobey.

729
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,960
Consider that the strings attached could make a bitch a gingerly.

730
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,020
Puppet boy.

731
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,360
Is leaving the couch.

732
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,260
Little problems, little minds, little points of view.

733
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,580
Puppet boy.

734
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,140
It's the way things add up.

735
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,800
Getting bigger, pull the trigger, little things like you.

736
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,440
Stand up, puppet boy.

737
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,320
Time to start the show.

738
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,820
You'd better do some brand new moves.

739
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,520
They feel old.

740
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,660
They want to watch you go.

741
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,060
Puppet boy.

742
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,900
Get up.

743
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,300
Get up, puppet boy.

744
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,260
You've got a job to do.

745
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,560
Even so, you're free to go.

746
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,400
Wear your mask, don't try to do.

747
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,920
Listen, puppet boy.

748
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,740
Before you disobey.

749
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,540
Consider that the strings attached could make a bitch a gingerly.

750
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,180
Puppet boy.

751
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,560
Is leaving the couch.

752
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,400
Little problems, little minds, little points of view.

753
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,720
Puppet boy.

754
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,340
It's the way things add up.

755
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,520
Getting bigger, pull the trigger, little things like you.

756
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:53,880
ett

757
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,240
You

758
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,800
Stand up open boy

759
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,620
Time to start the show

760
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,040
You'd better do some brand new moves

761
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,880
They've made a lot to watch you go

762
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:28,980
No

763
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,620
No

764
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,900
What's that puppet boy?

765
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,820
Don't tell me what to do

766
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,760
What's that puppet boy?

767
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,740
I'm not a creep like you

768
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,680
What's that puppet boy?

769
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,620
I'll move when I want to

770
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,880
I can't hear you puppet boy

771
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,380
Now dance, dance, dance

772
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,820
Stay out of bed, I'm getting wet

773
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,720
I'm a boy, not a toy, I'm not through yet

774
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,560
Stay out of bed unless you want to get wet

775
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,020
Now wake up puppet boy

776
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,520
Listen puppet boy

777
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,860
You're not a robot boy

778
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,080
You're a robot slave

779
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,620
Consider that

780
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,300
Strings attached could ever make you miss me

781
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,500
Oh

782
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,600
Puppet boy

783
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,120
It's the little things that count

784
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,420
Little problems

785
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,540
Little minds

786
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,980
Little points of view

787
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,400
Puppet boy

788
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,760
It's the little things that are

789
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,380
Bigger, that will trigger

790
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,860
Little things like you

791
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,180
Puppet boy

792
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,760
It's the little things in life

793
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,800
Puppet boy

794
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,360
It's the little things I did

795
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,740
Puppet boy

796
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,880
I don't know if I'll ever be a human

797
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,860
Puppet boy

798
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:11,860


799
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,140
Puppet boy

800
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,140


801
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,060
Puppet boy

802
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,740
Puppet boy

803
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,820
Puppet boy

804
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,720
Who do you want to be today?

805
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,900
Who do you want to be?

806
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,740
Who do you want to be today?

807
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,860
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

808
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,540
Oh boy, it's so terrible

809
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,880
It's like a dreadful scene

810
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,660
Nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV

811
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,020
I'd rather be a cowboy than just a airplane up the walls

812
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,940
I've been before so many times I can't remember them all

813
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,820
And I say, who do you want to be today?

814
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,900
Who do you want to be?

815
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,860
Who do you want to be today?

816
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,120
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

817
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,480
Just like somebody!

818
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,300
On TV!

819
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,460
I think I'll be a heavy boy

820
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,400
I think I'll be a hump

821
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,180
I think I'll be a tough guy

822
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,380
And I think I'll be a pump

823
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,860
I might just be a bad boy

824
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,580
But I should start all dressed in bloody rags

825
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,560
Overheels across the other side

826
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,420
And walk around in drag!

827
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,320
Who do you want to be today?

828
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,400
Who do you want to be?

829
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,340
Who do you want to be today?

830
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,500
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

831
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,920
Just like somebody!

832
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,720
On TV!

833
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,120
begin or die

834
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,120


835
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,120


836
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,680
Help others get S愂

837
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,240
Jump offiend ledges

838
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:40,840
Jump offiend Cause, jump and valuござkglo railway marked by B

839
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,560
Do you like to live just like a rock in the middle of the sea?

840
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,840
Do you want to suffer by yourself in a pool of less-for-misery?

841
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,580
Do you feel like a saint in artist's clothes with a rosary in your hand?

842
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,200
Do you want to be crazy like Van Gogh, like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

843
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,560
Would you rather push the buttons and be feared by all humanity?

844
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,480
Or perhaps you'd like to be a boss?

845
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,080
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

846
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,280
Who do you want to be today?

847
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,360
Who do you want to be?

848
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,260
Who do you want to be today?

849
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,400
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

850
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,500
Goodbye, Salim Ali.

851
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,140
Who do you want to be today?

852
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,120
Who do you want to be today?

853
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,960
Who do you want to be today?

854
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,980
Who do you want to be today?

855
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,880
Who do you want to be today?

856
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,940
Who do you want to be?

857
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,840
Who do you want to be today?

858
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,120
Who do you want to be?

859
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,240
leading

860
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:03,240


861
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,520
These are band ghosts and I came to negotiate til the end

862
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:06,620
The kinds of people you want to fight to protect your heart

863
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,660
Huh

864
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,180
They

865
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:09,180


866
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:09,180


867
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:09,180


868
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

869
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,340
Hi, hi, hi, girls.

870
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,300
Oh, I thought I was afraid you couldn't do it, Buck.

871
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,980
I'm glad you were able to work that out.

872
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,140
I hope it gets some results.

873
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,420
Oh, our heart.

874
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,280
This is Dr. Onan Kanabai.

875
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,460
Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

876
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,480
Think above.

877
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,800
When you're outside exercising, think above.

878
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,220
When you're using sex devices, think above.

879
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,700
When you're walking through the woods,

880
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,840
when you make out with the girls,

881
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,000
when you're beat up to the roots, think above.

882
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,220
Think above.

883
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,220
Big thad.

884
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,220
Big thad.

885
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,460
Big thad.

886
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,200
Dr. Onan.

887
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,000
La, la, la...

888
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,400
When you just run out of words, think about

889
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,960
When a ring for run your car

890
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,220
When you hear a given call

891
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,200
When you write checks for one dollar, think about

892
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,640
When you write to these subgenius, think about

893
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,000
We all pass 140306, think about

894
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,600
When you cash your mojo taxes

895
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,420
When you write to Dex Texas, when you

896
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,540
Think about

897
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,700
Think about

898
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:31,620
Ah, the whole world is going crazy.

899
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,940
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

900
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,920
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

901
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,180
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

902
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,100
Dare I ask it? Yes.

903
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,900
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

904
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,680
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the Earth each and every day?

905
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,780
The answer? Yes, definitely.

906
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,540
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty,

907
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,800
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

908
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,040
Are you on drugs?

909
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,360
Of course not, Mr. Baldwin. I'm trying to explain.

910
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,820
Yes, and very strangely.

911
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,380
Perhaps strange enough to understand my little secret.

912
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,520
Sir?

913
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,960
I mean, saying there was a power failure so your clock didn't go off,

914
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,540
and then claiming a meteorite held you up on Central just as an excuse to be late.

915
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,540
I mean, you must be wacko.

916
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,240
But, sir, there will be drugs.

917
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,200
Yes, pretty odd.

918
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,120
Odd. Odd enough to believe this.

919
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,040
Sharon, I am not a regular human being.

920
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,320
I am, in actuality, an alien from a distant solar system.

921
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,060
Sir, it's been a long day as it is, and it's only noon.

922
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,820
Yes, Sharon, you heard me right.

923
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,300
An alien from a distant solar system.

924
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,200
We came here for two reasons.

925
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,100
One was for our food, which you have here in abundance.

926
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,200
Kittens. We suck their guts out.

927
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,940
And second, to mate.

928
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,360
And you seem to be just weird enough to do it, Miss Sharon and Joy.

929
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,880
Yes, Glorp needs ladies.

930
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:37,920
Oh, no!

931
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,980
You do not believe my claim?

932
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,320
Then look at this!

933
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,940
And now you see me as I really am.

934
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,340
Sharon, let's have sex.

935
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,000
There was a second service at the beginning of the show.

936
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,160
It was your brains, dear.

937
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,680
Doubt by us.

938
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,380
Ah!

939
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:57,560
Ah!

940
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,460
Ah!

941
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:58,560
Ah!

942
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:58,660
Ah!

943
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,180
Ah!

944
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


945
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


946
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


947
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


948
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


949
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


950
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,180


951
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,120
Ah!

952
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,700
Ah!

953
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:01,940
Ah!

954
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,460
Ah!

955
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:02,600
Ah!

956
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:02,700
Ah!

957
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:02,700


958
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:02,700


959
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:02,700


960
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,540
Unfortunately, I won't tell you.

961
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,720
Unfortunately?

962
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,040
Unfortunately?

963
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
That show is right.

964
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,440
Your show, cancelled.

965
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,940
Bad words on your show.

966
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,720
No, no.

967
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,660
Forbidden language used on the air.

968
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,560
Yeah.

969
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,100
Ew.

970
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,260
The insipid, insipid noises from your little collar face holes.

971
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,180
Face crime. Face crime. You know what that means.

972
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,440
Naughty nigger.

973
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:29,480
No, no.

974
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,560
Yes, another caller's soul sucked out.

975
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,660
She paid for one breath of church air with that soul.

976
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,680
Now, was that worth it?

977
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,600
No.

978
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,920
No, is this abuse worth it, caller?

979
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,480
Bad luck, caller.

980
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,140
I got a question.

981
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,580
Don't hang up on me.

982
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,240
I just want to check it out for you.

983
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,580
Wait, wait, don't hang up on you?

984
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,740
Yeah, don't hang up on me.

985
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,200
And don't play everything all at once, right?

986
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,160
Don't play all the microphones and turntables and recorders real loud.

987
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,860
No, I just want to ask you something.

988
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,020
Do you want to think of something else?

989
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,780
Well, yeah, go ahead and ask.

990
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,020
It's getting cold out here, little caller.

991
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,480
Hurry up.

992
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,140
Come on, come on.

993
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:10,680
What?

994
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,020
What?

995
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,580
I can't hear you.

996
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,480
It's so cold in here.

997
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,300
You don't understand.

998
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,820
The caller's being manipulated.

999
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,000
Now there's nothing but caller.

1000
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,020
Then you drown it all out, you know?

1001
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,340
Right.

1002
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,600
It's just frustrating.

1003
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,060
I know.

1004
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,300
Okay.

1005
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,180
What is the point?

1006
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,680
There used to be a point to the show.

1007
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,720
Yeah, there was a point to the show, and the point was Bob Dobbs,

1008
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,540
so we just don't need that guy anymore.

1009
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,780
Oh, James, or Mobius.

1010
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,040
Okay, but what was the old point?

1011
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,140
Well, the old point was that it wasn't like Bob.

1012
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,120
You could turn to somebody and everybody called up and they had a good time.

1013
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,160
It was a caller party.

1014
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,100
Everybody comes in your...

1015
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,400
Yeah, funky caller party.

1016
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,360
You know, you'd have a lot less work to do.

1017
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,880
You'd sit back and you'd start work.

1018
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,820
You'd start the callers.

1019
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,180
You'd start the callers.

1020
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,480
You'd start the callers.

1021
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,420
And you know what the subgeniuses do to us if we do that?

1022
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,660
Oh, no, don't talk about that.

1023
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,940
Just the memory.

1024
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,100
It's cold and rainy out here.

1025
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,220
Have you ever been peed on like this?

1026
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,000
Caller, you're fading.

1027
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:14,880
What's wrong?

1028
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,400
Well, it sounds like everybody's fading.

1029
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,200
I can't believe those guys.

1030
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,220
That's that California show.

1031
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,080
See, now that's another station.

1032
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,060
That's trying to take over our airwaves.

1033
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:29,980
That's...

1034
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:31,640
These...

1035
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,080
These...

1036
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,040
There's that echo again.

1037
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,560
Those creatures.

1038
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,920
Well, you know, this is an unusual hour of slack ending.

1039
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:47,500
Usually as it gets down to about 1226 like it is now here on KNON 90.9.

1040
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:56,000
Why, the entire Monday morning crew and Norm Ward and all his friends are usually crowding behind me,

1041
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:56,780
clustered around.

1042
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:57,960
But...

1043
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,340
Friends, they seem to be having some sort of trouble with the phones.

1044
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,620
Maybe the poltergeist has set it up to where the hour of slack has to turn into three hours of slack.

1045
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,360
Or 24 hours of slack.

1046
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,620
Maybe days and days.

1047
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,080
Well, anyway, just in case Norm does come in here and kick me out at the appointed hour,

1048
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,700
which if I was him, I certainly would do.

1049
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,620
And if he doesn't, I've got a tape of him doing it anyway.

1050
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,460
I do have something that...

1051
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,880
I should have been playing at the end of every show since we started the show 21 shows ago.

1052
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,940
And this is the credits for the hour of slack.

1053
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,620
What we were just hearing before...

1054
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,040
Before the credits started, to give you a credit, was...

1055
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,520
The...

1056
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:41,960
The...

1057
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,880
More than an hour, less than a show show.

1058
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:46,760
But...

1059
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,360
As well as that, you find...

1060
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,880
You like my heart, yeah!

1061
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:01,520
The voices, faiths, music, and editing you've been listening to come from...

1062
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,360
Leepo Abernathy.

1063
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,560
The Buck, Naked, and the Jaybirds.

1064
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:13,480
Dr. Odan Canobite.

1065
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:17,000
Show's right up on the green lines, Dr. G. Gordon.

1066
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,900
Killer for Bob.

1067
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,380
Help me somebody, she ain't got...

1068
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,760
Dr. Spool.

1069
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,240
Or Bob.

1070
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:23,780
Go!

1071
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,640
Dr. Philo Drummond.

1072
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,460
Overman, first degree.

1073
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,280
Well, I'm ready to go!

1074
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,540
Reverend Cleve...

1075
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,600
Donut...

1076
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,440
Duncan.

1077
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,500
I ain't gonna...

1078
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,640
Dr. Snavely Eklund.

1079
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,000
And I'll see you on the radio, but you can't...

1080
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,900
Hey, what are we getting to?

1081
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,260
This is the DNA of...

1082
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,140
Gordon and Bob.

1083
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,780
Now that you have a paradigm perspective, let's move on to...

1084
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:52,860
Thanks.

1085
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:52,860


1086
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,400
The shift in paradigm...

1087
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,880
This is Dr. Ahmed Fishmark.

1088
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,020
This is Blast Madness.

1089
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,800
Bob is my blindfold world...

1090
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,680
This is Herr Dr. Chris Gross.

1091
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,560
This is Hell's Mommy Satellite Geekbirds.

1092
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,180
This is compatible with all religions.

1093
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,500
And this is Negative Lands.

1094
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:19,900
What?

1095
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,360
These are those fantastic swinging love corpses.

1096
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,300
These are doctors for dinosaurs.

1097
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,520
These are doctors for Wotan.

1098
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,200
This is Gary Gubrog, friends.

1099
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:47,120
This is St. Leonor Hyperboots.

1100
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:47,900
The Unmistakable.

1101
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:48,600
The Unmistakable.

1102
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,180
This is Archp Ouch.

1103
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,640
The Unmistakable.

1104
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:54,640


1105
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:54,640


1106
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,600
kü Ch forbidden docks.

1107
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,020
ascounded by.

1108
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,740
Kill.

1109
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,160
This is somebody.

1110
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,320
This is...

1111
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,920
DK Jones.

1112
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,320
This is Palmer Vreenies

1113
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,240
of The Lives Foundation.

1114
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,900
Hi, Palmer.

1115
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:23,580
And this is the Pope of all New York, David B. Martin III.

1116
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,220
This is Mark Mothersball.

1117
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,180
This is the band of the year.

1118
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:44,040
This is Buck Naked, the fighting preacher.

1119
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,900
This is Dr. Howard Roberts.

1120
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:57,840
This is Mark Byron Warner.

1121
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:05,480
You never hear his voice, but you hear lots and lots of his tapes and his fine editing.

1122
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,420
This is someone else.

1123
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,920
And this is Reverend.

1124
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,580
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1125
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,620
Ah, yes.

1126
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
Thank you.

1127
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,380
And praise Bob.

1128
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:28,000
Oh, and this is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas, the voice of the people and of other things.

1129
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,640
Praise Bob!

1130
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,260
Yay!

1131
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:40,800
Now you may have observed, if you walk into a wall, you get a certain sensation of reality.

1132
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,940
When you take a look.

1133
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:50,000
Through your memory book, you may perceive a certain rhythmic regularity.

1134
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:56,220
The crazy things your mind gets up to when you're awake.

1135
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:04,500
Throwing clouds of rain over Brighter's Day.

1136
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,320
And there was once a little man.

1137
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:17,500
He worked all day, slept all the night.

1138
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,300
He looked at the sun.

1139
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,140
It didn't seem bright.

1140
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,060
It didn't seem right.

1141
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:39,960
He wondered, did the world go rolling along on its own?

1142
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,840
Or did the sky go blue?

1143
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:41,920


1144
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,300
Or did the sky go blue?

1145
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:47,960
Or did some spirit move it with a black cat bone?

1146
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:59,040
And he set out to find the causes behind the events in the world and the seasons of the mind.

1147
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:05,120
So he asked his wife about it and his wife said yes.

1148
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,400
Come back and see me if it's time to know less.

1149
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,340
He knew too much of questions of the world at large.

1150
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,380
Everybody knows the politician's in charge.

1151
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,380
So he went to the king house just the next day.

1152
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,360
To see that politician with his hair dyed grey.

1153
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,180
Jump down, turn round, blow you up or kiss the ground.

1154
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,680
Trying to be the president of a land so gay.

1155
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,060
He had those false pretendies.

1156
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,500
Had to love his style.

1157
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,680
Bound to make some havoc with that violent smile.

1158
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,920
Hey Salvador, darling, make a walking, talking something.

1159
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,920
You paint some freaky pictures.

1160
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,440
Make the likeness of that man.

1161
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,380
Muchos dollars if you can.

1162
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,500
And so the little man,

1163
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,040
He was a little man.

1164
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:08,040


1165
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:12,880
Asked the politician who makes the plan.

1166
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,780
Who makes the plan.

1167
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,560
What happens to me.

1168
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,660
And who has the key.

1169
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,760
Now you are asking me who makes the scene.

1170
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,460
His highness king gold and madam silver his queen.

1171
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,500
They keep it all a rustling with the dollars and pounds.

1172
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,420
And everyone knows that money makes the world go around.

1173
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,580
And so the little man,

1174
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:53,000
Asked king gold and madam silver come tell me what you can.

1175
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,520
And king gold said,

1176
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,320
Lifting his golden voice from his golden bed.

1177
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,200
Now money is something, it's a basic flow.

1178
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,220
And me I am the archetype of jewels and dough.

1179
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,180
I do a lot of talking both slow and fast.

1180
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:24,120
But me make decisions, no, of course it's the past.

1181
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,100
Oh the past is something, we all have some.

1182
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,260
Universal history is a bundle of fun.

1183
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,200
Now I get sleepy, starting to nod.

1184
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,600
And if you want to check the picture.

1185
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,520
Want to check the picture.

1186
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:43,400
Want to check it, check it with God.

1187
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,000
And so the little man,

1188
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:55,100
Climbed up on a rickety ladder to the heavenly lands.

1189
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,040
And he shed a tear.

1190
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,920
He's all so queer.

1191
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,120
And it doesn't seem clear.

1192
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:06,620
Yeah.

1193
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,860
Now God was sitting easy in a heavenly chair.

1194
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,880
Breathing deep and lazy on the heavenly air.

1195
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,840
The little man got near him just to get right from wrong.

1196
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,860
Said God are you responsible for all that goes on.

1197
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,860
God looked up from having a heavenly thing.

1198
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,400
He gave that little questioner a heavenly wing saying.

1199
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,220
Men have colored me with the colors of their minds.

1200
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,520
So I find.

1201
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:47,600
They use me as an excuse for all kinds of goofs.

1202
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,500
And for crimes of all kinds.

1203
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:57,500
All your so hard facts painted thinly on the void.

1204
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,400
Why were you not more pleasantly implored.

1205
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,600
Anything you want to do I'm happy if you make it go right.

1206
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,500
And it's true if it makes you happy.

1207
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:18,080
Oh you know it makes the world more bright.

1208
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:26,080
And you shall have liberty.

1209
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,020
Liberty.

1210
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,060
It always was yours.

1211
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,860
Yours anyway.

1212
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,580
You're one of my kind.

1213
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,760
You're an infinite mind.

1214
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,480
You make each new day.

1215
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,600
There's nothing more.

1216
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,060
Oh.

1217
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:58,880
Oh.

1218
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,220
Oh.

1219
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,520
Transparency.

1220
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:00,520


1221
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:00,520


1222
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,300
I can say.

1223
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:09,940
I can.

1224
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:09,980
I can.

1225
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:10,220
You do.

1226
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:15,880
You can.

1227
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:15,880


1228
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:15,880


1229
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:15,880


1230
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,100

01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,840
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1298
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,620
We're just all out of slack.

1299
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,460
That's okay.

1300
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,720
It's time to read a PSA anyway.

1301
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,460
Where's that log?

1302
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,160
That's a good question.

1303
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,280
Yeah, where is that log?

1304
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:23,840
Where'd you put it, Phil?

1305
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,920
Well, in the meantime, friends,

1306
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,480
as background music here,

1307
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,720
we can't stop for more than a second.

1308
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,700
This is Tangerine Dream.

1309
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,220
We'll be right back.

1310
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:16,900
Heavy metal viene del symptom.

1311
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,960
The only one that stops that hope is for...

1312
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:19,960


1313
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,060
beans in lover.

1314
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,480
I can't stop you.

1315
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:28,480


1316
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,900
I've got a pink Count Burl.

1317
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:29,900


1318
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,120
But what about your

1319
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:30,660
Ode to � cooling the

1320
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:30,760
What a question.

1321
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,360
Just.

1322
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,720
bad.

1323
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,400
So let's just cut to the chase.

1324
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,780
Better take it easy here.

1325
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,800
Maybe we should work against the pharmacy

01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,400
I'm her dad.

1343
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,020
Susie.

1344
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,240
Yes, yes, yes.

1345
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,760
I've always loved her.

1346
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,360
Yes, I agree, man.

1347
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,760
It really makes it.

1348
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:55,140
Yeah, that's how we all see you, man.

1349
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,660
It really makes it.

1350
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,840
Susie, you just got to town,

1351
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:05,960
and we've been very interested in your development.

1352
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,580
Forget it!

1353
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,660
Hmm.

1354
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,360
It can't happen here.

1355
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,360
That's what they all say, friends.

1356
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:25,320
You remember the Mothers of Invention?

1357
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,740
I was just telling somebody here

1358
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:30,240
that was one of the three things,

1359
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,880
along with R. Crumb's comics

1360
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,180
and Jimi Hendrix's first album

1361
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,040
that turned me overnight

1362
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,560
from a nightmare

1363
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,360
Nixon Youth in 1967

1364
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,780
to a mad, crazy prophet of the airwaves.

1365
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,340
Yes, friends.

1366
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:47,220
What you're hearing are the

1367
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:50,460
Norm Ward will be in

1368
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,600
and the Hour of Slack,

1369
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,520
I mean the...

1370
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:55,100
Monday morning,

1371
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,360
Norm Ward and all his crew

1372
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,740
are here, are striving

1373
01:26:58,740 --> 01:26:59,960
to get the phones working,

1374
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,640
and they will, friends, they will.

1375
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:02,620
So hang on.

1376
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,880
I know you've all got something to say,

1377
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,920
and you'll be able to, yeah,

1378
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,600
beg for slack.

1379
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,460
Pray for Norm and his machines.

1380
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:13,420
But, uh,

1381
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,640
one more little change of pace here.

1382
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,560
This is, um,

1383
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,100
this is George Clinton.

1384
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:19,620
Huh!

1385
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,360
Huh!

1386
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:24,700
Huh!

1387
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,180
Huh!

1388
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,160
Huh!

1389
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:27,700
Huh!

1390
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,120
Huh!

1391
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,420


1392
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,420


1393
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,420


1394
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,420


1395
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,420


1396
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,440
With electronic bait, man is nuclear fission.

1397
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:15,660
And the fish on his line is bigger in his mind

1398
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:19,360
than the reality of the reel he has to reel it in.

1399
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,840
You shouldn't have bit, fish.

1400
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:39,680
The one that got away is the catch of the day.

1401
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,800
You shouldn't have bit, fish.

1402
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,760
You took the bait, it's too late to pray.

1403
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,540
Now over you, they say the grace.

1404
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,260
Lord bless this fish.

1405
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,600
Bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da.

1406
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,220
Bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da.

1407
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:12,600
Bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da.

1408
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:30,500
Bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da.

1409
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,840
From our coffee to the whale.

1410
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,300
Hands and tail.

1411
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,760
We ate the fish.

1412
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:58,540
Bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da.

1413
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:07,760
Bum, bum, bum, bum, ba-da.

1414
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,360
We take the tilting bait.

1415
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:17,020
And what about who is fishing?

1416
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,040
Don't look at me.

1417
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,840
And then we take the bait.

1418
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,240
We've got to carry the weight along.

1419
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,580
You've got to carry the weight along.

1420
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:33,220
Carry the weight along.

1421
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,580
Yo!

1422
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,540
Carrier the weight.

1423
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,060
With the line attached is mine.

1424
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,180
The hookin' is behind.

1425
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,140
The 반박을 Annul이라고 하는 건ide.

1426
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:00,400
carry you far, so will I.

1427
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:09,580
And as the fishermen nodded, are you sleeping, are you sleeping, are you stone?

1428
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,320
Or are you fishing for a song?

1429
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,460
All that smell fish ain't fish.

1430
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:24,640
Fish.

1431
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:29,960
Fish brain poop.

1432
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,840
A lot of things about caviar.

1433
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:39,220
Fish eggs on the brain.

1434
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,300
Hatchin' in the Saturday.

1435
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,440
Gonna lay you out.

1436
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,200
Saturday night fish fry.

1437
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:52,740
Fish fry.

1438
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,140
Fire ид Cream fish fry.

1439
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,560

1440
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,580

No way I can change it

1463
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,980
For somebody's life is now through

1464
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:28,960
Their soul has been called by the master

1465
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,360
They died in a crash on the way

1466
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:38,420
I heard the groans of the dying

1467
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:42,760
But I didn't hear nobody pray

1468
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:47,460
I didn't hear nobody pray

1469
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:52,220
Yeah, brother, I didn't hear nobody pray

1470
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:57,000
I heard the crash on the highway

1471
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,100
But I didn't hear nobody pray

1472
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,840
Yes, friends.

1473
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:11,820
This is not Reverend Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1474
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:13,920
That is.

1475
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,100
Nay, nay.

1476
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,200
No.

1477
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,880
Mr. Ed's back in here again.

1478
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,160
Anyway, this is KNOAN-FM, Dallas-Fort Worth.

1479
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:30,680
The voice of the people, the choice of the masses.

1480
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,420
And other things.

1481
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,860
Yeah, among other things.

1482
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,420
But my name is Norm Ward.

1483
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:41,340
John Horton is in Baltimore, Maryland tonight.

1484
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,580
He's not missing anything.

1485
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,700
The folks from Inertel.

1486
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:49,520
A real nice guy.

1487
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:50,920
He can't figure out what's wrong.

1488
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,520
He told me to throw a few switches, and I did.

1489
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,320
And it didn't happen.

1490
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,020
I don't think I need to worry about it.

1491
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,340
Robert, you want to talk about it?

1492
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,120
You want to get here and talk real quick?

1493
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:10,880
We can do this.

1494
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,240
We can at least inform you.

1495
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,460
Give him a minute.

1496
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:14,920
Okay.

1497
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:22,080
We can talk about something that was mentioned earlier during the hour of slack.

1498
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:33,600
And that is the fact that apparently an agreement has been reached in principle on the challenge to the license.

1499
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:36,520
And have you got the newspaper there?

1500
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:37,680
Yeah.

1501
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:37,980
Yeah.

1502
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,640
Anyway, this appeared in the Thursday edition of the Dallas Times.

1503
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:43,000
Harold.

1504
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:45,240
March 6th.

1505
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:57,500
And the terms of the agreement says K&N will give up the frequency.

1506
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:08,700
It says it would have to give up its hopes of expanding broadcast capacity from 10,000 to 100,000, which is allocated on this frequency.

1507
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,660
And what we're going to do is what KCBI wanted to do three years ago.

1508
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:13,720
Which was trade frequencies.

1509
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:21,700
So KCBI, K&N will take the frequency of 89.3 and remain at 10,000 watts.

1510
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:26,900
And KCBI will take over 90.9.

1511
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,020
And I'm sure they'll have the money.

1512
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:29,680
I don't know why.

1513
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:34,800
But I think they just might have the money to get the equipment to run it at 100,000 watts.

1514
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:37,140
You can go up to 100,000 watts from that.

1515
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,040
I know.

1516
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:38,420
What?

1517
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:39,340
Yeah.

1518
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:40,400
It has to be directional.

1519
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,240
Oh.

1520
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:41,600
Okay.

1521
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:41,960
Okay.

1522
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,620
And that's something very unusual.

1523
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,640
Joy is just telling me that we can go to 100,000, but it's directional.

1524
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,380
And FM directional is a very unusual animal.

1525
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,180
And would probably cost more money than the undirectional.

1526
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,160
Yeah.

1527
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:55,980
Okay.

1528
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,480
Anyway.

1529
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:58,600
I'm surprised he hadn't already done it.

1530
01:42:58,700 --> 01:42:59,240
So anyway.

1531
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,780
Plus they're going to pay off.

1532
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:05,100
They are going to, I guess, pay off.

1533
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,120
I don't know.

1534
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:06,860
Just.

1535
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:07,700
Look.

1536
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:08,500
Yeah.

1537
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,060
See, here's the other.

1538
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:11,260
Yeah, I know.

1539
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:12,640
But that's what's interesting.

1540
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:13,220
Even more interesting.

1541
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:17,380
The other people that had filed are also getting a settlement.

1542
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,300
So the folks at.

1543
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,220
They didn't disavow.

1544
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,020
Yeah.

1545
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:25,280
KCBI is paying off the other group as well as KON.

1546
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:28,660
So it's like.

1547
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,860
I don't know if I like that or not.

1548
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,400
Well, I mean, you know, with the commercial.

1549
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,780
And with the commercial frequencies.

1550
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:39,080
I mean, you know, if you can get 17 million for it, great.

1551
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:41,180
Which is what Cap City's got for a kiss.

1552
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,300
Or so.

1553
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:43,520
Whatever they got.

1554
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:44,440
16, 17 million.

1555
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:45,560
But.

1556
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,640
I just.

1557
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:53,120
For some reason, the idea of paying off people for non-commercial frequencies.

1558
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:53,460
I.

1559
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:54,800
Doesn't sit well with me.

1560
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:55,700
Following.

1561
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:57,920
The preceding was an editorial opinion.

1562
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:58,380
Okay.

1563
01:43:59,140 --> 01:43:59,580
But.

1564
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:03,660
Why don't we go ahead and just say that right now that any opinions expressed during the

1565
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,080
next hour are those of.

1566
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:09,440
Of Norm and myself as an individual and not necessarily those of the management.

1567
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:11,220
Of K and O N.

1568
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:12,540
Okay.

1569
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:13,600
That's Robert Jackson.

1570
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,980
Reverend Stang, are you still going to do something here or.

1571
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:16,540
Hey.

1572
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:17,420
Are you waiting on me?

1573
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,800
Up to you guys.

1574
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:19,380
I've got a.

1575
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,300
Well, I was.

1576
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,500
A Laurie Anderson tape.

1577
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,000
Ooh.

1578
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:23,940
Well, I was just going to say.

1579
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,480
I can read this weird newspaper to everybody.

1580
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:27,600
You got a newspaper?

1581
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:29,540
Well, it's the Forty and Times.

1582
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,320
The Journal of Strange Phenomena.

1583
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:32,580
It's reports on.

1584
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:33,900
Like believe it or don't.

1585
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:34,860
Yeah.

1586
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,100
And some of them are just news clippings that are funny.

1587
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,340
Like this guy here.

1588
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,640
A novelist, Arnold Bennett, died of typhoid fever.

1589
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:42,640


1590
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:42,640


1591
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:42,640


1592
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:42,640


1593
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,980
He died of typhoid in Paris after drinking a glass of water to prove the water was perfectly

1594
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:47,560
safe.

1595
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:51,480
It's got loads of news items like that.

1596
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,600
True facts.

1597
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:57,620
True facts that are ironic and sad and hilarious to those of us it didn't happen to.

1598
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:58,840
Okay.

1599
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:03,500
Well, the only reason I came on is to let everybody know that we are going to suspend

1600
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,480
Monday morning for this week just because I can't get you folks on the air.

1601
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,520
They took out the old phone.

1602
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:10,020
We used to have.

1603
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:10,940
Yeah.

1604
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:11,740
Well, you can talk.

1605
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,140
I just, you know, I only want to listen to myself talk for so long.

1606
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:15,800
And then I got bored.

1607
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,720
But the Two-Faced Kitty.

1608
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,160
I think that was done with mirrors.

1609
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,440
I'm sorry.

1610
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,640
I've got this book of freaks, folks.

1611
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,100
Yeah.

1612
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:24,880
No kidding.

1613
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:25,700
Yes.

1614
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,280
But anyway.

1615
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:30,300
But before they took out the old telephone, we had one line that came in and I could have

1616
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:30,900
patched that in.

1617
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:33,200
But it is here no longer.

1618
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:37,840
So I am going to check out for this week.

1619
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:39,900
Remind everybody that our.

1620
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,540
Our pledge drive will start next week.

1621
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:46,280
We're going to be starting it off here.

1622
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:52,360
And we want everybody to participate because I think we should be able to raise about $2,000

1623
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:53,360
during this show.

1624
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,180
What do you think, Robert?

1625
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,340
At least 10 times that much, I think.

1626
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,580
Oh, you're disgusting.

1627
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,600
This man is just plain greedy.

1628
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:00,380
I'm sorry.

1629
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,920
Well, I think $2,000 in pledges would be reasonable.

1630
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,960
So that's what we're going to need.

1631
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,780
We're going to do it like you know who.

1632
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:09,460
We're going to say.

1633
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:10,140
We need.

1634
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,200
$2,050.

1635
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:14,620
We need 40 people to give us $50.

1636
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:15,380
Is that right?

1637
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:16,260
Is that $2,000?

1638
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:16,540
Yeah.

1639
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,340
Yeah.

1640
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,920
I need 40 listeners next week to come up with $50.

1641
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,700
So that's what we're going to do.

1642
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,980
We're going to raise $2,000 during my show next week to get things off to a real big

1643
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:27,300
start.

1644
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:33,680
Reverend Stang, why don't you entertain the masses with your stories of mystique and illusion

1645
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:35,220
and Laurie Anderson.

1646
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:36,060
No, no.

1647
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,880
Well, those were.

1648
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:37,700
Those were true.

1649
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:38,220
No, they can't.

1650
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:39,840
They can't hear you when you're leaning over.

1651
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:40,700
I know.

1652
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,600
I don't want to.

1653
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,120
Take your mic.

1654
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:42,740
I don't have anything to say.

1655
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:43,520
Take the mic with you.

1656
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:45,060
It moves.

1657
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,320
See?

1658
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,320
Isn't that amazing?

1659
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:46,820
Yeah.

1660
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:47,860
It makes noise, dude.

1661
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,760
Oh, God.

1662
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:52,580
It just friends the microphone.

1663
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,160
It's too slack.

1664
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,120
It's achieved slackness.

1665
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:56,680
Listen to that.

1666
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:56,940
Look.

1667
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,680
Total slack.

1668
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,680
It has been slacked.

1669
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:00,500
Look what.

1670
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,640
It's slack to the max.

1671
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:05,040
Look what an hour and a half of slack does to a microphone.

1672
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,100
Just look at that.

1673
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:08,200
Can we get camera two to close up on that?

1674
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:08,200


1675
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:08,880
Yeah.

1676
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,060
Yeah.

1677
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,480
It still has that good tone.

1678
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:16,600
There is somebody that we need to be slackful with, and that is Heritage Cable, folks.

1679
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,060
We are no longer on the Community Billboard audio channel.

1680
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:22,500
We are no longer on any of their audio channels.

1681
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:24,400
I noticed that just today.

1682
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:29,480
Your antenna, your receiver, you can't pick up K&O in through the cable either.

1683
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,280
They can't hear you unless you talk louder.

1684
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,760
Why sad, G1?

1685
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:34,420
There you go.

1686
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:35,060
Now they can hear you.

1687
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:35,560
All right.

1688
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:38,200
I said that you can't pick us up when you hook up the cable.

1689
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:38,200


1690
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:41,600
I said that you can't pick us up when you hook up the cable to your receiver either.

1691
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,900
K&O in is the only FM signal that you can't pick up.

1692
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,940
Now why is that, friends?

1693
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:55,540
That's because we have some people that aren't paying attention down at Heritage Cable.

1694
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:01,080
Now the folks, if Warner Amex could do anything else right, at least they had us on down there.

1695
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:07,360
And they took us off once, and I called down there, and I got into the chief engineer,

1696
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,580
and he said, no prob.

1697
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:12,240
And he ran down there, and he just plugged the right things in, and he fixed it immediately.

1698
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,660
Now I don't know if the same people are working there or not, but different people are running

1699
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:16,880
it.

1700
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:22,180
Now, no, well, I understand what I mean, that the same guy may be down there pushing

1701
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,760
the buttons, but different people are running it.

1702
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:30,540
And you folks need to get on the phone and call Heritage Cable first thing tomorrow and

1703
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:34,740
tell them you want K&O in on your cable or else.

1704
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:37,340
And we know what that means.

1705
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:37,340


1706
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,960
That means no, or else you cancel the service.

1707
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,160
They don't care about the FCC.

1708
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,020
They care about if you're going to send them any money or not.

1709
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,420
So anyway, the ultimate threat.

1710
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:48,080
That's right.

1711
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,760
You can discontinue, discontinue your subscription.

1712
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,700
Are you ready to go, Reverend Stang?

1713
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:56,420
There, I think we're back in.

1714
01:48:56,420 --> 01:48:56,620
All right.

1715
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,760
Well, I appreciate your time and efforts, and thanks for covering for me here.

1716
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,540
Oh, sure, you bet.

1717
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,160
As a matter of fact, I'm going to get back to praising Bob here pretty soon.

1718
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,520
Oh, I'm going to get out of here.

1719
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,140
I'm going to get out of here before you start this.

1720
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,340
I'm going to get out of here before you start this.

1721
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:07,340


1722
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,220
I know Robert might throw you out, but I'm going to let you have it.

1723
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,200
What was the line, Bob, slack?

1724
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,580
I don't know, but we'll be back.

1725
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,580
We'll be back next week.

1726
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:17,240
It'll be pledge drive time, so don't you dare miss it.

1727
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,060
Bring your checkbook.

1728
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,440
I'm going to bring mine.

1729
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:20,980
Thank you.

1730
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:21,280
Thank you.

1731
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:24,480
A praise norm, friends.

1732
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:31,080
Well, you know, how long am I going to be in here?

1733
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,660
Until you get tired of it.

1734
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,540
Do you want to go home?

1735
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,520
Well, no, no.

1736
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,460
Hey, I'll keep entertaining the masses, folks.

1737
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:44,160
Give me Dr. Gene Scott's time slot.

1738
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,440
48 minutes.

1739
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,120
Yeah, we have a new program on.

1740
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,200
Excuse me.

1741
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:48,560
Oh, yeah.

1742
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:49,260
3 o'clock.

1743
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:54,040
Friends, at 3 o'clock, and we'll have a cartridge coming up here any second now.

1744
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:58,580
It's the...

1745
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,020
This.

1746
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:00,500
This.

1747
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:05,900
All right.

1748
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:06,500
You're going to get a new program.

1749
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:06,500


1750
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:06,500


1751
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:06,500


1752
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:06,720
The minutes.

1753
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,520
This is a phage.

1754
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:17,500
You know the world is in bad shape, and the future looks frightening.

1755
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,860
We know the questions.

1756
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,500
Let's find some answers.

1757
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:32,360

1772
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,480
I'm going to make a mistake.

1773
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,360
I'm going to make a mistake.

1774
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:59,500
I'm going to make a mistake.

1775
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:29,480
I'm going to make a mistake.

1776
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:59,480
I'm going to make a mistake.

1777
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:03,520
I'm going to make a mistake.

1778
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:59,420
I'm going to make a mistake.

01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:53,620
I'm going to make a mistake.

1785
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:02,980
I'm going to find you.

1786
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,860

You probably know th Carnostance.

1788
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:20,020
You probably know the concept of the film.

Yes.

1790
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:36,520
Big science

1791
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:40,380
Hallelujah

1792
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,320

Every man lives that

1794
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:55,900
Big science

1795
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:01,560
Hallelujah

1796

You're my hero

1797
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:22,320
What do our listeners think about K-N-O-N?

1798
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:24,780
Here are some comments we've received in the mail.

1799
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:25,880
You play more difficult.

1800
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:43,180

You play more difficult.

1813
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,540
You play more difficult.

1814
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:03,540


1815
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:03,840


1816
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:06,240
Hello.

1817
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:06,460
Hello.

1818
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:07,220
Hello.

1819
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:09,680
Hello.

1820
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:14,960
This here and, uh...

1821
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,500
Oh.

1822
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:16,480
Oh!

1823
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:17,880
That's all right.

1824
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:18,220
It's catching.

1825
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,140
Oh, no.

1826
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:20,020
And a pack of forums.

1827
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,000
Forums.

1828
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,840
Oh, yes.

1829
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:22,620
Here they are.

1830
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:24,560
These have little gladiator tips.

1831
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:25,600
They're cute and strong.

1832
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:26,000
$65.

1833
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:27,660
And that's holiday decanter.

1834
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,180
Wild crow is on special.

1835
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:31,380
$214.89.

1836
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:34,260
That's a bargain for a collectible like that.

1837
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:35,580
Look at those eyes.

1838
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,160
They'll follow you wherever you go.

1839
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:38,120
That's why I bought it.

1840
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:38,940
Come again now.

1841
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:39,840
Thank you.

1842
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:40,500
Thank you.

1843
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:41,020
$99.

1844
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:41,640
Mm-hmm.

1845
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:41,980
Ah!

1846
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:42,740
Oh!

1847
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:43,040
Oh!

1848
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,660
My anus butt bumper.

1849
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:45,600
Get out of the way, mister.

1850
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,860
Have you boys caught that nasty Indian yet?

1851
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:48,800
That's what I come for now.

1852
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:49,380
Now, listen, Ma.

1853
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,980
You better turn the eyes off in the lizard.

1854
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:52,440
Yeah, before he shoots him out.

1855
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,420
Yeah, we lost him up at the trailhead over to Mount Boron.

1856
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:55,820
Oh, my.

1857
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:57,160
Now, you just stay inside.

1858
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,080
Keep safe, huh?

1859
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:03,200
Oh, he's broke my TV.

1860
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,760
We hit the light, Sonny, and get behind the counter.

1861
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,800
Come on down here.

1862
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,120
Oh, for God's sakes.

1863
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:09,740
This is worse than an Indian in a goat fight.

1864
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:10,160
Shh.

1865
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:11,960
Keep your voice down.

1866
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:13,320
It's not just happening here.

1867
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:14,980
It's happening over in Hollywood, too.

1868
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:15,820
I heard it on the radio.

1869
02:06:15,980 --> 02:06:19,680
This is a strange place, just as strange as Hollywood any day.

1870
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:23,140
I expect you've heard the voices.

1871
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,200
No.

1872
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,000
What voices?

1873
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:29,240
Oh, most people hear them as soon as they come into town.

1874
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:33,520
You got to keep your TV on real loud all the time to drown them out.

1875
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:34,200
Yes.

1876
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:34,680
Oh!

1877
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:35,540
Shh.

1878
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,160
Is that one?

1879
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:40,520
Oh, they must come up from the next world.

1880
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:41,020
Shh.

1881
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:41,240
That's all.

1882
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:41,860
Shh.

1883
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:42,060
No.

1884
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:42,900
Sugar, sugar.

1885
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:43,760
Oh.

1886
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:44,760
Sugar, sugar, sugar.

1887
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,500
How does it know my name?

1888
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:47,860
What?

1889
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,000
Oh, they call everybody sugar.

1890
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:51,560
Be careful.

1891
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:52,480
Don't let them read your mind.

1892
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:53,160
Sing.

1893
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:54,100
Sing something.

1894
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:54,520
Anything.

1895
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:56,220
Hey, lazy Steve.

1896
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:57,380
There's no...

1897
02:06:57,380 --> 02:07:02,140
Help me.

1898
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:02,960
Help me.

1899
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:05,120
Say thanks.

1900
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:08,840
Help me.

1901
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,960
Say thanks.

1902
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:11,760
You got to believe...

1903
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:11,960
You got to believe...

1904
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,580
Help me, please.

1905
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:14,920
Help me, please.

1906
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:31,000
Help me, please.

1907
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:31,980
Please help me.

1908
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:08,180
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack to see how they did hang.

1909
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:12,620
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.

1910
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,180
I couldn't ignite a thing.

1911
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:19,680
There was no shard, no bow, no twig.

1912
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:21,580
I dropped my comic book collection.

1913
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,400
Was about this big, yeah.

1914
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,900
Well, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1915
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:30,360
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

1916
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:33,840
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock.

1917
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,760
But all that food was stale.

1918
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:41,000
I thought I'd call that ripoff schmuck.

1919
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:43,700
But I forgot he was in jail.

1920
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:51,620
Ended up killing a porcupine just to see if I could smoke his rhyme.

1921
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:55,140
Oh, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1922
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:58,640
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

1923
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:02,220
Yeah, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1924
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:05,680
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

1925
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:06,600
I don't know.

1926
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:09,160
You know what I am going to do.

1927
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:13,120
I just know that this here trip ain't through, oh.

1928
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:16,440
Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1929
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:19,920
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

1930
02:09:20,940 --> 02:09:23,600
Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1931
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:26,960
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

1932
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:30,640
Yeah, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1933
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:31,720
Don't cop from that guy there.

1934
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,040
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

1935
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:35,000
Oh, stay away from that.

1936
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,580
Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.

1946
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:48,600
told us not to say the earth turned gray the sea turned black the rivers turned red

1947
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:57,140
the beast turned pale

1948
02:10:58,360 --> 02:10:59,520
the stars

1949
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,900
fast the air turned to poison

1950
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:25,920
but let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of bob for this brief

1951
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:29,300
minute of slack from the church of the subgenius

1952
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:35,920
ah yes dear friends this is reverend ivan stang with the facts that's right the facts but why are you

1953
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:41,360
so hung up on facts my friend the church of the sub genious unlike the conspiracy that you serve now

1954
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:48,200
does not confuse you with so-called quote facts unquote there are no facts to the enlightened man

1955
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:53,840
the one trained in the church by bob dobbs ultimate truth can be found in a potato in

1956
02:11:53,840 --> 02:12:01,020
a comic book or at the bottom of a bottle of liquid slack because friends slack is what comes first yes slack comes first

1957
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:01,020


1958
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:01,020


1959
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:02,320
must come even before truth.

1960
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,140
So why are you letting the experts

1961
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:06,120
pull the wool over your eyes?

1962
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:08,920
Forget the facts, friends, and do like Bob.

1963
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:11,260
Pull the wool over your own eyes

1964
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:14,400
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

1965
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:16,280
This is your only hope, my friend,

1966
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,100
if you wish to unravel the punchline

1967
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:19,720
to the joke of life.

1968
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:21,340
Let there be slack.

1969
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:24,580
God, really, folks, let there be slack.

1970
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:26,820
I just, the wind just blew so hard

1971
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:28,540
it knocked the, uh, needle out.

1972
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:29,200
Whoa!

1973
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,420
That's close enough.

1974
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:42,100
Get up, puppet boy.

1975
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:45,660
You've got a job to do.

1976
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:49,560
Even so, you're free to go.

1977
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,260
Well, you're not so tired to do.

1978
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:52,640
Listen, puppet boy.

1979
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:56,080
Before you disobey,

1980
02:12:58,180 --> 02:12:59,960
consider that the strings attached

1981
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:00,900
could never be

1982
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:01,120
true.

1983
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:02,820
In your head, puppet boy,

1984
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,020
it's the little things that count.

1985
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:07,220
Little problems, little minds,

1986
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:08,500
little points of view.

1987
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:09,740
Puppet boy,

1988
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,100
if the world makes that up,

1989
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:13,580
you'll give me up

1990
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:15,440
for the trigger-based things like you.

1991
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:24,260
Stand up, puppet boy.

1992
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,760
Time to start the show.

1993
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,880
You'd better do something.

1994
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,540
Brand new moves, they feel like

1995
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:33,460
to watch you go.

1996
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:37,540
Huh.

1997
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:46,600
Puppet boy.

1998
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:48,080
Get.

1999
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:54,180
Get up, puppet boy.

2000
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,740
You've got a job to do.

2001
02:13:59,160 --> 02:13:59,820
You've got a job to do.

2002
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,460
Get up, puppet boy.

2003
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:00,880
Even so, you're free to go.

2004
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:01,660
You're free to go.

2005
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:03,380
Well, you're not so tired to do.

2006
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:04,700
Listen, puppet boy.

2007
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:08,160
Before you disobey,

2008
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:12,060
consider that the strings attached

2009
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:13,240
could never be true.

2010
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,900
In your head, puppet boy,

2011
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:17,140
it's the little things that count.

2012
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:19,380
Little problems, little minds,

2013
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:20,660
little points of view.

2014
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:21,900
Puppet boy,

2015
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:24,260
if the world makes that up,

2016
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:25,720
you'll give me up

2017
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:27,620
for the trigger-based things like you.

2018
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:35,340
You're notendre wit.

2019
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:38,260
StandNium's not trying to mess with you.

2020
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:39,220
That's fine.

2021
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:39,440
You can see what you're worried.

2022
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2023
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2024
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2025
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2026
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2027
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2028
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,440


2029
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:39,700
You shouldn't miss out on a show.

2030
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:44,040
Puppet boy.

2031
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,040


2032
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,040


2033
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,040


2034
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,040


2035
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,040


2036
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,720
It's theword they work with all day.

2037
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:45,800
No game.

2038
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:47,500
We're here to stay.

2039
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:47,960
Even a little more.

2040
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:47,960


2041
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,800
No game.

2042
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:00,680
What's that, puppet?

2043
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,740
Don't tell me what to do.

2044
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:04,440
What's that, Puppet Boy?

2045
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:06,280
I'm not a creep like you.

2046
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,040
What's that, Puppet Boy?

2047
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:09,740
I move when I want to.

2048
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:13,180
I can't hear you, Puppet Boy. Now dance, dance, dance!

2049
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:17,100
Stay out of bed unless you're gonna get wet.

2050
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:20,720
I'm a boy, not a toy, I'm not through yet.

2051
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:24,240
Stay out of bed unless you're gonna get wet.

2052
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:27,340
Now wake up, Puppet Boy!

2053
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:30,760
Ha!

2054
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:45,860
Listen, Puppet Boy.

2055
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:49,300
You're not a robot slave.

2056
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:54,820
Consider that a string's attack could ever make you misbehave.

2057
02:15:56,580 --> 02:15:59,880
Puppet Boy is the thing that counts.

2058
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:03,060
Puppet Boy, you're the problem, you're the mind, and the world is yours.

2059
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:06,980
Puppet Boy, it's a little thing set up.

2060
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:10,460
Be me up in the tree, I'll do things like you.

2061
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:13,780
Puppet Boy, it's a little thing to like.

2062
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,960
You're the problem, you're the mind, and the world is yours.

2063
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:22,920
Friends, I'm sorry. It wasn't the wind that was blowing this needle all across the turntable.

2064
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,940
It was apparently that poltergeist again,

2065
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:30,260
because Buck put the window up and all of a sudden everything just started flying around the room,

2066
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:31,880
and the needles were jumping, and phew!

2067
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:53,220
Who do you want to be today?

2068
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,160
Who do you want to be?

2069
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:57,560
Who do you want to be today?

2070
02:16:57,560 --> 02:17:00,300
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

2071
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:00,560
Oh boy!

2072
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:03,900
Heaven is so terrible, it's like it's rephesies

2073
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:07,880
And the things could be worse than when there's nothing on TV

2074
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:12,460
I'd rather be a cowboy than just airplane got the walls

2075
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:16,700
I've been reborn so many times I can't remember them all

2076
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:19,220
And I say, who do you want to be today?

2077
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:20,980
Who do you want to be?

2078
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:23,580
Who do you want to be today?

2079
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:26,300
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

2080
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,020
Just like somebody on TV!

2081
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:49,140
I think I'll be a scary boy, I think I'll be a hunk

2082
02:17:49,140 --> 02:17:53,360
I think I'll be a tough guy and I think I'll be a punk

2083
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:57,940
I might just be a fashion star all dressed in pretty rags

2084
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:02,100
Over half across the other side and walk around in red

2085
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:04,580
Who do you want to be today?

2086
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:06,320
Who do you want to be?

2087
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:08,920
Who do you want to be today?

2088
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:11,720
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

2089
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:15,420
Just like somebody on TV!

2090
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:25,300
Who do you want to be?

2091
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:27,220
Who do you want to be?

2092
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,640
Who do you want to be?

2093
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:31,100
Who do you want to be?

2094
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:35,920
Who do you want to be?

2095
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:39,240
Oh yeah!

2096
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:51,740
Do you like to live just like a rock in the middle of the sea?

2097
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:53,480
Do you want to suffer?

2098
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:56,160
Do you want to go by yourself in a pool of blissful misery?

2099
02:18:56,560 --> 02:19:00,480
Do you feel like a saint in honest clothes with a rosary in your hand?

2100
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:03,080
Do you want to be crazy like Bando?

2101
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:05,420
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

2102
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:09,080
Would you rather push the buttons and be feared by all humanity?

2103
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:11,740
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum?

2104
02:19:11,900 --> 02:19:14,020
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

2105
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:15,940
Who do you want to be today?

2106
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:17,760
Who do you want to be?

2107
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:20,280
Who do you want to be today?

2108
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:23,080
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

2109
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:26,820
Just like somebody on TV?

2110
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,940
Who do you want to be today?

2111
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:33,100
Who do you want to be today?

2112
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:37,380
Who do you want to be today?

2113
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,900
Who do you want to be today?

2114
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:46,220
Who do you want to be today?

2115
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,960
Who do you want to be?

2116
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:50,580
Who do you want to be today?

2117
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:52,260
Who do you want to be?

2118
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:07,760
Hi girls.

2119
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:11,240
I thought I was afraid you couldn't do it, Buck.

2120
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,600
I'm glad you were able to work that out.

2121
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:15,520
I hope it gets some results.

2122
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:17,360
Or har.

2123
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:22,640
This is Dr. Onan Kanabai.

2124
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,380
Think a bob.

2125
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:23,820
.

2126
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:28,040
Dr. Onan's Wootan Man.

2127
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:30,660
.

2128
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:38,620
When you drive in 16 hours, think a bob.

2129
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:39,540
Think a bob.

2130
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:42,420
When you use your mutant powers, think a bob.

2131
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:43,280
Think a bob.

2132
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:47,380
When your blood is low in sugar, when they're picking out the boogers.

2133
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:50,140
When you shoot them with a luga, think a bob.

2134
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:51,140
Think a bob.

2135
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,620
When you're outside exit, think a bob.

2136
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:56,960
Think about when you're using sex devices.

2137
02:20:56,980 --> 02:21:00,660
Think about when you're walking through the woods.

2138
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:02,580
When you make out with the girls.

2139
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:04,800
When you're beat up to the hooves.

2140
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:05,260
Think about.

2141
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:22,940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, big fat, big fat, big fat, big fat sick.

2142
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:23,380
Bad.

2143
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:25,780
Babby, baby, bad baby.

2144
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,580
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2145
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:28,740
No.

2146
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:31,220
Can they perhaps been».

2147
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:34,720
Don't do that.

2148
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:06,960
When you see a flock of birds, think about

2149
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:11,020
When you just run out of words, think about

2150
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:16,000
When a ring falls from your collar, when you hear a given holler

2151
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,600
When you ride chicks for one dollar, think about

2152
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,520
When you ride to the subgenius, think about

2153
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:27,260
P.O. Box 1403-06, think about

2154
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:31,480
When you cast your mojo hexes, when you ride through Dallas, Texas

2155
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:34,180
When you're off the residence, think about

2156
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:56,060
The whole world's gone crazy!

2157
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:14,020
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

2158
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:17,540
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

2159
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:21,320
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

2160
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:23,120
Dare I ask it?

2161
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:23,900
Yes.

2162
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:27,260
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

2163
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:31,500
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the Earth each and every day?

2164
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:34,180
The answer? Yes, definitely.

2165
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:37,520
Take that, and shove it up the tube, mark certainty.

2166
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:40,440
In the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

2167
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,280
Are you on drugs?

2168
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:55,180
Of course not, Mr. Baldwin. I'm trying to explain...

2169
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:56,360
Yes, and very strangely.

2170
02:23:57,260 --> 02:24:00,380
Perhaps strange enough to understand my little... secret.

2171
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:05,300
I mean, saying there was a power failure so your clock didn't go off,

2172
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:09,320
and then claiming a meteorite held you up on Central just as an excuse to be late.

2173
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:11,120
I mean, you must be wacko!

2174
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:15,140
Yes, pretty odd. Odd enough to believe this.

2175
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:18,600
Sharon, I am not a regular human being.

2176
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:22,420
I am, in actuality, an alien from a distant solar system.

2177
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:26,620
Sir, it's been a long day, as it is, and it's only noon.

2178
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:27,200
Yes, Sharon.

2179
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:28,160
Sharon, you heard me right.

2180
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:30,360
An alien from a distant solar system.

2181
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:32,040
We came here for two reasons.

2182
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:34,600
One was for our food, which you have here in abundance.

2183
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:37,360
Kittens. We suck their guts out.

2184
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:39,820
And second, to mate.

2185
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:43,720
And you seem to be just weird enough to do it, Miss Sharon and Joy.

2186
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:46,780
Yes, Glorp needs ladies.

2187
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:47,760
Oh, no!

2188
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,760
You do not believe my claim? Then look at this!

2189
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:54,000
And now you see me as I really am.

2190
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:57,020
Sharon, let's have sex.

2191
02:24:57,260 --> 02:25:00,300
There was a second service at the beginning of the show.

2192
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:02,460
Because your brains, dear...

2193
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:04,420
...out by us.

2194
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:12,260
Unfortunately, that show...

2195
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:13,960
Your show, cancelled.

2196
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:16,880
Bad words on your show. No, no.

2197
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,480
Forbidden language used on the air.

2198
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:20,160
Yeah.

2199
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:21,640
Ew!

2200
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:27,080
The insipid, insipid noises from your little collar face hole.

2201
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:30,580
Face crime, face crime. You know what that means.

2202
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:32,600
Naughty nigger.

2203
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:33,560
No, no.

2204
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:38,940
Yes, another collar's soul sucked out.

2205
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:42,580
She paid for one breath of true cheer with that soul.

2206
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:44,320
Now, was that worth it?

2207
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:45,140
No.

2208
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:46,220
Horrible little collar's soul.

2209
02:25:46,220 --> 02:25:48,140
No, is this abuse worth it, collar?

2210
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:49,700
Bad little collar's.

2211
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:51,020
I've got a question.

2212
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:52,280
Don't hang up on me.

2213
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:53,760
I just want to check it out for you.

2214
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:55,820
Wait, wait. Don't hang up on you?

2215
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:56,860
Yeah, don't hang up on me.

2216
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:57,240
And don't put your hands on me.

2217
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:58,160
Don't play everything all at once, right?

2218
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:00,720
Don't play all the microphones and turntables and tape recorders real loud.

2219
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:01,100
Yeah, here.

2220
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:02,300
No, I just want to ask you something.

2221
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:03,340
Do you want to think of something else?

2222
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:04,960
Well, yeah, go ahead and ask.

2223
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:06,420
It's getting cold out here, little collar. Hurry up.

2224
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:09,700
Come on, come on.

2225
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:10,460
What, what?

2226
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:15,360
I can't hear you. It's so cold in here.

2227
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:17,380
No, you don't understand. The collar's being manipulated.

2228
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:19,360
Now there's nothing but collar.

2229
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:22,040
Then, then you drown it all out, you know?

2230
02:26:22,040 --> 02:26:23,840
Right. It's just frustrating, I know.

2231
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:24,800
What is the point?

2232
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:27,080
There used to be a point to this show.

2233
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:30,660
Yeah, there was a point to this show, and the point was Bob Dobbs,

2234
02:26:30,660 --> 02:26:32,280
and we just don't need that guy anymore.

2235
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,760
Oh, James, or Mobius, or something like that.

2236
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,280
Okay, but what was the old point?

2237
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:39,100
Well, the old point was that it wasn't so much Bob,

2238
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:42,580
it was the church subgeniuses that everybody called up and they had a good time.

2239
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:45,220
Oh, it was a collar party. Everybody comes in your...

2240
02:26:45,220 --> 02:26:46,380
Yeah, funky collar party.

2241
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:49,020
Well, you know, you'd have a lot less work to do.

2242
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:51,940
You'd sit back and sound work, and just let the collar sit in the pocket, right?

2243
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:54,380
And you know what the subgeniuses do to us if we do that?

2244
02:26:54,620 --> 02:26:55,160
What do they do?

2245
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:57,080
They make a...

2246
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:57,220
Oh, no, don't do that.

2247
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,320
Don't talk about the collar.

2248
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:00,200
Just the memory.

2249
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:03,000
It's cold and rainy out here.

2250
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:05,780
Have you ever been peed on like this?

2251
02:27:05,860 --> 02:27:06,460
Collar, you're fading.

2252
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:07,260
What's wrong?

2253
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,280
Well, it sounds like everybody's fading.

2254
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:13,800
I can't believe those guys.

2255
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:16,440
That's that California show.

2256
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:19,240
See, now, that's another station that's trying to take over our airwaves.

2257
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:21,040
That's, um...

2258
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:22,120
These...

2259
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,260
There's that echo again.

2260
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:25,620
Those creatures.

2261
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:26,180
Well...

2262
02:27:26,820 --> 02:27:30,360
You know, this is an unusual hour of slack ending.

2263
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:36,260
Usually, as it gets down to about 1226, like it is now, I hear on KNON 90.9,

2264
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:42,160
why the entire Monday morning crew, Norm Ward and all his friends,

2265
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:44,480
are usually crowding behind me, clustered around.

2266
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:49,500
But friends, they seem to be having some sort of trouble with the phones.

2267
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:55,060
Maybe the poltergeist has set it up to where the hour of slack has to turn into three hours of slack,

2268
02:27:55,060 --> 02:27:56,620
or 24 hours of slack.

2269
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:57,740
Maybe days and days.

2270
02:27:57,800 --> 02:28:01,700
Well, anyway, just in case Norm does come in here and kick me out at the appointed hour,

2271
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:04,040
which, if I was him, I certainly would do.

2272
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,520
And if he doesn't, I've got a tape of him doing it anyway.

2273
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:14,880
I do have something that I should have been playing at the end of every show since we started the show 21 shows ago.

2274
02:28:15,020 --> 02:28:17,620
And this is the credits for the hour of slack.

2275
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:22,980
What we were just hearing before the credits started, to give you a credit, was...

2276
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:24,240
The...

2277
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:27,240
The more than an hour, less than a show show.

2278
02:28:28,660 --> 02:28:31,200
But, as well as that, you find...

2279
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:41,900
The voices, tapes, music, and editing you've been listening to come from...

2280
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:44,420
Leepo Abernathy,

2281
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:48,260
Buck Naked and the Jaybirds,

2282
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:52,520
Dr. O and Canobite.

2283
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:54,220
Show's right up on the Green Room.

2284
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:55,600
Green Lines, Dr. G. Gordon.

2285
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:57,400
G. Gordon Gordon, killer for Bob.

2286
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:59,500
Tell me somebody, she ain't got...

2287
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:01,180
Doctors for Bob.

2288
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:06,660
Dr. Philo Drummond, overman, first degree.

2289
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:11,800
Reverend Cleve Donut Duncan.

2290
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:16,600
Dr. Snavely Eklund.

2291
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:19,600
Can't have seen it on the radio, but you can find it.

2292
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:21,260
Yeah, we're only kidding, too.

2293
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,560
We're just trying to make sure that you have a good nap.

2294
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:23,880
Or a good nap.

2295
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:28,700
Now that you have paradigm perspective, let's move on to the shift in paradigm.

2296
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:31,040
This is Dr. Ahmed Fishmark.

2297
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:35,560
This is Glass Madness.

2298
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:37,900
Bob is my blindfold world.

2299
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:41,540
This is Herr Dr. Chris Gross.

2300
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:46,760
This is Hell's Mommy Satellite Gevers.

2301
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:48,140
This is compatible with all religions.

2302
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:51,120
And this is Negative Lands.

2303
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:57,260
These are those fantastic swinging love corpses.

2304
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:01,660
These are doctors for dinosaurs.

2305
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:05,400
These are doctors for Wotan.

2306
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:09,320
This is Gary the Brogue Fan.

2307
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:15,540
This is St. Seymour Hyperboles.

2308
02:30:15,820 --> 02:30:17,000
The unmistakable.

2309
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:21,080
This is Arch-Poet.

2310
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:22,500
This is Sturgo Dox.

2311
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,500
This is Chattoons.

2312
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:27,200
Help me somebody.

2313
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:30,920
This is D.K. Jones.

2314
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:39,820
This is Palmer Breedings of the Lies Foundation.

2315
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:41,560
Hi Palmer.

2316
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:47,460
And this is the Pope of all New York, David B. Monk.

2317
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:48,300
We're through.

2318
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:53,260
This is Mark Mothersbaugh.

2319
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:59,660
This is the man in the movie.

2320
02:31:00,060 --> 02:31:06,440
This is Buck Naked, the fighting creature.

2321
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,920
This is Dr. Howell.

2322
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:15,200
I didn't understand the meaning of this explanation, but I'm sure I'll call her later.

2323
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,460
I won't be able to help her.

2324
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:18,740
This is Mark Byron Warner.

2325
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:20,680
You never hear his voice.

2326
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:25,620
But you hear lots and lots of his tapes and his fine editing.

2327
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,000
You have reached the correct number.

2328
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,300
This is someone else.

2329
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:31,080
Your call has already been analyzed.

2330
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:34,640
And this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

2331
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:38,060
Ah, yes. Thank you and praise Bob.

2332
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:45,680
Oh, and this is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas, the voice of the people and other things.

2333
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:47,260
Praise Bob!

2334
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:53,660
Now you may have observed

2335
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:55,700
If you walk into a wall

2336
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:58,500
You get a certain sensation of reality

2337
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:02,920
When you take a look through your memory book

2338
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:06,580
You may perceive a certain rhythmic regularity

2339
02:32:06,580 --> 02:32:10,700
The crazy things your mind gets up to

2340
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:12,160
When you're away

2341
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:16,700
Throwing clouds of rain

2342
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:19,620
Over brightest days

2343
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:25,980
And there was once a little man

2344
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:28,460
He worked all day

2345
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:30,680
Slept all the night

2346
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:33,320
He looked at the sun

2347
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:35,760
It didn't seem right

2348
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,480
It didn't seem right

2349
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:45,740
He wondered

2350
02:32:45,740 --> 02:32:50,120
Did the world go a-rolling along on its own

2351
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:51,100
On its own

2352
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:55,200
Or did some spirit move it

2353
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:57,600
With a black cat bone

2354
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:01,400
And he set out to find

2355
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:02,800
The causes behind

2356
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,860
The events in the world

2357
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:07,440
And the seasons of the mind

2358
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,700
So he asked his wife about it

2359
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:13,140
And his wife said yes

2360
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:15,240
Come back and see me

2361
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:16,940
If it's time to know less

2362
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:20,420
Due to much of questions of the world at large

2363
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:21,100
He said yes

2364
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:22,080
Everybody knows

2365
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:23,940
The politician's in charge

2366
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:25,880
So he went to the king house

2367
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:27,560
Just the next day

2368
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:29,420
To see that politician

2369
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:31,080
With his hair dyed grey

2370
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:33,580
Jump down, turn round

2371
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:35,380
Blow you off or kiss the ground

2372
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:37,700
Trying to be the president of the land

2373
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:38,500
So gay

2374
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:41,800
He had those false pretend

2375
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:43,740
He's had to love his style

2376
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:45,860
Bound to make some havoc

2377
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:47,440
With that violent smile

2378
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:48,280
Hey

2379
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:50,940
Salvador Daz

2380
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:51,440
Charlie Maker

2381
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:53,040
Walking, talking something

2382
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,800
You paint some freaky pictures

2383
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:57,060
Make the likeness of that man

2384
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,820
Muchos dollars if you can

2385
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:08,660
And so the little man

2386
02:34:10,060 --> 02:34:11,500
Asked the politician

2387
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:13,480
Who makes the plan

2388
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:16,140
Who makes the plan

2389
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:18,680
What happens to me

2390
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:20,600
And who has the key?

2391
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:21,080
And who has the key?

2392
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:25,160
And who has the key?

2393
02:34:25,160 --> 02:34:27,440
And who has the key?

2394
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:29,820
Now you are asking me

2395
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:31,500
Who makes the scene

2396
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,100
His Highness King Gold

2397
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:34,820
And Madam Silver his queen

2398
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,820
They keep it all a rustling

2399
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:38,420
With the dollars and pounds

2400
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:40,280
And everyone knows that money

2401
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:42,060
Makes the world go around

2402
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:44,600
And so the little man

2403
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:47,940
Asked King Gold and Madam Silver

2404
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:49,920
Come tell me what you can

2405
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:52,060
And King Gold said

2406
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:55,460
Lifting his golden voice

2407
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:57,260
From his golden bed

2408
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:05,440
Now money is something

2409
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:07,120
It's a basic flow

2410
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:09,600
And me I am the archetype

2411
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:10,760
Of jewels and dough

2412
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,840
I do a lot of talking both

2413
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:14,340
Slow and fast

2414
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:16,420
But me make decisions no

2415
02:35:16,420 --> 02:35:17,860
Of course it's the past

2416
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,680
Oh the past is something

2417
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:21,540
We all have some

2418
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:23,580
Universal history

2419
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:25,240
Is a bundle of fun

2420
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:27,220
Now I get sleepy

2421
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:28,840
Starting to nod

2422
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:30,960
And if you want to check the picture

2423
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,740
Want to check the picture

2424
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:34,160
Want to check it

2425
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:35,160
Check it with God

2426
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:40,340
And so the little man

2427
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:43,700
Climbed up on a rickety ladder

2428
02:35:43,700 --> 02:35:45,860
To the heavenly lands

2429
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:48,480
And he shed a tear

2430
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:49,300
And he was a little boy

2431
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:49,300


2432
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:50,180
It's all so queer

2433
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:52,160
And it doesn't seem clear

2434
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:01,180
Now God was sitting easy

2435
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:02,760
In a heavenly chair

2436
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:04,860
Breathing deep and lazy

2437
02:36:04,860 --> 02:36:06,420
On the heavenly air

2438
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:08,600
The little man got near him

2439
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,020
Just to get right from wrong

2440
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:11,780
Said God are you responsible

2441
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:13,640
For all that goes on

2442
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:15,480
God looked up

2443
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:17,240
From having a heavenly thing

2444
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:20,920
He gave that little questioner a heavenly wink

2445
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:23,260
Saying, men have colored me

2446
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:25,640
With the colors of their minds

2447
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:27,600
So I find

2448
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:30,900
They use me as an excuse

2449
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:33,180
For all kinds of goofs

2450
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:34,900
And for crimes of all kinds
