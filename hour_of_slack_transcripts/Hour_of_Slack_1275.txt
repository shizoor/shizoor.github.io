You realize, of course, Miss Tyler, why these rules are in effect.
Each of us is afforded as much opportunity as possible to fit in with society.
In your case, think of the time and money and the effort expended to make you look...
Look like what, Doctor?
Normal, the way you'd like to look.
What about all the historical figures who didn't give a fuck about anything?
Thank you.
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

Please, please take this off me, please.
Please take this off me.
Please take this off me.
Oh, please take this off me!
Take it off me!
Take it off me!
Help!
Somebody!
It can't get back in. It's too late.
The exit hole has now closed.
It's too late.
Open sesame won't work.
Brainy now. It's too late.
Passage is too small.
I can't wedge it in there. I can't lever it in there.
Squeeze it in or squirt it in with a siphon.
Or spoon it in through the sinuses.
Alright, now we've got full microphone coverage.
Sneeze into the microphone, Philo.
The sound height.
The sound height.
It's at that appropriate height.
Miss Tyler.
Miss Tyler, don't be afraid.
He's only a representative from the group you're going to live with.
Now come on now.
Don't be afraid.
He's not going to hurt you.
He won't hurt you.
Don't be afraid.
He's not going to hurt you.
It's alright.
It's alright, Miss Tyler.
Now this is Mr. Smith.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
Yes, I'm Mr. Smith.
Just a representative from the group you're going to live with.
And we're preparing you for your new life with this hour of slack.
Which will be mostly recordings from 13X Day at the place where you'll be living.
Which will be mostly recordings from 13X Day at the place where you'll be living.
Yes, most of this show, besides the collages, will be songs from 13X Day and a live hour of slack from the stage with Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond, Pope David Lee Black and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
But first, a very special recording from the parking lot of the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland outside the 2010 Devotional the last August.
A brand new subgenius hymn by Reverend Samantha and Reverend Robert.

The Dobs is watching us.
He's following you.
His Holy Highness knows everything you do.
Dobs heads are all around.
Trust me, I know.
His third eye will track you down.
Wherever you go.
If all slack is what he's found, pink you shall blow.

Cracking his every thought.
Truth he shall find.

Now look at this.
Now look at this.
This is a great contest.
You are watching this.
They were uncharitable.
I could see our license plate was California.
Just because they did not exhibit the behavior of advanced beings does not mean one should slip to their level.
They said, oh, look, they're just from California.
They're assholes.
Californicators.
They're used to being that way.
Yeah, people hate those who are fleeing California.
Here, back to you, Dr. Howell.
I'm trying to make everything like California.
Preserve the flyover territory.
All I know is that in just about every state we passed through, there was massive, giant fireworks superstores and whole galaxies of fireworks selling arenas.
Massive fireworks displays with the most fireworks I'd ever seen.
And that was just like one of them.
And then we went on down the road and there were hundreds.
Every state we went in, they sold fireworks.
Even the Walmart.
I went into a Walmart and the Walmart had, you know, children's fireworks areas where the kids could get their favorite explosive devices for like 19 bucks, you know?
That sound is coming from the video.
I just want to light the whole thing, you know?
Which I'm controlling.
They got to learn this now.
But they don't have that.
See, they've taken that.
You don't have to worry about that.
Okay, shut up.
Listen.
Enough of this boring old fart at traveling across the U.S. in their van crap.
The world ends tomorrow and you probably will not actually die.
Because I'm assuming everybody here has their name listed in the book of life.
And so, therefore, we should all, yeah, you know, the drill.
And this is not a drill.
This is not.
A drill.
Needle, please.
Needle, please.
So we've been reading out of the collection of wonderful, wonderful fucked up fairy tales that have been created by this.
This absolutely wonderful, wonderful uber femme.
But in the many fairy tale varieties that we've had, we've never actually had one read by the author herself.
And that is what we are doing right now.
So please welcome Reverend Beckett on up.

This one in the flyer.
Oops, should I start over?
Now do it!
Okay.
The boss is coming for dinner.
It was very short notice, but if you got that big new account, it would mean more hats and
aprons and clamps and speculums and pie birds and leather hoods for everyone, so dinner
would have to be perfect.
Yeah.
everything was going fine but upon scraping some entrails into the garbage disposal a geyser of
spongy tubes and bloody snappers erupted from the drain and clung to the ceiling dripping gore
oh dear said mrs johnson that's going to be a bitch to clean up
in a panic she hurried upstairs for a quick bowel movement she flushed repeatedly but her steaming
loaf would not budge and when she employed the plunger an unexpected force grasped from within
and held fast now she had guts all over the kitchen ceiling and a splintering wooden probe
jutting out of the toilet my goodness she sighed what the fuck can go wrong next
then she tried to wash her hands and the sink ran coarsely chopped fish heads they collected in the
basin oozing a thick fishy aroma and blinking their shiny vapid eyes heavens to betsy she moaned
i guess i'd better call the plumber before the boss gets a whiff of this shit the plumber came
and his findings were upsetting there was a rampant
historical jesus infestation in her kitchen plumbing buddhist stuffed the pipes behind the
toilet a slender ala was snaked around the u-pipe under the bathroom sink and an angry blue krishna
lay coiled just beneath the drain in her bathtub with a film of soap scum and pubic shavings all
over his face there's something wrong with me
oh my she declared what can i do about all these fucking plumbing deities i don't know he said but
i'm not gonna lie to you i'm gonna say it's the only thing i think you need is an exterminator
now you don't get to be the wife of a junior executive supervising account logistics manager at
important co by giving up the first sign of trouble so mrs johnson set to work with only an hour left
before dinner she stewed up a pot of entrails and tubers put on a fresh coat of lipstick and a clean
harness scraped the tentacles off the ceiling powdered her gills and lubed up thoroughly when
the doorbell rang she looked fresh as a rose and the house smelled invitingly of chum but it was not
her husband and the boss on the doorstep
It was Bob who said, Hello, Mrs. Johnson.
You've got a problem.
You've got gods in your pipes.
She felt her loins warm slightly and nodded.
Wouldn't you rather have pipes in your gods?
She drooled just a little and calmly agreed.
So they fropped together for a while.
Time slowed.
When the doorbell rang again, Mrs. Johnson panicked.
Oh, no, Bob.
What about the boss?
Fuck the boss, declared Bob.
So she did.
And Johnson got that big new account.
And they lived happily ever after amid a house full of brand new shit
that they could afford with the promotion money,
thanks to Bob and his heavenly wisdom.
And now after a violent spree, when the bodies pile up in the basement,
they chop them up and feed them to drain Jesus,
whose thirst for blood is matched only by his love for the flavor of eggshells
and potato peelings and the cool, damp habitat of kitchen plumbing.
The end.

Tonight's brain cells.
Doesn't that make you hate the person that made you forget it?
Reverend Stang, doesn't that make you hate the person that made you forget it?
It forced you out of your brain.
It wouldn't make me hate everybody, but it's almost like I've got too much slack now.
But Bob makes you forget.
I had slack poisoning last night.
If only Bob could let me forget.
I actually had, I can't say that it was too much.
You can't have too much, but I definitely had a little slack poisoning.
I could feel it.
There's no such thing as too much slack.
There is slack poisoning, slack abuse, false slack, which G. Gordon Gordon said,
false slack is still better than no slack at all.
But Reverend Carter LeBlanc added, false slack is no slack at all.
And as Dr.
Legume said, pass me that joint.
I think we suffered from slack poisoning.
As Harry Dean Stanton said, people come up to me and ask me what I believe.
They go, preacher, what do you really believe?
I'll tell you what I really believe, son.
I believe I'm going to go have me another beer.
I've got a character, you know.
It's this mix between Keith Richards, Johnny Depp, and threw in a little Bob.
You know, he's got this.
He's got a little band.
When it's just two, Dr.
Howell.
The Minoan pinheads or something like that, the casket basket.
Variance of two doesn't qualify to be described as way, way two.
What are you talking about?
I wasn't paying any attention to you.
We weren't paying any attention to you either.
I didn't know that.
We were just having a sidebar discussion about what constitutes a sizable variance in a normal distribution.
When approximated.
When approximated.
When it is a casual conversation between gentlemen.
You actually...
Right.
We wondered where two fit into that.
The number two...
That's where you get things that are vague, and yet when you consider them specific, like a couple is always two.
Right.
Then it's a few, three, you know.
I don't think a few can be more than four.
How much is a bunch?
A bunch can't be more than five.
A bunch, I think...
Oh, it can be a dozen.
Nine.
Nine could be a bunch.
Then a dozen is six.
Oh, a dozen is a dozen.
How much is too much?
Not enough.
Not enough.
There's only one answer to that.
How much is too much?
There is no answer.
Bob is not even the answer.
And neither is anything else.
Too much is not enough.
For some individuals.
For some individuals.
For some individuals.
For some individuals.
For some individuals.
shows Eye of the Beholder, written by St. Rod Silling, with music by St. Bernard Herman.
You may have noticed that I'm on a slight Twilight Zone care. Before that clip, besides
live X-Day Hours of Slack, we had a collage by Heart Ignition, and before that, several
by The Large. This would be a good place to mention that many of the X-Day preachers and
bands will be at the big sub-genius show in New York City, Pastoria actually, on October
9th. I'll be there to sermonize, meet and greet, and accept ticking, smoking gifts,
only to find out...
That's a damnable blog hemp!
That's what happened to the show yesterday.
The blog started.
I'm glad you did mix the tech in there, that makes me feel more at home.
Yeah, it makes you feel like you're bopping in the black room.
Rock desert, no water, no food, no shade, a horrible headache, a slight overdose.
Well, I'm ready for that.
Or just imagine at night...
I'd rather be ready.
No thanks, Dr. Howell.
There's sound coming toward you from all directions.
You're stuck.
Melding into a verbal of electronic beble babble.
He who smelt it dealt it.
Susie the floozy donated this to our enterprise.
I know.
By not accepting it, you reject...
Her corrupting element.
By not accepting it, you reject the inculcated principles of dogs.
Oh, well, I guess if somebody offered me a chance to jump off a cliff, then I wouldn't
want to make them feel insulted by not jumping off the cliff.
Is that right?
That's right.
Your leadership skills would make us come right behind you.
You're the first lemur who jumps.
They arranged the bottom of the cliff with those soft mattresses and large chocolate
eclairs.
Right.
Because the...
Because at least the first 10 or 15 people make it softer for the next 10 or 15, right?
I was shipwrecked in the desert in a land ship.
And I was thrown off the pool deck when we crunched.
I thought I was going to die as I was hurtling through the air.
I actually thought, well, this is the way I die on this weird land ship out in the desert.
But, of course, I did not die because I landed on somebody nice and soft.
I had a...
They died, but he didn't.
I had at least one near death.
Princess, we and I were pretty certain we were faced with near death out at Burning
Man when the Argentinians who had the anti-Pope mobile, had a flamethrower mounted on the
front.
It was like...
Try to envision two or three station wagons stacked atop each other and welded together.
And what we're sitting on as a passenger seat is the propane tank that is fueling...
the damn flamethrower.
And you're supposed to pump it.
And it's like you're sitting on a bomb.
And why did we find ourselves sitting on a bomb?
Because it's fun.
Because it's praised Argentinians.
Fun.
Because they wanted to trade us something for LSD.
Yeah.
We didn't even know what it was.
So on the way back, we're riding on a bomb being driven by guys tripping their asses
off.
On LSD.
And, oh, and they let us work the flamethrower.
You know what?








You can't imagine how much fun it is.
The burners are even dumber than the Bobs of X-Day.
You pull up behind this couple who are like in your way of your flame-throwing, huge,
noisy, army tank-like vehicle, and they don't hear you.
So you go...
The Argentinians, go ahead, run the flamethrower.
Get those assholes out of the way.
It's a flame-powered horn.
So you blast them in the butt with this gout of flame.
And like cattle, they slowly turn around and notice, oh, there's a flamethrower.




Oh, there's a flamethrower.
Are we in your way?
We're blocking this giant, deadly vehicle.
Of course, don't forget that it was on a playa that's about two miles wide.
And if somebody happens to be in your way, it's only because they were in your sights.
Well, yeah.
No, this is like driving down those primitive streets like an old Western movie lined with
tents.
And naked people.
How come more people come to Burning Man than X-Day, Dr. Drummond?
Yes, Dr. Drummond.
It's closer.
Closer to what?
It's about in the middle of the damn desert.
I don't know.
I mean, we can join Sherman seven minutes from here.
Folks, it's easy in X-Day.
You've got vegetation.
You've got life.
You've got shade.
You've got water.
How come Dragon Con is bigger than X-Day?
That's all indoors and air conditioned.
Well, there's your answer right there.
It has air conditioning.
How come X-Day is bigger than X-Day Europe when it's in Amsterdam?
Yeah.
I never got that one.
I never got that one either.
Maybe because the Europeans are better educated than we are.
Instead of getting high, I get with Jesus.
He turned the water into wine, but I turn the wine back into water.
If you want to get high, then that's a big lie.
You can get with God.
Don't be a fraud.
Jesus is king, so ding-a-ling.
If you don't like my song, then you are wrong because it's about staying straight.
So don't be late.
You don't need crack to be a king.
You don't need to be on the right track.
You just need fun and be number one.
Don't do drugs.
Don't do drugs.
Don't do drugs.
Enough of this bullsh-t.
Let's go get high.
From PR News in Washington, I'm taking the threats seriously.
The United Nations has been a source of the threat for the past decade.
The United Nations says it will continue to provide explosive devices for terror attacks against Canadian flood victims in Pakistan despite violent threats from the pivot points in Texas if it were to go ahead.
U.N. spokesman P.J. Crowley said the U.S. and other countries could resort to violence because of the presence of some of its jets.
You're listening to PR.
PR News.
When President Obama delivers an address next week, he will make the point that U.S. efforts will be moving to the war off the coast of Gaza.


Greenland.
Greenland's minister in charge of Britain's prime minister says Greenland is huge, offering no explanation.
Obama spokesman Bill Burton says the president also wants to thank abroad.
If he can prove he is indigent.
American Airlines says it will find a $22 fine levied by the Federal Routine Maintenance Administration in connection with charges the carrier failed to conduct necessary routine maintenance on PR News in Washington.
There are many others who share your misfortune.

Now I'll tell you the reason you came
I'll tell you the reason
Though you won't admit it
To yourself
Now it's my turn to ask
What might that be?
I don't fit your formulae
Somewhere along the line
There's been a deviation from the norm
Your state has everything categorized
Indexed, tagged
You are the strength
People like me are the weakness
You control and order and dictate
And my kind merely follow and obey
But something's gone wrong, hasn't it?
I don't fit, do I?
Yes, you fit, Mr. Wordsworth
In a few moments
You'll be cringing and pleading
Just like they all do
Oh, yes, indeed, you fit
Guess we all have our little secrets
Down with that
Yeah, we sure do
Of course, I read about yours
On the internet
What?
Oh, I know all about the cocks
In your in-house
Oh, God
Bobby, you're thinking about
How to make a girl blush
Yeah, well, I gotta
The subgenius power of
Splashing
Now you know you can't expect
To live any kind of life
Among normal people
Friends, let's face it
Not everybody has what it takes
To be a subgenius
Well, we met the Euro
For one thing, not everybody
Can actually read anymore
So that cuts out a certain number of them
At least four of us today
For example, I met
Reverend Plastic Mediator
A wonderful European
Or rather, British subgenius
We'll show this lunatic
Who's born and raised
In the world of the pro-profit
We met an interesting group
Of subs in that Amsterdam tour
This is a brochure
From the Amsterdam tour
Right here, I believe
Oh, from the French line
You want to take the French line
I hear screams
Through Poseidon's playground
Nothing's new like Chevy's new
I see some pyres burning
In the horizon, Stank
Pyres of fires
Oh, they're necklacing
Another disbeliever over there
Well, I don't know




There's some horrid hostiles here
That get a little bit too carried away
It's kind of like
Well, if you don't
We must save you or kill you
They take that real seriously
And when they try to get somebody
To praise Bob
And pay their 30 bucks
The guy goes
Oh, that's real funny
But no, I don't think
I'm going to spend my 30 bucks
They really do kill the person
Now, how are we going to get
30 bucks out of him anytime?
And once they do that
That just doesn't make any sense
Case in point
A minister
A minister would tell us
That his function is that of preaching
The word of God
And of course it follows
That since the state has proven
That there is no God
That would make the function of a minister
Somewhat academic as well
There is a God
You are in error
Mr. Wordsworth
There is no God
The state
Has proven
That there is no God
You cannot erase God
With an edict
You are obsolete
Mr. Wordsworth
A lie
No man is obsolete
You have no function
Mr. Wordsworth
You're an anachronism
Like a ghost
From another time
I am nothing more
Than a reminder to you
That you cannot destroy truth
By burning pages
You're a bug
Mr. Wordsworth
A crawling insect
An ugly
Misfortune
A little creature
Who has no purpose here
No meaning
I am a human being
You're a librarian
Mr. Wordsworth
You're a dealer in books
And two-cent fines
And pamphlets
And closed stacks
And the musty insides
Of a language factory
That spews out meaningless words
On an assembly line
Words, Mr. Wordsworth
That have no substance
And no dimension
Like air
Like the wind
Like a vacuum
That you may believe
Has an existence
By scribbling index numbers
On little cards
I don't care
I tell you, I don't care
I'm a human being
I exist
And if I speak one thought aloud
That thought lives
Even after I'm shoveled
Into my grave
Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth
Delusions
That you inject
Into your veins
With printer's ink
The narcotics
That you call literature
The Bible
Poetry
Essays of all kind
All of it
An opiate
To make you think
You have a strength
When you have no strength at all
You have nothing but
Spindly limbs and a dream
And the state has no use for your kind
You are a lie
No man is a
Who are you people anyway?
What is this state?
Who makes all these rules
And traditions
And statutes
The people who are different
Have to stay away from the people
Who are normal
This state isn't God, Doctor
This state is not God
It hasn't the right to penalize somebody
For an accident of birth
It hasn't the right to make ugliness a crime
Miss Tyler, stop this immediately
Friends, have you been singled out due to your mutation?
The conspiracy plunging its filthy claws deep into your soul
Wrecking from it the vestige of any individuality
Any potential spark of abnormality
Have you sold your soul to the nine to five demon money handlers?
Suffering epiwems of sadistic,
The














Jack holes giving undeserved authority over your mind and pocketbook
Taking all the credit for your hard work
You feel yourself being drugged down into the depths of the conspiracy machine
Feeling yourself being pulverized into a quivering pile of pink shit
Friends, we have suffered this torment
Yes friends, we too are slowly being lulled into the glazed eyes block of sheeple
Blissfully bleeding away
Being led to the slaughterhouse
If you are not a human being, you are not a human being
Not for Bob!
Grave Bob!
Friends, do you have what it takes to follow the path of least resistance?
To bring the salt of the scales into your mind, body and wallet?
Do you have the perfect hate coursing through your veins?
That perfect hatred that knows no color, creed, ideology, sex or sexual orientation?
That verdict contempt for the plague of pink eyed fist lovers dragging you down in the bowels of their self-made position
There is only one way to cleanse the palate of the wretched taste from dealing with the legion of slack-jawed dopey dipshits
Only one path to divine slack in the incautiable death of species waste and the destruction of this planet
And that's J.R. Bob Dove
Grave Bob!
For it was Bob who sold his dollar into God and convinced him it was heaven
For it was Bob who fucked Mother Teresa just because she answered the door
For it was Bob who told Sarah Palin to get that first abortion
Embrace your teachings of Bob
Embrace your abnormality
And never again sell out for a piece of that pink pie my friends
And I ain't talking about the Roman media's wishy-tiny diva
Now let's see if this fucker will work
Keep your fingers crossed!
And your cocks laid!
Baby!
Hey look at the monkey boy with his swagger as he staggers and stumbles his way through the pages of history
Flinging the feces that collect the species of beasties breaking their back for a little false slack
How they made it this far is a mystery
It's even worse than you think
Just a little too deep
Come on let me hear you hate people and your screen!
You wish you'd like to be free
Just a little too deep
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You're so cool that you dream
Just a little too deep
Oh come on the saucers can't fucking hear you people
Come on!
It's even worse than you think
Just a little too deep
Still not loud enough
You're so cool that you dream
Just a little too deep
Don't you ever trust me yet
They're trying
Does the monkey enjoy
All the battles, the bloodies, the bodies of brothers and buddies, barely above the voting age
Humors and attitudes smothered in platitudes
Given just a bit too much latitude
To show you gratitude while throwing you in a cage
It's even worse than you think
Just a little too deep
Turn all the pigs fucking down!
You touch the sides of the drink, you're just a little too mean
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You taste the bullet you drink, you're just a little too mean
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You see the person you think, you're just a little too mean
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
I still ain't convinced you guys are full of hate yet
I still can't fucking hear it, come on man
I wanna feel your hate!
What's wrong with you monkey boy?
Did they fool you once?
They fooled you twice!
I'm sorry, looks like you got fooled again there pal
We smile at your pain and your vein
Who explained the insane campaign to soak your domain in acid rain
And laugh as it all goes straight down the drain
Team First!
You think you're just a little too mean
You're just a little too mean
You let a pest all over the planet, they can have it anyway
You touch the sides of the drink, you're just a little too mean
We'll stop them around a little bit and use them for target practice too, ain't that right man?
You taste the bullet you drink, you're just a little too mean
This is uh, three package warfare, it's the special of the day friend
Team First!
You think you're just a little too mean
Let's hope the X's come to blow all them fuckers away!
Team First!
Oh and with all due respect
They can all kiss my fucking ass
Team First!
You're just a little too mean
Team First!
You're just a little too mean
Team First!
You're just a little too mean
Team First!
You're just a little too mean
I still ain't convinced y'all are full of hatred but the night is still good
Team First!
You're just a little too mean
Team First!
How'd you know uh...
Tell them who we are man
We are Dr. Knob and the Polishers!
Team First!
Now they're lyin' friends, that was Monkey Hive!
Live at 13X Day
And Monkey Hive being Reverend Suds Pasha and Reverend Gag Hole
They did a truly amazing set
I guess we've had a theme this show
Weirdos vs. Normals
Although really that's our theme every show
Unless you're a complete jerk friend
You shouldn't be ashamed of your weirdness
But should exploit it for fun and profit
Or at least for slack
Here's a good lesson
Uh, there was a reporter for the
Cleveland Scene
He was gonna come over and interview
Actually he was gonna interview Princess Wee
About Starwood
They'd already covered Subgenius
Starwood indeed
Princess Wee was terribly upset
Because our house was a mess
And this reporter, Michael Gill
Was gonna come over
And uh, you know our house is like every other
Subgenius house probably
Used
Now every now and then you'll run into one who's
Like perfectly meticulously neat
Poor bastards
We caught up with Mrs. Stang in her somewhat
Casually decorated house
We never got a chance to clean it up as much as we wanted to
That guy walked in
He was so envious of our house
They've got not one but two bigfoot statues in there
I wish my house was totally full of weird crap like this
Original Zap Comics covers
He didn't notice the dust build up
Or the piles of mayflies under the windows
And the dust was just like
A
A
A
A
A
A
A
A Legal tiger
Thank God
He just بkeys the meat Shawkl
He just hekeys the meat Shawkl
Um

It's a Fu
Oh I did see all that
This is
I will not**
African driver ants.
Beautiful array of
tchotchkes and
gewgaws. Under the
spell of your subgenius germ
plasm. Jack Chick tracks.
You will accumulate. Yeah, Jack
Chick tracks. They count, certainly.
It's mostly for tiny
little figurines. At least in my
subgenius altar. Yeah, that's it. The tiny little figurines.
They're the ones that get you. The plastic
Shoney's big boy. The pipe
that's this long that costs
$2,500. I actually
have one. It's this long.
Here's a spoiler. It's the perfect
part. The tiny spaceship that Wellman
bought a bunch of and gave to a bunch of people.
If a booger picker.
If the subgenius movie
gets made
and isn't a puppet show
but actually a real movie
with a bunch of humans in it. One of the
last images
will be
all the cool
junk of the
subgenius world being
lifted up off of the earth and
sucked into the saucer in this
endless whirlpool of
comic books, video games,
cheap paperbacks, old play
boys, toy
dinosaurs.
Everything in the
Bulldada auction. Bonanza.
The greatest garage sale orgy.
Last Supper
black
light posters.
Black velvet
Elvis paintings. All of that.
Somehow turned into one giant
CGI vortex of
genius.
Think about the poor son of a bitch
will have to scan all of those
images and
Photoshop the background
out so they can be
all after effected up into a huge
mess. You just get the string fairly
tight. Go around it about five times
and then pull it tighter again
and then over. Can you see that?
Over on itself
and Bob's your uncle. There's no
knots there until you get rid of it.
You just pull it again. Slides off.
No knots. Nothing to worry about.
Man.
The planet. Man. The planet.
When we left our friends
Pat, Billy and Jane
we find Billy, Pat and Jane discussing
their honor. Brother, you said it.
But what possible danger
may face Pat, Billy and Jane?
Particularly you two, Billy
and Jane. I'm sorry, Pat.
You do it deliberately.
It's just that I've got a lot on my mind.
Oh, here's the story.
When we left Pat and the two kids, Billy and Jane
I
wanted to talk to you about Billy and Jane.
I think you ought to be aware that they'll stop
at nothing. I didn't want to frighten
you so I pretended it was sabotage.
What happened? I'm afraid we're stuck.
Hello, man planet.
Man planet. Hello,
man planet. Gosh, can't you
think of something pleasant? I wouldn't
be a bit surprised.
Well,
will, or
what?
But first, here is a message man the planet
wants you to hear.
Wherever man the planet threatens the universe
you will find man the planet.
I was, well, I guess
driven by jets along the tops of the dust
the way a sled goes over the dust.
Look at those young children playing catch
with that brain. I would be remiss
if I did not say that. So sweet.
Did not flog this mention. Somebody take a picture of that.
It's my brain.
But we
shall never repent. That's one thing.
We subgeniuses will never
repent. Don't get any dirt on it.
It might not take later
when they replant it.
You want to make sure you can still
wipe off the roots and
you might have to put a little root tone on it
to get it to take again.
Back balm and root tone.
That brain is
not in the condition in which they are
perfused. The guy that left it
tried to put it back but he couldn't make it.
It was already too late.
The wound had closed.
I think we...
The exit wound. We're on this topic
back in our show in
Berkeley a few shows ago
talking about how Frankenstein
removed the brain
and put it in his
creation. His stem.
I mean, where did he cut the stem at?
Well, that's the thing. You cut as far away
as possible because that brain
is not suitable for perfusion.
It's been cut too soon.
There must be a length
of each of the major
motor nerves of the brain
as well as the
chief ganglion
spinal accessory nerve and the spine
itself. In fact,
as Frankenstein knew well
but nobody hardly ever considers
anymore, the brain
so-called only has its
natural organizing mass
there in that familiar organ.
The brain is also
all the rest of the nerves extending
into the body. Anything that can
feel and send back
a signal is a piece of this
complicated neural mechanism
called the brain.
Your brain extends into your fingertips
and your brain
has other parts in your body.
Secret
places that are generally not
known. Like that hidden appendage
you just discovered last week.
I didn't know that was there.
A painful episode.
No wonder they've been laughing
at me behind my back.
Had something to do with that
appendage.
So when you lift out the brain,
you've got to keep it alive during
transit. Also remember they're very
fragile. They're like a meringue.
You can't drop them or
bang them around.
Kicking it will probably
have a negative effect.
Well that one's been street toughened.
The story you have just
heard has changed.
Paul and Myra were tried and convicted
on seven separate counts of receiving
property. In most cases
they were found to be basically good
and they were returned to their homes.
You have just heard the 13th
in a new series of Authentic Files
from Los Angeles.
And now, an important announcement.
And now, speaking in
behalf of the producers, consult your
local newspaper for the new listening time.
We would like to take this opportunity
to thank you for your many kind
letters of encouragement and approval.
Los Angeles Police Department.
The Lone
Incorporated.
The Lone
Incorporated is from the
Lemur Incorporated.
We'll be going now in six or seven minutes.
First I should say that Dragnest,
Man the Planet and our titles are also
by the Lemur Incorporated.
I should also say that on that song
Summer of Yeti Love, the singing was
Pisces, the guitar Reverend Angry Larry
and Reverend Suds, the sax was Philo.
And I thank Reverend Phil on drums.
Another subgenius event is coming up for which I'm going to talk about.
Another subgenius event is coming up for which I'm going to talk about.
This is a great opportunity to get

you don't have to leave your house,
which is good because it's six weeks,
online.
The subgenius cult biz and history online class
at Maybe Logic Academy.
Details on that, X Day and other subgenius radio shows
and books, etcetera, and downloads of all our previous shows
are at our huge website at subgenius.com.
There are also a couple of official Facebook pages
and secret forums and chat rooms.
Well, they were secret.
We'll end with a little more X Day Live
and then finally a song by filmmaker Zandy Smith.
Another Mr. Smith.
And yes, he has a very close relation.
Thanks, Dad.
But first, I have a point of doctrine that hasn't been addressed.
Well, let's get to it.
It's new.
It's new.
You know, we, the evangelicals and so forth talk about faith healing.
Mm-hmm.
And of course, President Bush, former Emperor Bush,
wanted faith-based companies.
And we had figured out that we had a face-based religion.

A face-based religion.
Well, one concept that went right over our heads for a long time
until Reverend E. Vade discovered it was the power of face healing.
It can be done.
By which it's not your face.







It's not the faith in Bob that heals you, but the application of a physical printed
Dobbs head to the afflicted area.
You put Bob's head on the part that hurts, like your nut or your brain.
Apply the Dobbs head to the brain, and that was the idea behind the healing.
Personally, I'm one of those.
Well, you know, if you don't believe in faith healing, you're cut out of an awful lot of
population.
And that's what we нее, in the medical Adding, I mean, the proper application a
person
to faith healing allows you to get the most count out of something instead of building

Okay.
Well, it got outside the borders of health practitioners to help improve the overall



If they can show me the machine that goes ding and the price tag on it, that's going to make me get well faster.
Yeah, yeah.
If you get a million-dollar bill, you know you're going to get well.
The backside of that is you can still get hooked on placebos.
Also, the hospital is a great place to get sick.
Homeopathic medicine is a testimony to that, Doctor.
You endanger yourself.
In the hospital, you can be subjected to disease vectors.
Eatrogenic destruction can be yours in the hospital.
But my dad used to say, if you get sick, don't go to the hospital.
Go to the best hotel in town and check in.
It'll be so much cheaper than the hospital, and you'll get much better service.
A lot of people that go to hospitals die.
That's a known fact, that they go to the hospital, and the next thing you know, they're dead.
Patients check in.
They don't check out.
That's right.
Friends.
Here's a question.
You don't need any of that crap, because Bob is the perfect placebo,
and the conspiracy is the imaginary disease.
Regular placebo.
You think about that.
But now it doesn't make any difference, because it's just a few hours left.
A few sad hours.
Right now.
To shed some final drops.
Probably like only about 11 or 12.
Humanity sins.
We have to reach out to the youth.
It's so hard to reach to the youth.
They move so fast.
Yes.
It's so terribly easy to reach old age.
That's true.
They don't move that fast.
You have been removed from office to feel investigators have declared you obsolete.
Obsolete?
You have disgraced the state.
You have proven yourself a coward.
You have therefore no function.
You are obsolete.
But I'm not.
I'm not obsolete.
You are obsolete.
Obsolete.
Obsolete.
You are obsolete.
Obsolete.
You are obsolete.



I'll make you a terrible state, a tragic tertiary.
I'm not obsolete.
I work for the state.
I help the state.
I help give the state strength.
How can you call me obsolete?
How can you?
I managed to feel investigators have declared you excerpt from explanatory video on the
Glenn Coogan era YouTube video.
It's time to because I've hadmax.
It's dark and it's dreary.
My mom said this to show pass.
And that all sounds cliche, but I don't give a rat's ass.
Who lost you?
We're all on that timeline.
I guess it's a strange thing to hope for.
Oh boy, I hope this one's mine.
Can't look in the mirror.
Gotta pretend I can't hear her.
Kicked a hole in the wall.
Got the things I could do in a bathroom stall.
The worst year.
We're all on that timeline.
It's a strange thing to hope for.
Oh boy, I hope this one's mine.
Feeling pathetic.
Feeling good.
Feeling sad.
Feeling sad.
Alexander.
And his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad.
Psych, this is great.
I'm moving to Australia.
With a loaded .38.
No seriously, this sucks.
I get pretty tired.
Of all of the fucks.
That are trying to tell me.
It'll all be okay.
It's a bad fucking year.
Not a bad fucking day.
The worst year.
We're all on that timeline.
It's a strange thing to hope for.
But boy, I hope this one is mine.
Thank you for watching!


Get us here soon!
