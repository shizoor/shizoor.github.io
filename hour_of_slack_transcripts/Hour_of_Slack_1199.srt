1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait, but you just gotta have another

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,460
Subgenius Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,060
What?

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:23,240
Uh, yes, dear friends, we're working on the Subgenius Online History class at maybelogic.net,

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:34,300
and therefore this Hour of Slack number 1,199 will actually be a rerun of Hour of Slack number 569,

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,920
which is actually a rerun of the ESO Swamp Radio Show from February 27th, 1997.

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,560
What are you?

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,400
Nobody.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,120
Are you blind?

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,700
What are you?

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,960
What are you?

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,880
What manner of beast is that?

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,780
What the hell are you?

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,260
What are you?

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
What are you?

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,440
Every man and woman is a star.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,220
And that's why Dave's head is a glowing gasp.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,860
This bag of flaming hydrogen.

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,680
So it was read, so it was written.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,280
All of their heads were glowing bags of hydrogen.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,860
And they walked around town wearing their bags.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,500
And one little day, one little man said,

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,620
Your head is much bigger than mine.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,680
You must have a much bigger bag.

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,920
Everybody is a star.

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,300
And yes, that man was the mayor of the town.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,300
He had a great yellow giant for a head.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,880
And unfortunately,

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,820
Dave, the village idiot, had what is known as a dwarf star for a head.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,940
In fact, it had collapsed so suddenly and compacted so tremendously,

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,480
that it, although it had not quite formed a black hole,

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,320
the density of the head of Dave,

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,960
you know, every man and woman is a star.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,340
Dave was a dwarf star.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,500
Well, one square, oh,

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,780
a millimeter or so of the interior of Dave's head

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,960
was of such a dense molecular,

38
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,380
a densely packed molecular structure

39
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,120
that that tiny, tiny fragment would be heavy enough on our planet

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,960
that if you dropped it, it would bore its way all the way to the center of the earth.

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,360
This is why Dave was not allowed in most towns.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,740
His head being altogether heavier than the most,

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
his head being a little bit more than the size of the nearby planets,

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:02,980
his presence tended to cause disruptions in the orbits of other inhabited star systems,

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,520
other planets that might have even cities and old civilizations that had lasted for thousands of years.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,920
Merely the gravitational waves caused by the thickness of Dave's skull

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,980
would destroy and wipe out these entire civilizations.

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,220
Oh, man.

49
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,380
And that's why when Dave would beg for a dollar for a bottle of beer,

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,400
most people in town would go ahead and give him the dollar.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,240
Hey man, spare change, buddy?

52
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,800
What the hell are you?

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,760
Because every time he got a headache, there was a...

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh, man, everybody's got some kind of personal deformity.

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,420
So my bag's a little bigger than yours, you know?

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,260
And what's the difference between helium and hydrogen?

57
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,040
My fucking corpus callosum, excuse my language.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,080
Oh, my God, it's not even 12 o'clock.

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,440
The townsfolk and the other planets,

60
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,700
civilized galactic federations and so forth,

61
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,220
had to pretty much put up with Dave

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,580
because whenever he got a headache, it would cause earthquakes in their capital city.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
Oh, my tylenol's doing nothing.

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,920
This X-Axepin's doing nothing.

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,860
This Aspen's just doing nothing.

66
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,920
This old Indian herbal extract ain't doing nothing, man.

67
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,480
I feel like my skull is spinning.

68
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,580
I feel like the weight of the universe is expanding out through my very, very, very, very...

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,460
Don't even look at me.

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,960
Did you ever feel that way, Fran?

71
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,160
Did you ever feel like the...

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,920
The problems of the world were weighing down on you so much

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,960
that your head was self-collapsing into dwarf star density?

74
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,840
Have you ever felt that way?

75
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,800
Well, if you haven't, then you're probably not a subgenius.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
It's so dense in here.

77
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,280
You lucky bastard.

78
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,600
It's just like the yolk of an egg.

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,340
Or she-bastard. What did I forget?

80
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,980
You can't say she-bastard.

81
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,340
She-bastard.

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,820
It's like a little psychic yellow of an egg in here.

83
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,260
It keeps me warm. It keeps me nurtured.

84
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,480
And that's all I need. I am a star.

85
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,720
See, everybody's brain...

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

87
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,960
I don't need those people. I don't need to drink Tylenol.

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,180
I don't need to snort that stuff.

89
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm different than that. I'm going here. I'm back.

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,020
We've taken good care to raise you up here, Dave.

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,340
Oh, by the way, Dave, Dave, there's something we needed to...

92
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,680
It's a pair of shoes.

93
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,020
Dave, there's something... I hate to interrupt your...

94
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,480
You.

95
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,320
Your fun little monologue there, but...

96
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,320
You've heard about cloning and so forth and the replaceable body parts and...

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,320
Well, you actually, Dave, are the clone of a master, Dave,

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,440
who is a very rich, powerful man who happens to have just destroyed his liver through hard drink

99
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,980
and it's time for his replacement liver.

100
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,300
And yes, you were cloned from him and have been raised as a poor, pathetic street...

101
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,000
Why, no.

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,080
Just kept alive. You and several other clones.

103
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,080
Several of the others have already been used for other parts.

104
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
Dave, I'm afraid your life is...

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,040
The goal of your life has come around.

106
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,820
It's time for you to give up that which you were bred for, which in this case is your liver.

107
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,580
Wait a minute.

108
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,760
Isn't cloning wonderful?

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,000
Wait a second.

110
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,180
Too bad nobody cloned you, eh, Dave?

111
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,560
Wait a minute.

112
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,800
You love the rich Dave. He looks just like you.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
And runs General Motors now, I think.

114
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,300
What? Now, wait a minute.

115
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,140
I don't know whether I'm having a psychic echo spasm or if all I have is some kind of coronal license here.

116
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,260
I'm so on the corner and I'm panhandling and I see your voice that say I'm cloned from somebody else who's rich and powerful.

117
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,480
And come on out from behind there.

118
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,360
My little leg yoke protects me.

119
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,380
My little helium hydrogen exchange key.

120
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,860
How could it break into here?

121
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,940
Hey, where'd it go?

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
Hey, little voice. Little garbage can.

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,420
Come back here.

124
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,520
Man, nobody around here.

125
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,240
Yoo-hoo.

126
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,140
Maybe I was just sucking a weird dream or something.

127
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
I gotta stop doing them methamphetamines.

128
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,940
I'm just ripping my brain apart.

129
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,700
I gotta stop snorting gasoline.

130
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,080
I gotta stop licking the bottoms of these allspice.

131
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,000
I gotta stop shaking up my nail clippings and my underchees and re-spooking them.

132
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,100
I gotta do something, man.

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,780
Maybe it's a self-concussive realization.

134
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,500
Maybe it wasn't a little voice.

135
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,420
Maybe I am cloned from some rich and powerful person.

136
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,060
I could take over the church of the subgenius, man.

137
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,740
And make a lucrative mullah.

138
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,080
Yeah, I'll be standing on top of everything.

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,920
I could topple a little paddy giant.

140
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,220
And a little tyrant.

141
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,260
And a little two-boots wherever I'm staying.

142
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,520
It's weird how these little voices in my head always sound like him.

143
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,460
Well, gentlemen, as you can see by our subject, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

144
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,040
the syringe implantable transponder works beautifully.

145
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,760
He seems to think that there are voices in his head.

146
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,200
In this case, my voice was used, of course, as the project chief.

147
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,200
But it is amazing, is it not, gentlemen,

148
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,240
that our General Electric tiny microchip,

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,740
the size of a grain of rice placed underneath his skin,

150
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,500
injected with a syringe,

151
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,640
a vaccination in his childhood,

152
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,820
has allowed us to dictate as voices in his head his entire life.

153
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,620
You know, there's no difference in principle, gentlemen,

154
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,960
between being forced to carry a microchip in your plastic card in your wallet

155
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,020
or the little pellet that we put in Dave's teeth.

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,140
The principle that Big Sister has the right to track you is inherent in both.

157
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,640
And the only difference is a layer of skin.

158
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
Or in Dave's case, a skull.

159
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,700
A very, very thick layer of bony carapace.

160
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,360
Uh, Doctor...

161
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,920
Let's turn the voices back on.

162
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,560
Yes, yes.

163
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,300
I've noticed in the literature...

164
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,160
Yes, Doctor Bronner.

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,540
I've read all of your papers,

166
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,880
and I am quite convinced that what you have done to this man is a remarkable disservice.

167
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,900
I see in here a picture, a perfect example of a man whose personality,

168
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,520
which was not in a good shape to begin with,

169
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,220
has been totally destroyed.

170
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,120
But what, you expect us...

171
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
Immersed in your faulty world religion.

172
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
You expect us to experiment on animals?

173
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,460
Just a minute, Doctor, I...

174
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,800
Poor innocent animals? Why not use these...

175
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,200
I agree.

176
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,360
Dave volunteered for this thing. We're poor.

177
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,280
I see nowhere in the transcript you have given me an example of Dave ever giving his permission,

178
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,180
written or otherwise, for you to conduct this experiment on him.

179
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,020
It seems totally remarkable to me how a man of your stature could conduct such an experiment

180
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,980
and receive grants and so much money to do it.

181
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,460
Well, Doctor...

182
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,600
Doctor Bronner, I think you've heard the expression,

183
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,640
if you're going to make an omelette,

184
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,980
you have to break a few eggs.

185
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,720
Uh, I don't see...

186
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,320
I mean, to a certain extent, this Dave, lonesome cowboy Dave character,

187
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,460
is little more than a human egg, an omelette,

188
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,960
so to speak, bubbling on the hot sidewalk of life.

189
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,660
How could you call a human being a fellow human being?

190
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
He's not a human being.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
He's a subgenius.

192
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm sorry, but your rules don't apply to us.

193
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,200
Doctor Stein, I agree with your work.

194
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,900
Can I say one word?

195
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,660
Yes, Doctor.

196
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,660
I appreciate what you have been doing the last few years,

197
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,540
especially, I mean, Mark, with your work with lonesome cowboy Dave

198
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,760
and other people, Einstein, Secret Orchestra,

199
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,980
they take the whole Cleveland project.

200
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,420
I would like to know if you can help me,

201
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,060
find a possible backup grant for...

202
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,540
I have a similar project, a hot shoe project.

203
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,480
I would like to do a similar size city in southern Japan.

204
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,060
Oh, well, I'll tell you the investment opportunities,

205
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
if you will connect...

206
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,980
Of course, I assume there's fetus research in your country?

207
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,120
Probably considerable amount of fetus organ trade going on there?

208
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,100
Yes, I have no problem with human donor.

209
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,200
Have you also considered genetic cloning research,

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
cloning research for...

211
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Well, that's another thing.

212
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,260
Doctor Bronner there was quite out of line complaining about

213
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,200
a so-called human being, even if Dave were a human being.

214
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,060
This is a clone of a human being.

215
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,920
The original Dave, the Master Dave, sitting over here to my right.

216
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,340
Yes, that's a very nice tie you have there, Captain Dave.

217
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,260
Thanks for having me.

218
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,880
The Master Dave there, obviously,

219
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,460
was born with the same rights according to human being or a subtenuous.

220
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,660
His clone, however, I mean, he's a human being,

221
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,820
how can one person have more than one set of rights?

222
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,640
So, therefore, the clone, being more or less the same person,

223
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,460
is going to have to find his own set of rights.

224
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,240
Ivan, do you mind if I get a little personal postulation in here?

225
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,720
I want to show a little of my own perspective,

226
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,300
after all, being the clone donor.

227
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,020
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is not a human being in the same way

228
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:11,200
you or I would call, say perhaps, the Reverend Hare or Dr. Sagamoto a human being.

229
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,700
He's an experiment conducted by the church

230
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,680
to re-incur the reprogramming of thousands more people

231
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,880
and to stop this X-Day thing that we've all been talking about.

232
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,780
That's all I have to say about it.

233
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,520
Dr. Broder can complain all he wants,

234
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,320
but the process has been set in motion.

235
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,920
Dave is contagious everywhere he goes in the city of Cleveland.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,240
We're going to see the same progress in the disease,

237
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
the virus, if you want to call it a disease.

238
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
We like to think of it as a new...

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,540
Oh, just some...

240
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,820
We're adding some artistic details to the fabric of human reality.

241
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,540
That's all.

242
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,600
We're just doing a little window dressing,

243
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,540
improving on God's handiwork.

244
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,660
Why not?

245
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
God gave us that right, did he not?

246
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,020
He made us as unto gods.

247
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,160
Every man and woman is a star, I believe.

248
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,420
Our secret leader, Aleister Crowley Hubbard, once said...

249
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,500
I remember us sitting there, Parsons at that nudist...

250
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Oh, yes, yes, sir.

251
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,360
Dr. Stefano Grappelli of the Institute of Psychic Research in Rome.

252
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,780
I was wondering if you found any sort of repercussion

253
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,760
with the Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

254
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,540
perhaps any psychic example of violence or trouble with police

255
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,120
or such psychological...

256
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,500
There was...

257
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,800
Yes, yes, I'm glad that you asked that question.

258
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,400
There was an extremely unusual side effect.

259
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,820
The treatment by which whenever Dave would sneeze,

260
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,500
plates, for instance, in the kitchen would fly across the room,

261
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,600
jump off the shelves and smash against the opposite wall.

262
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,280
One time we were in the front office

263
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,660
and the files flew out of the file cabinet drawers every time Dave sneezed.

264
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,140
Of course, we had to put him down whenever he was around

265
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,360
any kind of expensive equipment.

266
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,420
Out on the street, most people hardly noticed there's so much violence,

267
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,380
mugging down there on the levels.

268
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
The level where he...

269
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,680
where the experiments are usually conducted.

270
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,920
Petri dish one, you know, the sidewalk.

271
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,860
I would like to ask a question also of you.

272
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,280
I am from the Institute of Moscow.

273
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,420
I won't need to mention the name of the Institute.

274
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm familiar with the parapsychological research I've been doing.

275
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,400
Oh, yes, comrade.

276
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,680
I would like to say that after the...

277
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,100
the re-programming will be a whole different situation in the former Soviet Union

278
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,020
and the Commonwealth of all of the states will be involved in...

279
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,280
and after what you have said,

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,500
re-programming, making people more malleable, pliable,

281
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,720
we'll find have to a different problem.

282
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,920
Is there some way we can use your research

283
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,760
and perhaps make the whole of former Soviet Union similar in the...

284
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,420
Well, comrade, as you know, Dobbs Co. is marketing the, as we call it,

285
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,100
the electronic leash of these implantable biochips

286
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,500
to be any corporate or governmental entity.

287
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,280
We'd happily assist.

288
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,800
Of course, our microchips do have the Dobbs trademark built in,

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,820
so that although they...

290
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,800
the subject's allegiance will be up to the choice of the corporation or governmental entity,

291
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,300
nevertheless, as you can certainly understand,

292
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,300
it's sort of like the Coca-Cola company is going to sell Coke in Russia.

293
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,100
That's fine, but they're going to have their logo on it.

294
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,940
Well, your people will be mind controlled according to your plans.

295
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,700
However, they will respond to the smiling face image of Bob.

296
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,660
That, comrade, that would be very... that is fine with us.

297
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,300
Thank you very much for answering this one.

298
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,060
And as we said, these computer chips will link the individual...

299
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,240
up to a vast computer database,

300
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,900
so that we can, in fact, follow the subject

301
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,040
and follow their spending, their voting habits,

302
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,380
pretty much their sexual habits up to a point.

303
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,580
We can, in fact, dictate their sexual habits

304
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,600
through the voice in the head technique.

305
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,900
We have had some subjects,

306
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,640
they get their ideas from the movies or comic books or something,

307
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,100
they pull all their teeth out,

308
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,040
so as they think that this will silence them,

309
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,020
we can use the silent radio in their head, of course,

310
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,240
that does affect the resonance,

311
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,680
and we have to increase the amplification

312
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,280
when they pull out all of their teeth,

313
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
but it's rather pointless to tell the truth.

314
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,000
It's sad.

315
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,840
I've noticed Dave down there is bleeding at the mouth,

316
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,360
the one down on the sidewalk,

317
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,280
not the one here in the boardroom, certainly.

318
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,220
I don't think we're getting enough...

319
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,200
Can you enhance this picture somehow

320
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,240
so we can all see it a little better

321
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,520
and bring up the volume somehow a little bit?

322
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,060
Yeah, zoom in on screen three there, Weldon.

323
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,180
If you pull in close, now you'll see

324
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,420
Dave yanked all his teeth out with those pliers

325
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,300
and has thrown them down in the gutter

326
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,400
where our servo robots have retrieved them

327
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,500
for the master Dave here in case he ever needs a new pole.

328
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't know what I'm doing to myself.

329
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,440
Man, the other day I started beating myself in the face

330
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,060
with a hammer for no apparent reason.

331
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,260
And here I am pulling out a moment.

332
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,160
Dave, Dave, we're back.

333
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,760
It didn't do you any good.

334
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,480
You pulled your teeth out for nothing, Dave.

335
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,200
You're an idiot, Dave.

336
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,400
You didn't love Bob enough, Dave.

337
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,440
Listen to this, you guys.

338
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,380
He'll believe anything.

339
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,220
Dave, you sinned.

340
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,220
You pulled out all your teeth for nothing.

341
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,260
That looked stupid as well as I thought it was stupid.

342
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,720
I ain't never gonna find me a day like this.

343
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,440
I'm gonna make a new wife.

344
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Bob will be my wife.

345
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,240
But don't cry, Dave.

346
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,660
Bob has a new job for you.

347
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,060
He has a new bride for you, Dave.

348
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,000
Bob has brought you a new bride.

349
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,500
See that goat over there in that pen?

350
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,860
That she-goat over in that pen, that's your new wife, Dave.

351
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,140
That's Hogan's goat.

352
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,720
You are the husband of Hogan's she-goat.

353
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,700
Last night you told me that was some kind of wife.

354
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,040
That weird goat they was gonna clone.

355
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,380
And then you said it was the goat that was using to catch nerve gas.

356
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,340
And now you're telling me it's my wife?

357
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,260
I thought it was gonna get me a nice six foot or seven yeti woman.

358
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,040
Let's go, no, I'm so confused.

359
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,040
Do you have a problem with the goat, Dave?

360
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,660
Would you rather us pick you another wife?

361
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,180
How about this giant, this gigantic eyebrow mantis?

362
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,980
An eyebrow mantis?

363
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,620
Man, I can't see it in my mind's left eye stroke.

364
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,180
The eyebrow mantis slide into his retina.

365
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,700
There, okay, he should be seeing the, uh, the giant eyebrow mantis.

366
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,420
What the hell is that thing?

367
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,460
Turn the erection knob up to ten.

368
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,900
He's terrified of the mantis and at the same time he's sexually aroused.

369
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,640
Oh my god, get that thing away from me.

370
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,940
This always fuses.

371
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,560
This always fuses the daylight challenge.

372
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,280
I'll bet you're a Leo.

373
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,920
I'll get away, get away from me.

374
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,820
Oh my god, hey, uh, hey.

375
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,840
And so you see, gentlemen, not only is the experiment a...

376
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,340
Oh, get away, get away.

377
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,820
As you can see, gentlemen, the experiment is not only a success but a lot of fun for we researchers.

378
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,980
You can pull the strings of the subject as if he were a little puppet dancing down there on that hot sidewalk in the inner city,

379
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,920
surrounded by the broken beer bottles and the other bums and losers.

380
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:14,380
While we up here in our skyscraper sitting at our computer keyboards may make him jerk and twitch our own little pathetic marionette, isn't he?

381
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:22,520
And so he suspects, of course, in fact he knows perfectly well his state, station, and life.

382
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,960
That's what religion is for, boys.

383
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,900
Praise Bob, eh?

384
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,760
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

385
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,320
And thank you for the excellent demonstration and quite an illuminating slideshow it was.

386
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,200
Now, what I think...

387
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Will you take credit cards?

388
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,300
Well, I think that's what we're all asking right now.

389
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,560
What will the next project be and how much do you need?

390
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,940
All I need is to fill the receptor holes, my friend.

391
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, you ask me what I need.

392
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,560
I just need to fill those receptor holes.

393
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,000
They used to be so full, those holes in my brain.

394
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,700
They had just the perfect molecule fit right into that little locked place.

395
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,660
Now...

396
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,420
The brain holes.

397
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,740
The brain holes.

398
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,160
The brain holes are empty.

399
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,620
The brain holes are empty tonight.

400
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,060
The brain's gonna have to make its own molecule.

401
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,340
The moon is shining.

402
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,760
My eyes are bright but...

403
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,460
The brain holes.

404
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,340
The molecule is gone.

405
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,620
You look pretty sharp.

406
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,940
You look pretty cute.

407
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,160
But you ain't going nowhere in that brain hole.

408
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,820
Soon you're gonna...

409
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,520
My best.

410
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,460
My best.

411
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,420
You say you look so cute in that brand new suit.

412
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,840
You think you got some place to go.

413
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,840
You ain't going nowhere, so just sit down in the chair and let Bob Dobbs tell you the truth.

414
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,560
Bob Dobbs...

415
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,560


416
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,600
The truth.

417
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,560
Bob Dobbs...

418
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,560
I told you when you were 10, and I told you when you were 12,

419
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,340
and I told you as you were coming on.

420
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,440
When you look, scourge, my son, think of that glimmering pipe.

421
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,500
So my work will be done.

422
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,080
I'm leaving soon, I am.

423
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,320
There is a great mesh in your brain.

424
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,320
And this mesh is composed of tiny holes, and these holes have a certain shape.

425
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:15,080
Those are receptor holes, and they're responsible for your sense of self and well-being and pleasure.

426
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,780
There's a certain shape of a molecule.

427
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,020
That'll fall into those receptor holes and make you feel real good.

428
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:35,640
And that shape is a shape, oddly enough, of what looks to us just like a common pipe.

429
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,680
Like a Dr. Grabow pipe.

430
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,760
If you can find some way to get tiny pipe-shaped molecules to fill those receptor holes

431
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,060
inside that vacant mesh in your head,

432
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,080
well, you'll probably feel so much better that you'll be able to do better on the job,

433
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,160
get a better job, become like a great stock whiz or something,

434
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,040
and get rich overnight on some great idea, perfect vision.

435
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,320
So, of course, at this point you're asking,

436
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,860
Hey man, where can I get some of them pipe-shaped molecules?

437
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Is it like a pill, or is it something you smoke?

438
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,060
Hey Bernice, I just wanted to try this.

439
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,320
Look what I got at the pharmacological lab.

440
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,560
What is it? What is it?

441
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,780
Well, it's not a pill, and it's not a pipe.

442
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,220
You place it in your third eye.

443
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,220
It's the virtual, hard noise trial of the, the, the, the...

444
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,040
I'm gonna try it. Let's make a few.

445
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
It's the Emperor's new pipe.

446
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,920
And turn on that radio.

447
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,720
You just, here.

448
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,140
Let me try that.

449
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,720
You see this thing that I'm holding in my hand?

450
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,580
It's real, King.

451
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:47,920
Yeah.

452
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,720
There's nothing really in my hand, but it's a virtual pipe.

453
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,760
There is no virtual in that pipe.

454
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,380
Hey man, let's all, like, smoke some of what's in this pipe in my hand.

455
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,680
Oh yeah, yeah man, I see that pipe in your hand.

456
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,320
Yeah, let me have some of that virtual...

457
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,840
Oh, whoa!

458
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,980
Whoa!

459
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:17,780
I tried marijuana one time, and I tried LSD, and I tried bananas mixed with Coca-Cola and aspirin, but...

460
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,620
Man, and Jimson weed and NyQuil, but...

461
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,340
Whoa, this virtual pipe.

462
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh man, I am going inside.

463
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,660
Oh, far in.

464
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,380
The pipe is feeling real, man. The pipe is feeling real. It's pointing.

465
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm like caved in.

466
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm caved in, man. I'm caved in.

467
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,500
The pipe is so deep, I'm, I'm like a... I am speed-lunkin', dude.

468
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,940
Help, help.

469
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,420
I am like in the magma.

470
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,040
Help. Oh, help, sir.

471
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,520
Magma city!

472
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,020
Oh, sir, my lungs are crushed.

473
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,220
Man, I feel that pressure.

474
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,900
No, no, the magma of the Pipe Cathedral has...

475
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,400
Whoa. I am so low.

476
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,240
...the point is...

477
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,540
I think... Man, I wonder, maybe I'm too low. Maybe I'm getting too deep.

478
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,580
...the line...

479
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,060
The line...

480
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,380
Am I ever gonna come up?

481
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,960
Hey, man, don't come up too fast. Your hand will explode.

482
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,160
You'll get the...

483
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,060
...bens.

484
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,680
...idea.

485
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,360
Whoa.

486
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,420
Get down on your knees.

487
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,460
Wow, these anti-drugs are so much better than those cheap conspiracy street drugs.

488
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:45,060
I don't want to get high anymore. Ever since I learned the word of Bob, I've been ready not only to come back down to Earth,

489
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:58,300
but to go below the sidewalk, below the sewers, below the upper crust, below the lower crust, down all the way.

490
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:08,660
Yeah, I've learned how to go down since I gave up those getting high kind of drugs. Bob's dragging me all the way down.

491
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,900
Oh, the pressure's getting... getting...

492
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,120
...louder.

493
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,800
It's getting really, really hot down here.

494
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,240
You know when Bob's taking me high.

495
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,100
You know when I'm...

496
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,540
I'm digging it. It's really hot.

497
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,440
What are these... these flames?

498
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,540
Somehow they're not consuming my flesh, but yet they're burning.

499
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,960
Fleshier, fleshier...

500
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,740
Whoa. Wow, this is...

501
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,180
...skin...

502
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,700
These Bob pills and this virtual Bob pipe, this stuff's really intense.

503
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,760
...illuminate...

504
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,380
I'm like having a before-death experience.

505
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,860
I'm having an... an out-of-inside-planet experience.

506
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,260
Man, I think I am too... too low. I... I probably need to come back up.

507
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,780
Hey, man, is there anything I can take to counteract this non-drug that I didn't take?

508
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,940
Hey, hey, hey, ref. What are you doing here, man? Crouched on the floor.

509
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,160
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

510
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,340
Isn't this the coolest club you ever been in? Oh, man, I already had three multigasers, and I don't even know what the hell that is.

511
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,660
Yeah, this stuff's great.

512
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,840
Yeah, whatever it is.

513
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,780
It's free, too.

514
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,180
Yeah, where'd he get it?

515
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,840
Oh, free.

516
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,320
From Bob?

517
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,240
Bob?

518
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,800
Well, I mean, it's free once you join up, you know.

519
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,660
Well, this guy charged me 15 bucks for one hit. He tell me it's free once I joined up?

520
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,020
Jeez, man.

521
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,080
Well, you're joined up. Now, here, take...

522
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,300
So I'm coming joined up.

523
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,040
...the pipe in my hand, my little...

524
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,000
There's not really a pipe in his hand.

525
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah.

526
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,440
But they believe there is a pipe in his hand.

527
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,180
Oh, I see it, man.

528
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,420
See the pipe? Here, take my pipe, Dave.

529
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,060
Okay, man.

530
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,100
And have a big hit of what's in that pipe.

531
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,620
Okay.

532
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,240
There is no pipe, and there is nothing in the pipe.

533
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:52,200
But the placebo effect is so much more powerful than any real drug that the subgenius victim

534
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,360
is now becoming so low, so in there...

535
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,660
Oh, wow.

536
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,020
...that it is as if he is looking up from eight feet underground.

537
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,280
I feel like they're made of mush.

538
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,100
300 pounds of mush.

539
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,680
He feels like he's laying at the bottom of a hole.

540
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,460
One.

541
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,620
Two.

542
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


543
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


544
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


545
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


546
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


547
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:25,820
Eight.

548
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:25,820


549
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Ten.

550
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,200
11.

551
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,220
11.

552
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,400
12.

553
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,340
13.

554
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,340


555
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,340


556
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,360


557
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,620
17.

558
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:31,740
18.

559
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:31,960
19.

560
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,560
20.

561
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:32,940
21.

562
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,240
22.

563
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,540
23.

564
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:33,540


565
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:33,960
25.

566
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:33,960


567
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:33,960


568
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:33,960


569
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,500
29.

570
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,900

36.

577
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:49,940

40.

581
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,280
41.

582
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,520
42.

583
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,180
43.

584
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,760

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:00,900


588
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,040

589
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,600

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,180

1.

673
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,640
0.

0.

685
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,920
0.

686
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,030
Well, he actually seems to be

687
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,790
vivying up money with Reverend Stang.

688
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,630
Come on, show money.

689
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,270
Look.

690
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,550
Well, Michelle is crying.

691
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,070
I don't want to die.

692
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,790
Oh, I think it's because she has hay fever.

693
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,550
I just realized...

694
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,470
Look, they're all laughing.

695
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,770
This is all a figment of my mind.

696
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,770
Yeah, I didn't smoke no corn silk.

697
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,550
I was back in the goose bar,

698
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,510
and I had me hit on that pipe.

699
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,150
Everybody got it looked like Stangy went.

700
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,730
If I just use my psychic abilities

701
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,650
and concentrate my yogic powers,

702
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,410
which was gifted me by Bob Dobbs,

703
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,910
down in my lowest lower chakra,

704
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,910
way down...

705
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,090
Oh, no, I can't do that.

706
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,770
The slack will be with you, Dave.

707
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,170
Oh, damn.

708
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,230
I'm never going to make it now.

709
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,930
Feel the slack, Dave.

710
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,910
Close your eyes.

711
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,450
Turn off the autopilot.

712
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,190
Come on, boy.

713
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,990
Feel the slack.

714
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,350
I'm seeing...

715
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,290
I'm seeing crystals.

716
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,310
Pulse floating by.

717
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,710
Just go with your instincts, Dave.

718
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,150
Oh, my God.

719
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,990
I don't want to go into the white light now.

720
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,050
I just want to take a hit off that pipe,

721
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,890
and I'm going to...

722
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,530
Off the meat shackles.

723
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,010
Dave, baby.

724
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,550
Welcome.

725
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,530
Shuck the body like an old shoe.

726
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,530
Welcome.

727
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,550
Welcome to the other side.

728
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,150
Remember me?

729
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,050
Benny.

730
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,190
Benny Gordon back in New York.

731
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,090
I was the guy who stole your shoes

732
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,470
and hid them in the garbage can.

733
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,310
Then you struck me in the face.

734
00:32:59,510 --> 00:32:59,710
Remember?

735
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,830
Yeah, I died later.

736
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,270
No thanks to you.

737
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,050
Yeah.

738
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,930
Kind of screwed me up inside.

739
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,210
When they let me in Bellevue,

740
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,670
they said I'd never be the same.

741
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,030
I starved to death.

742
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,310
I thought about you when I died.

743
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,270
This don't look like the green garbage coming out.

744
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,590
It kind of looks blood red.

745
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,430
Hello, Dave.

746
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,350
I'm sure you don't remember me.

747
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,490
I was...

748
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,170
I was originally a tiny puppy

749
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,750
that you tortured when you were six years old.

750
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,770
Remember me now?

751
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,910
Now I am Dog Demon,

752
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,430
the bearer of vengeance

753
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,730
for all torturers of tiny puppies.

754
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,570
And meet my friend,

755
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,170
the legless grasshopper.

756
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,090
We've all come to get...

757
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,190
to tell you that we remember

758
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,450
all the things you did

759
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,410
in life.

760
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,930
I don't think this is going to be very pleasant.

761
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,530
If I'm supposed to recount

762
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,130
all my incidences,

763
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,610
so far I've only had three incidences.

764
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,190
It's all bad.

765
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,690
I wonder what's next.

766
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,550
Who's that weird-looking woman?

767
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,210
Grandma?

768
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,290
I've never done nothing to you, really.

769
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,630
I'm sorry about the stove.

770
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,650
I'm sorry about the stove.

771
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,390
It's too late for forgiveness now, Dave.

772
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,230
Oh, Mom, come on.

773
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,270
It's too late now.

774
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,390
It's too late now.

775
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,430
It's much too late.

776
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,650
She's on this figure

777
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,230
and burns just the way I left her

778
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,510
when I ran out of the house.

779
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,330
Dave, remember your habit

780
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,950
of sticking chewing gum

781
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,210
under theater seats?

782
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,170
Yes.

783
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,110
I am a soul who once reached

784
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,610
under the seat and touched

785
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,930
your germ-ridden gum.

786
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,450
Later to die of a cold.

787
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,090
I'm sorry, bro.

788
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,910
You know, I've tried to keep myself clean

789
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,690
and have good personal attributes

790
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,570
like that and stuff,

791
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,490
but, you know, those things are so bourgeois.

792
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,450
Hey, Dave, remember me, Butch?

793
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,630
Yeah, Butch.

794
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,030
Yeah.

795
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,830
I'm sorry.

796
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,210
Yeah, I bet you're sorry now, Dave.

797
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,730
Get away.

798
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,570
I didn't mean nothing.

799
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,850
Maybe you shouldn't have stuck up behind me

800
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,490
and pulled that little trick on me

801
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,450
that one time, Dave.

802
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,930
You know my personality, man.

803
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,490
Push me in front of that car, Dave.

804
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,110
Everybody in school knew I was a joker.

805
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,530
Everybody thought that I just fell

806
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,130
in front of that car, Dave.

807
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,510
Were you jealous just because

808
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,850
I was bigger and tougher

809
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,930
and got all the girls

810
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,110
and got decent grades

811
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,030
and had friends and had parents

812
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,290
and had money and had a life?

813
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,970
Were you jealous, Dave?

814
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,410
What, you think you can wait?

815
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,990
Yes. Yes.

816
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,450
I hated you all.

817
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,550
I hated that puppy for having hair.

818
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,410
I hated grandma for having food

819
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,530
and I hated you for having a car

820
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,010
and girlfriend.

821
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,130
In fact,

822
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,070
I still hate you

823
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,870
and that's why I don't mind being here.

824
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,450
Dave, meet everyone of whom

825
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,350
you have ever been jealous.

826
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,330
They are here to gloat

827
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,390
at your misfortune.

828
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,950
Thousands and thousands of people

829
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,730
gloating, gloating

830
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,650
at your total humiliation

831
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,590
here in the endless flames

832
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,770
of, yes, let's say, in hell, Dave.

833
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,330
You're dead and you're in hell.

834
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,770
See your faces

835
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,790
and your point fingers at me.

836
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,110
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

837
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,430
And here are snapshots

838
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,590
and tape recordings

839
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,010
of every stupid or humiliating thing

840
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,790
you've ever done.

841
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,110
Here, the files of every callous

842
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,190
and thoughtless thing

843
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,790
you've ever said or done.

844
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,210
Oh, man, they're flying by so fast.

845
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,530
Here, every betrayal.

846
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,690
Here, every lie.

847
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,910
Here, every time you've masturbated

848
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,350
in an impure manner.

849
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,390
Oh, man, my eyes.

850
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,210
I'm going blind.

851
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,610
You didn't know we had such good cameras,

852
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,950
did you, in all those...

853
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,630
You're all...

854
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,410
filling station restrooms, eh, Dave?

855
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,390
All right.

856
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,590
I don't know, but...

857
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,350
Here, the endless file

858
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,170
of the times you picked your nose.

859
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,490
Here, the file

860
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,550
of the times you wet your bed.

861
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,210
Here, the files

862
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,190
of the times you didn't wash behind your ears.

863
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,830
Everything, everything in your entire life

864
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,370
has been reconstructed

865
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,650
and you're going to have to relive

866
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,530
every single moment of it

867
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,690
over and over and over again

868
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,570
inside this little black box

869
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,110
underground because you're...

870
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,250
You smoked the corn silk

871
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,310
and didn't do what your parents said.

872
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,630
Man.

873
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,110
Oh, I'm not going to fit in there, you guys.

874
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,010
And of course, all that masturbating and cruelty.

875
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,950
I don't know how long I can do it.

876
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,530
I'm older now.

877
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,830
My arms might get tired.

878
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,870
But if I just go back in the box

879
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,110
and when I reappear,

880
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,770
I'll be back in the goo-goo bar

881
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,910
talking to Stangy

882
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,470
and smoking on the bike, please.

883
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,670
So, what say, what say, brothers?

884
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,630
Shall we give him another chance?

885
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,870
Shall we give Dave...

886
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,610
Dave a chance to live his life again?

887
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,090
Do you think he's learned his lesson?

888
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,230
Oh, please, good sirs and dames.

889
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,630
Let's flip a coin

890
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,190
and see whether he gets the eternal salvation

891
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,870
or not.

892
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,370
All right, place the giant coin

893
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,490
on the giant thumb.

894
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,870
Set the catapult.

895
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,810
Three, two, one.

896
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,150
Flip the coin.

897
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,450
It is flying.

898
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,210
Look at it.

899
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,750
Flying miles up.

900
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,210
Spinning end over end.

901
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,850
Dave is pouring bullets of suspense out

902
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,490
as the coin slopes.

903
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,530
Oh, it's getting slower and slower.

904
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,170
It's falling.

905
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,270
It's falling back down to earth.

906
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,670
It's coming down

907
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,430
and it's landed right exactly on edge

908
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,390
and it rolled and it came to rest

909
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,510
and the coin is on edge.

910
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,490
How shall Dave's fate be decided now?

911
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,410
It's just more...

912
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:58,530
It's terrible.

913
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:58,810
It's just more...

914
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:58,810


915
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,050
I have to go through the suspense

916
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,110
and flip the coin again.

917
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,750
Okay, there it goes.

918
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,710
It's a slow motion.

919
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,130
Okay.

920
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,970
Oh, the...

921
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,910
And so the endless suspense

922
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,410
went on for another million years

923
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,870
as Dave waited to find out

924
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,510
whether any of the coins

925
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,530
would actually land.

926
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,930
And one day,

927
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,510
a million years later,

928
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,650
it landed heads up.

929
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,030
Dave, you have won.

930
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,550
You were allowed to dig your way

931
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,610
out of your coffin.

932
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,050
And back to earth

933
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,090
in the year 1 million A.D.

934
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,730
You have been forgiven

935
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,290
by God and Satan

936
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,970
and are resurrected

937
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,050
into eternal life

938
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,690
in whatever is left

939
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,530
on the planet of your birth

940
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,010
where you now claw your way back up.

941
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,430
There he's tearing the coffin open.

942
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,810
He's digging his...

943
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,910
choking his way...

944
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,050
But we're using his front teeth

945
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,790
to dig his way out.

946
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,050
Like an entrenching tool.

947
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,690
And he's finally made it

948
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,550
out of the grave.

949
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,950
He's coming through the surface

950
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,610
of the graveyard.

951
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,810
Dave is free.

952
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,210
Dave has escaped.

953
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,030
He has literally dug his way

954
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,910
out of hell.

955
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,610
I'm free.

956
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,290
Hey.

957
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,110
Where can you get

958
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,490
a good sandwich around here?

959
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,490
Ancient Judah pie.

960
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,390
What kind of Müller come from you.

961
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,610
And what you've discovered

962
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,790
you can't just plug in

963
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:47,950
and throw up.

964
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,610
See, there.

965
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


966
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


967
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


968
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


969
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


970
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


971
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


972
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


973
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


974
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


975
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


976
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


977
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:48,610


978
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,770
He can't anytime soon

979
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,450
be away from life.

980
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:50,450


981
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:50,450


982
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:50,550
than it's supposed to scraped

983
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,670
from his house.

984
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,070
But the fire

985
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,170
of the sugar

986
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,190
will conjure up

987
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,170
theEuropeans Qiu

988
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,070
and just stay here,

989
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,790
here at this spot.

990
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,190
You know, I just had some pretty strange things happen to me.

991
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,330
You know, this beautiful, gorgeous babe just appears as I imagine to think about it.

992
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,410
It's called serendipity, Dave.

993
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:11,570
Serendipity.

994
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,290
Serendipity, or slack.

995
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,650
You can call it either one.

996
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,630
Serendipity.

997
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,110
I remember them guys when I was a little kid.

998
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,990
They used to be in the Thomas Brothers, you know.

999
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,990
And one of them died of a heroin overdose, I think.

1000
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,870
Yeah, serendipity.

1001
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,650
I could die of a heroin overdose.

1002
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,570
That's my name, serendipity.

1003
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,590
How did you know?

1004
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,870
I didn't know, sir.

1005
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,490
I just kind of guessed it.

1006
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,610
Yeah, you know, I'm one of them intuitive kind of guys.

1007
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,650
You know, one of your strong, silent types.

1008
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,210
Yeah.

1009
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:36,630
Yeah.

1010
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,010
Wow.

1011
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,430
Hope I ain't smelling too strong.

1012
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,110
I just crawled out of a graveyard.

1013
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,950
I think it kind of smells manly.

1014
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,270
I kind of like it.

1015
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,870
You know, some people say it smells more like a goat.

1016
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,610
But you in the mood for a cup of coffee?

1017
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,110
Well, sure.

1018
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,290
An espresso?

1019
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,410
Yeah.

1020
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,590
How about a cappuccino?

1021
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,450
Can we snuff?

1022
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,930
Yeah, baby.

1023
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,590
We can do anything you want to.

1024
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,070
Especially with legs like that.

1025
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,950
We can snuff a dude.

1026
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:03,950
Wow.

1027
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,170
Is that your naturalistic hair?

1028
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,490
Or is that some kind of falsified hair?

1029
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,090
I never saw that hue on a woman or on a human being.

1030
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,510
It's a virtual hair.

1031
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,290
Virtual hair?

1032
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,590
Yes, virtual hair.

1033
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,230
You mean like it's feely, really?

1034
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,110
It's sort of like a holodeck hair.

1035
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,990
You mean if I touch it, like,

1036
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,170
then I would automatically experience a sensation?

1037
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,850
You mean like the sensation you was talking about in the aforementioned article?

1038
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,010
Well, kind of, yes.

1039
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,730
Like a hologram.

1040
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,870
Kind of, yes?

1041
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,870
Yes, kind of.

1042
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,710
What about...

1043
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,810
You sure that ain't a...

1044
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,650
A merkin?

1045
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,030
You sure that ain't a...

1046
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,470
Bob Dobbs feely, really, virtual reality merkin?

1047
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,670
It really is.

1048
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,250
Oh, okay.

1049
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,170
I believe you.

1050
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:49,590
It really is.

1051
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,330
It's a real merkin.

1052
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,790
You just lied to me.

1053
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,910
You know, I'm wondering again.

1054
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,510
Just put...

1055
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,970
It's a real virtual merkin.

1056
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,570
Oh, so then...

1057
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,150
Does some of this seem too good to be true, Dave?

1058
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,950
Yeah, well, the birds are singing and a woman in virtual work

1059
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,850
had come up and tried to ask me out on a date.

1060
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,470
Are you looking at gift horse in the mouth, Dave?

1061
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,070
No, I'm looking at...

1062
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,510
I mean, we let you out of hell to relive your life

1063
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,990
and now you're complaining that maybe it's all too perfect or something?

1064
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,970
No, I was just looking at the bus stop.

1065
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,530
I was reading the cards on the bus stop.

1066
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,690
Snacko Funeral Home, George's Beans.

1067
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,310
Hey, wait a minute. Where'd the girl go?

1068
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,210
Oh, whatever.

1069
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,550
Well, Dave, we'll go ahead and admit it.

1070
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,170
It is we put you in another one of those worlds

1071
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,730
where whatever you imagine is whatever you get.

1072
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,790
And as long as you were feeling pretty good,

1073
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,350
you were imagining pretty good things

1074
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,510
and getting the girls and so forth.

1075
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,930
But what are you imagining now that we've browbeaten you down

1076
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,370
and made you feel insecure again, eh, Dave?

1077
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,470
What kind of reality are you creating for yourself now,

1078
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,210
you poor pathetic loser, eh?

1079
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:56,490
I'm looking at the bus stop.

1080
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,290
I'm surrounded by snakes and hushpuppies

1081
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,490
and old rotten...

1082
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,810
I love the cats.

1083
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,170
I know this. It's all full of it now.

1084
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,290
I'm surrounded by snakes and hushpuppies

1085
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,710
and everybody knows you don't eat no hushpuppies with no snake.

1086
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,870
You eat no snake, you eat...

1087
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,110
You see, we confused him

1088
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,290
and his entire reality collapsed around him.

1089
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,830
I hate snakes. I hate snakes.

1090
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:26,450
We made him afraid and that of which he was most afraid surrounded him.

1091
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,210
The moral of the story is, kids, you make your own reality.

1092
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,290
Every man and woman is a star.

1093
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,610
And if that was so, then how come it hurts when you stub your toe

1094
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,690
and how come your head ain't on fire?

1095
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,650
These are the eternal questions

1096
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,290
to be answered only by the eternal verities,

1097
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,810
death and taxes and Bob.

1098
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,170
The three things that you can depend on.

1099
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,210
All ragged bones, all ragged shoes.

1100
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,390
I am a vagabond, a vagabond.

1101
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,130
Free as the wind.

1102
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,410
Hey, buddy over here.

1103
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,590
I got some snakes and hushpuppies.

1104
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:11,010
You hungry?

1105
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,450
You feel like curling your toes up and squirming?

1106
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,050
Come on over here, I got it.

1107
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,290
Hey, you over there. I got lemonade too.

1108
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,750
You look a mite parched.

1109
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,910
You look like a demon.

1110
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,090
You...

1111
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,150
Say!

1112
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,590
What is he...

1113
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,750
Say, Dave.

1114
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,270
I'm a demon.

1115
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,190
I noticed that you took all those lemons we handed you

1116
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,530
and made lemonade.

1117
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,950
We noticed that you had that glass that was half empty

1118
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,610
and magically made it half full.

1119
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,910
Yeah, and I got the one-errant eyeball pointing down

1120
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,150
like many convicts do.

1121
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,050
But that doesn't explain it.

1122
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,630
How come my life is such a mess, man?

1123
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,590
I done square by you.

1124
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,250
I bought your lemons with real U.S. money.

1125
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,810
David, it's part of the seeking.

1126
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,070
It's part of the journey.

1127
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,950
You have to pay your dues.

1128
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,810
In order to truly soar through heaven,

1129
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,110
you must first embrace the porcelain bowls of hell.

1130
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,510
Yeah, I'm like some kind of mythic knight, Percival guy.

1131
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,250
Yeah, I don't mind, sir.

1132
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,030
Yes, it's the holy grail of slack.

1133
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,230
And you're getting so close,

1134
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,770
having gone through the terrible gauntlet of anti-slack.

1135
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,650
Surely you must be almost to your goal of enlightenment.

1136
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,890
Nirvana of magic.

1137
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,370
It's true.

1138
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,930
Here comes the nirvana.

1139
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,170
By the way, Dave, you knew that nirvana means nothing, right?

1140
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,950
Yeah, I knew it meant nothing.

1141
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,410
And that's what I'm ready for, man.

1142
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,390
Lies and nothing.

1143
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,230
Because every time I get me something good,

1144
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,710
it turns out to be something bad.

1145
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,790
And every time I get me something bad, it turns out worse.

1146
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,570
So it's like a shifting sandy beach of $20 bills.

1147
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,830
It keeps on changing and changing and changing and changing.

1148
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,670
And I don't need nothing, blessed sweet oblivion.

1149
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,270
Oh, here then is your reward.

1150
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,590
Here, Dave, you asked for it from Bob, God, and all the others.

1151
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:04,490
Back into the little black box eight feet underground in the cold and dark.

1152
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,230
Here, Dave, is your nirvana.

1153
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,790
No longer to face the woes and travails of life.

1154
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,930
You may lie here in total slack and repose.

1155
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,230
Yes, this is the slack that Bob promised.

1156
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,490
An eternity.

1157
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,090
Perfectly aware.

1158
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,850
Inside a closed black box.

1159
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:33,310
Feeling the corruptigating worms shoo their way through your desiccated, decaying flesh.

1160
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:39,310
And finally to feel your bones dissolve into powder as the box caves in.

1161
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:45,530
And you have achieved nirvana and final enlightenment as worm experiments.

1162
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:46,370
Thank you.

1163
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,470
I was a little man.

1164
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,030
Ran a shoeshine stand.

1165
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:04,470
And every day the man would sweep the water from the busy street.

1166
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,010


1167
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,810
Yeah.

1168
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:09,630


1169
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,430
Yeah.

1170
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:13,790
Yeah.

1171
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,230
Yeah.

1172
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,710
Yeah.

1173
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,610
He sailed in the 701.

1174
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:32,430
And anybody knew, there was something in his face.

1175
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,390
Right.

1176
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,570
Loneliness could not erase.

1177
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:37,490
Yeah.

1178
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,750
Yeah.

1179
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,970
No thoughts.

1180
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,690
No thoughts.

1181
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,670
sensations no feelings no

1182
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,210
recurrent memory it's simply a

1183
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,450
moldy spatula and those little

1184
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,250
worms uh kind of itch a little

1185
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,430
bit as they crawl in and out oh

1186
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,990
yeah just me and the worms just

1187
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:13,210
me and the worms like a broken

1188
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:17,510
pup he looked up from his cup

1189
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:21,150
and drank his morning coffee

1190
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,730
and wiped the dribble from his

1191
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,210
chin

1192
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,730
there is nothing there shall be

1193
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,910
nothing there is nothing nada and

1194
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,790
nada and nada except when his

1195
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,230
eyes are that mine he made a

1196
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:47,490
little wish and he said i'm not a

1197
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,470
little one

1198
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:52,690
he came within an inch or two

1199
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:58,430
and then he whispered i hate you

1200
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,690
or nada who are to nada nada be

1201
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,350
thy name

1202
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,610
or nada who are to nada nada be

1203
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,010
thy name

1204
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,070
thy name be dust thy feet be dust

1205
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,490
thy eyes be dust thy toes be dust

1206
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:26,370
thy body be dust thy feet be dust

1207
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,690
thy hands be dust as well

1208
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,670
you know you know you know

1209
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,810
you know you know what y'all

1210
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,670
you know y'all know y'all know

1211
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:56,210
How did he know? How did he know? How did he know? How did he know?

1212
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:02,530
Once I had some pets, I let them starve to death

1213
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:09,430
It was a funny little monkey and a big white Easter bunny

1214
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:16,510
They lived in little cages and sometimes in rages

1215
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:23,950
I'd turn them upside down and drag my monkey all around

1216
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,410
And drag my monkey all around

1217
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:57,370
You shouldn't have dragged me around like that, Dave.

1218
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,530
Now ye shall be dragged around.

1219
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:17,490
Around.

1220
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,050
Look at that monkey dragging Dave around his cage.

1221
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,110
Let him be dragged.

1222
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,430
Let him all be dragged.

1223
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,890
Let his armpit hairs be braided by a tired chimpanzee.

1224
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:34,930
No.

1225
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:35,930
No.

1226
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:37,690
Yes.

1227
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,470
Yes.

1228
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:39,930
No.

1229
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,210
No.

1230
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:42,390
Contaminated.

1231
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,550
Don't do it, man.

1232
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,490
Good night.

1233
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:46,490


1234
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,190
Contaminated.

1235
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:48,970
Contaminated.

1236
00:52:50,090 --> 00:53:01,450
Folks, you've been listening to ESO Radio and Einstein's Secret Orchestra with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1237
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:09,650
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself and Michelle and special guest this week, the Reverend Ivan Stang and the Princess We Are Doe.

1238
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:10,850
Contaminated.

1239
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,190
Being contaminated.

1240
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,550
Contaminated.

1241
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,590
Contaminated.

1242
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,290
Contaminated.

1243
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,130
Contaminated.

1244
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,250
Contaminated.

1245
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:28,250


1246
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,910
Contaminated.

1247
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,450
Contaminated.

1248
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,130
Contaminated.

1249
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:32,570
Contaminated.

1250
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,310
Contaminated.

1251
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:33,930
Contaminated.

1252
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,310
Contaminated.

1253
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,410
Contaminated.

1254
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,870
Contaminated.

1255
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,830
Contaminated.

1256
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,370
Contaminated.

1257
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:48,910
And all bearded English professors will quote nada and nada and nada.

1258
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,950
And they shall be throttled.

1259
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,810
They shall be throttled by giant beasts and their hands held under their necks.

1260
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,290
And as they cry out, are you looking at my neck?

1261
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,470
They shall be struck down by the archangel Bill.

1262
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,550
Praise Bill.

1263
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,570
The Bill genius must be lax.

1264
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,350
There is only one gene that we work for.

1265
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,710
It's critical we get the gene.

1266
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:19,250
We must not let Bob get to the gene before the ceremony.

1267
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:24,410
The gene must still be a virgin when the time is nigh for its arisal.

1268
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,930
We need a virgin gene, clean of any impurities.

1269
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,010
That's the only way this will work.

1270
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,450
Where can we find the untainted gene?

1271
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,090
The unsullied, pure DNA formulae?

1272
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:37,790
Oh, man.

1273
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,390
I know where you can find it.

1274
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:42,370
Where?

1275
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,390
Where, man? Tell us.

1276
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,510
It's in my head.

1277
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,810
It's in my words.

1278
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,110
Words are like worms.

1279
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,010
And they crawl in your brain.

1280
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,170
I think he's right.

1281
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,590
And they wiggle around.

1282
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,570
I think he does have it.

1283
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,330
And then...

1284
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,010
I think he has the perfect, uncontaminated...

1285
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:02,030
The southern man.

1286
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,830
Completely crushed gene.

1287
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,410
It's like the helium and I.

1288
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,790
I didn't even start.

1289
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,770
It's in your brain, man.

1290
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:12,670
It's true.

1291
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:17,370
This man's brain is so densely compacted that the interior of it is like a dwarf star.

1292
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,110
We've found what we need.

1293
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,790
He's the gene genie.

1294
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,710
He wasn't a pathetic loser after all.

1295
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,890
He was the one.

1296
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,170
Dave was the one.

1297
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,310
After all his tortures and torment,

1298
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:37,530
it turned out that the gene, the perfect, unsullied, untainted gene,

1299
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,430
was in fact buried inside Lonesome Cowboy Dave's head.

1300
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:43,550
Praise Bob! The world is safe!

1301
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:44,810
Remove the gene.

1302
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:51,010
This will make Dr. Von Neumann very happy, Reverend Stang.

1303
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,450
This will make Dr. Von Neumann very happy.

1304
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:59,290
We have retrieved the gene from inside the head of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1305
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,250
He's dead now.

1306
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:01,090
And...

1307
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,190
And...

1308
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,450
We, the conspiracy of overlords,

1309
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,790
disguised as...

1310
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,990
rebels against the conspiracy of overlords,

1311
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,290
have once again won.

1312
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,210
The world is indeed our oyster.

1313
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,250
The world is our oyster, one might say.

1314
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,170
Fearless clam or some sort of shellfish.

1315
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,010
We all enjoy shellfish.

1316
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,590
Let's have some more, shall we?

1317
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:28,210
Yes, let's slip a few more raw planets down our throats.

1318
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,570
We have no love.

1319
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,070
We have no heart.

1320
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,010
We have no...

1321
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,130
We have everything we need.

1322
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:56,610
We have the best of all

1323
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,750
really-

1324
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,630
Chop off its head and stuff its mouth with garlic.

1325
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,230
It's too late. It's too late.

1326
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,930
He's already eaten all the garlic and chopped off his own head.

1327
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,050
He's coming back to life.

1328
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,610
And here he is, Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar.

1329
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,850
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Corruptigating Worms.

1330
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,990
There can only be one.

1331
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,990
There can only be one.

1332
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:35,570
One.

1333
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:35,750
One.

1334
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:40,950
As Dave, the resurrected Dave, without the perfect gene,

1335
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,750
and with his head now hollowed out, emptied and expanded.

1336
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,470
And his corpus callosum, that perfect conical shape,

1337
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,230
so that we can impact it with all the necessary documents.

1338
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,730
He now freed from his tasks.

1339
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,150
He rides off into the sunset on his tricycle.

1340
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,330
Side settled, wearing that funny conical hat,

1341
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,750
thinking somehow he has made it.

1342
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:06,910
But in fact.

1343
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,230
It's made him.

1344
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,150
Let's see if he can get it.

1345
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,790
But he's doing a good job with it.

1346
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:31,550
His head.

1347
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:31,550


1348
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:45,890
Ever feel like you should have just said no to that magic carpet ride to Electric Lady Land?

1349
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,150
Ever feel so heavy?

1350
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:56,390
Ever feel like your thighs are so sick, your muscles are weak, and your neck is too blotchy?

1351
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:01,570
Ever feel disconnected and completely alone?

1352
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:08,630
Ever feel corrugated worms burrowing through your follicles?

1353
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:13,970
Well, if you have, we can't help you a bit.

1354
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,110
But we can help you get your mind off of it.

1355
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:23,970
So just write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1356
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,470
Got that pencil ready?

1357
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,190
You can find out everything you need to know

1358
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,550
about how to...

1359
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,230
make money off of your corruptigating worms

1360
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,250
by writing to

1366
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:57,970
All of the above was from ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland from the old days.

1367
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,490
The show of the late, incredibly great Chaz Smith.

1368
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,050
Who also played half the instruments.

1369
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,590
Praise Chaz.
