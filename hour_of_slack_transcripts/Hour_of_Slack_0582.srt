1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:09,500
I know how beat up you are, and how terrible it feels not to have any money in the dry, dumpy cars, burning oil, leaking oil, transmissions leaking.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,940
Praise God. You'll sense the anointing flowing out of me.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,900
Oh yes, it was ankle deep, now it's getting knee deep. Hallelujah, pretty soon we're gonna be all swimming in it.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,600
The American people are taxed too little. Now we will never break the poverty trap.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,860
This is the time. Abandoned those who through no fault of their own must have our help.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,100
Talking about how that you will lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brook.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,920
Yea, the Almighty will be your defense, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.

8
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,180
And I think we're all for that, definitely, for sure, to pay our bills.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,480
The Silk Jeans.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:58,940
Yes.

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,920
Our own sweat.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,460
What?

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,320
How does one man assert absolute power over another?

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,660
By making him suffer.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,500
Exactly, by making him suffer.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,940
Does anybody here remember Ivan's name?

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,600
Remember how he said that we would finally win come next day?

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,760
I know your work. You go by the name of being alive, and you are dead.

19
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,720
Now listen, pal.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,100
Dead!

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,080
They have the power to shut the skies.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,580
They have the power to shut the skies.

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,580


24
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,580


25
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:58,580


26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,160
Go, scum, on my way to him that is dead!

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,160


28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,160


29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,660
But...

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
When I was fair, I gotius, and I, too, felt...

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,020
Verg...

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,020


33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,600
I, my love, a man inredictable!

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,860
my soft cut monte, in which Bernie is uploads.

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,260
Or my one trouper in this cage on the USA Seragames, working with İn neo Primal because he may be the only on whom strange things are hard to find.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,940
You are to pay for what?

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,360
I don't know.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,360


41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
I see wild woods as the tasty jack, and a garden...

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,560


43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
I found him in a garbage can

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,100
Boycott everything he said

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,120
The last free man will soon be dead

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,240
From people who are so messed up

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,320
They don't know what's right from wrong

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,320
The price of keeping conscience clean

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,860
Of punishment and poverty

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,420
The process is slow

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,840
And it grinds your mind to dust

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,540
As your identity is torn

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,740
Stripped of the parts that never fit

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,320
And driven crazy with loneliness

55
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,800
You play the games like all the rest

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
Until your mind is not your own

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,740
But that of a clone

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,960
In my lifetime, America set the standard for the world.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
Well, that won't happen if we act now.

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,580
But I will submit legislation shortly to help bankruptcy and death.

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,680
Second, how well prepared are we to enter the 21st century?

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,540
It is a question of time.

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,960
It is now time that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding.

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,780
The Congress will soon receive grit for basic research.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Competitiveness also means unfair trade practices

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,480
and weapons to fight our children.

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,700
Finally, let's stop our children and our children with our children.

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,640
Let's stop the spiritual core of our national being.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,340
It's more than that.

70
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,740
More subtle than that.

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,520
Everything they describe, if we didn't pull that on them,

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:58,720
we'd pull that on them.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,400
And I say pull that on them.

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,440
Now, I say to you, because I get to look in your own nervous system,

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,140
whether you consider yourself religious or not,

76
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,040
genetically, it is already and somewhere imprinted,

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,960
you're still dealing with that kind of aspect of being a human.

78
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,980
Because it's up here.

79
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,740
It's not in your soul.

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,320
But it's up here.

81
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,040
At any rate, they still describe it.

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,940
We did away with that part of me describing a real Jew or Christian or Muslim

83
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,820
as being a dead man.

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,960
Or conversely, a dead man is the only one who fits the requirements.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,740
Because if you talk,

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,640
you know,

87
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,900
to the Pope of Christians, the Pope of Jews, or the Pope of Hindus,

88
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,500
and you say,

89
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,320
does anybody fit the requirement of a real Jew or Christian?

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,640
They would even,

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,860
of course, the big guys got the sham, the humility and go,

92
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,180
well, no, not even me.

93
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,060
But all you got to do is think, wait a minute,

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,040
who would fit the requirements?

95
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,960
What are the religion is?

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,920
Who would fit all these requirements right now?

97
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,720
A dead man.

98
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,340
Bob.

99
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,820
Bob.

100
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,300
Bob.

101
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:53,900
Bob.

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,480
Bob.

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,100
Bob.

104
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,740
Bob.

105
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Bob.

106
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,340


107
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,640
Bob.

108
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:57,760
Bob.

109
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:57,920
Bob.

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,160
Bob.

111
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,040
Bob.

112
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,340
Bob.

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,340
We're going to refine it.

114
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,760
If we didn't do that and I just said,

115
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,740
all right, consider everyone's idea of improvement,

116
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,840
of a better person, a real Jew, a real Christian,

117
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,780
a real humanitarian, a real humane homo sapien,

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,840
what would it be?

119
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,580
No matter what they start describing,

120
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,640
even if we're now freed from religious terminologies

121
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,280
and paradigms,

122
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,700
what would they start describing they can't help it they would start

123
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,540
describing the past always think about a second we got a second by the way you

124
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,420
folks are being so faithful and fulfilling the vows that you've made to

125
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,680
the Lord that's we're so pleased when I pray for you early in the mornings I

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,280
just sense such a joy from the Lord for how he is so delighted that you said

127
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,720
you had anointing out of me to work with you so that we can feel only heaven's

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,840
realities in your life you know many people are just takers in life some

129
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:23,760
people just take but I'm running down my leg the hate the hate is running down did it he did it friends all and what a little collage of messy sound we've had here what these tapes I've been going through now some of this is a barrage handed to me by the the folks who were the band at Atlanta a p-dog night and

130
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,160
um

131
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,700
um

132
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:24,700


133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:54,720


134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:54,960
,

135
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:16,120
and and we can plus some Lee Harvey McVeigh why look at all these little tapes we've got more more more but where where where is I where do you know my friend I seek an honest man surely there must be one

136
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,820
Ivan

137
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,620
Ivan

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,700
Ivan

139
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:24,700


140
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:24,700


141
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:24,700


142
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:24,820
in

143
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,760
in

144
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,660
what have become of you

145
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,460
Lisa

146
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:33,840
Thank You

147
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,260
I mean

148
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,240
aporacy

149
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,460
finally

150
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,000
your

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,560
I mean

152
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,060
but what's real good

153
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,060
you did done the same thing Bob told me

154
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,380
to

155
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,160
a

156
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,140
Hey

157
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,040
We'll be right back.

159
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,460
A superficial walking death

160
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,760
A cartoon of yourself

161
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
The process is slow

162
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,060
And it grinds your mind to dust

163
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,900
As your identity is stripped

164
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,940
Of the parts that never fit

165
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,960
So when you feel down

166
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,380
Just take some time to

167
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,360
Nave from the flowers

168
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,960
Mow down the trees

169
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,540
And scorch the forest

170
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,080
Climb up the world

171
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
With your sterile compound

172
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,920
Instead to shine

173
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
Point in my mind

174
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,280
Maybe further from the truth

175
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,180
Take me far away from here

176
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:19,400
Take me far away from here

177
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,640
To a place where the girls don't care

178
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,600
How you talk or who you are

179
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,840
Or if you drive a ripped up car

180
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,920
The process world, the process mind

181
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
Watch your TV then go blind

182
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
A superficial walking death

183
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,200
A cartoon of yourself

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,060
The process is slow

185
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,480
And it grinds your mind to dust

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,320
As your identity is stripped

187
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,380
Of the parts that never fit

188
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,960
And driven crazy with loneliness

189
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,440
You play the games like all the rest

190
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,700
Until your mind is not your own

191
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,380
But that of a clone

192
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,680
So when you feel down

193
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,080
Just take some time to

194
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,100
Nave from the flowers

195
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,640
Mow down the trees

196
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,240
And scorch the forest

197
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,760
Climb up the world

198
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,240
With your sterile compound

199
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,640
Instead to shine

200
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,060
Point in my mind

201
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,060
Maybe further from the truth

202
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,520
Take me further

203
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,080
From the truth

204
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,380
Before you're calm

205
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:07,380


206
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:07,540
And me a rgré

207
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,220
Atonement

208
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,220


209
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,220


210
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,780
But you'd be welcome

211
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:08,880
Thunder Maßnahmen

212
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:08,880


213
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:08,880


214
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,820
What a place this is

215
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,560
It was in the sad labeled

216
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


217
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


218
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,200
Perfect for entertainment

219
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,120
Can we just please seel the bum?

220
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,280
smke

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,920
this is a constipated society. The Church of the subgenius is an enema for that constipated society.

222
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,540
Raising land from the ocean, making something where there was nothing before, and then selling

223
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,600
it to other people, that is the epitome of slack. Well, I mean, it's good stuff. And faith in God

224
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,180
brings the faith of God into reality in your life. And then we have the faith to speak to mountains

225
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,780
and believe they'll be removed, and to call things which be not as though they were. Glory to God the

226
00:11:50,780 --> 00:12:01,340
prophesy. Through lower taxes and smaller government, moral and spiritual greatness.

227
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,680
Government has its ways of freeing people's spirits, and isn't that what we do best?

228
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,560
Let's reiterate that this is a fictitious scam. Pesky little pieces of lint. Contains its own

229
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,160
demon, which resembles a demon.

230
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,160
It's a heat-resistant ugly dog on fire. If you disturb this creature as it feeds, which the

231
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,660
Egyptians called boiler grease. If I were you, I'd throw away your oven and eat only your leftovers

232
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,740
as you sleep, right down to the boiler grease.

233
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,180
Bring away the veil and let us stare unashamed into the face of stark reality.

234
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,060
The stark fist.

235
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:54,340
The best of reality comes at you, bringing you the message of J.R. Bob Dobbs. Now, most people have seen Bob, but don't know of him.

236
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,260
And the question foremost in their mind is, who is Bob?

237
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,060
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.

238
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,400
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

239
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
And to you, young man.

240
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,360
You too.

241
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:39,020
I've had an awful career doing stand-up tragedy. My 15 years as a traveling missionary for the Church of the Subgenius.

242
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,320
There's other things I probably couldn't talk about.

243
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,140
Either one of my most remarkable experiences in the history of the church, which is the history of the subgenius, is that I was a missionary for the Church of the Subgenius.

244
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,140


245
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,140


246
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,400
Or I was a missionary for the church for the rest of my life.

247
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,400


248
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:53,880
Yes, we had a group called the 7-Elevens in the recent bands, the Southland Corporation, a band that worships 7-Elevens and some other convenience stores.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
And we had a few songs about stacks.

250
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:04,200
We had a few, a few things about Junior Food Market, Junior Food Mark, but primarily the worship of 7-Eleven.

251
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:13,380
I probably couldn't talk about my upcoming, the script I'm working on, my upcoming film, The Thing That Had a 7-Eleven for a Head.

252
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,140
This kind of also ties in with the 7-Eleven.

253
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,140


254
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,140


255
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,140


256
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,140


257
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,320
Southland Corporation, of course.

258
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,360
Of course, the sequel, The Thing That Had a 7-Eleven for a Head,

259
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,340
rises from the grave.

260
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,340
The Thing That Had a 7-Eleven for a Head rises from the grave.

261
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,180
From Mars, Part 2, Epilogue, A New Beginning for a Head.

262
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,940
That's probably another thing I couldn't talk about.

263
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,600
And then I've got another idea for a horror film

264
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,820
that I wouldn't want to discuss or mention.

265
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,940
The Thing That Had a Thing with No Face for a Left Leg.

266
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,080
What was your question?

267
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,940
While Bunny Sarita brings you a hot-buttered rum martini,

268
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,200
settle back and get ready for Aunt Bertha's most scintillating party yet.

269
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,900
With Timmy on the piano playing your...

270
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,820
What? Timmy doesn't know how to...

271
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,180
God, look at his hands!

272
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,600
...cocktail favorites.

273
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,820
Guests of the Aunt Bertha show stay at the Roach Motel.

274
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
They don't need to stay anywhere.

275
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,660
They stay at the Roach Motel.

276
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,080
They're in hell, don't you understand?

277
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,740
And now the bad hell music happens because he said hell on the radio.

278
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,120
But is there any scientific evidence for the existence of hell?

279
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,540
According to one researcher studying the phenomenon of the near-death encounter, or MBE,

280
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,040
there is indeed evidence of hell.

281
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,400
Here it is now.

282
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,200
The first film of hell ever seen.

283
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,320
Among his other positions, Dr. Rawlings is affiliated with the Chattanooga-based Heart Association's Advanced Life Support Program

284
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,020
and serves on the teaching faculty of the American Heart Association.

285
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,760
His music we refuse to play.

286
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,080
Wait.

287
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,700
He's a professor of internal medicine, and he is an authority on cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

288
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,900
This latter specialty has led Rawlings to the study of near-death encounters,

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,160
which are out-of-body experiences many heart attack victims reportedly undergo

290
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,700
during moments when they are near death or have actually experienced clinical death.

291
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:09,580
The study of the MBE was first popularized by Raymond Moody in his 1975 bestseller,

292
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,380
Life...

293
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,320
After Life,

294
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,340
which described the experience as a blissful encounter,

295
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,560
during which the witness leaves his body,

296
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,420
often travels down an intestinal tunnel to a heavenly paradise,

297
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,900
and there meets his deceased relatives before returning to his body.

298
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,700
But Rawlings does not share Moody's optimistic, rather idealized view about the afternoon.

299
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,720
On the basis of his own research, he believes hell literally exists.

300
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,640
He says it's the devil who has been causing the death of Moody,

301
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,560
as well as the demons capering in the flames, the coals, the giant scorpions, the orthopedic shoes that don't fit.

302
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,880
All real, not to hallucinations, but actually existing from the beginning of time.

303
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,920
His book on the subject, Beyond Death's Door, has gone into eight hard-cover prints.

304
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:08,060
It all started when a Little Rawlings patient, a 48-year-old mailman named Bert, had a heart attack

305
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,660
during a medical examination.

306
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,960
when they dropped some ice down the back of his hospital gown.

307
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,780
The patient was undergoing a stress test as part of a clinical ATT

308
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,360
when he went into bonkers or, in scientific terms, cardiac arrest.

309
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Rawlings frantically tried to revive him.

310
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,100
Each time, he regained heartbeat and respiration.

311
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,460
The patient screamed, I am in hell!

312
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm going nowhere.

313
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,080
And therefore, you better damn believe in some new hell.

314
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,200
He was terrified and pleaded to help,

315
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,400
but as he continued working on the patient,

316
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,500
Rawlings would see the look of abject terror on J.R.'s face.

317
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,080
Each time the doctor paused during the resuscitation,

318
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,020
he complained that he found himself slipping back into a hell.

319
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,060
This was not the full extent of the mailman's ordeal.

320
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,760
Ultimately, he experienced a more peaceful experience

321
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,220
during which he left his body,

322
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,180
visited every subgenius in town,

323
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,280
and had himself one new carol of a time.

324
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,980
Yes, it's J.R., and he's back in town.

325
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,340
Yes, the guy who buys the votes to put those presidents in power.

326
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,100
Here he is.

327
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,380
He sees the lows. He sees the heights.

328
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,620
With his famous leather jacket, it's J.R.

329
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,880
I'm related to Clinton. Everyone is.

330
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,580
And I think at some point I'm going to have to talk about,

331
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,460
reveal the truth about my affair with Bill Clinton.

332
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,700
You asked me about Nugent earlier before the broadcast.

333
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,600
Before the broadcast, we were having a little argument.

334
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
Some friends of mine back home were wondering,

335
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,420
who rules more, Leonard Skinner or Ted Nugent?

336
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,640
Well, I mean, I definitely have to say Nugent.

337
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,480
I mean, anybody that thinks cat scratch fever is a better record

338
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,580
than Double Eye of Gonzo can turn around and just get the hell out of here.

339
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,420
I mean, I'm into...

340
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,600
I like cat scratch fever.

341
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,140
Well, we might have to step outside after the broadcast.

342
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,720
Does anybody got a rope?

343
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,540
But I mean, I'm into some parts of cat scratch fever.

344
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,440
Say, songs two through five on cat scratch fever.

345
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,940
Double Eye of Gonzo, sides one, three, and three of the songs on four.

346
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,300
And you can quote me on that.

347
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,240
Just don't quote me on saying you can quote me on that.

348
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,540
And you can quote me on that.

349
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,240
Just don't quote me on saying not to quote me on saying you can quote me on saying not to quote me on saying you can quote me on that.

350
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,880
However you could quote me on that.

351
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,180
Just don't quote me on saying not to quote me on saying that.

352
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,700
saying you can quote me on that, but you could quote me on that, obviously. Basically what

353
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,640
I am saying is that you can quote me on the even-numbered permutations of repeating sentence

354
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,740
fragments of quotability, anti-quotability, but not the odd-numbered sentence fragments

355
00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:00,140
of quotability, anti-quotability. But you can quote me on that. And I mean that. You

356
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,320
know, a lot of people in Los Angeles, they'll say, I mean that. It's just a thing people

357
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,580
say. They don't really mean that. But when I say I mean that, I mean that. And I mean

358
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,060
that. And you can quote me on that.

359
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,260
So you mean that?

360
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,460
I mean that, yeah.

361
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:17,220
Okay, some people have accused you, Mr. Jainer Hyperkleets, of, despite all your sincerity

362
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,840
in your cheesy little scam, some have accused you of being a lawbreaker.

363
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,100
How do you respond to this accusation?

364
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,400
No, I don't break the laws.

365
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,540
I make the laws.

366
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,060
I'm the lawmaker.

367
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,180
I make laws from up here, like this.

368
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,900
Oh, I've got a microphone cable.

369
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
I mean, I'm a lawmaker, but I still have, you know, microphone cables.

370
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,360
See this?

371
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,280
This is me.

372
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,620
Nixon was just playing.

373
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,080
See this?

374
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,780
This is me.

375
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm the track layer, Rex.

376
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,860
Hi, Jainer.

377
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,160
You'll see him mamboing the night away at the...

378
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,160


379
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,920
The coolest night spots in the USA.

380
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,280
... are seen only at the finest restaurants in town.

381
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,340
Look at the girls upon his arm.

382
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,300
They went to La Mambo.

383
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,480
They've only got Jainer to keep them warm.

384
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,680
We're not going to use soap or anything.

385
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,860
We're not going to go on like this.

386
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
They went to El Ropa.

387
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,180
They went to smoke some El Dopa soap on the rope.

388
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,180
At the beautiful retrieval room with its shiny plasma fountain.

389
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,220
There they are at the Bug Girl show.

390
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,180
Mind is dying by Bug Girl herself.

391
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,700
Can life be any better than this?

392
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,100
And now look free to go to the next one.

393
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,060
I'm the one about the college decision.

394
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,160
And now look free to go to the next one.

395
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,160


396
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,160


397
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,160


398
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,300
Look free tickets to Burning Man.

399
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,420
There he goes.

400
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,340
Phineas Darko has descended into psychobabble.

401
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,040
He's taken this city by storm, and there is Mayor Willie Brown now turning over the

402
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,180
symbolic key to the city on the steps of the newly earthquake-retrofitted city hall, and

403
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,120
Jainer, waving and smiling at the crowd, turns around and drops his pants.

404
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,720
Now was that good enough for you, Phineas?

405
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,380
All right, yeah, that was I think what I've received as a Jainer riff, and now I think

406
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
we can leave that.

407
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,720
You see, I was talking about that.

408
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,140
Unfortunately, I don't have lyrics.

409
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,500
male man who visited a hell many times because of his doctor's clumsy

410
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,740
manipulation. Well, no wonder he was disgruntled. Oh yeah, he was disgruntled, alright.

411
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,040
Anyway, the same doctor, this Dr. Rawlings I'm talking about, he has suggested that

412
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,860
many people on the verge of death may have a vision of hell, but they forget

413
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,540
that fact because it's too shocking to recall. Interestingly enough, not everyone

414
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,440
experiences hell the same way. Some experiences seem muddled after the

415
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,620
popular Christian conception of hell. Other people appear to enter a Dantean

416
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,960
inferno. I've experienced hell. You know what hell is? It's a disassembly line. I was

417
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,340
standing near a shoreline of a great ocean of fire. I gotta take notes on this thing. It was a lake of fire and brimstone, the most

418
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,460
awesome sight one could ever see this side of Final Judgment.

419
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,480
Piles of bodies.

420
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:14,600
After the vision of the burning lake, I experienced a panoramic review of my entire life, after which a Christ-like figure approached and conversed with me.

421
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,320
Hey, how you doing?

422
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:15,900
Yeah, hi.

423
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,280
I awoke back in my bed at home with Uncle Henry and Auntie Em leaning over me.

424
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,640
Are you okay?

425
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,860
Yeah, I just had a horrible... Let me have a drink. Get away from me.

426
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,800
It was real. You were there.

427
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,280
I did you.

428
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,940
Did you dream that you saw scorpions?

429
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,920
Don't cut your nose off to spite your face. Don't you understand? Most of the money in this project is yours.

430
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,800
Don't remind me. You know, I'm sick of supporting you in this stupid project.

431
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. Welman and Stang, secretly recorded. The only problem is you can't tell which is which, and whether it was before or after my sex change operation.

432
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,260
Ah, yes, dear friend. Someone's got to be there.

433
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Yeah, I'm glad you're perhaps pissed even if you haven't gotten the she lies to the crowd.

434
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,280
Ferem Watson may have assumed there'd be magic in her.

435
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,200
But I still can't believe she'd at least know how to wrap charme up.

436
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,420
Maybe the осв macabre can heal the spirit of familiars

437
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:17,760
Once Vengeance check me, and I will live with you for a quarter of two months, and hopefully the burnt behind me,

438
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:17,760


439
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:26,320
See strength, but if your hit or loss dies...

440
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,020
And I ever said she's rich they curse and torment me away

441
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,580
Have a 만 Sunday day whenapps will rise andken with Giants.

442
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:50,780
in Atlanta and some of my collection. I've just been kind of throwing it all together. We heard music by Steve Slack. We heard Dr. Dinosaur on the air. And I've got some home recordings, you might say, of the spectacular Atlanta Devival.

443
00:24:51,860 --> 00:25:05,240
As it turns out, out of all the tapes that were recorded, the only fragments that really sound clear enough to use on the radio were things that were recorded on my little $30 handheld deck.

444
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:17,020
I was carrying it around, making just a private tape for a friend. You know, here we are backstage. Oh, here, listen to Dr. Legume for a minute. Oh, here, listen to Susie for a minute.

445
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,080
And that turned out to be the only record.

446
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,180
And that turned out to be the only recordings that we have in which the microphone was actually pointing at the thing that was making the noise.

447
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:45,820
It was just a bad, bad luck. It happens very frequently that there will be a lot of machines turning and spinning, and yet, when it all comes down to it, all the best recordings were taken away.

448
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,360
Just taken to the vortex. Took them. Just took them away. The demons.

449
00:25:50,780 --> 00:26:00,700
So Catfish, comes and takes the line recordings and makes the bar employees forget to flip the tape.

450
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,420
The bottom line is if you don't want something done, you're going to have to do it yourself.

451
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,040
And that's why Susie the Fluzie sisters handles the castration ceremony there.

452
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,800
A couple weeks later, something completely coverage of it.

453
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,780
There's a castration about to happen.

454
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,760
We are down here in these تع geral aqui o profundidade.

455
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


456
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


457
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


458
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


459
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,560
We're about to witness a live castration.

460
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,460
Reverend Rockingham has this shiny knife.

461
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,200
Very nice.

462
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,320
A lovely knife sitting on a leopard skin pillow.

463
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,820
Susie has got the guitar player ready to expose himself.

464
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,280
This is really disgusting.

465
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,080
This is a big improvement over those other saucer cults.

466
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,400
Because unlike those other saucer cults,

467
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,840
Bob won't make you do something stupid like this.

468
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,940
Susie uncellently saws away at the testicles of the poor individual guitar player.

469
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,440
All video cameras, zoom in.

470
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,140
Stang vainly begs for video footage.

471
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,740
We haven't actually got any.

472
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,980
But it was, friends, it was a mighty looking member.

473
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,240
It was a mighty sacksack.

474
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,280
That she took that blade to Susie.

475
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,440
The beautiful harlot of the Church of the Sun.

476
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,300
Listen to her song.

477
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,540
This guy was quite a manly fellow.

478
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,280
See, he just smoked a cigarette because, you know...

479
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,220
Bob's not going to make you do some damn fool thing like that.

480
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,520
And don't feel sorry for Brother Bill because Bob does provide for his flock.

481
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,540
Bill will have a complete set of brand new testicles by the time the show's over.

482
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,200
And if you don't believe me,

483
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,380
check for your show.

484
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,460
You're going to have to do it yourself.

485
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,880
While he unmails himself from the public, come on, right now.

486
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,580
He's coming at us, though.

487
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,040
Come on, come on.

488
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,120
Jesus Christ!

489
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,340
Oh, Jesus just stepped up on stage.

490
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,500
Jesus is speaking at the subgenius show.

491
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,520
I can't believe it.

492
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,340
Thank you.

493
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,360
Ah, ah, feels good.

494
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,520
Mmm, Atlanta at last.

495
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,260
I am the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God.

496
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,460
Thank you.

497
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm back.

498
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,660
Nice restaurant, kid buddy.

499
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,980
Thank you. Thank you very much.

500
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,560
Well, I am now the business manager of the church of the subgenius.

501
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,560
Um, I'm not going to talk a lot about myself tonight

502
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,760
because there's a man who's more important to me

503
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,100
that I'd like to talk about.

504
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,040
And that's J.R. Bob Doggs.

505
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,420
Yeah!

506
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,800
Now, what I'm doing tonight is, um...

507
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,340
Well, hey, Bob.

508
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,620
You've never had to say this, y'all.

509
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,860
This is Subgenius 101.

510
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:47,960
Yeah.

511
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:47,960


512
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,680
Well, we, as I say, only recorded bits and pieces of this thing.

513
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,460
We'll run down and see what else there is, uh,

514
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,780
what else we can overhear backstage

515
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,060
among the strange, creepy subgeniuses.

516
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,540
That's superb, all my hate.

517
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm, I'm wiping the hate off my inseam now.

518
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,360
Oh, the hate is running down my leg.

519
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
Oh, the hate. Oh.

520
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,440
Oh, man.

521
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:29,160
Suzy has just wandered in in her full bustier completely wrapped in police...

522
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,460
Police barrier tape.

523
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,260
Suzy is wearing police barricade tape.

524
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,620
.

525
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,740
.

526
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:36,740


527
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:36,740


528
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:36,740


529
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:36,820
.

530
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:36,820


531
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,140
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

532
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,580
Abandon hope all ye who enter her.

533
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,040
Doctor Leguim's getting all dressed up in a nice suit.

534
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,580
Uh-oh, I'm worried now.

535
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,780
Anybody have the pudding?

536
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,760
Quick, pudding! Quick, pudding!

537
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,180
Pudding.

538
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,040
Whoa, whoa, ah, yes, we're back, dear friends.

539
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,740
You can tell.

540
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,180
The most feared, so to speak, says Mom.

541
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,740
Mom, Dr. Katahdin Leguim.

542
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,460
Give it up for him.

543
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,300
No, no!

544
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,080
Oh, yeah, we're here tonight to save the unsaved.

545
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,000
Do we have any unsaved in the audience tonight?

546
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,520
Do we have any born-agains in the audience tonight?

547
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,860
I don't see any hands raising up.

548
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,940
Come on, do we have...

549
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,080
Oh, you bunch of chicken shatters, I know you're out there.

550
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,860
Oh, yeah.

551
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,580
You know, any other time you'd be saying,

552
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,160
well, I don't have to worry about nothing because if I get in any trouble,

553
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,620
Jesus will come and save me.

554
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,220
But you won't raise your hand to put that to the test, will you?

555
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,640
Oh, yeah, brothers and sisters.

556
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,920
Well, I'm here tonight to tell you Jesus is not going to save you.

557
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,400
Oh, yeah.

558
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,980
Jesus doesn't want nothing to do with all you who are unsaved.

559
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,840
He doesn't want anything to do with the subgeniuses either,

560
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,620
even though he was up here talking to you earlier.

561
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,760
Oh, yeah.

562
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,780
Friends, and that's where the...

563
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,560
Somebody came up and started talking to me.

564
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm standing there with my arm up in the air pointing at the...

565
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,560
holding a tape deck pointing at the PA and...

566
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,440
They always want something.

567
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,860
Let's see what we can scrape off of the video...

568
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,400
the otherwise useless videotaped soundtrack.

569
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,140
Hmm.

570
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,460
Oh, man, it is so depressing.

571
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,880
On my recording, all you can hear is this Bobby jabbering at me.

572
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,800
Instead of listening to... I mean, Dr. Legume is up there delivering this great rant.

573
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,840
And instead, this guy has to pick this moment to come over and kiss my butt.

574
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,140
Oh, man.

575
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,400
The prognosis is not good.

576
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,920
Oh, man. I'm sorry, folks.

577
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,220
Here's what Dr. Legume sounds like on the other best recording.

578
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,300
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm supposed to say one thing, man.

579
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,980
After some of your actions, I'd like to know how they bought the 1998.

580
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,700
That's still a year away. I've got time.

581
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,860
Well, time is a funny thing. It has the tendency to creep away from you.

582
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,260
Yeah, time has a way of raping you like a horned cellmate.

583
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,940
Oh, don't trust anybody under 30, friends.

584
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,900
Well, let's go back.

585
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,420
Let's go back to my handheld deck and see if there's anything we can peel off of this thing.

586
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,040
Oh, okay. Yeah.

587
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,040
The Bobby finally quit jabbering at me when Dr. Legume knocked over the pulpit

588
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,660
and pulled out this great big clock and started smashing it with a hammer.

589
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,720
This got the kid's attention.

590
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,500
This guy finally quit kissing my butt at this point.

591
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,620
Time controlled this, friends.

592
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,080
Yeah, we got away again.

593
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,140
We don't have to get up in the morning and go to work now.

594
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,680
After all, what's going to wake us up?

595
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,900
Yeah, but you can smash clocks.

596
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,460
You can kill time. Time will fly unless you kill it.

597
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,700
But some of you don't want to kill time.

598
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,260
Some of you are slaves to time.

599
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,860
Some of you are shackled at the risk.

600
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,060
To time.

601
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh, yeah.

602
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,220
And you don't want to kill time.

603
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,660
But the time is coming.

604
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,140
The time is coming when the world is going to be like a clock.

605
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,200
It's going to be ticking down.

606
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,960
It's going to be turning.

607
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,160
It's going to be working its way down to zero.

608
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,500
And this world is going to be like a clock.

609
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,800
And then it's going to be like a clock.

610
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,720
It doesn't make sense.

611
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,040
You don't want to be a clock.

612
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,220
You know what I do?

613
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
You're going to be a prisoner.

614
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,900
Don't drop the clock.

615
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:09,900


616
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:09,900


617
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,260
Don't drop the soap.

618
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,420
Oh, yeah.

619
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Because there's going to be somebody waiting right behind you when you do drop the soap.

620
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:26,180
When you're in the showers on prison earth, don't drop the soap.

621
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,900
That's right.

622
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,940
Your membership in the church is a subgenius.

623
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,140
It's like a big old dab of Vaseline.

624
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,140
And then the bobbies attack again and it goes like that.

625
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,180
Yeah, we got a hole in our head.

626
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:54,240
You know what goes up, the wall is over the top.

627
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,300
It's $50.

628
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,900
It's $100.

629
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:58,900


630
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,020
I did pop to go to the habit.

631
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,400
I didn't even naturally think I was going to get burned.

632
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,320
ITY Wow there.

633
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,900
While I was the doctor, what were the other omega that you were supposed to do?

634
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,460
keep falling out the back.

635
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,600
Okay, well, so much for...

636
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,580
That's all there is

637
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,580
from Dr. Leguim.

638
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,740
It's what I get

639
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,820
for

640
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,680
not bringing my own

641
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,300
equipment. Anyway,

642
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,740
there seems to be a little bit

643
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
of Sister Susie the Floozy, the

644
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,900
most difficult person to record. You really

645
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,620
have to walk right up in there

646
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,420
with the... You have to get

647
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,900
close to Sister Susie

648
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,800
the Floozy and her red,

649
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,700
red, red hair and her

650
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,280
soft, soft,

651
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,880
smooth, bounteous

652
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,380
white buzzer.

653
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,940
It's the only way to get a good

654
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,220
recording.

655
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,300
And you know which side of it you're on.

656
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,400
You're on the same side as all, baby.

657
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,040
Drop!

658
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,380
Three, four, five, drop!

659
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,120
Oh, they give you nothing

660
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,620
real, nothing solid,

661
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,180
nothing of substance, nothing you can

662
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,140
latch onto and give it a

663
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,820
good lap, I think.

664
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,440
Yeah.

665
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Get off to the floor with your own slack.

666
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,940
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

667
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,580
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

668
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,720
They don't let you have a good

669
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,700
time. They give us a hard

670
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,460
time for launching fake heads.

671
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,640
Oh, you know what? About when we're gonna be

672
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,980
launching the real ones.

673
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,500
We're gonna be singing a different tune then.

674
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,740
Oh, but

675
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,160
yes.

676
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,620
Seekers, how it would be if

677
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,740
X-Day never

678
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,280
came.

679
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,600
What would our future

680
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
be then? How could you

681
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,700
face living in a world without irony?

682
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,560
A world without slack?

683
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,800
A world without fault?

684
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,480
Marching that endless lockstep with

685
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,440
a zombie Christian legion?

686
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,380
Oh.

687
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,500
Are you yeti enough to exist

688
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,340
like that?

689
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,220
I don't think so.

690
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
So are you

691
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,320
ready to die gasping

692
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,000
on cat box earth?

693
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm ready.

694
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,040
Oh, yeah? Or would you rather suck in that sweet

695
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,360
crappy aerophone?

696
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,400
I wanna die.

697
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,220
Oh, because we're living at

698
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,920
right angles to the human swarm,

699
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,360
seekers. And for the last aching

700
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,260
year of existence, it's like we're

701
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,220
standing on the corner of walk and

702
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,000
don't walk. And we're naively

703
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,020
standing there waiting for that little

704
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,900
sign to change like it's actually

705
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,860
connected to something. But

706
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,180
Seekers is not a point of walk or don't walk.

707
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,940
It's time to run!

708
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,100
We're hurtling headlong into

709
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,640
the final Ragnarok.

710
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,260
400 and how many days left?

711
00:37:59,560 --> 00:37:59,880
28.

712
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
428 days.

713
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,840
Oh,

714
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,560
God.

715
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm getting excited

716
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,700
just thinking about it.

717
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,240
Oh, yes.

718
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,300
So it's time to start living

719
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,420
this subgenius life like it really means

720
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,280
something. Because

721
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,060
let's party like it's

722
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,260
1998, bucko. There

723
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,280
ain't no snooze alarm on the end

724
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,320
times and they're coming up. We're not

725
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,020
gonna be able to just roll

726
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,860
over and snooze away.

727
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,360
Because I think

728
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,260
about everything that's happened in the world.

729
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,200
Since I joined the church some 16

730
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,380
years ago.

731
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,040
I mean, a whole lot of big,

732
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,520
ugly, deadly, rancid

733
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,140
things have happened in this world

734
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,000
since 1981.

735
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,840
But do you know that all of it

736
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
ramped up together

737
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,560
and a big stick

738
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,520
of fog

739
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,660
can be the demonic

740
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,160
slag and alio that is promised to us

741
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,220
in the pre-church.

742
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,160
With a little

743
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,460
soap in my hole.

744
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,940
And with a little hope in my soul.

745
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm going to pull

746
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,640
myself up on my own

747
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,520
grass traps and we

748
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,760
fully into Bob's Twilight

749
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
Zone. Because

750
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,180
like Mama said,

751
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,060
life

752
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,100
is like a box of condoms.

753
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,940
It doesn't matter whether you wind up

754
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,180
with one of them French ticklers

755
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,180
or one of them

756
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,420
ripped numbers.

757
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,200
The end

758
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,240
results is safe.

759
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,020
You still wind up getting

760
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,980
but she says Bob

761
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,740
and Connie will

762
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,680
Bob you good.

763
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,300
I'm not going to

764
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,220
give you what your spirit is

765
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,420
crying out for.

766
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,620
Yes!

767
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,900
But it's at a price.

768
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,240
Like all good things.

769
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,420
But hey,

770
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,140
how can you measure

771
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,840
the street value of slag?

772
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,300
Well, on the newsreport,

773
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,060
I'm sure it would be jacked up

774
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,100
to insane astronomical heights,

775
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,120
but the actual price is a mere $30.

776
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,100
Oh, and for $30,

777
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,420
you get a complete

778
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,220
cerebro-skeletal reaming

779
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,620
from the ground up.

780
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,840
You go out and price that.

781
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,700
You look through the yellow pages

782
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,600
and you're not going to find it anywhere

783
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,820
at any price.

784
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,260
But we've got it, baby.

785
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
We got it bad.

786
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,460
Oh, so now,

787
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,560
the church dickens

788
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,840
are passing out among you,

789
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,680
carrying Xerox pages

790
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,020
from the new unreformed,

791
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,520
unrepentant church of the subgenius

792
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,800
hymnal and take-out prayers

793
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,580
within you.

794
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,300
But please, please, don't slash your throats

795
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,140
with the razor-sharp paper edges

796
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,740
we've added you, at least

797
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,980
not yet.

798
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,740
And I'm doing this,

799
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,340
because in this church,

800
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,640
you're paid a free association.

801
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,240
But we haven't really been acting much

802
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,560
like a real church.

803
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,060
The idea of a real church is

804
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,020
fellowship,

805
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,680
friendship,

806
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,080
sex and drinks,

807
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,740
and a good sing-along.

808
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,060
Oh, so we're already halfway

809
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,360
to being a good church

810
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,440
by accepting the doctrines of our faith

811
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,940
without question or logic.

812
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,740
And attacking anyone

813
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,320
who sees things differently.

814
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,180
But I'm getting pretty tired of you

815
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,380
seekers sitting out there

816
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,100
in your own pew.

817
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,720
So yes, we're all going to sing along

818
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,260
if the tape machine is working.

819
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,440
Because I'd like some spiritual interaction

820
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,300
with you seekers.

821
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,180
There's a lovely song.

822
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,380
Hymn 999 by G. Don Truby

823
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,060
is interpreted through the brain filter

824
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,120
of Pastor Craig.

825
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,320
So sing along, seekers.

826
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,420
Now everybody, I want you to sing along here.

827
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,960
This is so lovely.

828
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,080
There's nothing to fear

829
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,900
if you just send us a dollar.

830
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,760
No, no, actually, I'm not going to.

831
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,700
We won't.

832
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,420
I think Friday Jones and I are singing this.

833
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,980
Do the sonnetto, vave.

834
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,840
The hurricane's eye.

835
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,900
There's a pipe in the sky.

836
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,660
There's a pipe in the sky.

837
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,520
Oh, the pipe in the sky.

838
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,500
And then I will follow it anywhere.

839
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,540
Oh, anywhere.

840
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,440
Anywhere, yes, indeed.

841
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,440
The floor of the ocean.

842
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,820
Oh, to the mountains.

843
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,860
And the mountains so high.

844
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,060
Oh, the mountains.

845
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,540
So high.

846
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,040
I'm not telling you to go out and kill Christians.

847
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,720
I would never tell you to go out and kill your enemies.

848
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,940
But if God were here, rest assured, he would.

849
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,300
You know, New Agers have been going on and on for years

850
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,580
and years about how a crystal can be used

851
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,820
to bring about world peace.

852
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,160
I say, why visualize world peace when it's 1,000 times more

853
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,940
satisfying to visualize a stark, righteous vengeance?

854
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,920
Now, for the, and I happen to have a hate crystal here.

855
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,820
Now, in order to.

856
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,040
Um.

857
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,560
Properly channel the energy of a hate crystal,

858
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,020
a hate crystal must be held in the left hand.

859
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,420
The eyes must be closed.

860
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,480
The disciple face is east.

861
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,060
While watching the breathing, the right hand on the heart.

862
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,620
The meditation lasts 30 seconds.

863
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,560
The crystal is then hurled full force into the victim's head.

864
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,140
But it was enough to tear away just a huge chunk,

865
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,340
the entire crystal.

866
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,220
The entire front of the federal building.

867
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,140
As they started the rescue efforts,

868
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,100
they were about 30 minutes into the rescue efforts,

869
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,760
30 to 45 minutes in.

870
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,180
That was when they were alerted to the presence

871
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,840
of the other two devices.

872
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,780
And that put the brakes on the rescue and evacuation efforts.

873
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,780
We're getting word of another bomb threat now, Devin,

874
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,080
to talk about the two after the initial blast.

875
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,420
Our crews are being moved back in downtown Oklahoma City.

876
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:34,500
And we'll reiterate again what these later devices

877
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,240
are doing to the rescue efforts.

878
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Time is so valuable right now as they try to get to these people

879
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,800
who perhaps somehow are still hanging on to life inside that building.

880
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,080
And each delay, every time the firefighters and the rescuers

881
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,340
are called back and brought back down off of their ladders

882
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,480
and scaffoldings just could be exacting a terrible, terrible toll

883
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,740
on the people who are already inside.

884
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,480
Yes, it is.

885
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,580
And we talked earlier about the two undetonated bombs

886
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,940
that were found that were bigger than the device that exploded.

887
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,220
And of this other one that they're looking at now,

888
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,340
it turns out to be something.

889
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,400
It appears that it was meant for this building to come down,

890
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,420
to be leveled because of the amount of power

891
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,540
that could have gone off.

892
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,380
Only one explosion that was obviously tragic enough,

893
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,740
but there were more bombs set to go off,

894
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,440
according to ATF officials.

895
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,220
I touched the crystal to my heart.

896
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,720
I touched the crystal to my heart.

897
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,840
I touched the...

898
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,220
Are we getting my best side on this?

899
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,980
Yeah. Yeah, beautiful. Yeah.

900
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,140
Okay, the lighting, okay, face that camera.

901
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,960
Yeah, we can edit this part out later.

902
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,760
Yeah, drop in some New Age music, something like that.

903
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,440
Yeah, I think...

904
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,660
I think that'd be...

905
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,420
Solid. I think it'll look beautiful.

906
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,620
I touched the crystal to my heart.

907
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,640
I touched the crystal to my heart.

908
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,460
And it's a beautiful journey into massaging your universality

909
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,300
in which we...

910
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,760
You'll get this back when you have woken up, my friend.

911
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,200
I'm sorry. I just...

912
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,040
I'm just trying to massage my inner dolphin nature.

913
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,080
Well, you're gonna massage your dolphin in somewhere else.

914
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,960
I've been worshipped and fed and treated like a high priest

915
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,100
for telling people things they want to hear.

916
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,900
Good medicine men are born, not made.

917
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,720
Come and see me sometime, my boy.

918
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,160
Even you'll take off your hat when you see how respected I am.

919
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:28,720
Yeah.

920
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,060
How bad is Bob ripping a dog?

921
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,800
Bob could be ripping...

922
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,220
The question was how bad.

923
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,780
How bad is Bob ripping us off?

924
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,320
I'll tell you what, friends.

925
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,840
If Bob was really ripping you off,

926
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,540
do you think we'd be able to make the offer of eternal salvation

927
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,400
or triple your money back?

928
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,960
Sure.

929
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,220
Granted, we'll be the first to admit and warn you

930
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,760
that Bob Dogz could be ripping you off majorly.

931
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,140
It could be that our invisible monster is just as much a bunch of bull

932
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,400
as all the other religions.

933
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,460
But, hey, you know, one of those religions has got to be right.

934
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,780
Why not this one?

935
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,760
And, uh...

936
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,360
Kill me.

937
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,540
You know, and like I say, yeah, sure Bob's ripping you off,

938
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,080
but you're being ripped off every day.

939
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,940
You might as well learn to enjoy it.

940
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,620
We're just trying to teach you to accept these things with an unblinkered vision.

941
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:40,140
Sure, it's depressing as hell to actually read the newspaper

942
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,720
or watch the news and truly understand

943
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,920
the incredible living horror that you are witnessing.

944
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,000
But that's right.

945
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,540
There's only...

946
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,060
If you could get real depressed about the situation of the world today,

947
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,580
and how much good is that going to do you, friends?

948
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,380
The point of life is slack,

949
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,980
and you are not going to be able to share slack

950
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,100
or be a quote, good person,

951
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,260
if you don't have slack yourself.

952
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,180
You can pretend to be.

953
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,620
You can act like Mother Teresa and go,

954
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm only doing it for the others.

955
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,580
But, I mean, let's be honest,

956
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:27,420
you know, yes, it would be great if everyone was equally rich without working.

957
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,740
But that will only happen if J.R. Bob Dobs becomes

958
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:36,540
world overlord and a dictator crushing you all under his shack book.

959
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,060
And I know you'd love it.

960
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,520
But the steady escalation of the amount of explosives on the street

961
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,100
and the invention of a bright yellow truck which disappeared without a trace

962
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,000
doesn't solve the problems the ATF officials

963
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,860
and the obliging media representatives are dealing with.

964
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,040
Such a car or truck bomb simply couldn't have taken out

965
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,020
those support columns of the federal building.

966
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,360
Doctor, we are just shocked at this,

967
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,040
what happened here in the heartland of America.

968
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,720
Should we be shocked?

969
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,940
Is it true that you go hunting with Mr. Nugent

970
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,900
up on Drummond Island in Lake Huron?

971
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,100
Yeah, Nugent, Nugent's a trip.

972
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,780
Nugent gets down. Nugent...

973
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,960
Care to tell us some deer hunting stories with Uncle Ted?

974
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,400
I remember one time I was riding with Nugent.

975
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,280
We were going down past the 405.

976
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,300
We were on the 405-63-70219 freeway.

977
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,260
And we were going about 85 miles an hour.

978
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,060
And this pig pulls up right next to us.

979
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,680
And Nugent just reaches down on the floorboard.

980
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,720
He just holds up a brick.

981
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,180
He didn't say nothing. He didn't do nothing.

982
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,100
Just held up a brick.

983
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,760
That pig did not do nothing.

984
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,860
He did not do...

985
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,280
I love that story.

986
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,160
He did not do anything.

987
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,320
He didn't do nothing, did he?

988
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,380
I don't know if I ever told you about my vision of heaven.

989
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,840
This is one that I probably share with a lot of people in Arkansas.

990
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,980
Okay, you're in a Trans Am,

991
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,700
or let's say a Z car,

992
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,920
model after 1987,

993
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,720
say, oh, say, 93.

994
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,580
Okay, you're driving towards a concert.

995
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,260
Okay, you've got Nugent right there on the road.

996
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,780
You've got ZZ Top right there on the center stage

997
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,700
playing mostly from Cat Scratch Fever,

998
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,720
some stuff from Double Live Gonzo,

999
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,560
some stuff from the first album, Ted Nugent.

1000
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,340
You've got ZZ Top over here on the right stage.

1001
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,600
You've got Foghat playing mostly from Fool from the City

1002
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,520
over here on the left stage.

1003
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,300
You're going 90 miles an hour,

1004
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,220
but you don't ever get any closer to the concert.

1005
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,280
You remain at optimum distance at all time.

1006
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,820
And you've got Cheryl Teague and Kathy Ireland on the floorboard.

1007
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,140
We won't go into that on TV.

1008
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,120
Can't do that.

1009
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,380
Any time you run out of weed,

1010
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,980
a pig pulls up, twists off a hooter,

1011
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,880
just throws it in your car window.

1012
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,200
That's my concept of heaven, a Ted Nugent concert.

1013
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,740
What would be your concept of purgatory?

1014
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,920
I don't know.

1015
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,620
I don't know.

1016
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,020
Jane or don't know, man.

1017
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,420
Jane or don't know.

1018
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,400
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1019
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:38,020
You have been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack

1020
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,300
on which we play bits and pieces of tape from a million different places,

1021
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,620
most of them some way related to our humble little religion,

1022
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,900
the religion based around the teachings of Bob Dobbs.

1023
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,080
And you can get free information about that religion from Bob at,

1024
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,200
got that pencil ready?

1025
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,620
I'm about to give the P.O. Box number and this is it.

1026
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,820
Write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

1027
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,780
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1028
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,900
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306,

1029
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,900
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1030
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,960
We'll draw those dollars out of you dear friends.

1031
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,500
And now to our confessions.

1032
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,460
I have to admit something very horrible to everyone here.

1033
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,520
Yesterday we robbed a grave.

1034
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,300
.

1035
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:47,360
.

1036
00:52:52,520 --> 00:53:00,180
Jesus, Susie the floozy and myself robbed the grave of John Benet Ramsey.

1037
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:00,580
.

1038
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,200
I'm not proud.

1039
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,580
I'm actually not proud.

1040
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,180
Many of you may not have known this,

1041
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,520
but that little girl who was murdered a few months ago,

1042
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,420
according to National Enquirer,

1043
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,340
probably by her dad, this ex-pervert, and so on,

1044
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,720
the beautiful little, little, uh, peep, uh, beauty,

1045
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,380
woman, six-year-old girl that was murdered.

1046
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,960
She is buried here in Atlanta in an unmarked grave.

1047
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,920
Susie figured all this out.

1048
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,260
She saw it on television and was able to work out where it was.

1049
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,420
Took us to the grave yesterday.

1050
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,760
And sure enough, John Benet's older sister has a marker there.

1051
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,360
It's definitely the grave.

1052
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,220
It is in Atlanta.

1053
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,880
It's the little murdered child.

1054
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:54,640
And surrounding the unmarked area where the darling little creature is buried and rocking,

1055
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,340
it's got a bunch of, uh, toys.

1056
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:03,920
You know, people brought flowers and little toy unicorns and little toy lions and stuff.

1057
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,480
And letters, friends.

1058
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,220
Letters written to the murdered child which we stole off that grave.

1059
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,380
.

1060
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:11,900
Sick, friends.

1061
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,580
I know that.

1062
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,380
.

1063
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:13,460
.

1064
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:13,460


1065
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,260
Well, shucks.

1066
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,300
That's funny.

1067
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:31,200
I, it looks like I knocked my tape deck off of the pulpit.

1068
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:37,800
And my reading of those letters from John Benet have been replaced by this weird background music.

1069
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,620
Isn't it bad?

1070
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,220
That's, that's, uh, this was supposed to be, what?

1071
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,320
What in the world tape was this being recorded on?

1072
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:58,420
Well, what a series of surprises we've received. My confessions, I guess, are lost also to the

1073
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:08,900
expert recording skills of Niiiigi, the evil one who does indeed follow us around and tries to get

1074
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:16,660
the funny stuff. That's it, man. It's a dead tape. Well, let's see what else there might be.

1075
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:25,240
Well, I'm fast forwarding down through this stuff trying to find... The band was good. Trying to find...

1076
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:32,560
I can't find the letters that we stole from the grave of JonBenet either. This seems to be... I

1077
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,420
should never ever ever believe anybody when they tell me that they're recording this stuff.

1078
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,420
This is what Dr. Dinosaur's songs sound like.

1079
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,420
Well, it just doesn't seem like an hour of actual slack, does it?

1080
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,340
I'm gonna sap... I know what I'll do. I'll sap all the slack out of you listeners. That's what I'll do.

1081
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:06,380
I probably already have and didn't even know it. Yeah, yeah. Then I'll sell it to the feds and they

1082
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,880
can trade it to the the greys, the grey aliens. They can sell it to the feds and they can trade it to the

1083
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:08,880


1084
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,820
greys. That's why they blew up that building was just to get... They had to pay off the greys with

1085
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:19,560
253 souls. That was all... They threw a few extras too, huh? Yeah, it looks like I was recording my

1086
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:26,240
rant over the top of a country western music radio tape that my daughter... I must have stolen from my

1087
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:34,880
daughter. I knocked my deck off when I went to reach for the JonBenet corpse letters. The tape

1088
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,860
deck got knocked off the pulpit and that was the end of it. But I did... I for... I think I did a

1089
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:38,860


1090
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:38,860


1091
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,340
flip the tape over and record later on in the evening.

1092
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,100
We have a lot of new people here, right?

1093
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:49,500
But is it any weirder than a bunch of Catholics in Naples

1094
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,280
who once a year get together to see if the blood of St. Januarius

1095
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,420
will liquefy, fearing that if it doesn't, the world will end?

1096
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,860
Is it any weirder than crying statues and bleeding black velvet paintings?

1097
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,860
I don't think so.

1098
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,820
Oh, yeah.

1099
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,720
But these are just lies and conspiracy figures,

1100
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,700
lies about their invisible god monster.

1101
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,280
Oh, yes.

1102
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,900
They lie to you about everything.

1103
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,440
They don't want to tell you that everyone in England are all robots

1104
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,780
or that the moon's only the size of a grapefruit and it's only three miles away.

1105
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,260
They don't want you to know these things.

1106
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,700
Oh, yeah.

1107
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,020
No, these are all just lies to them.

1108
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,460
And we have our own lies.

1109
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,380
But the difference between our lies and their lies

1110
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,580
is that our lies are all true.

1111
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,380
And our lies have bigger...

1112
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,220
Dear John Bonnet,

1113
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,500
you are loved more now than you have ever been.

1114
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:01,040
The ones that say they love you the most is the one that hurts you.

1115
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,860
They will be judged by a new set of judges soon,

1116
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
signed God.

1117
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,120
Dear John Bonnet,

1118
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,800
you're a beautiful young lady who is treated very wrong

1119
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,460
by two people who say they loved you.

1120
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,340
You were in pain and knew what was happening.

1121
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,160
If only everyone else could see,

1122
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,220
you would still be here with us.

1123
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,080
The ones who love you the most are the ones who made you life hell

1124
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,760
and end in such tragedy and pain.

1125
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,580
God will get mom and dad.

1126
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,780
We love you and we miss you,

1127
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,480
but you're free at last and in a better place.

1128
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,900
We hated to see you go,

1129
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,220
but Jesus has his arms around you and no one can hurt you anymore.

1130
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,400
Here is a beautiful horse, a unicorn,

1131
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,420
and he sets an example of how free you are.

1132
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:02,120
My three children really love you and they talk about you all the time.

1133
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,660
So they want you to have their unicorn so you can be free.

1134
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,660
We love you.

1135
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,240
You sweetheart.

1136
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,320
We left a letter there.

1137
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,680
We didn't just take.

1138
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,500
We left a letter there saying the same thing basically.

1139
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,360
Signed Jesus, Susie the floozy and Reverend Stan.

1140
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,640
And you know, we meant it too.

1141
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:34,740
God will get mom and dad, John Bonnet.

1142
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,400
You know, one of these days,

1143
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,640
somebody's going to come up to me and say,

1144
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,800
you know, you're going to put a curse on us.

1145
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,300
Probably the dead child.

1146
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:49,060
And the only way to remove the curse will be to burn the note stolen from the grave

1147
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,540
of a child murdered by her parents.

1148
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,660
So we'll be ready friends.

1149
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,180
If you must cook at home,

1150
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,720
you could be unleashing the very beast mentioned in the book of oil or grease.

1151
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,200
Take a look at the last time.

1152
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:13,840
Jack.

1153
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,220
Wait.

1154
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:14,880
No.

1155
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,520
For a day.

1156
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:16,540
Then I had.

1157
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:16,880
.
