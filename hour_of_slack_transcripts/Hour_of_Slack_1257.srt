1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,320
Your mind is my mind.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,300
Your every thought is my thought.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,940
What I tell you to do, you will do.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,740
What I tell you not to do, you will not do.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,040
No.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,160
No, stay where you are.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,660
For this is a time of slack.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,360
This is the slack hour.

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,400
Why what, my boy?

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,040
Why must you humiliate me in public like this?

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,380
I didn't mean to humiliate no one, son.

12
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,640
But, caller, that's his job.

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,140
I'm not even actually present.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,940
But if I were, I would not humiliate you.

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,200
Dr. Howell is the friend of all humanity.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,840
His humiliation exists solely within himself.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
Now, you know, son,

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,340
modern electronics can reliably count small numbers of electrons

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,140
down to a single number.

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,140


21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,140


22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,140


23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,140


24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,140


25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,440
A single particle.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,580
So if one electron is ripped from the outer shell of each atom,

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,260
then the electrons are counted,

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,680
the number of atoms will be known,

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,760
and then lasers can be used

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,080
as versatile and efficient guns

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,280
for knocking electrons out of atoms.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,020
Only the method is not in these bits selected.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Select gun now.

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,480
If one climbs the food chain

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,120
and loses all threats to existence,

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,660
does he wither?

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:55,820
No.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:56,980
No.

39
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


48
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


49
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


50
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


51
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,140


52
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
The question may also be an evolutionary strategy,

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,440
perhaps of our genes,

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,000
to increase their concentration in the gene pool of humans.

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,380
And are we not the constructs

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,060
used by those at Galactic Center

57
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,340
to learn of the universe

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,200
and bring back a recording in 2012?

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,660
Until then, remember,

60
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,060
the clowns at the circus, they're real funny.

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,400
This is...

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,440
The Soul Genius Hour of Science.

63
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,120
The Soul Genius Hour of Science.

64
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,220
I'd advise you to continue to cooperate.

65
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,900
If it is a good recording,

66
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,400
i.e., makes sense, works, is efficient,

67
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,420
such as a gene for sacrificing oneself

68
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,240
to let live two or more fertile phenotypes

69
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,760
carrying that same gene.

70
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,460
But we constantly,

71
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,140
and in best human action typically,

72
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,960
diverge, converge, merge, emerge

73
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,140
as new unleashed beings.

74
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,140


75
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,140


76
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,140


77
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,740
the sun, but not new under the sun.

78
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, that's right, dear friends.

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,760
Nothing new under the sun, except that this is the all-new subgenius hour of Slack.

80
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,460
Unmatched, which means it's almost as good as the competition, with incredible design

81
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,160
simplicity.

82
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,560
Costs cut to the very bone.

83
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,500
Foolproof operations.

84
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,240
Satisfaction guaranteed and microprocessor controlled.

85
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:37,360
However, the Church of the Subgenius and KNON are not responsible for fractures of interdimensional

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,820
consciousness, cellular, oral incontinence, nor personal violence resulting from close

87
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,980
contact with the macroverse of pain and retribution, which is this show and this church.

88
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,220
Remember, always sit at least 25 feet away from your receiver for maximum subliminal

89
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,560
penetration.

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,040
We remind you that recording the Subgenius Radio Ministry is a federal crime punishable

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,900
by a fine of not less than $10,000 and a minimum prison sentence of not less than 15 years.

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:14,420
A reproduction by digital, cassette, wire, video, heliograph, Xerox, or interocitor recorder

93
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,320
is forbidden by law.

94
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,180
Right?

95
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,740
Yeah, I know you heard me.

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,820
I know you heard me on that one, dear friends.

97
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,500
It was an accident.

98
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Kill pigs dead.

99
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,040
Kill pigs dead.

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,360
Kill pigs dead.

101
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,720
Kill pigs dead.

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,460
Kill them.

103
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,860
Ba ba ba ba ba ba

147

Friends, Bob does kill pinks dead.

148
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,660
I'm afraid he really does.

149
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,280
And I've got proof of it right here.

150
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,660
In fact, it's the proof that we've been waiting for all this time.

151
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,300
I'll let the Reverend Gino Saad's music run in the background here

152
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,200
while I read to you this amazing clipping we got

153
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,920
from a member, a subgenius minister in England.

154
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,560
Reverend Annie McGrath sent us her change of address

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,700
and also a photocopy of this article,

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,040
this completely straight and dead serious article, friends,

157
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,440
from the Bedford on Sunday Times.

158
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,020
I think I ought to do this without.

159
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,620
Music.

160
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,400
From the Bedford on Sunday Times.

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,240
And it's got a photograph printed here.

162
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,500
It's a picture of a wall on which is spray-painted Bob's face,

163
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,580
a nice stencil of J.R. Bob Dobb,

164
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,900
with kind of crossed bones underneath it,

165
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,980
and then hand-sprayed on.

166
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,400
It says, Bob is slack,

167
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,480
a standard subgenius graffitis that one sees, you know, in most major cities.

168
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,380
And a little caption underneath, Bob is slack.

169
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,280
Not the end.

170
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,900
Innocent graffiti.

171
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,520
It originally seemed to be.

172
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,400
The headline is,

173
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,860
Satanic sect shows its face.

174
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,360
And the best part of this is the date is July 6th, 1992,

175
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,760
the day after X-Day.

176
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,360
That was the day that this article appeared,

177
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,040
just by coincidence, perhaps.

178
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,020
But these folks are serious, I believe,

179
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,880
and they say here,

180
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,180
a secret religious sect,

181
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,120
which claims to have,

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,720
conjured up the Gulf War,

183
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,900
is infiltrating Bedford.

184
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,300
What was thought to be a harmless pavement graffiti of a man's face,

185
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,520
is actually a sketch of the sect's founder,

186
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,800
Bob Dodds.

187
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,160
That's Bob Dodds.

188
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,160
Now we know his real name.

189
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,520
Who now calls himself a high priest.

190
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,280
The magician's genius is a sect from America,

191
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,080
which is growing in size in Britain.

192
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,080
It is believed the main target is,

193
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,040
adolescence.

194
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,080
The sect's doctrine and practices are mainly unknown,

195
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,400
but members did claim to have conjured up the Gulf War in February,

196
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:26,920
91,

197
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,440
according to the Independent newspaper.

198
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,940
I'd sure like to get a copy of the Independent.

199
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,440
The word slack,

200
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,980
used under some of the stenciled art,

201
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,360
is a description of a power of the human race,

202
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,220
lost thousands of years ago.

203
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,860
Slack is a power which maintains the tranquility of the race.

204
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,560
They got that part right.

205
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,240
The artist,

206
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,540
or,

207
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,600
artists responsible,

208
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,660
have not been found.

209
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,440
It is a clear sign there is an active unit of the sect operating in Bedford.

210
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,500
Followers hold believers meetings in their homes,

211
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,900
and during the day,

212
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
carry out normal,

213
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,020
everyday jobs.

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,400
The sect concentrates on supernatural powers and beliefs,

215
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,980
which other Christian denominations term as satanic and evil.

216
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
Bedfordshire on Sunday,

217
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,260
reported last week,

218
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,880
how the face of Bob was peering up from a number of pavements across Bedford.

219
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,720
The design is used to publicize the image of the sect.

220
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,900
In other adult comic magazines,

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,300
the symbol is printed in the small advertisement section,

222
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,820
asking people to send one pound for more information.

223
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,680
A man who said his identity as a follower of the sect must be kept secret said,

224
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,340
quote,

225
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,140
this graffiti is intended to grab people's attention.

226
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:55,060
The design slips into your subconscious and will emerge when people learn more about the sect.

227
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,220
Dear friends,

228
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,260
I have been waiting for twelve years to get a clipping like that.

229
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,340
And, of course, we've run a thousand copies of it.

230
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,600
It'll be a part and parcel of all membership packs from now on.

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,140
It's proof, dear friends,

232
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,120
it's as good as the time the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the mass media,

233
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,920
the Macintosh virus,

234
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,000
was a result of this evil sect started by this J.R. Bob Dobbs,

235
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,400
who was unfortunately assassinated and killed.

236
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,340
And see, it's in news, it's in print now,

237
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,680
that Bob Dobbs was a man who was killed in January of 1984.

238
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,820
What they never bothered to print is that he was resurrected about six months later.

239
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,560
But, well, that's another part of the story, friends.

240
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,860
Someone left the radio station on.

241
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,280
I'll just sit down and broadcast for Jesus.

242
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:02,440
Now, you know that Yehob in the old greasy book was turned into a pillar of coal by Jehovah One

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,540
because he pisseth against the wall.

244
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,920
And when they were done, it so happened that came unto them the fishers of three wallets,

245
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,420
who were the Abhag-i,

246
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,940
and they moved into the land of Grunthor,

247
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,560
where there is Bdilium and the Onyx Stone.

248
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,000
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

249
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,960
If you would like a free picture of me in compromising positions,

250
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,520
write to Aunt Bertha,

251
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,220
dial a picture,

252
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,720
Box 1, Grand Rapids, Michigan,

253
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,360
848-445.

254
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,180
Goodbye, now.

255
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,620
Goodbye.

256
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,060
Hey, what?

257
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,780
That flash, that light.

258
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,060
It disappeared.

259
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,780
What was that?

260
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,680
Well, it was somebody in here.

261
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,740
It kind of looked like just a flash of light shaped like an old lady.

262
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,100
But that organ music, hey, is this ever corny.

263
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
What's going on around here?

264
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah, whew.

265
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,340
Now, get that organ music off.

266
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,840
You know, it's almost that.

267
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,520
That's KPFA.

268
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,760
Hey, you smell that old lady like perfume?

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
Where'd that come from?

270
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,420
Oh, yeah, a little bit of Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence there from the KPFA Berkeley Subgenius show.

271
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,060
It's so nice that they send us tapes of that show,

272
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,020
and when the Swingin' Love Corps is cut off, I can cut them on again,

273
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
because they, too, send those tapes.

274
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
What is your captain?

275
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,620
I have many questions.

276
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,520
You wouldn't hit a coward now, would you?

277
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,660
God, not only have I lost my mind, I've lost my calm.

278
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,400
You're like a question machine.

279
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,780
Watch out. He's probably on his fourth tranquilizer by now.

280
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,860
My pants are haunted! My pants are haunted!

281
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,740
But you just remember this, and don't you ever forget it.

282
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,360
When you see me walking down the street in my elevator shoes,

283
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,140
remember it was you that did it.

284
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,780
Shazam.

285
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm flying on a U.S. passport.

286
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
A small community in central Arkansas is in ruin

287
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,500
after President Obama's election.

288
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,800
President Obama tore through it last night.

289
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,220
At least one woman was killed when Mr. Obama hit her home

290
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,920
about 80 miles north of Little Rock.

291
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,860
The White House says the president flattened several buildings,

292
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,280
toppled power lines, and overturned vehicles.

293
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,640
President Obama's were also reported in other parts of Arkansas last week.

294
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Meanwhile, President Obama continues to creep toward land,

295
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
ready to help battle PR News.

296
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,120
The left-leaning president says he's shooting for total state control.

297
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,880
If you didn't mail in your census form,

298
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,780
you may very well get exploded tomorrow.

299
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,460
But aides are not saying exactly what time.

300
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,420
Legitimate census workers will ask people for bank account numbers.

301
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,000
Chinese authorities are interrogating an airline passenger

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,220
who told a plane crew that he had PR News in his Washington.

303
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,140
Music, religion, pills, beer, smoke, all rise.

304
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,520
Boy wise.

305
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,100
But that's not the end of the story.

306
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,080
Let's continue our journey.

307
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,700
On the cutting edge of what you call growing like a good man,

308
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,340
slamming to not good,

309
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080
frustration is worse than paranoia.

310
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,800
It's the only world we've seen where this is the case.

311
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,700
It's the only world we've seen where this is the case.

312
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,320
The only world we've seen where this is the case.

313
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,180
You grunt until all your grunting is done.

314
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,400
The best I've heard all day, recurring events we already knew about.

315
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,080
It's not different.

316
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,000
It's difficult to retain your slack.

317
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,980
What is the opposite of emergency anyway?

318
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,480
Pizza, calzone, panzerotti, burgers, wings, shawarma, curry, bok choy, ribs, steaks, potato, pasta.

319
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:56,840
That was The Psychoskeletons as found in the wild at soundclick.com slash thepsychoskeletons.

320
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,540
Praise Reverend Story.

321
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:08,480
We're busy here gearing up for X Day, July 5th when the world ends and we have a big party.

322
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,720
Also, we've been creating new, for once authorized,

323
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,860
subgenius foundation Facebook page.

324
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,260
And we have Starwood coming up right after X Day on the escape vessels.

325
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:31,960
So, as you hear, this episode of Hour of Slack, number 1257, is part old and part new.

326
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:39,620
That new was, of course, by the aforementioned Psychoskeletons and the great Mr. Lee Murr,

327
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,140
who also did PR News and the titles.

328
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,080
And before that, there was a little...

329
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,060
Collage by Mr. Rection.

330
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,360
And the old is mostly from Hour of Slack number 371 from 1992.

331
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:04,640
But with the obsolete and outdated parts militantly smashed and replaced with a juicy sermon

332
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,860
by Papa Joe Mama from a devival in 2002 in Tampa.

333
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,840
Or was that in Indianapolis?

334
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,000
Or...

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,160
Or...

336
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,160


337
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,480
Tucson?

338
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,400
No, not Tucson.

339
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,360
Anyway, this is that sermon.

340
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:26,120
And friends, I love just how evil and sick and incorrect politically is that man,

341
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,620
Father Joe Mama!

342
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:29,840


343
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,140
Wait! Wait! Wait!

344
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,000
The sermon for the John L. Cornell community.

345
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,700
Yes, dear friends, it is true.

346
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,180
The truth hurts.

347
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,520
And our good friends, I think it's fair to say, if there's a single ally in the world that we love more than any other,

348
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,640
it's probably got to be...

349
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,880
Al-Qaeda.

350
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,400
And they have a saying over there, friends, and it goes like this.

351
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,900
He who tells the truth should keep one foot...

352
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,740
In the...

353
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,560
Europe.

354
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,380
Now, when he's talking about gynecology, I don't know.

355
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,400
On to the sermon.

356
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,620
The sermon tonight is entitled...

357
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,480
Reparations.

358
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,380
Because there has been a recent movement afoot to sue various companies, if not the government itself,

359
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
for slavery in the 1800s and before.

360
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,080
Lawyers figure if they could work around the...

361
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,600
Statute of Limitations and collect four billion for the internment of World War II Japanese,

362
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:56,020
and then sidestep the century-old Swiss banking laws to squeeze out another four billion for Jews who lost their account numbers,

363
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,440
then some schmuck, some schmuck should be able to extract a few billion more from the powers that be

364
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,240
for the kidnapping, rape, and enslavement of various African ancestors.

365
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,220
So tonight, we're going to examine this controversial topic.

366
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,200
And consider the true ramifications in regard to this man, Bob.

367
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,600
Of course, any subgenius worth their salt can tell you that slavery, the ramifications for slavery,

368
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,640
are, to put it charitably, a joke.

369
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,740
It's nothing more than a smokescreen to camouflage the conspiracies, ongoing enslavement of the masses today.

370
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,060
Today!

371
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,200
Do I hear praise Bob?

372
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,660
Praise Bob!

373
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,960
Attention all humans!

374
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Attention all humans!

375
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,600
Stand by for an important revelation.

376
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,960
People do not go to work on a volunteer basis.

377
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,980
They are compelled to go.

378
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,940
And show up, hat in hand,

379
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,060
begging to serve their conspiracy masters,

380
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,800
or else they starve in the streets!

381
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,240
Oh sure, you can call it employment,

382
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,380
and come up with all sorts of fancy, soundy names like free enterprise and capitalism if you want.

383
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,800
But make no mistake about it, it's still slavery, plain and simple.

384
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,140
Only now, my friends, they've repackaged it and put it in a new container.

385
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,060
Now it's wage slavery.

386
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,060


387
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:51,620
Yes, because the conspiracy eventually realized a very important little point.

388
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,820
They realized that it's always cheaper to rent than it is to own.

389
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,820
And we all know how they love to cut costs.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,880
Do I hear praise Bob?

391
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,220
Praise Bob!

392
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,260
Praise Bob indeed!

393
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,660
The old time slaves, my friends, they were never paid for their work.

394
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,480
Oh, that difference is true.

395
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,740
But they were also given the bare necessities of life so that they could survive.

396
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,420
Food, clothing, shelter.

397
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,160
Wage slaves, however, they're given little pieces of paper,

398
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,120
which they're told are quite valuable,

399
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,720
but which the conspiracy in fact mass produces like toilet paper!

400
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,780
Then, those same workers are expected to turn around and fork over much of that same little pieces of paper,

401
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,740
so that they can buy the same necessities that they used to be given for free!

402
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,380
Oh!

403
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,020
Plus, they're also expected to give another 20 or 30 percent for taxes!

404
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,960
For what?

405
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,920
To the conspiracy in order to control their lives!

406
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,640
Yeah!

407
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,440
Oh!

408
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,860
And if anyone refuses to pay the conspiracy its tax,

409
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,640
what happens?

410
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,100
It's off to the big house!

411
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,180
The house of pain!

412
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,580
Free enterprise indeed!

413
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,900
But now, now there's always a certain percentage,

414
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,820
and we all know them too well, don't they?

415
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,260
They're made to be celebrities!

416
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,760
We're supposed to respect these certain workers that work for their slave masses so much

417
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,400
that they earn extra pieces of paper.

418
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,800
They're allowed to retire and stop working

419
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,780
to serve as motivational examples for the rest of society!

420
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
If we work really,

421
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,560
really hard,

422
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,340
then we also,

423
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,520
we also might be able to retire.

424
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,420
And, we're told, if we follow the rules,

425
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,240
be just like them!

426
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,720
Better yet,

427
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,920
if we really make it,

428
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,320
oh, and this part's great, friends,

429
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,740
if we really make it,

430
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,140
we'll be able to rent our own slaves!

431
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,000
That's right!

432
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,960
Then we'll be just like Pinky!

433
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,200
We'll be able to afford our own servants!

434
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,980
Incredible,

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,660
but so, so true.

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,560
Yeah.

437
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,000
Yet, you see, friends,

438
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,600
the sad fact is

439
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,220
that money doesn't really matter.

440
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,700
Possessions doesn't really matter.

441
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,400
The only thing in life that really matters

442
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,980
is life itself.

443
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,360
We're all given only so much of it,

444
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
and the moment it's gone,

445
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,560
we die.

446
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,640
And no more free minutes.

447
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,720
The conspiracy,

448
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,820
the conspiracy knows us

449
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,740
and can't stand the realization

450
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,380
that they were given the same amount of time

451
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,240
as the rest of us.

452
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,140
So what do they do?

453
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,180
They immediately set out

454
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,480
and devise new ways

455
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
in order to capture,

456
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,740
take away,

457
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,300
and control all the free time of others!

458
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,900
Yes, my dear friends,

459
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,200
that is how slavery began.

460
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,400
And they started to use it

461
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,260
so that they could get more goods

462
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,200
and services at the expense of others,

463
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,820
the so-called servant class.

464
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,300
Oh, a little problem occurred, though.

465
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,840
Over time, they started to realize

466
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,280
that slavery was more expensive

467
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,260
than it might otherwise be,

468
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
so they devised this new

469
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,040
rent-a-slave concept.

470
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,900
Ha ha.

471
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,900
And it also had an added benefit.

472
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,040
There were no more escapees.

473
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,780
Remember that?

474
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,020
A few people might run away.

475
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,100
This way, with rent-a-slaves,

476
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,140
if they disappear,

477
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,720
another one quickly shows up

478
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,940
to take their place.

479
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,060
Ha ha ha!

480
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,960
In fact, they'll even compete

481
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,780
for their privilege!

482
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,860
Incredible!

483
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,700
And yet, that's the beauty

484
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,480
of their system.

485
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,280
It's a much more easier

486
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,540
and efficient way to do it, isn't it?

487
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,360
And best of all,

488
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,120
the slaves don't even realize

489
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,660
they are being controlled.

490
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Oh, how that must have seemed

491
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,840
like the days of Camelot to the Khan.

492
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,020
The golden age of domination and power!

493
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,920
But then something terrible

494
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,980
happened, my friends.

495
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,000
A leader appeared,

496
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,860
who demanded in a thundering voice,

497
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,160
to let my people go!

498
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,420
His name wasn't Moses,

499
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
although he spoke with the authority

500
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
of Jehovah One.

501
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,460
His name wasn't Harriet Tubman,

502
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,880
although he ran an underground railroad

503
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,820
to freedom.

504
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,040
No, sir, his name was, is,

505
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,340
and shall ever be,

506
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,300
J.R. Bob Doe!

507
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,680
And he won't rest

508
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,040
until the very last of genius is free.

509
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,540
Will you give me a praise, Bob?

510
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,020
Praise Bob!

511
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,800
Praise Bob!

512
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,040
Praise Bob!

513
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,180
Now, if the African Americans

514
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,340
wish to legitimize slavery

515
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,280
by accepting a monetary payment

516
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,980
for the past,

517
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,060
that's their business.

518
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,480
Then the Khan will print up

519
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,960
more pieces of paper,

520
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,900
hand it over, and brag,

521
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,100
well, then, now that closes

522
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,960
the books on slavery,

523
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,720
we said we were sorry,

524
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,320
and promised never to do it again.

525
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,220
Weak, weak.

526
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,980
So, uh, stop complaining,

527
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,140
and get on back to work.

528
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,620
Now, if that's not bad enough,

529
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,320
my friends,

530
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,440
there are some pink conspiracy whores

531
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
who have even gone so far as to say

532
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,360
that the blacks should be thankful

533
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
for slavery.

534
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,960
They joke amongst themselves

535
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
that the lucky ones were captured,

536
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,060
domesticated, and transported

537
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,340
to a civilized nation that offers

538
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,700
social programs like five years,

539
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,720
five and higher long years of welfare.

540
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,280
Oh, aren't they so fortunate.

541
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,360
And if they were back in Africa,

542
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,300
they sneer.

543
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,540
The Negro might be starving

544
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,700
or swatting flies

545
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,360
or waiting to contract AIDS.

546
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,020
Oh, but now he just follows the rules,

547
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,720
cheers plenty of pink little butt,

548
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,760
and doesn't cause any trouble.

549
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,780
He'll get a warm place to sleep

550
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,480
and a loose pair of shoes.

551
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,060
The arrogance.

552
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,820
The outrage.

553
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,840
Oh, how the conspiracy could even dare

554
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,880
to think such things.

555
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,900
That should be all the proof that we need

556
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,760
that you cannot compromise with the con.

557
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,680
No, sir.

558
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,200
These aren't rational beans.

559
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,080
They're monsters,

560
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,640
and they only understand one thing.

561
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,580
One thing,

562
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,580
and that's brute force.

563
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,680
Bob Dobbs knows this better than anyone else.

564
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,200
Yes, my friends,

565
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,060
and he's going to make sure

566
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,440
that he doesn't settle

567
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,060
for such a cheap cop-out.

568
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,080
No, sir.

569
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,740
The subgenius race

570
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,000
will not accept a settlement

571
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,640
for the past or the present.

572
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,300
We refuse a presidential apology.

573
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,320
And we will not accept the pink,

574
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,440
oh, we're so sorry, pink guilt platitudes.

575
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,360
We can't toss out words

576
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,040
and they won't be permitted to just say,

577
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
oh, we're sorry and throw money our way

578
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,900
and then claim to be paid in full.

579
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,520
No, sir.

580
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,660
We demand payment

581
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,820
in a more precious commodity,

582
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,160
one that they could relate to, perhaps.

583
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,740
For every lifetime taken,

584
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,020
we expect one to be forfeited

585
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,040
plus interest.

586
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,300
Now, I'm not saying whether that means

587
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,820
the conspiracy slave masters

588
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,080
and their overseers

589
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,440
must be euthanized

590
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,260
or made slaves themselves our next day.

591
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,940
That is, after all,

592
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,080
a question that evangelicals

593
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,380
and Holocausters

594
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,560
are still trying to sort out.

595
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,860
But I will say this.

596
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,000
All subgeniuses agree on this one premise,

597
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,580
and that is this.

598
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,180
We will never forgive and forget.

599
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,120
Do I hear a praise bob?

600
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,740
Praise Bob!

601
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,760
Praise Bob, indeed.

602
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,400
The conspiracy is not the only one.

603
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,120
Bob is the only one

604
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,440
who can hire certain bill collectors.

605
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,480
Bob Dobbs is bringing the entire fleet

606
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,840
of them here to Earth on X-Day.

607
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,740
And on that fateful day, my friends,

608
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,040
at 7 a.m.,

609
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,440
he's going to unleash the entire force

610
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,640
on the conspiracy.

611
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,800
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

612
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Yes, the pinks will then know

613
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,420
the true meaning of Bob's pipe

614
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,160
as they struggle and scramble

615
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,200
to pay the piper.

616
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,320
We, on the other hand,

617
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,820
will finally have our chance

618
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,140
to truthfully look towards the heavens

619
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,560
and sing in unison,

620
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,520
free at last, free at last.

621
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,700
Praise Bob, almighty.

622
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,960
We're free at last.

623
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,140
Here is the word of Bob.

624
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,160
Praise Bob.

625
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:48,780
Amen.

626
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,100
We just had someone call in

627
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,360
a little while ago

628
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
with a pertinent question,

629
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,340
a question which I can answer.

630
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,020
This poor child,

631
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,780
I know this sounds like a line

632
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,760
you've heard on a subgenius revival before,

633
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,160
but this poor child actually called up

634
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,900
and said, well, she didn't ask if Bob was dead.

635
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
She said, Reverend Stang, is Bob immortal?

636
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,320
And one thing that our new book is going to do

637
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,480
is clear up a number of misconceptions.

638
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,320
And misconception number one,

639
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,540
is that Bob is dead.

640
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,420
That is an absolute misconception.

641
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,220
It's a lie, a black lie.

642
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,240
Of course, they started making accusations

643
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,420
that the inner circle had murdered Bob

644
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,180
to get power ourselves.

645
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
And of course, finally,

646
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,520
we had to tell everybody that Bob wasn't real

647
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,540
so he couldn't be dead.

648
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,480
And since he wasn't real, he was immortal,

649
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,980
and that's a lot better than real.

650
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,120
And even Bob liked that one, friends.

651
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,380
But you want to know just how dead is Bob.

652
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,240
And you'll be glad to learn

653
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,020
if you haven't the unquestioning faith before

654
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,220
that J.R. Bob Dobbs is completely undead

655
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,320
and undead for good.

656
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,780
You may already have heard that J.R. Bob Dobbs

657
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,120
was allegedly shot and killed

658
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,180
on January 21st, 1984

659
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,740
at the Victoria Theater in San Francisco.

660
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,840
You may not know that it happened again

661
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,880
in Los Angeles in 1985,

662
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,860
in rural Arkansas in 1986,

663
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,240
in St. Louis in 1988,

664
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,680
and in Atlanta in 1992.

665
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,480
Now, according to Dobbs' own account,

666
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,140
after each bungled resurrection or assassination,

667
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,940
and or assassination, same thing in his case,

668
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,360
he was immediately dispatched back to hell.

669
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,660
But he repeatedly lucked his way out of hell,

670
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,180
winning the Hell Gladiator Games,

671
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,840
beating the devil at poker,

672
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,900
even digging his way to the surface.

673
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,060
Although he was re-killed and sentenced

674
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,500
even deeper into hell,

675
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,020
after each breakout or reincarnation,

676
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,260
the daring escapes still proved humiliating to Satan.

677
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,740
When, finally, Dobbs out-tempted Lucifer

678
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,680
and seduced his wife.

679
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,760
Put horns on the devil, you might say.

680
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,960
It was the last straw and Bob Dobbs was banished.

681
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,400
Banished, dear friends, even from hell itself.

682
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,680
And since he was never baptized,

683
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,260
of course, Bob has never been able to enter heaven either.

684
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,640
So there is nowhere for Bob to go in death now.

685
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,380
It is because Bob was killed so many times,

686
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,420
and yet is banished from all available afterlives,

687
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,620
that he now cannot die.

688
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,640
He can only wait around for X day here on earth

689
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,900
with the rest of us,

690
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,900
at least until he is baptized or Satan forgives him.

691
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,720
I hope that answers any questions.

692
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,920
As we like to say, friends,

693
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,260
curiosity killed the cat,

694
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,000
but loathsome rituals brought it back.

695
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,340
Bob and Lal was all we needed.

696
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,460
But she was lovely and great

697
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,460


698
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,740
and and sweet railing,

699
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,580
andyeong jagars and

700
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,520
andyeong daggeneration!

701
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,300
And see you soon.

702
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,040
Friends, this music you're listening to, instrumental, called Bob.

703
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,560
It's the title of it, Bob.

704
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:24,040
Done by St. Jay Condom, author of the great P-Dawg comics

705
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,400
and many, many other fine subgenius pieces.

706
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,440
Co-author, in fact, of the Lee Harvey is a Friend of Mine song that so many people love.

707
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:40,080
This music is on the Zombo Fropland cassette tape.

708
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,200
You'll have to refer to your subgenius catalog for that.

709
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,020
I'll give information on where you can get that at the end of the broadcast, dear friends.

710
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,420
Ah, yes.

711
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,740
Ah, yes.

712
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,480
But I think it's time for some more text.

713
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,180
This is from the Rudy Schwartz Project.

714
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,400
Once again, Reverend Joe Newman, this time doing this lovely short tune,

715
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,760
An Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

716
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,480
An Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

717
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,680
An Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

718
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,840
Nine-year-olds that kick you in the shin.

719
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,720
Toilet bowls with droplets on the rim.

720
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,520
Leisure suits with polyester trim.

721
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,380
And an Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

722
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,360
Pepperoni pizza by the slice.

723
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,300
Ronald Reagan's go-to dinner vice.

724
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,800
Chinese food and bass with a bowl of rice.

725
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,480
And an Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

726
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
And an Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

727
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,300
Shopping malls on Sunday afternoon.

728
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,260
Watching grandma vomit with a spoon.

729
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,040
Harvard that you're squatting on a broom.

730
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,780
And an Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

731
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,960
This inspection's pretty red.

732
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,860
Making for a chef will give you head.

733
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,040
Pupsters that are dead.

734
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,380
Rotting in your bed.

735
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,480
And an Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

736
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,340
An Orange is Nothing But a Juicy Pumpkin.

737
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,900
Your next gold كوچ.

738
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,160
iPhone, iPad, mouse, and brush is indeed free And your car's about treatin' now

739
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:47,320
My dall, quiser this?

740
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,580
Where's your hat?

741
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,860
What do you say?

742
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,440
The

743
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,420
clown on the

744
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,680
Thank you.

745
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,400
Thank you.

746
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,080
Thank you.

747
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,520
Thank you.

748
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,480
Oh, amazing.

749
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,060
Yes, dear friends, and I have to be careful.

750
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,440
What I play on any given...

751
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,600
Did I do that right? Yeah.

752
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,800
Any given old Rudy Schwartz project album,

753
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,300
you do have to be careful what you come up with next.

754
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,680
Wonderful stuff.

755
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,480
In the background right now,

756
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,880
Zooks Rift and a Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz project.

757
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,740
Only I think this is on an upcoming Zooks Rift album.

758
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,140
We just wanted to let you know what you're getting into.

759
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,300
You know, we have to be able to say later in court

760
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,820
that we gave you plenty of warning.

761
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,680
I mean, what are you worried about?

762
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,240
This is just a joke church, right?

763
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,800
Oh, those subgeniuses are so funny

764
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,400
with all their paranoid warnings and disclaimers.

765
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,920
Well, here's one coming up.

766
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,900
Here's a paranoid warning and disclaimer

767
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,040
by a German band.

768
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,000
Called Ultimate Klingons.

769
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,680
Their album, The Cloaking Device.

770
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,060
Actually, it's a cassette tape that was handed to me

771
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,300
at the World Subcon by Captain Nancy Darnell,

772
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,740
who is an American subgenius

773
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,820
who's been living in Germany for a long time.

774
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,780
And according to the PR she gave me,

775
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,500
The Cloaking Device is

776
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,200
the turn of the Ultimate Klingons.

777
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,680
Contact me.

778
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,660
I'll be ready.

779
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,100
Thank you.

780
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,080
To the humanoid.

781
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,700
Scalar Technology.

782
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,200
Brain Tech Food Waves.

783
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,180
And here's a good one.

784
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,120
Acclarung der Illuminaten machen Schafen.

785
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,280
So, and Gitarn Alster Wils

786
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,500
in der Kirche of Subgenius.

787
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,260
Bob Dobbs, High Epoch of the Church of the Subgenius.

788
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,880
Uber Day CD.

789
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,960
Dies Band, says Bob,

790
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:36,180
So Captain Nancy Darnell now and Ultimate Klingons from Cloaking Device will sing to you about the conspiracy.

791
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,660
Them. They. T-H-E-Y.

792
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,360
T-H-E-Y.

793
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,780
I'll write it again.

794
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,840
T-H-E-Y.

795
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,700
I'm responsible for everything.

796
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,340
I'm responsible for everything.

797
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,020
They tell you what to think and they tell you what to do.

798
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,600
They got you going to work, a mind shut and stop.

799
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,200
Watch your TV and you never get enough.

800
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,680
T-H-E-Y.

801
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,180
I'll write it again.

802
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,140
T-H-E-Y.

803
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,460
Whoa. Amazing.

804
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,920
The Cloaking Device there, dear friends.

805
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,720
From Germany.

806
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,940
Americans from Germany, you might say.

807
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,340
I'm going to give their address real quick for those typing illegally.

808
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,400
That's Nancy Darnell.

809
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,080
At Briesester.

810
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,960
B-R-I-E-S-T-E-R.

811
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,040
That's all one word.

812
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,360
7-D-1000.

813
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,840
Berlin 44.

814
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,020
Well, now you know.

815
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:39,840
And, uh, friends, you know, do you realize this religion has only been around for 10 years?

816
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,300
We're just starting out.

817
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,620
We are literally just beginning.

818
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,460
The Mormons have been around for 100 years.

819
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,260
And they only run one minor state and a bunch of Indian reservations.

820
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,800
It took Christianity.

821
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,060
A thousand years to conquer the West.

822
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,280
But look at what a small band of nerdy intellectuals was able to pull off in Russia in 1917.

823
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,740
So, with radio, television, and thousands of computer geeks slaving away for Dobbs,

824
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,060
it shouldn't be long before the Church of the Subgenius is so big that even you would be afraid of it,

825
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,800
as well you should be.

826
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:18,060
For, just as we can grow faster, we must be even more cautious than the Christians.

827
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,940
We must not allow the word of Bob to be perverted.

828
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,260
We must not allow the word of God to be perverted quite so drastically and get away from us so quickly as that of Jesus.

829
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,160
That's the scariest thing about this.

830
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:34,320
You'd better be glad most subgeniuses are sloppy no-accounts, slackers, lousy business people,

831
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,060
far more concerned with personal slack than with power or money.

832
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,420
If we had it together as much as the Christians, or even for that matter the O.T.O.,

833
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,740
we'd be bigger than the Nazis by now.

834
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,940
And it's so horrifyingly easy to start a real cult and manipulate a bunch of Indians.

835
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,820
And you know that knowledge has always fallen into the wrong hands.

836
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,460
Now, Dobbs, on the other hand, may have a better chance than Jesus in not getting his message twisted.

837
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,340
Bob is a salesman and not a lowly carpenter, and he has the advantage.

838
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,300
He understands advertising.

839
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,320
Now, Jesus didn't really understand selling a concept.

840
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,940
Bob was able to start his own marketing strategy, not leaving it up to the followers.

841
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,920
Now, whether or not you're a follower of the Church of the Subgenius,

842
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,420
whether Bob is selling the same message as Jesus,

843
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,220
well, we'll just have to find that out on X-Day.

844
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,560
But who else can you trust when the rupture comes?

845
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,120
I mean, we'd be the first to admit that our promises, predictions, dire warnings and stuff sound insane,

846
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,860
but what if they come true?

847
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,040
And that what-if part is what keeps most religious people in line.

848
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,980
But what if hell is real?

849
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,500
That's the only thought that keeps most folks sitting in the pews.

850
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,960
They don't really believe they'll go to heaven or any afterlife.

851
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,480
If they were, sure, they'd jump off a high bridge as soon as they got depressed over bills or something.

852
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,260
But no, they slug their way on through life just in case.

853
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,800
Some subgeniuses may not believe that X-Day is actually gonna happen,

854
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,460
but they damn sure have that $20 membership card in their pockets just in case, don't they?

855
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,620
But we understand, friends.

856
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,460
You may not have the strongest faith that X-Day will happen,

857
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,840
but you're none too sure it won't happen either.

858
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,300
You're just being smart, staying prepared for either outcome.

859
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,960
And that's why we say don't give away all worldly goods before X-Day.

860
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,420
It might not happen.

861
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:44,320
But leave some-definitely leave some kind of paper, legal paper, stating that in case of rupture,

862
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,280
your property goes to your desired unsaved friends and relatives

863
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,960
and not just any old left-over property.

864
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,220
And that's why you're not gonna be able to get a job.

865
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,820
You're gonna be left behind Christian who wants to move from an empty home.

866
00:47:53,980 --> 00:48:00,900
And besides, will you even want to rupture when Jehovah One throws the cosmic switch?

867
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:09,660
Oh, many would rather stay, friends, since who knows what fate lies in store once back aboard that wondrous craft.

868
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,280
Oh, you must know!

869
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,780
You must know your destiny!

870
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,360
So don't die without slack, friend.

871
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,700
So be afraid, and think as much as possible about everything that comes your way.

872
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,260
The only wonder is the Pontiff.

882
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,920
perceiving the unsullied truth

with no subjective bias?

Are you ready to do

00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,740
whatever Bob says

886
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,820
to swallow his every

887
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,160
statement, hook, line, and sinker?

888
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,140
Even if he someday tells you

889
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,200
that you, you must push

to their unbelievably

00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,360
painful doom?

894
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,080
Hey! Now some may

895
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,040
resist the possibility that

896
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,980
man's purpose may be to do

897
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,440
exactly what he is doing,

898
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,780
blindly pursuing his techno

899
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,080
madness until he wipes

900
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,840
himself out and causes a great

901
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,720
cataclysmic planetary change.

902
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,580
One of those cyclical

903
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,860
rearrangements which the Earth goes through

904
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,220
every few million years.

905
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,780
Now mankind, through Bob,

906
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,420
might be meant

907
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,960
to set off a nuclear holocaust

908
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,540
so terrible that even the mighty

909
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,980
cockroach will be extinct,

910
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,300
leaving nothing alive but blind

911
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,400
albino cave snakes and those

912
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,780
mysterious worms that live

913
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,360
where no other life can survive,

914
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,000
clustered, writhing senselessly

915
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,720
around volcanic heat vents

916
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,780
in the deepest, coldest

917
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,860
depths of the ocean.

918
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,580
Only for the purpose, though, of giving

919
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,600
that lowly heat vent worm

920
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,520
a chance to evolve

921
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,740
into the dominant life

922
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,640
form. Maybe it's just the fulfillment

923
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,520
of natural order. The dinosaur's

924
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,540
got their time. The mammals

925
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,680
have had their time. Maybe next time it'll be

926
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,720
the arthropods. Who's to say?

927
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,000
Only Bob!

928
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,500
Only Bob can say! But you can

929
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,520
rest assured, my friend, that

930
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,140
even if it is Bob's plan,

931
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,680
he at least will still be around,

932
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,620
probably down there with his

933
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,320
pants around his ankles, happily

934
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,580
humping away at a deep-sea volcanic

935
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,540
heat vent.

936
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,640
Oh, will

937
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,240
the pyramid of centuries

938
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,360
then be, in the end,

939
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,160
only a monument

940
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,740
to the vanity

941
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,980
of Bob?

942
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,520
Do you have

943
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,080
any better ideas?

944
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,700
...

945
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,920
...

946
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,740
...

947
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,500
...

948
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:12,100
...

949
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,000
...

950
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,120
...

951
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


952
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


953
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


954
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


955
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


956
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,420
...

957
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,420


958
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,420


959
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,420


960
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,420


961
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,420


962
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,440
...

963
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,440


964
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,440


965
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,440


966
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,440


967
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,660
...

968
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,220
...

969
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:20,380
...

970
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,760
...

971
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,380
...

972
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,620
...

973
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,320
...

974
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,760
morning

975
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,200
a new

976
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,180
ray of hope

977
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,820
for mankind

978
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,260
and your dead men

979
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,000
they are marching

980
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,320
in legions

981
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,400
to end the games

982
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,980
the ropes will

983
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,680
be hung

984
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,500
to speed you up

985
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,080
and your

986
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,880
young people are

987
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,460
leaving

988
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,880
their candles

989
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,020
like campfires

990
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,240
in darkness

991
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,180
to walk in the

992
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:15,880
sun

993
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,480
and your young

994
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,340
men and her follow

995
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,160
your teachings

996
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,140
now they know

997
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,640
how

998
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,580
you've done

999
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,840
and they've

1000
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,640
heard all your

1001
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,480
new sighted

1002
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,160
preachers

1003
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,540
now we

1004
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,560
know just what

1005
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,480
must be won

1006
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,600
and the sweet

1007
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,820
white light

1008
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,040
flows freely

1009
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,860
and clearly

1010
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,440
and break the

1011
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,560
now while

1012
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,440
you can

1013
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,460
and

1014
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,400
form a great

1015
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,540
circle

1016
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,360
that shall not be broken

1017
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,900
proclaiming

1018
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,500
the freedom

1019
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,200
of name

1020
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,760
that shall not

1021
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:50,760


1022
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,500
and the

1023
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1024
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1025
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1026
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1027
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1028
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1029
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,500


1030
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,580
oh

1031
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,560
yes dear friends

1032
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,700
quicksilver messenger

1033
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,440
service

1034
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,380
old-timey old-timey subgeniuses i reckon they are

1035
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:18,980
But you know, every sound like that cough is just a new note in the ongoing Doctors for Bob album that we're all recording right now.

1036
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,460
We only sell little tiny sections of it.

1037
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,800
Most people don't want to sit through the whole thing.

1038
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,580
Unfortunately, we have to.

1039
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,900
So give us a worst case scenario.

1040
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,480
I mean, what is your ultimate nightmare of the future of the religion?

1041
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,900
I mean, we're open for ideas.

1042
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,900
How often do you engage in unorthodox sexual practices?

1043
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,580
I mean, it's right.

1044
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,580
Your body escapes the feast.

1045
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,340
Voices fly away.

1046
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,300
The night time falls.

1047
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,320
Falling off the streets.

1048
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,980
Come for now.

1049
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,960
Touch me there.

1050
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,840
Make the worst.

1051
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,000
Insist.

1052
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,900
Come for now.

1053
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,860
Break the silence.

1054
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,080
Come for now.

1055
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,660
Break the silence.

1056
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,880
It's time to break the silence.

1057
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,880
It's time to break the silence.

1058
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,100
It's a sex party.

1059
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,320
It's an emotional breakdown.

1060
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,900
It's a sex party.

1061
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,720
It's a sex party.

1062
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,020
It's a sex party.

1063
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,060
It's a sex party.

1064
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,680
Oh yeah, that's right. Club No, friends up near Fair Park.

1065
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,900
No, I can't.

1066
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:03,060
But I can tell you that you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1067
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,880
Oh, actually, what you're listening to is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1068
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:14,420
Oh, actually, what you're listening to is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1069
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,460
Yo, what I got up there about the subgenius-

1070
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,880
Oh, what is that social service?

1071
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,960
Oh, a attainment of worship?

1072
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,020
Yeah, they're cleansing.

1073
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,020


1074
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,140
You can click on them and do this, just click on them..

1075
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,140


1076
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,240
funkань

1077
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,460
coke

1078
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:28,920
All that goes without saying.

1079
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,500
On, we will start the video from the first clip..

1080
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:30,940
..odd..

1081
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,780
ordained in the church of the subgenius. I'm about to give you the free

1082
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,160
post office box number to write to for information.

1083
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,700
This is completely free information. It would help if you threw in a self-addressed

1084
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,880
stamped envelope. Just address that to got that pencil ready.

1085
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,960
Bob at post office box

1086
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,020

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,040
44118 and also

1088
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,040
see subgenius.com

1089
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,860
And before I leave, I'm going to play you a cover version

1090
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,260
of a famous old song. This is such an improvement over the original.

1091
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,180
I've been wanting to play this for a while. It's Rudy Schwartz Project from his

1092
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,040
Don't Get Charred, Get Puffy album.

1093
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,360
Oh, you're going to love it. The horrible thing is you'll be humming it

1094
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,140
for days. Sorry.

1095
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Cracklin' Rosie, get on board.

1096
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,680
We're going to ride till there ain't no more to go.

1097
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,380
Taking it slow.

1098
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,800
Lord, don't you know.

1099
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:53,260
I'll have me a time with a poor man's lady hitching on a twilight train.

1100
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,060
Ain't nothing here that I'd care to take along.

1101
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,040
Maybe a song.

1102
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,320
Sing what I want.

1103
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,240
No need to say please to no man for a happy tune.

1104
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,920
Oh, I love my Rosie child.

1105
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,700
She got the way to make me happy.

1106
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,700
You and me, we're going in style.

1107
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,420
Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman.

1108
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,520
And you make me sing like a guitar strumming.

1109
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,280
Sing on your radio, girl.

1110
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,020
This song is for you.

1111
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,620
Oh, he's running home.

1112
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,720
Play it now.

1113
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,860
Play it now.

1114
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,380
Play it now, my baby.

1115
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,620
Cracklin' Rosie, make me smile.

1116
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,260
You're a rock star.

1117
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,040
Girl, if it lasts for an hour.

1118
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,020
Well, that's all.

1119
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,800
That's all right.

1120
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,340
We got all night.

1121
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,920
To set the world right.

1122
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,080
Find us a dream, but don't ask no questions.

1123
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:14,700
Yeah.

1124
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,360
Oh, I love my Rosie child.

1125
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,200
You got the way to make me happy.

1126
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,180
You and me, we're going in style.

1127
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,780
Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman.

1128
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,020
And you make me sing like a guitar strumming.

1129
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,720
Sing like a guitar strumming.

1130
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,260
Hang on to me, girl.

1131
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,160
This song is running home.

1132
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,400
Yeah.

1133
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,620
That's awesome.
