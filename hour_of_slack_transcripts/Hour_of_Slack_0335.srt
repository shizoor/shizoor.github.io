1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,900
Oh yeah!

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,200
Do you want to stand alone against the whole world?

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,240
There's no place for originality.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,340
We've tried to teach you the accepted historical style.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,340
You refuse to learn.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,700
No, can't you be a little...

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,960
Oh, how clumsy.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,200
No, no.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,540
Subliterally encrusted into the right there.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,400
I can't hear you in the headphones.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,280
Hello?

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,980
Can't hear you in the headphones.

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,980
Sorry.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
We're plugged in.

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,040
Okay, wow.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,600
Spent some time with Bob Dobbs.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,040
Right.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,620
The two are very difficult to hold up.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,540
Oh, it's very loud.

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,640
Yeah, I can hear you.

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,620
Oh, I can hear you very loudly.

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,480
Once again, conflict on planet Earth.

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,060
Problems all over the globe.

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,680
No one is certain exactly what happened last Memorial Day weekend when ten-year-old Puzzling

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,880
Evidence was jumping rope with some of his little friends in the Bronx.

26
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:57,960
Oh, no.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,080
Where are you going, Bob?

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,080


29
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,480
Look at him.

30
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,660


31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,680
It's nothing for him, this weird bad boy.

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680


40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,840
Okay, Robert needs aELLMğiNg a medios kinda team and just jumping with you.

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,800
Four years have past and he still searching for someone in his next life.

42
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,840
Don't worry.

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
No need to worry about it and be sure that we still provideagen to all of us.

44
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,480
I've got a feeling that the crisis will have another thing to do.

45
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,180
I would like to know if Bob Dobbs is just the most exemplary too the group of men he's

46
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,200
running to today, right?

47
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,440
Could you talk about his social Asian self and the reason why he's living here?

to the rave

105
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,780
found in the rave 4 game

106
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,240
found in the rave 4 game

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,960
well let me explain what's happening here

108
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,120
well let me explain what's happening here

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,500
it has actually been happening last week

110
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,740
your dear friend and prayer partner reverend stang

111
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,620
went to a

112
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,900
the first subgenius

113
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,700
devival in London

114
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,600
not London Texas

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
London England to preach

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,740
and it was a wonderful revival

117
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,440
we saved many souls

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,080
we set up many new business accounts

119
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,280
and even

120
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,200
established i think

121
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,680
a london office for the church

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,960
headed by our dear friend reverend Stang

123
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:56,500
lore. But the thing was, I got plunged into the rave scene in London, which I really didn't

124
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,560
know anything about. And if you're not familiar with it, well, you know, it's the music and

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,520
the pills and the mind machines and the jargon. Especially the jargon. Oh, it's a, it's a,

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,480
and these are ravey beats you're hearing in the background. Now, of course, many of you

127
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,100
are like going, well, duh, Reverend Stang, where have you been? Why, that was hip two

128
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:28,600
years ago. It's all sold out now. Well, that may be, but why, there's still some of those

129
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,860
customers out there waiting to buy more and they need more slack. And that was what we

130
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,720
were trying to preach, dear friend. Kind of interesting, the people I met, the subgenius

131
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,220
people in London.

132
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:50,900
This particular show or revival was sponsored by a group called Evolution or E-Volution,

133
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,140
as they say it.

134
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,340
Be exactly as you'd like to be.

135
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,360
What happened to the music?

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,900
Who also publish a magazine called Evolution or the Encyclopedia Psychedelica? Get the

137
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,780
picture? They're sort of like Mondo 2000 here in the States. In other words, if you can

138
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,460
make it, you can make it.

139
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:13,460


140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,200
If you can make your way past the trendy buzzwords, there's probably something there. We tried

141
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,680
to put even more into it. Now, they were the ones who sponsored the show, but the actual

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:34,040
manipulation of the whole thing, what started it off, yeah, that's what we're trying to

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,320
do.

144
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,260
Um, Bob Dobbs, good friend, BP Wow, of the Wow.

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:51,580
Group, or the Wow Foundation, acting through his, um, tool on Earth, Reverend Patrick Treloar,

146
00:07:52,260 --> 00:08:02,000
who is, well, he's BP Wow's and Bob's man, BP's and Bob's man in London. Uh, and he's

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,260
also the creator of something called the Rave Game. The soundtrack of the Rave Game is playing

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,460
in the background. Can you imagine a game, a board game? This is a board game. I like it.

149
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,560
I like Monopoly. Only it comes with a tape, heard in the back, and as the publicity, I

150
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,020
can, I can, um, I can read you about this game, friends, because, well, it's not on

151
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,820
sale in the United States yet.

152
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,740
But as it says right here, civilization is rocked by the Acid House board game. Phew,

153
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,340
what a scorcher. Go on, get on, and get one, matey.

154
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,360
Question mark? The whole of civilization was rocked to its foundations today by the

155
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,700
release of the world's first Acid House board game, allegedly designed by a spaced-out weirdo

156
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,640
from Tibet. A director of the Wow Group, the game is taking the whole wide universe by

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,420
storm. Rave, the board game, hit the streets amid a rush of frenzied activity. Mental,

158
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,960
mental, mental, mental was the cry as hordes of hooded top teenagers besieged their local

159
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,440
records.

160
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,840
The world's first game in rave shops, with only one question on their lips. Where's the

161
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,240
game?

162
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:26,220
Devised by Acid Ted Guru. Now, that means, Acid Ted means tough kids, teddy boys, hoods,

163
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,800
that take LSD. That's what it means over there. Acid Ted Guru, B.B. Wow, will still glowing

164
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,020
from a strange combination of Tibetan herbal remedies and an unrelenting night of trance

165
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,420
dancing exactly two crimbo's ago. Rave, the game, is taken great Britain by storm and

166
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,040
is poised to take over the world.

167
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,460
Allegedly, the aim of the game is to get to a rave before it gets busted without getting

168
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,500
busted yourself. Once there, tokens exchange, er, players exchange their collected energy

169
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,380
tokens, get it, get it kids, for dance cards and to peek at a solid one hundred twenty

170
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:10,920
beats per minute. Enough times to finish the evening saying wow! And I learned what the

171
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
Wow group is about. I didn't realize at that point that秌ا

172
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,440


173
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,440


174
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:26,080
about is doing things that when you see them, you or hear them, you go, wow. And I believe

175
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,300
there may be some possibilities there. As it says here, we at WOW believe that ravers

176
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:40,760
appreciate and deserve quality. And with, for that quality, and for that warm, mellow

177
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,980
afterglow feeling in mind, offer you the ultimate post-rave ambient pastime, rave the board

178
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,000
game, 18 months in the making, and wicked enough to keep for a lifetime. Promising,

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,680
spectacular visuals, rockin' mixes, ambient track strategy, like, blah, blah, blah, blah.

180
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:04,400
Well, it was wonderful for me to be plunged into that strange world, and we're going to

181
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,440
plunge back into that strange world together. As I play, what, a few tapes, I was able to

182
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:18,280
pull together in a brief time since I've been back. I understand Willow Dobbs did a

183
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,460
wonderful show last week, which I haven't even had time to hear yet. Thanks, Willow

184
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:31,340
Dobbs. It wasn't exactly as you wanted it to be.

185
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:54,780
So, uh, are we all there? Okay. Okay, so, uh, I understand. What exactly is a church

186
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:02,340
of some genius? Well, in the 1950s, Bob Dobbs founded this sort of disorganized religion

187
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:10,420
for misfits, mutants, disbelievers, or particularly those who will believe anything. And he was

188
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:21,620
used as a cover player and

189
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:21,620


190
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:21,920
비슷

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,360
messenger

192
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,280
and a

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,420
pastor

194
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:51,440
this thing. Okay, move the antenna just a little bit.

195
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,960
From the minute the doctor spanks you behind when you're born, the conspiracy starts taking

196
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:23,100
it away. And what they're trying to do is turn you into a normal person. Bob and we,

197
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,900
the preachers of Bob, are trying to turn people back into their original selves.

198
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:39,160
It's no use! You took over when I gave it up. My heir, eh? And look at it! You haven't

199
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
got any further than I have.

200
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,740
You won't!

201
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,520
How many years have you been on your own now? And what have you got this show for?

202
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,600
It's only been ten years.

203
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,500
I didn't expect it to be easy. But those who want me will come to me.

204
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,820
They don't want you, son, don't you understand? This is what they want.

205
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,600
They're coming. They're coming in the windows. They're coming in the doors.

206
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,140
Oh yeah? Okay. Yeah?

207
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,760
The Christian zombies!

208
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,460
Oh, I thought you meant the slush bumps. You know, the fiends without a face, those little brains, come hop around, sit on the furniture up there.

209
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,480
They brought the prayer warriors up with the baseball bats. They depressed bats in people's windows.

210
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Stand back up now! Fight the fiend zombie!

211
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,120
We've got to strike back. It's time to prank the preacher!

212
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,140
Time to fire the preacher!

213
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,940
Think to yourself, and question the Lord.

214
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,900
Think to yourself, and question the Lord.

215
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,320
Yeah, easy for you to say, Tim.

216
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,300
So, so, so, sort of like, um, what, like free spirits?

217
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,980
Oh, much worse than that. If, uh, if we were able to turn everyone completely free, uh,

218
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,160
well, they, we wouldn't be on the radio now. They, they would have locked us up a long time ago.

219
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:22,360
So, we try to disguise the preachings of slack as almost like entertainment, or, or humor.

220
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,660
And somehow they, uh, let us get away with this.

221
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,440
So, so, would you say almost then that, that, that what you're advocating is like a state of anarchy?

222
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:40,060
Oh, like, uh, much worse than anarchy. Uh, we call, we call our political stance patriopsychotic anarcho-menace.

223
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:46,500
A state of materialism by which every home is a kingdom, and every child and dog is a, a serf.

224
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,300
So, so, uh, under that banner, what, what exactly is it that the church is subgenius African?

225
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,160
Well, you, for one thing, you'd be able to declare war on your neighbors.

226
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,260
You hold your own ideas and you'll starve.

227
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,680
Gayle, why don't you give people what they ask for?

228
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,960
The common, the vulgar, and the trite.

229
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,140
And it's making the most powerful man living.

230
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,700
Can you fight that?

231
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,880
I never notice it.

232
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,560
Look, you see those people down there?

233
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,120
You know what they think of architecture?

234
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,120
I don't care what they think of architecture, or anything else.

235
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:28,400
Although the conspiracy has tried to, uh, sell you slack in the form of, uh, fashionable clothes,

236
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,140
or something, some new toy that you think is going to give you slack,

237
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,320
uh, the, the best way to get slack, of course, is to, uh, make donations to the church of the subgenius.

238
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,260
Study your book of the subgenius.

239
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:50,080
Uh, play the rave game, which is, uh, uh, in, in infested and encrusted with, uh, subliminal messages about slack.

240
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:58,800
And the mo-, even more immediate than that, the people out there should simply repent, quit your job, and slack off.

241
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,300
The New Materials Demand

242
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,460
The New Materials Demand

243
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:10,460


244
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,120
The New Materials Demand

245
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,160
It's easy to say that you can't borrow pieces of another's shape, just as one man can't borrow another's soul.

246
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,680
Howard, every new idea in the world comes from the mind of some one man.

247
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,760
And you know the price he has to pay for it.

248
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,840
Okay, alright, I get the idea. Jesus!

249
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,380
Can I declare war on the forces of darkness and religious deception?

250
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,820
I called you three years ago, Bob.

251
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,440
I was talking about my mom locking me under the house and feeding me dog food and stuff.

252
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:51,500
I guess the thing that, you know, I really wanted to say today was I was so frustrated when I heard while ago how, you know,

253
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
you're saying that you're a farce.

254
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,540
And I just kind of got tears in my eyes because I thought, you know, Satan is such a deceiver.

255
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,520
And, you know, like Skull and Bones, George Bush, he belongs to a fraternal organization called Skull and Bones.

256
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,740
Well, Bob's controversial, but it's the controversy that draws an unsaved listener.

257
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,540
That was Dwindling Intelligence and his tamed caller, Poop the Peep Dog Hat.

258
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:27,300
And now let's go to our next and presumably more interesting caller, Mrs. Iveen Schwartz of Oakland, California.

259
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,580
Yeah, the truth is we just haven't made that one out yet.

260
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,760
She's a composite of a number of women in the New York area.

261
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,800
Hi, boys.

262
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,920
Have killed.

263
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,020
We're men family members.

264
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,420
Turn her up a little.

265
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,100
I can't see.

266
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,060
Hey, you're losing her.

267
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
But, man.

268
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,760
Ted loves to get your dirty underwear.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, cut it out, will ya?

270
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,720
You know, this is a kind of a family program.

271
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
I know that because my family listens to it all the time.

272
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,060
Okay, okay, okay.

273
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,960
So, what exactly are you doing over here, Ivan?

274
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
Well, I'll be preaching the word of Bob Wednesday night.

275
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,120
I mean, is it not?

276
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,360
At the University of London Union.

277
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,300
We will be performing a short-duration mass marriage.

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,620
Everybody in the room cannot leave without being married in the eyes of Bob Dobbs.

279
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:27,240
And they'll only be married for 24 hours, but it gives them 24 hours where anything they want to do is completely sanctified.

280
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,200
And, of course, if they like it, they can always come back for another short-duration marriage.

281
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,160
We know what kind of question is that.

282
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,260
It's not that.

283
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Why?

284
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,460
Why are you guys talking about the Christians?

285
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,900
Well, it's like, here's our philosophy about the pinks in general.

286
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,120
It's not, get, now don't get me wrong.

287
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,740
It's not, it's not that we hate Jesus.

288
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,460
Jesus is just another, you know, damn preacher.

289
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,360
It's his fan club that gives us a little bit of trouble sometimes, you know?

290
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,660
Personally, I was like,

291
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:13,740
Jesus hung around with, with, uh, drunks, uh, gays, hookers, anybody, you know, had to make friends with or whatever.

292
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,040
He wasn't quite as squeamish as some of his followers, I think, probably.

293
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Jesus is a closet subgenius!

294
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,440
Oh, no doubt.

295
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,580
But, what we worship, if we were going to be, uh, Christian about it, we would worship the fighting Jesus.

296
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,880
Not the dandy, pandy, crybaby, guilt-ridden, school-marred Jesus.

297
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,580
We worship the werewolf Jesus!

298
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,960
The football-playing Jesus!

299
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,700
The Jesus that's...

300
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,080
Okay, let me ask you, I'm sure there's some Christians in here that get a bit upset with what we're saying.

301
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,640
But I'm gonna ask you a question.

302
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,080
What brand did Jesus smoke?

303
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,680
And I, I didn't think you'd be able to tell me, and I bet your preacher can't tell you either.

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,660
Jesus smoked Chesterfields.

305
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,640
Jesus Christ smoked Chesterfields.

306
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,640
And yet, that brand was not invented 2,000 years ago.

307
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,340
But we believe it anyway because faith is all that counts!

308
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:23,520
We wouldn't want to take away anybody's faith because, as Mark Twain said, faith is the absolute only thing they have to believe with.

309
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,820
If you just felt Bob coming, you better go get a test tomorrow.

310
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,840
We'll move on to the bad story to serve your country!

311
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,980
What?

312
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,780
Howard, it's no use.

313
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,640
Give in. Compromise.

314
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
Compromise now.

315
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,000
You'll have to later anyway.

316
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,780
Why are you saying that to me? That's not what you did.

317
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,580
That's why I'm saying it.

318
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,320
Because it's not what I did.

319
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,200
If you want to end up this way, it's your future.

320
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Do you want it?

321
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,500
Yes.

322
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,840
Then may God bless you, Howard. You're on your way into hell.

323
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,760
I want to help you.

324
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,760
I don't give or ask for help.

325
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,300
Oh, why don't you drop it?

326
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,800
What?

327
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,320
Oppose. All the ideals, if you prefer.

328
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,260
You can't stand alone. Give in.

329
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,440
Learn to get along with people. Start to design the kind of buildings everybody else does.

330
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,420
Then you'll be rich. You'll be famous. You'll be admired.

331
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,760
You'll be one of us.

332
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,020
Is that what disturbs you about me, Peter? That I want to stand alone? Is that it?

333
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,840
I don't know.

334
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,280
Think for yourself and question authority.

335
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,040
Think for yourself and question authority.

336
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,600
The ellipse has rapidly become the most desirable prism available.

337
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,360
It can appear as though it's a two-dimensional ellipse. Impossible, you say?

338
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,880
See for yourself and be amazed.

339
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,300
Very unusual beauty, color, optical imagery.

340
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Large size. Four and a quarter inches long with felt base.

341
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,340
Subgenius Ellipse Prism 2495. That's order number 4288.

342
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,440
The crystalline structure of the control metal seems to be acting like a DNA model for the flesh.

343
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,480
It's like a molecular union but with organic and inorganic compounds.

344
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,960
In other words, we think it's alive, the whole thing.

345
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,040
And we think it's growing.

346
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,960
Growing?

347
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,280
Subgenius Ellipse Prism 2495. The control metal is a crystal.

348
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,400
It's a crystal.

349
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,400


350
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,400


351
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,400


352
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,400


353
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,340
And religion is a pretty good area to work in sales.

354
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,160
And Bob founded his church on...

355
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,180
Rather than founding it on a rock, he founded it sort of on a ten dollar bill.

356
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,460
The mutants and the abnormals particularly need slack.

357
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,340
We're trying to lead this sort of revolution before 1998.

358
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,320
You see, we've got the exact date for the end of the world.

359
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,420
You may have heard some of these kooky, silly, weird cults talking about the end of the world

360
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,080
and their ridiculous prophecies and so forth.

361
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,060
Bob has the actual date.

362
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,220
And remember this, folks.

363
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,460
It's 7 PM, July 5th, 1998.

364
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,600
The men from Planet X will come down and everyone carrying a Subgenius membership minister's card in their pocket

365
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,560
will be ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X.

366
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,340
And those who don't have that...

367
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,100
That membership card will just be left behind to fry in their own fat like strips of bacon,

368
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,720
which I personally would be very happy to watch from my front row seat.

369
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,740
Watch those pink boys and normals get what they have coming to them.

370
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,140
Where can I sign up?

371
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,140
Resistance is useless!

372
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,520
You can sign up as well!

373
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,520
Resistance is useless!

374
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,960
Now give it a rest!

375
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,660
Waiting for the UFO!

376
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,080
I am controller of Planet X.

377
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,100
The connection between comets and our own existence may be greater than thought.

378
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,220
These messengers of destruction, they too have been the harbingers of life.

379
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,340
Waiting for the UFO!

380
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,180
Waiting for the UFO!

381
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,020
In a starring vehicle.

382
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,320
A living machine so complex that all that is possible is impossible.

383
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,320


384
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,320


385
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,320


386
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,320


387
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,040
The end result will be a weapon to letting comets play with the mucus of our skin.

388
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,740
But, and not some conspiracy world government, must be there in a position of world leadership

389
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,980
that is quite dramatic.

390
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,800
Reacted to the exorcist in ways they can understand so they don't put us out of our misery.

391
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,720
In far away and frozen places on Earth, we are finding the evidence of our connection to the cosmos.

392
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,220
Everything into the hole and buried.

393
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,300


394
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,240
We are not buried at all, forever.

395
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,660
Recalibration.

396
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,700
Living image floating in.

397
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:45,320
This holographic recalibration appears to float eerily in space, magically turning its head to follow you as you pass.

398
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,240
Publication of the Church of the Subgenius.

399
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:53,340
Beautifully crafted with a high gloss flesh-like finish, your mysterious guest will amaze and mystify.

400
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,760
How does this severed Arnold Palmer head work?

401
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,880
Well, I promise not to tell.

402
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,300
Yes, um, bloody or non-bloody.

403
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,280
Our choice, please.

404
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,800
That's order number 5807, living image 998.

405
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,820
Excuse me, I just wanted to...

406
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,280
Also with the Reverend Ivan Stang is Patrick Wow.

407
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,900
Um, Patrick, you're from the UK.

408
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,560
We're sort of traditionally a bit of a reserved bunch.

409
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,700
How do you think we're going to take this on board?

410
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,660
I think it'll be very difficult.

411
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,440
I think it'll involve a lot of pain and personal exorcisms by some people.

412
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:43,940
They will eventually, obviously, find that the message to the true subgeniuses in this country cannot fail but pull Bob out of them.

413
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,700
And at that time, they will bear witness and they will become part of the Church of the Subgenius.

414
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,460
The same as anybody else that the true subgenius has gone to when the message comes.

415
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,280
Those who plan to wed tonight need to get up off their butts and come forward.

416
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,680
If you don't,

417
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,660
which you don't seem to be doing,

418
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,880
what is with these...

419
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,880
You all are so reserved.

420
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,440
Why are the English so polite?

421
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,300
You're going to have to get over this politeness thing, man.

422
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,520
You're never going to be able to take over the world again being so damn polite.

423
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,340
Now here's three, a lovely triple or couple type group.

424
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,660
Oh my God.

425
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,500
My heart is getting...

426
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,100
Where do we go?

427
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,020
Now remember,

428
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,340
boys and boys is okay.

429
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,360
Girls and girls.

430
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,400
We got two guys and a woman.

431
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,920
We got a man and woman.

432
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,820
We got a man and woman.

433
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,000
We got several single guys.

434
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,680
Here's three.

435
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,420
All right, here's a big commune getting married here, friends.

436
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,040
A man in a bag.

437
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,860
A man in a bag.

438
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,660
Yes, marry the man.

439
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,560
Bring up your court suit.

440
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,320
You can marry your dead relatives, your ancestors.

441
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,220
He's marrying his keys.

442
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,980
The Freemason will never lose his keys again because he will be married to them.

443
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,340
There are some more.

444
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,700
This man's marrying his balloon.

445
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,080
I want to marry Tim Leary.

446
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,040
This guy's going to marry Tim Leary as well as a dozen other people.

447
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,300
You can marry your favorite porn star tonight.

448
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,120
You can...

449
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,260
Wait a minute.

450
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,300


451
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,560
You can consummate that marriage in your mind.

452
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,200
And just like I say, it's all sanctified.

453
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,240
It's absolved.

454
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,100
No guilt.

455
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,200
And it's going to last 24 hours exactly after the time that...

456
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,540
Is it karma-free?

457
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,240
Well, we haven't figured the exact moment.

458
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,300
Is it karma-free as well as guilt-free?

459
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,520
Karma-free.

460
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,680
There will be no karmic repercussions from anything you do involving your married partner.

461
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,240
Take a look.

462
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,180
Woo-hoo!

463
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,740
Woo-hoo!

464
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,980
Yes, praise Bob, dear friends.

465
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,980
A lovely moment from a subgenius revival in England.

466
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:13,240
Before that, some Dad's new slacks, X Day Mix, and of course KPFA, Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

467
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Sound clips from the movie of The Fountainhead by Anne Rand.

468
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,160
Cuts by Nick Nolan and the evolution record of Timothy Leary.

469
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,720
All mixed together in a great hour of slacks.

470
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,260
Side one of which is about to end.

471
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,080
Oh, yes, and I bet you know just what to do now.

472
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,380
Plum, apple, doughnut, plum pudding, stuffing all a swim in a swamp of bog oak gravy for that Greek-in-hearted dude.

473
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,460
Roast beef of old zealand.

474
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,920
He could not have touched it.

475
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,280
See what happens when your somatophage merman takes his fancy to our vegetarian...

476
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,460
...pig's mouth.

477
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,900
...and the

478
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,020
...

479
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,920
The public wouldn't like it.

480
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,100
It would shock people.

481
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,920
It's too different, too original.

482
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,460
Originality is fine, but why go to extremes?

483
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,980
There's always a middle course.

484
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,720
So we want to preserve your beautiful design, but just soften it a little with a touch of classical dignity.

485
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,560
Here.

486
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,800
Excuse me, I just wanted to bring in the tape here, okay?

487
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Boy, you're all elbows and knees, buddy. I never saw anybody so malatoid.

488
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,880
It's crazy out there, but listen, I've got...

489
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,900
Glad we've got Janitor's weekly input here on the floppy desk.

490
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,260
And I thought I'd show you this video.

491
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,600
Well, he's got, you know...

492
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,240
Oh, yeah, just put it in the projector and we'll run that film right now.

493
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,400
Let's see that film clip now.

494
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,920
Well, it's actually video and digital.

495
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:05,120
But we have every week from the far-flang, flunderhands of Texas, moments of information coming from Gordon G. Gordon.

496
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,920
This week, bringing you into focus...

497
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,020
Dr. Welm Brau.

498
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,700
Hello, and Dr. Powell's here.

499
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,280
Old fist good.

500
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,520
I'm over here in Visigoth City, Dr. Welm Brau.

501
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,060
Think about the fist.

502
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,820
And this is G. Gordon Gordon.

503
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,900
For this week, perhaps we should turn our attention...

504
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:24,900


505
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,340
to more problematic news on the front.

506
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,980
By now, most of you will have received that piece of absolutely putrid and foul and inflammatory material...

507
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:42,000
pretending to be the stark fist of removal, that is to say, the official publication of the Church of the Subgenius.

508
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:50,620
But, friends, I'm here to tell you that I have positive proof through computer scanning and a holographic recalibration...

509
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,720
that this is not the real stark fist.

510
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,320
No, friends, you hear it first on the Uber Brau Network.

511
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,340
This is not the real stark fist.

512
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:09,600
No, indeed, this is a putrid and foul concoction of absolutely miserable stuff...

513
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,660
that could not possibly have been put together by the Church of the Subgenius.

514
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,000
And sure enough, it wasn't.

515
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,760
So, join us today and boycott the new stark fist.

516
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,380
The pink fist.

517
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,580
Bad.

518
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,400
Old fist.

519
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,000
Good.

520
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,700
And that's about the way it looks from over here in Visigoth City, Dr. Welm Brau.

521
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,420
And this is G. Gordon Gordon signing off and getting back to see if I can...

522
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,860
if I can kill all the... kill all the...

523
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,100
Ah!

524
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,040
Ah!

525
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,500
Ah!

526
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:48,660


527
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


528
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:48,940


529
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,340
Ah!

530
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,360
Ah!

531
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,060
I have a little agreement with the sentiments that last speaker expressed in my program.

532
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:05,380
I think it's really been so concisely put that something so neatly said was wrapped up in so pretty and pithy a package.

533
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,380
And you can quote me.

534
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,960
Ah, the problem of the new stark fist.

535
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:17,480
I'll have another Stein in my fist before I read another word of that mismatched organ.

536
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,600
Now there's a touch of the new and a touch of the old.

537
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,140
So it's sure to please everybody.

538
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
The middle of the road.

539
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,360
Why take chances when you can stay in the middle?

540
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,060
You see, it doesn't spoil anything.

541
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,080
Does it?

542
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,680
And we must always compromise with the general taste, Mr. Roach.

543
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,740
You understand that, I'm sure.

544
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,120
No.

545
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,580
If you want my work, you must take it as it is or not at all.

546
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,640
But why?

547
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,400
A building has integrity, just like a man.

548
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,860
And just as seldom.

549
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,260
It must be true to its own idea, have its own form, and serve its own purpose.

550
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,960
But we can't depart from the popular forms of architecture.

551
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,100
Why not?

552
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,640
Because everybody's accepted them.

553
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,360
I haven't.

554
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,200
Do you wish to defy our common standards?

555
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,020
I set my own standards.

556
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Do you intend to fight against the whole world?

557
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:06,880
If necessary.

558
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,500
But after all, we are your clients and it's your job to serve us.

559
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,140
I don't build in order to have clients.

560
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,620
I have.

561
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,240
I have clients in order to build.

562
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,240
The rest of you can just sit there and watch.

563
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,340
Well, I would, but I mean, I've got a pie in the oven.

564
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,240
That is, otherwise...

565
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,800
You realize what you're doing?

566
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,840
Quite.

567
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,920
Roach, this is sheer insanity.

568
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,280
Can't you give in just once?

569
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,500
After all, you have to live.

570
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,100
Not that way.

571
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,800
Too much is always better than not enough, friends.

572
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,760
A little bit of...

573
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,180
What?

574
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,880
Do you feel the spirit?

575
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,640
Yes!

576
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,720
Put your hands on each other!

577
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,280
Psychedelic.

578
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,660
Extern.

579
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,660
Mind.

580
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,160
Psychedelic.

581
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,560
Extern.

582
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,700
Mind.

583
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,020
Psychedelic.

584
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,480
Extern.

585
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,500
Mind.

586
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,100
Psychedelic.

587
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,100


588
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,280
Mind.

589
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,840
Psychedelic.

590
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,240
Have either of you, you know, borne witness to Bob?

591
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,260
Well, I'm a professional preacher for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

592
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,400
He's made me rich.

593
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,740
I mean, look at this suit I'm wearing.

594
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,980
I wore it especially for this radio show.

595
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,540
Have I?

596
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,740
Oh, sorry.

597
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,280
What, has Ivan revealed himself to Bob?

598
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,080
Or has Bob...

599
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,100
Okay, sorry.

600
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Okay, excuse me.

601
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,100
Has...

602
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
Has Bob...

603
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,460
Has Bob revealed himself to you, then, Ivan?

604
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:52,340
Oh, Bob came to me in the form of a blinding flash of light and an echoing voice, just like in the movies.

605
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,140
The way he usually...

606
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,420
The way people usually find Bob is he sells them something.

607
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,320
Bob, over the years, has probably sold everyone something.

608
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,380
Now he is trying to give them something.

609
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,800
He's trying to give them slack.

610
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,760
They will have to pay for it, but he's giving.

611
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:11,880
He's giving them something.

612
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,520
Excellent.

613
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,760
Thank you very much.

614
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,360
Nice of you.

615
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,240
Did that help you all right?

616
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,360
That would be wicked, yeah.

617
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,720
Yeah.

618
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,120
Yeah.

619
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,740
You ought to find some great stuff on that tape, too.

620
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,540
I hope the quality is okay.

621
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,020
Right.

622
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,860
Well, I'm sure it will be.

623
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,160
I'm sure it will be.

624
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,800
There's one more thing, and that is an evening of slack as a proposed kiss and a hug.

625
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,300
Thank you very much.

626
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,540
I'm so glad I got Aaron and Lola.

627
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,220
We're supposed to get married for 24 hours.

628
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm trying to find someone that would be some kind of challenge.

629
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:41,740
I'm trying to find someone that would be a good match.

630
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:41,740


631
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:41,740


632
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,020
Erika pea.

633
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,020


634
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm an evaluation side of a handled member, and Lisa, we can sort her that.

635
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,580
Your, oh, no.

636
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,080
Your personal counselor.

637
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
I don't think more than I think even an hour with me would kill him too much.

638
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,380
That's why I like to end the end on a message.

639
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,740
That's the people it should be.

640
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:11,720
Well, Doctor Drummond, I'm in the, in the London tube station with my…

641
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:11,720


642
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,320
And there's the classic busker up there.

643
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,360
I'm walking along with my new friend Gordon.

644
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,420
We've both got video cameras.

645
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,620
We're going to Hyde Park to rant.

646
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,840
Speaker's Corner.

647
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,940
Yeah, Speaker's Corner.

648
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,400
This is like the classic ranting spot of the English-speaking world.

649
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,400
I finally got a chance to do it the way it's supposed to be done in the classic spot.

650
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,040
So I'm going to do, I'll just start preaching.

651
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,300
What are you, were you just going to let them push you around like that?

652
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,280
My God, are you men or subgenius?

653
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
Oh, you're probably just men.

654
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,780
That's what it is, just a bunch of damn human men and women.

655
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,780
My God, and they haven't nuked all of you yet.

656
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,800
But there's one thing, there's one thing that will get you off of that path to pinkness.

657
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,820
And that's the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

658
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,800
I know you've heard of him.

659
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,840
I know you've heard of J.R. Bob.

660
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,840
Bob Dobbs, that man Bobby, that smiling man, that man with the pipe.

661
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,600
You've seen his face, grinning at you.

662
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,220
Big brother.

663
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,540
Oh, the conspiracy would rather call him big sibling.

664
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,400
Oh, yeah, more politically correct.

665
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,760
But you know what I mean.

666
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,180
Bob is here to bring you slack.

667
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,620
True slack.

668
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,700
Well, that was the saddest subgenius moment.

669
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,500
Standing there ranting to an audience of pigeons.

670
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,580
Yes, dear friends, it's true.

671
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,820
At Hyde Park, Speaker's Corner.

672
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,680
When I finally got there to preach the word of Bob, there wasn't a living soul.

673
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,580
Not a living soul, but I did it anyway.

674
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,340
Now, how many of your preachers would do that kind of a thing?

675
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,680
Well, I didn't want you to get caught up in that.

676
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,620
I didn't want you to get worried that I'd been out raving too much with these folks and turned into some sort of new ager.

677
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,260
In fact, that's exactly what we're trying to prevent.

678
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:33,100
Well, as the people at Evolution call it, they like the new New Age, which is a little bit, well, I guess you might just say sexier than the old New Age.

679
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,360
Ha, ha, ha.

680
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:47,860
But, well, I think we also heard a little bit of controversy there about the latest stark fist, speaking of such things.

681
00:40:47,920 --> 00:41:00,340
As the church newsletter came out and was deemed pornographic by, well, our dear, some of our dear friends.

682
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,920
And while there was even a critique.

683
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,340
Ha, ha, ha.

684
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,040
And a critique there by G. Gordon Gordon.

685
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:16,520
I bet some of you were surprised that G. Gordon, an old, a nasty old hairy feller like G. Gordon Gordon would be upset about the terrible things we printed in the stark fist.

686
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,080
And guess what?

687
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,240
He wasn't.

688
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,280
He was putting on those Southern California, or Northern California folks.

689
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,400
Oh, there's my mic just popped back into place as the music ended.

690
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,940
Oh, yes, you can tell it was all meant to be.

691
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,160
And, uh.

692
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:42,940
But, well, here's what we have to say about, about all of that.

693
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:54,740
You see, it's, uh, as Saint Ayn Rand said, and Atlas shrugged in the, uh.

694
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,880
Now, you people on the phone banks, keep your voices down.

695
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,820
I'm going to be preaching here.

696
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,900
We're going to go back to the old, the old stuff.

697
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,420
Your old straight subgenius preaching.

698
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,540
I guess you could call it that.

699
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,360
It is the victims who made injustice possible.

700
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,800
It is the men of reason who made it possible for the rule of the brute to work.

701
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:29,680
The despoiling of reason has been the motive of every anti-reason creed on earth.

702
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,120
The despoiling of ability.

703
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,740
Has been the purpose of every creed that preached self-sacrifice.

704
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,100
The despoilers have always known it.

705
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,040
We haven't.

706
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,260
The time has come for us to see.

707
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:54,640
What we're now asked to worship, what had once been dressed as God or King, is the naked, twisted, mindless figure of the human incompetent.

708
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,860
This is the new ideal.

709
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,280
The goal to aim at.

710
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,540
The purpose to live for.

711
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,100
And all men are to be rewarded according to our claims.

712
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,180
And to be the most close they approach it.

713
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,840
This is the age of the common man, they tell us.

714
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:12,460
A title which any man may claim to the extent of such distinction as he has managed not to achieve.

715
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,560
He will rise to a rank of nobility by means of the effort he has failed to make.

716
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,840
He will be honored for such virtue as he has not displayed.

717
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,800
And he will be paid for the goods which he did not produce.

718
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,000
But we, we who must atone for the guilt of ability.

719
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,540
We will work to support him as he orders, with his pleasure as our only reward.

720
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,740
Since we have the most to contribute, we will have the least to say.

721
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,100
Since we have the better capacity to think, we will not be permitted a thought of our own.

722
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,680
Since we have the judgment to act, we will not be permitted an action of our choice.

723
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:56,040
We will work under directives and controls issued by those who are incapable of working.

724
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,780
They will dispose of our energy.

725
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,920
Because they have none.

726
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,260
They have none to offer it of our product.

727
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,980
Because they can't produce.

728
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,600
You say this is impossible, that it cannot be made to work?

729
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,940
They know it.

730
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,660
But it is you who don't.

731
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,900
And they're counting on you not to know it.

732
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,840
They're counting on you to go on.

733
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,040
To work to the limit of the inhuman and to feed them while you last.

734
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:24,180
And when you collapse, there'll be another victim starting out and feeding them while struggling to survive.

735
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,340
And the span of each succeeding victim will be shorter.

736
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:37,000
And when you'll die to leave them a railroad, your descendant in spirit will die to leave them a loaf of bread.

737
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,820
This doesn't worry the looters of the moment.

738
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,460
They plan like all the plans of all the royal looters of the past.

739
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,780
Their plan is only that the loot shall last their lifetime.

740
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,520
It has always lasted before because in one generation they couldn't run out of victims.

741
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,820
But this time, it will not last.

742
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,220
The victims are on strike.

743
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,520
We are on strike against martyrdom and against the moral code that demands it.

744
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:11,220
We're on strike against those who believe that one man must exist for the sake of another.

745
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,800
We're on strike against the morality of cannibals, be it preached in body or in spirit.

746
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,060
We will not deal with men on any terms but ours.

747
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,720
And our terms are a moral code which holds that man is an end in himself and not the means to any end of others.

748
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,760
We do not seek to force our code upon them.

749
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,260
They're free to believe what they please.

750
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,000
But for once, they will have to believe it and to exist without our help.

751
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,740
And once and for all, they'll learn the meaning of their creed.

752
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,400
That creed has lasted for centuries solely by the sanction of the victims.

753
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:54,240
By means of the victims' acceptance of punishment for breaking a code impossible to practice.

754
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,100
But that code was intended to be broken.

755
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,660
It is a code that thrives not on those who observe it, but on those who don't.

756
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:10,440
A morality kept in existence not by virtue of its saints, but by the grace of its sinners.

757
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,880
We have decided not to be victims any longer.

758
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,340
We've decided not to be sinners any longer.

759
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,160
We have ceased breaking that moral code.

760
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,320
We shall blast it out of existence forever by the one method that it can't withstand.

761
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,740
By obeying it.

762
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,760
We are obeying it. We're complying.

763
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,700
In dealing with our fellow men, we're observing their code of values to the letter and sparing them all the evils they denounce.

764
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,880
The mind is evil?

765
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,620
We've withdrawn the works of our minds from society.

766
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,580
Not a single idea of ours is to be known or used by men.

767
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,140
Ability is a selfish evil that leaves no chance to be found.

768
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,080
We've withdrawn from the competition and left all chances open to incompetence.

769
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,220
The pursuit of wealth is greed, the root of all evil.

770
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,200
We don't seek to make fortunes any longer.

771
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,440
It's evil to earn more than one's bare sustenance.

772
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:20,020
We take nothing but the lowliest jobs, and we produce by effort of our muscles no more than we consume for our immediate needs.

773
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:31,340
We have seized burdening the weak with our ambition and have left them free to prosper without us.

774
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:46,440
Well dear friends, that little odd rant is from the mistress of all odd rants, I guess you could call her.

775
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,000
Anne Rand, whose book Atlas Shrugged I picked up from the library.

776
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


777
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


778
00:47:50,020 --> 00:48:08,100
I picked it up recently and was shocked to find that it was like, well, it's like all the most hatefulest hate rants of the subgenius against normals only without slack.

779
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,140
There's no bob, nothing to balance it.

780
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:19,640
Friends, I mean, if you want a scary read, pick up probably anything by Anne Rand.

781
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,000
And you'll find it's a good one.

782
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,000


783
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:25,120
You'll probably, like me, you'll think half the time you'll be going, this needs to be said.

784
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,320
This desperately needs to be said.

785
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,080
And the other half of you will be going, man, I sure would hate to be married to her.

786
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,120
God almighty.

787
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,880
But what Atlas Shrugged is about, dear friends, is what if everybody who had half a brain

788
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,000
just got sick and tired of the crap?

789
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,500
And quit?

790
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,160
Just disappeared?

791
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:06,660
What if, what if, what if every, and I don't mean, now see, in Anne Rand's case, her idea of anybody with half a brain was the brilliant, rich, achieving industrialist and so forth.

792
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:13,020
And well, that's all well and good, but like I say, she forgot about, that was the only kind of slack she understood.

793
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,560
There was, there's so much more.

794
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,900
It's sad that some miss out on,

795
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,660
on the, the glory that can be slack.

796
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:32,500
And you can be an overman or an uber woman without building railroads or airports.

797
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:38,360
You can be an overman or an uber, we'll be doing a whole lot better than most pigs

798
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:46,400
if you're not pestering everybody else and trying to tell them what they should or shouldn't be thinking or doing.

799
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,720
And so I don't know.

800
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,260
I just, I just, I think,

801
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,660
as, as Bill Burroughs said,

802
00:49:51,940 --> 00:50:04,880
our forefathers who built this great nation would be pretty disgusted to find out that a person's qualification for a job was dependent on a urine test.

803
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,200
Well.

804
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,400
What happened to the music?

805
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,580
What happened to the music?

806
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,360
What happened to the music?

807
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,340
What happened to the music?

808
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:40,300
Oh yes, beautiful, beautiful, what a, a wonderful, let's get back to some great,

809
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:49,020
that was some more, some more rave music from the, the soundtrack of this strange board game.

810
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:58,560
Created by the British, the London sub, well the, I mean there's probably a bunch of clinches in London and,

811
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:05,420
but I suppose that Reverend Patrick and his, his friends must be,

812
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,080
well I think they're the busiest dear friends.

813
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,040
They want to, they want to, they want to sell subgenius over there.

814
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,520
See, that's the difference, that's the true doctors.

815
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:25,960
They're the ones that figure out a way to, to make us both a, a bit for our coffers,

816
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,580
to get some copper in, you know what I mean?

817
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,320
Some cabbage and gravel.

818
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,640
Because this ain't the kind of church that just runs on love, dear friends.

819
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:40,400
Oh no, this is, of course, the church of the subgenius.

820
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,200
I'm about to give you an address to write to for special secret information

821
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,500
from the church of the subgenius.

822
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,700
Got your pen ready?

823
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,800
Got that pencil ready?

824
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,580
Why don't you try this?

825
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,720
Just try Bob.

826
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:13,560
Try the free information from Bob just by dropping us a card at post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214, USA.

827
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,500
And you too can become a subgenius.

828
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,180
You can become what we call a Bob-a-Law-o.

829
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:28,520
A Bob-a-Law-o, a medicine man, a diviner, a witch doctor, a, and father confessor, you might say.

830
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,500
All rolled into one.

831
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,600
The Bob-a-Law-os are the children of Bob, the owners of the tables of Connie.

832
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:42,560
The Bob-a-Law-os' powers are limitless and a word unto themselves.

833
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,480
And when a Bobby, one of the little Bobbies, has a, a problem in his life,

834
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,340
and it brings it to the Bob-a-Law-o,

835
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:57,300
he then analyzes it by means of the entrails and the bones and the dice.

836
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,340
For he carries with him a mojo bag.

837
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,460
It's a talisman, the mojo bag, which has its own guardian spirit.

838
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:13,920
It is prepared by a virgin who fills the bag and stitches it shut with human skin thread

839
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,260
and attaches it to a tiny pipe

840
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,400
with the name of Saint Janor engraved upon it.

841
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,300
The Bob-a-Law-os, my friends, can prepare you a love potion.

842
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,480
Yes, we make love potions.

843
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,380
Of course, some of these remedies require strong stomachs.

844
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,720
Our love potion involves, let's say you're casting a spell.

845
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,220
You have to remove the corn kernels from your, well,

846
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,180
you might say you use used corn kernels.

847
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,820
You toast them and ground them up, make them into a powder,

848
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,600
and then slip them into the tea or wine of the intended victim.

849
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,000
They drink this filter, filter spelled with a P-H, that's very important,

850
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,120
and then they fall madly in love with you.

851
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,600
That's one way to do it.

852
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,900
For those of you who must and probably should pay

853
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,240
to know what you really think.

854
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,340
Think to yourself and question authority.

855
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,020
Think to yourself and question authority.

856
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,980
Think for yourself and question authority.

857
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,660
Think for yourself and question authority.

858
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,940
Five years.

859
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,220
Five years.

860
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:35,240
Lord, what horrible, what horrendous, strange noises come bubbling up from the show.

861
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,840
Unexpectedly.

862
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,020
But, you know, that's the fun thing about it.

863
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,040
Every week, actually, we are definitely...

864
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,920
We don't know exactly what to expect from one minute to the next.

865
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,200
If we did, it'd be...

866
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,900
It really would be pretty boring, wouldn't it?

867
00:55:52,940 --> 00:56:00,440
Because, you know, as Bob teaches us, evil is composed really of two polarizing aspects.

868
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,080
Negative evil and positive evil.

869
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,760
You'll be glad to know about positive evil, friends.

870
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,820
Whereas the negative aspect represents chaos and imbalance.

871
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:20,280
The positive aspect represents the demonic order and the entities.

872
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:26,120
So that on the negative evil side, which is a passive principle,

873
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,220
the negative aspect of the passive negative evil principle is a principle of inertia,

874
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,960
whereby things just swing along in a Brownian motion.

875
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:41,940
In other words, when you put off that job that your boss wanted you to do,

876
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,860
that's really just a negative evil.

877
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,880
That's not a serious...

878
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,860
Evil.

879
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,240
Evil.

880
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,840
I mean, if...

881
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,340
If you do some victim-less crime, why, perhaps that's evil, but...

882
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,880
It's really just a negative evil, you know what I mean?

883
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,120
You see, the word of Bob has many, many excuses.

884
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:00,860
We...

885
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:05,160
We can't give you forgiveness because, well, we're not that well connected, but...

886
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,060
We can at least bring you...

887
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,580
That mighty excuse, which is that man Bob...

888
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,860
The next episode is coming soon.

889
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:14,860


890
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:14,860


891
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,240
It'll be very interesting.

892
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,580
See you then.

893
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,360
I love you, Bob.

894
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,360


895
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,560
Have a nice weekend.

896
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,900
Have a nice weekend.

897
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:22,800
Bye.

898
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,740
Thanks, guys.

899
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,440
Bye.

900
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,140
Bye.

901
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,380
Bye.

902
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


903
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


904
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


905
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


906
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


907
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


908
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


909
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


910
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


911
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


912
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,380


913
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,000
The good name is Larry Nixon.

914
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,020
In a way of saying,

915
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:27,300
America,

916
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,900
who needs the hell

917
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,520
on his church

918
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,100
and give.

919
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,240
Thanking lives

920
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,460
for coming to our annual

921
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:32,760
fellowship.

922
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,040
It's on the Red Cross

923
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,240
and brochure and record.

924
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,300
Tom,

925
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:36,920
or whether you

926
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,080
sleep,

927
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,960
that's me.

928
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,860
And we say goodbye

929
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,860
to another show

930
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,160
and goodbye to

931
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,840
Reverend Michael Townsend.

932
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,700
It's mixed there.

933
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,120
That was from our sister show

934
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,420
up there in the Dad's New Slacks show

935
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,180
in Maine.

936
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,680
They play old hour slacks

937
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,120
and new slacks.

938
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,220
And we'll let this,

939
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,140
we'll go back to the

940
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,060
Swingin' Love Corpses

941
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,120
to take us out.

942
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,500
Goodbye.

943
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,180
Good night.

944
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,940
Good night.

945
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,060
Good night.

946
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,200
Good night.

947
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,320
Good night.

948
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,980
Good night.
