27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
same thing in china in his days

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
in china in his day

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,040
yeah and three years to the day later there was a massacre in the same place yeah the

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,740
world famous

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:59,220
thing the norwegian raising the norwegian flag at the south pole yeah so how long how's

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,220


33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,780
How did you get that?

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,200
What else?

35
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,660
Tell us more about that wonderful country.

36
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,320
Please ask specific questions.

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,220
Well, tell us why.

38
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,220
Did Un have plastic surgery?

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,040
Look like his grandfather, like they're saying?

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,400
No, no.

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,120
Un really looks like that.

42
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,920
In fact, that's why Kim Jong-il passed over son number one and son number two.

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,920
Son number one had been to the Swiss high school and wanted reform,

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,820
and Kim Jong-il decided that son number two looked too effeminate.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
So son number three won and said he would go for it.

46
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,440
Yeah, because he's posing a lot like Granddad.

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,200
Looks like Granddad.

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,460
There are no pictures of the new guy up yet.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,500
They're still working on his death angle and et cetera, et cetera.

50
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,100
The perfect ill head.

51
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,340
The Kim cult is a faith-based religion just like us.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,240
Cool.

53
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,460
Yeah, I was thinking it's face-based.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,340
Face-based.

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,280
It is a face-based religion.

56
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,740
Sherman now has a similar thing going.

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
They have the beatific face.

58
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,560
Where do you stay in this country?

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,400
We stayed at the Hotel Yanggakdo,

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,640
which is a 40-story Soviet in-tourist hotel on an island in the middle of the river.

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,200
We could walk around up to the hotel and could not go off.

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,880
Wow.

63
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,560
Man, that's clever.

64
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,100
That's good.

65
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,760
That's the way to do it.

66
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,860
We should do that the next day, yeah.

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
So did you feel like your liberty was being repressed while you were there?

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,300
Yes, we had our minders watching us at all times.

69
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,520
They were nice lady minders, mind you.

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,380
Did they have minders minding the minders?

71
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,380
Unfortunately, I had my wife minding me.

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,240
I would have been minding my minder a little more closely if you catch my drift.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,360
I know exactly what you mean.

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,920
You're drifted a long time for a long ways.

75
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,560
My guide was a Miss Kim, a 33-year-old North Korean MILF.

76
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,960
Well, you know, part of that is the Stockholm Syndrome.

77
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,100
You fall in love with your captor.

78
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,140
Your captor, yes.

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,960
That happened to me in China.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
It happens to me.

81
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,240
Big accident.

82
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,860
Call back.

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,060
Jay has McBobcat.

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,140
I fell in love with my captor.

85
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,940
Okay, we temporarily lost our...

86
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,680
It's possible that Princess We might try to call in.

87
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,040
Then we'd have a representative from China.

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,100
One from...

89
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,880
The planet of the UFOs.

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,780
The unidentified ones.

91
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,780
Hello, doctors.

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,880
Hello.

93
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,360
No, no.

94
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
Oh, no.

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,180
All right.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
We're trying to lock in on your signal there, Shining Path.

97
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,900
Thank you, Beth.

98
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,440
We have lost much space.

99
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Next question.

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,260
How long were you there?

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,940
Four days.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Do you have to scream like that?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Yes.

104
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,180
He's been brainwashed.

105
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,260
Man, he can't help it.

106
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,100
You talk with this forceful...

107
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,140
Almost like...

108
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,740
It's too late.

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
There's no brain left.

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,800
They get it right away.

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,740
Did you eat any strange and disgusting food?

112
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,220
Like maggots?

113
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,920
Actually, I gained weight in North Korea.

114
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Did you eat the giant maggots?

115
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,820
They have giant maggots there that they eat.

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:13,940
That's obscene.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,900
And all you got was that lousy T-shirt.

118
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,420
Oh, there's Phineas and Margaret.

119
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,400
Is that Phineas?

120
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,900
There's Phineas on there, too.

121
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,540
Not Jane.

122
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,760
No, that's not.

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,720
Jane, you're just...

125
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,780
I...

126
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,260
Is it Jane you're doing, Phineas?

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,680
Yeah, probably.

128
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,920
No, it's Jane you're doing.

129
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,720
Jane you're doing.

130
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,040
Notice how they just ignore the guy from North Korea and go to Jane.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,700
Jane you're talking.

132
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,260
Jane you're talking.

133
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, no.

134
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,920
No, I actually have a Jane you're like conundrum because I don't like what I'm doing anymore.

135
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,100
Next question.

136
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,340
I don't know what else to do.

137
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,900
How much money does it cost to go to North Korea?

138
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,140
For Chinese citizens, $300.

139
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,080
For Hong Kong citizens, $700.

140
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,220
For Americans, $1,400.

141
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,460
Yeah.

142
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,240
You really have to have the yen to do that.

143
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,420
I've got a question for you.

144
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,560
Who shot Liberty Valance?

145
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,460
Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone.

146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,040
Which Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone?

147
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,400
That's the big question.

148
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
The replica.

149
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,620
The replica Lee Harvey Oswald.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,360
Which replica?

151
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,320
The replica.

152
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,760
The fake replica.

153
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,140
The good copy or the bad copy?

154
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,420
Because there was one where you could see the seams along the sides.

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,900
The never been scanned copy.

156
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,620
How do you get to North Korea?

157
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,300
You fly to a Chinese border town which is sort of like El Paso to North Korea's Juarez.

158
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Oh, man.

159
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,680
That must be great.

160
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,180
I was recently in El Paso and was scared to go to Juarez.

161
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,940
Yeah.

162
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,780
Do they wear guns there and cowboy hats?

163
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
Not at the border town.

164
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,400
Not at the border town.

165
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,160
But I was taking the local train from the Chinese border to Pyongyang which is forbidden

166
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,460
to Americans and it was quite heavy on the rail platforms.

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,520
Squatties with AKs frisking everyone.

168
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,100
Desperate peasants.

169
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,540
It looked like Japan in 1944.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,120
Wow.

171
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,440
Cool.

172
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,020
But they don't know what pot is so it's cool to carry a film camera.

173
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,020
They don't know who Michael Jackson is.

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,400
They don't know who Snooki is.

175
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,960
They don't know who Mitt Romney is.

176
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
They don't know who Snooki is?

177
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
But now they know who Bush is.

178
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,300


179
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,300


180
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,300


181
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,580
They don't know who Bob Dobbs is.

182
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,980
They will praise Bob.

184
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,780
Yeah, and the secret police are going to be combing YouTube looking for that tape and

185
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,980
then that guy won't do it.

186
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,520
I threw one copy of Arise onto the railroad track.

187
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,080
Yeah.

188
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,380
That's what we need.

189
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,280
Well, at least a copy of Arise didn't throw itself on the railroad track, which is what

190
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
usually happens.

191
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,740
And instantly 300 countrymen came out.

192
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:54,960
Next.

193
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,300
Next.

194
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,300


195
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,100
And they killed themselves because they let that happen.

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,240
Then they jump on the tracks to protect a copy of Arise.

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,580
So how many more minutes do you have on your phone call right now?

198
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,640
Oh, no, no.

199
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,800
We're on Skype this time.

200
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,520
We're fine.

201
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,200
Forever and ever.

202
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,540
Did they take you to the military airfield again this time?

203
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,320
We passed by the North Korean airport, Sunan Airport.

204
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,160
I saw a few Tupolevs and Ilyushins.

205
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,380
I'm not typing this out.

206
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,640
Okay.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
No, I am writing it down, though.

208
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Did you meet them?

209
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm using my fart pen to write it down.

210
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,680
Well, Honda has not been seen in North Korea since 1961.

211
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,020
Is the television or the television shows in North Korea as good as the ones in Beijing

212
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,800
in 1986?

213
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,180
There's only one channel in North Korea.

214
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,220
It shows Grandfather and Father's Greatest Hits.

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
It has the news.

216
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,540
And then it shows North Korean karaoke.

217
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,900
They're very patriotic music.

218
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,260
Yeah.

219
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


220
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


221
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


222
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


223
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


224
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


225
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,260


226
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,340
And Schmaltzy, Pony, and then there's a war movie.

227
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,160
So they don't have a Playboy channel over there, for instance.

228
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,640
No, they don't.

229
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,020
I went to the North Korean side of the DMZ.

230
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,820
You went where?

231
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,360
To the North Korean side of the DMZ.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,080
Nice.

233
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,880
Where they killed those poor Americans after they relieved them and they were watching

234
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:18,880


235
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,100
Well, they showed us where the armistice was signed and the...

236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,240
Oh, man.

237
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,200
The North Korean soldiers...

238
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,160
Oh, man.

239
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,180
The North Korean soldiers got in my face and said, what?

240
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,320
We started the war?

241
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,760
Yeah.

242
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,660
Tell that to me.

243
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,520
Say that to my face.

244
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,640
And you didn't have to say anything.

245
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,820
He didn't know that, right?

246
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,420
Yeah.

247
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:34,900
Right.

248
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,240
They did.

249
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,660
Nice.

250
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,660
So did you reteach them their entire history now?

251
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,960
I usually don't.

252
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,780
Sorry.

253
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,260
Go ahead.

254
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,140
Did you reteach them their history?

255
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,060
I tried to engage them in friendly debate.

256
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,760
Aha.

257
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,340
Aha.

258
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,460
My interpreter smiled and chided the soldiers.

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,980
Well, think of that.

260
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,880
Every single Euro that comes out here, they...

261
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,920
Has to feel like he has to engage them in friendly debate.

262
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,960
Oh, man.

263
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,140
When I was in China at the Friendship Hotel, there were people from many climes.

264
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,920
And this young sort of Arabic-looking fellow sat across from me at the bar.

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,440
He was not drinking beer like I was.

266
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,780
And we had a little discussion.

267
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,960
I said, where are you from?

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,540
And he goes...

269
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,660
Suddenly, his face got real flat.

270
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,820
He said, Libya.

271
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,740
About a month earlier, Reagan's guys had bombed Tripoli.

272
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,560
Yes, yes.

273
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

274
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,160
And hit a hospital, ostensibly.

275
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,720
So, you know, he suddenly...

276
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,640
Suddenly, I was the guilty party.

277
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,380
I had dropped the bomb on Tripoli.

278
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,820
Yeah, you mean Ivan Stang?

279
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,920
Yeah, you did that, man.

280
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,660
I asked him...

281
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,560
I could have...

282
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,480
If only I'd known that a few years later, I would literally be launching a football-shaped

283
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,500
Qaddafi head from a pulpit at X Day.

284
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,140
Two years in a row.

285
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,420
It's funny how they always put their criminals and the ones they're seeking always seem

286
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,220
to hide out in hospitals and schools.

287
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,340
Just remembering, Reverend Stang...

288
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,440
Yes, Reverend...

289
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,000
They took us to the Palace of...

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,080
They took us to the Palace of Gifts.

291
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,640
There was the entire Palace of Gifts to President Trump.

292
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,320
There was the Palace of Gifts to President Kim Il-sung and a second palace to President

293
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
Kim Jong-il of gifts only from foreign leaders and delegations.

294
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,380
And it was there I saw the gold scimitar given by Muammar Qaddafi to Kim Jong-il, as well

295
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:40,380
as the hiking rifle from President Putin, a pearl inlaid desk from Hafez al-Assad of

296
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:47,120
Syria, and, yes, I saw the holy Michael Jordan autographed basketball that Madeleine Albright

297
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,400
of our country gave Kim Jong-il.

298
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Oh, my God.

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,440
Man, what a rich dude.

300
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,140
Okay, well, I get dibs on that Palace of Gifts for X Day.

301
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,480
How do you...

302
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,480


303
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,140
I get dibs on it.

304
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,540
I got new dibs on it.

305
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,240
I said it first.

306
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,240
Okay, well, you said it.

307
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,640
I don't care.

308
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,480
But think about this.

309
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,360
You got...

310
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm thinking.

311
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,300
You got a golden scimitar in one hand or a basketball signed by Michael Jackson...

312
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,900
Michael Jordan.

313
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,920
Michael Jordan.

314
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,980
Was it Michael Jackson or Michael Jordan that signed it?

315
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Michael Jordan.

316
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,420
It was Michael Jaskin.

317
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,920
Michael Jaskin played basketball.

318
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,380
No, but...

319
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,380


320
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,380


321
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,380


322
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,380


323
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,380


324
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,340
But he signed a basketball, probably.

325
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll bet you he signed a basketball at some point in time.

326
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,540
That basketball's gonna be worth a lot of money someday with Michael Jackson's signature.

327
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,320
Yeah, but maybe the gold scimitar without Michael Jackson...

328
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,420
The gold scimitar would be worth a lot of money.

329
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:35,760
...with Julian Crested.

330
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,460
I want the signed copy of Gaddafi's little green book.

331
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,820
I'd just like to find out...

332
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,180
I have a better North Korea, Reverend Stang.

333
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,040
I have a better North Korea, Reverend Stang.

334
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,440
You have what?

335
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,340
I have a better book.

336
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,360
I bought Kim Jong-il's book on football.

337
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


338
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


339
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


340
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,040
I have a better book on the American film series.

341
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,960
Wow!

342
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,360
Right.

343
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Man, we can revolutionize Hollywood with that.

344
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,100
I want to sell it in an American edition called Socialist Filmmaking for Dummies.

345
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,340
Cool.

346
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,320
Man.

347
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,580
Well, there must have been thousands of subjects that he wrote on in his spare time,

348
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:09,920
though.

349
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, you guys will get it.

350
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll scan it and send it to you.

351
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,260
Trust me.

352
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,180
Didn't he, like, kidnap film directors and make them make movies for him and stuff?

353
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,340
Yeah.

354
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


355
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


356
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


357
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


358
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


359
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


360
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


361
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


362
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


363
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


364
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


365
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


366
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


367
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


368
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


369
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340


370
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
I don't think they were any North Korea.

371
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,020
That's right.

372
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,980
No, that was the dad, right?

373
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,300
He probably didn't kidnap them.

374
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,600
That was pretty cool.

375
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,620
He just persuaded them.

376
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,220
I thought, that's how Hollywood should be.

377
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,400
His advanced rhetorical technique.

378
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,460
He made them an offer they could not refuse.

379
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:30,840
Right.

380
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,360
He used his advanced techniques in persuasion.

381
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,960
You mean like, oh, I see, like kidnapping them.

382
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,300
Yeah.

383
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,020
We know where your children go to school.

384
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,080
Yeah, now let's make the movie.

385
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,760
Yeah, now let's make a movie.

386
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,140
Okay.

387
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,080
Reverend Stang, you know who really liked my account of North Korea was all the burners.

388
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,300
I had a separate email to the burners and they all love it.

389
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,860
Oh, I have a question for you.

390
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,440
All of them?

391
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,820
Did you talk to Un about him sending the torpedo into the...

392
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,480
All of them love it?

393
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,100
Into that South Korean frigate?

394
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,680
He still hangs out with the rich burners.

395
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,760
Ah, rich burners.

396
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,500
By the way, I'll...

397
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,880
The North Koreans had lost the three previous rounds of ship-to-ship battle in that zone.

398
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,320
So, when things went bad with the South Korean president, the Navy tapped Kim Jong Il on the

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,820
shoulder and said, hi, you promised.

400
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,060
Yeah.

401
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,700
You promised to get paid.

402
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,540
So, the North Koreans are still down three to one.

403
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,920
They lost three of their ships to the South Korean one.

404
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,900
That was just a payback.

405
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,440
Man, that's a lot of space in these.

406
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,080
You stole my battleship.

407
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,080
Yeah.

408
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,860
You stole my battleship.

409
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,600
Or as Eddie Izzard said, Hitler never played to risk, huh?

410
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,260
Oh, yes.

411
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,920
Oh.

412
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,080
Hey, your fighter jet fell into my battleship.

413
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:41,860
Yeah.

414
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,640
Your battleship crashed into my fighter jet.

415
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,060
Okay, here's another question.

416
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,860
Hey, they taste good together.

417
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,360
How many North Koreans are coming to Ex Day?

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,620
There they are now.

419
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,180
They're lining up.

420
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,980
Everyone will be at Ex Day.

421
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,920
We represent the North Korean agency.

422
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,780
No one has a choice, Lister.

423
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,540
When Ex Day comes, it comes to them.

424
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,380
It comes to everyone.

425
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,460
Hello, we represent the North Korean agency.

426
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,500
Here's the story.

427
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,120
Half the North Koreans who defected out of North Korea can't handle the rest of the

428
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,140
world and have to go back.

429
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,860
Okay.

430
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm not surprised.

431
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,220
That...

432
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,740
You know, it's real hard for Native Americans.

433
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:16,840
Yeah.

434
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,640
Unless...

435
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,060
Otherwise, at that moment in time, it's an assigning

436
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,300
or subadaskling of lessons or exercises.

437
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,340
It's a capital issue for Native Americans, man, way overread, and they'reometry digo

438
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,480
forward.

439
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,660
There's history of...

440
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:45,840
Yeah, automated information.

441
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,420
live, long live, long live.

442
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,800
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

443
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,640
At ease, at ease, man.

444
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,680
Gentlemen, thank you.

445
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,320
Yes.

446
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Aloha.

447
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,260
I'll see you.

448
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,380
I'll see you someday. We are

449
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,080
ready to welcome you again.

450
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,860
Okay.

451
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,140
I'm in the airport now.

452
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm ready to come back.

453
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,440
All right. Thank you. I'm signing off.

454
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Thank you for calling. Bye.

455
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,740
No problem. No problem.

456
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,460
No lie, GI. No lie.

457
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,280
No. I love you no show.

458
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,220
No.

459
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,660
That's my dream. I love you no show.

460
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,340
I love you no show.

461
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,040
I love you no show.

462
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,780
I love you no show.

463
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,620
I love you no show.

464
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,000


465
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,140
I love you no show.

466
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah, if you're in North Korea, the government

467
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,560
totally sucks.

468
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,260
Ben Franklin was a rebel indeed.

469
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,420
He liked to be a rebel.

470
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,420


471
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,680
He liked to get naked while they smoked on the scene.

472
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,020
He was the kingiest.

473
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,780
But if he was here today,

474
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,300
the government would buttercup his right to your day.

475
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,280
Now, let me tell you something

476
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,320
about the government.

477
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,280
What?

478
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,300
Blowing up the environment.

479
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,820
Hey, is that right?

480
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,340
Taking all the freaking beautiful animals, yeah?

481
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,760
And making them freaking extinct.

482
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,660
Oh, no.

483
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,460
The government totally sucks, you mother trucker.

484
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,620
The government totally sucks.

485
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,420
The government totally sucks.

486
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,420


487
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,780
The government totally sucks.

488
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,840
In North Korea.

489
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,600
Because the land of love and freedom

490
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,580
is just a baby's breath away.

491
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,080
And if we hold hands together,

492
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,100
we can bring back the USA.

493
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,120
The USA.

494
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,020
Thank you.

495
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,580
Bring back the USA.

496
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,540
Not the NPRK.

497
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,180
No, the USA.

498
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,720
The USA.

499
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,420
We're on KPFA.

500
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,040
No, we don't vote for you.

501
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,820
KPFA and Berkeley in 98.

502
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,880
No, we don't.

503
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,140
We ain't.

504
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,880
Bring back the KFUS.

505
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,660
Oh, yeah.

506
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,680
KFUS, KC, KF, KF.

507
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,020
And remember, the government totally sucks.

508
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,440
Wherever you are.

509
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,280
Was that the D?

510
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,220
Yeah.

511
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,360
The government totally sucks.

512
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I've never heard that song by the D.

513
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,100
I thought it was Conspiracy Rock.

514
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,540
Oh, that was a great band.

515
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,620
Conspiracy Rock.

516
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah, they got that.

517
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,860
I want to know more of Rock.

518
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,380
Oh, yeah.

519
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
Then there's Turok.

520
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,560
We were talking about Turok.

521
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:24,780
Turok, yeah.

522
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,320
Turok, Son of Stone.

523
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,700
Then there's Turok.

524
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,220
Deadly Specimens.

525
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,100
That's my new goth band, Deadly Specimens.

526
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,460
Oh, I bet there's 20 D.

527
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,700
You better Google that one

528
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,560
and see if there's somebody

529
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,700
that doesn't already have that name.

530
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,540
Oh, yeah.

531
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,760
I looked up.

532
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,960
I was trying to contact Sister Decadence.

533
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
For some reason, I Googled Sister Decadence

534
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,760
and discovered that there were something like

535
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,820
a hundred different bands out there named Decadence.

536
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,660
Yeah, it's like Cork K-Rob.

537
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,860
You know, one day I went and looked for K-Rob

538
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,440
and there were a hundred K-Robs.

539
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,920
Fifty of them in each city in America.

540
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, you get on Facebook and there's so many Bob Dobbs

541
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
that your finger gets tired scrolling down.

542
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,220
I'm tired of scrolling.

543
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,000
So stupid.

544
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,880
You know, there's thousands and thousands of them.

545
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,560
Every now and then, one of them shows a different guy

546
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,900
and it's probably someone whose name is Robert Dobbs.

547
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
James Robert Dobbs or something.

548
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,940
So here we are on the show.

549
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,140
I feel sorry for those guys.

550
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,620
And you can call 8-5-0-4-0

551
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,240
from the 5-10 area code to find us.

552
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,220
You're listening to the Positive Evidence Show.

553
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,840
Or, as heard on Hour of Slack,

554
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,360
cause deepness.

555
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,980
Missed.

556
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,020
No, I'm just jumping.

557
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,320
What?

558
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,180
What?

559
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,760
So you can leave that part in

560
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,140
because the angels were carrying him while he said that.

561
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,680
I hate to put your number out on my show

562
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
because it doesn't make any sense.

563
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,240
When some poor guy here is going to get a call.

564
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,000
Once a month.

565
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,420
What?

566
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,600
At midnight.

567
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,220
The calls from Cleveland are coming.

568
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,240
They are.

569
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,000
They're rolling in.

570
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,380
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

571
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,900
Trolling, trolling, trolling.

572
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,540
Keep trolling, trolling, trolling.

573
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,260
Trolling.

574
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
Keep those little scrolls.

575
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,420
Trolling, trolling, trolling.

576
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,940
Yep, the heat's gone back up,

577
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,140
but the calls don't sound bad now,

578
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,080
so maybe that's not related.

579
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
Before the internet, Dr. German,

580
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,520
remember how we used to troll people on CB radio?

581
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,240
We had the urge to troll.

582
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,760
But then we didn't have the means of the internet.

583
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,760
You could only troll within about a 19-mile radius.

584
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,520
You know, that proves that trolling is genetic to the human.

585
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,720
All humans need to troll.

586
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,440
Well, also,

587
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,880
geniuses need to troll.

588
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,340
Well, okay, that's true.

589
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,400
I thought he said he was a subgenius, but.

590
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,660
I wouldn't say all subgenius.

591
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,040
Okay.

592
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,860
Did you say a subgenius, but?

593
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,640
She said that we're trolls.

594
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,260
The government totally sucks.

595
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,960
Trolls under the bridge.

596
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,820
I said on the one we were singing it that I thought he said he's a subgenius, but.

597
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,860
But he says he's a genius, but.

598
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,720
It's an album put out without the bad words, you see.

599
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,360
Oh.

600
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,380
It's the actual CD of the Pick of Destiny.

601
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,020
My copy of the Pick of Destiny was simply copied.

602
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,580
From a movie.

603
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,380
Copy.

604
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,260
Oh, that's.

605
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,560
That worked.

606
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,560
And this song, I don't remember that song being on.

607
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,540
In the movie.

608
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
Man, I haven't seen the movie in so long.

609
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,820
The government totally sucks.

610
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Yeah, that wasn't in the movie.

611
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,720
That's in North Korea, not here.

612
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:27,860
Right.

613
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,360
Yeah.

614
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,940
No, I didn't say that.

615
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,780
I didn't say that.

616
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,420
I didn't say anything.

617
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,900
Mr. Gingrich will be seeing you when you get home from the show.

618
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,020
Here is police escort.

619
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,160
Pulls up in front of your eyes.

620
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,860
The alien has.

621
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,440
Governor Rhodes will get me.

622
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,380
Counting.

623
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,540
Counting.

624
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:41,740
Counting.

625
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:41,740


626
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:41,740


627
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:41,740


628
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:41,740


629
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:41,740


630
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:41,980
How old is he?

631
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,960
He's the one.

632
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,940
He sends the National Guard to shoot the students at Kent State.

633
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,380
He did, though.

634
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,600
And they named the radio station after him.

635
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,400
WCSB used to be located in Rhodes Tower, named after Governor Rhodes, who told the National

636
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,280
Guard, you better do something about them hippies.

637
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,640
That still hurts.

638
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,720
People up there get big heartache every.

639
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,720
What if you were dead on the ground?

640
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,420
Yeah.

641
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,740
What if you were?

642
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,600
What if you were?

643
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,500
I know people who did see her dead on the ground.

644
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,700
Well, there you go.

645
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,640
One of them formed a band called the Devo.

646
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:16,940
That's right.

647
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,360
Yeah.

648
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,380
You want to be.

649
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,020
Because he.

650
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,900
Yeah, I think about that all the time.

651
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,420
It's just.

652
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,680
I can't get it out of my mind.

653
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,500
You know, the sense of seeing that and then going and starting Devo, because that's.

654
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,240
That's the only place you can go with that energy.

655
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:30,600


656
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,040
They did it too.

657
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,980
Just shout it out.

658
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,860
Take a look at that.

659
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,340
Twitter.

660
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,340


661
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,900
I'll do anything for you

662
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
Just tell me what you want me to do

663
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,660
Money!

664
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,900
He'll be up against the wall

665
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,620
Money!

666
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,340
Throw on everything he wants it on

667
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,700
No!

668
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,180
You can't take it

669
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,540
No!

670
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,200
You can't take it

671
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,620
No!

672
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,680
You can't get that away from me

673
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,700
No!

674
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,180
You can't take it

675
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,420
No!

676
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,660
No!

677
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,220
You can't take it

678
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,600
No!

679
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,840
You can't get that away from me

680
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
Hand like a hoe

681
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,880
Black as your soul

682
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,780
I'd rather die

683
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,700
Than die

684
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,640
Than give you control

685
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,800
Hand like a hoe

686
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,980
Black as your soul

687
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,800
I'd rather die

688
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,880
Than give you control

689
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,020
Whoa, no!

690
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,780
Before the one you serve

691
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,580
You're going to get what you deserve

692
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,920
Whoa, no!

693
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,700
Before the one you serve

694
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,500
You're going to get what you deserve

695
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,800
I'm not looking for the cure

696
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,940
Not concerned about the sick among the pure

697
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,860
Let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised

698
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,760
Not the one to choose

699
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,160
You can't take it

700
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,440
No!

701
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,540


702
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,160
You can't take it

703
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,340
No!

704
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,620
You can't take that away from me

705
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,080
No!

706
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,080
No!

707
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,180
You can't take it

708
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,460
No!

709
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,200
You can't take it

710
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,440
No!

711
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,880
You can't take that away from me

712
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,900
Hey!

713
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,300
Let the Ben Sam tell you

714
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,460
My damn playing's not bad

715
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,080
Here came what I got

716
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,420
Hey!

717
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,760
Let the Ben Sam tell you

718
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,180
My damn playing's not bad

719
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,820
Here came what I got

720
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,360
Here came what I got

721
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,540
Here came what I got

722
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:15,540


723
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,780
It damn must've gone...

724
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,000
Bow down

725
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,860
Before the one you serve

726
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,680
You're going to get what you deserve

727
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,000
Bow down

728
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Before the one you serve

729
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,580
You're going to get what you deserve

730
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,640
Head like a hole

731
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,760
Black is your soul

732
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,780
I'm at the die

733
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,620
To give you control

734
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,820
Head like a hole

735
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Black is your soul

736
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm at the die

737
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,660
To give you control

738
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,780
Head like a hole

739
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,860
Black is your soul

740
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm at the die

741
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,640
To give you control

742
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,820
Head like a hole

743
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,940
Black is your soul

744
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,920
I'm at the die

745
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,840
To give you control

746
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,040
Bow down

747
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,840
Before the one you serve

748
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,620
You're going to get what you deserve

749
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,960
Bowdown

750
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,720
Before the one you serve

751
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,560
You're going to get what you deserve

752
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,900
Bowdown

753
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,760
Before the one you serve

754
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,600
You're going to get what you deserve

755
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,920
Bowdown

756
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,700
Before the one you serve

757
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,380
You're going to get what you deserve

758
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,300
Okay, I have a question about the black cat.

759
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,240
Black cats in general?

760
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,040
Mm-hmm.

761
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,120
Okay, now, I've always heard that if they cross one way in front of you, it's good luck.

762
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,480
Is it true, or is it either way they cross in front of you is bad luck?

763
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,540
Are you talking about...

764
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,600
And if there is a good luck way for them to cross in front of you, which way is it?

765
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,200
Left to right or right to left?

766
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:52,340
If a black cat walks backwards from left to right in front of you, it reverses the previous...

767
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,900
Right?

768
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,200
It's a balancing...

769
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:03,680
Yeah, the last time one walked in front of you from left to right, forward, that produced a lot of bad luck.

770
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,200
So if they walk backwards in the opposite direction, then that can negate that previous...

771
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,080
Oh, so you've got to track the little bastard down. It's like a rabies thing.

772
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,560
You've got to get him to walk backwards.

773
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,440
It's a transaction reversal.

774
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,760
Now, can you drag him?

775
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,040
Can you drag him, like, by the tail?

776
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,740
Oh, well, you can do whatever it takes.

777
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,440
You can do whatever...

778
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
What? What's that so hard?

779
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,420
See, what you say on the radio happens in real life.

780
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,280
I guess so. It's happening in the studio.

781
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,300
Right now, even as we speak, there's a cat back there that's trying not... trying to get away.

782
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,020
That sounds a little like the X-Cottas, actually.

783
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,180
But what happens...

784
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,960
Yeah, it's a cat.

785
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,360
Maybe you're right about that.

786
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,480
You've got to go with it, man. It's radio.

787
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
It's only in your mind.

788
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,740
You just say it, and then it happens.

789
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,620
Now, which would you rather do?

790
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,400
Do what you're doing right now or sit through a session of Congress?

791
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,100
I do want to go right now. Session of Congress.

792
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,980
I mean, come on.

793
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,600
You want to fucking eat your own hat after that.

794
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,140
Yeah, you want to eat your own hat.

795
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,240
Right, right, right.

796
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,560
I don't know.

797
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,240
I don't know.

798
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,220
Did you see that?

799
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,880
That just went straight...

800
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,400
So whatever I say on the radio will happen in real life.

801
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,120
Yeah, it's done.

802
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,940
That's what happened.

803
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,200
That's what just happened.

804
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,240
Except if you were in Congress right now.

805
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,840
Oh, I was going to say that there will be plenty of...

806
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,900
Like, watch this.

807
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,540
I think Ivan Stang's here.

808
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,240
There will be plenty of tickets for anybody who wants to...

809
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,720
No, that didn't work at all.

810
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,460
Let me try again.

811
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,260
I think Ivan Stang's here.

812
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
I think Ivan Stang's here.

813
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,460
See?

814
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,580
I said it on the radio and it happened.

815
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,220
How about that?

816
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,060
Never mind, you guys.

817
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,860
They don't even know who you're referring to out here.

818
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,160
Indeed, we have again the mighty Ivan Stang joins us in here in the studio.

819
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,060
We're there.

820
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,420
Get a second job.

821
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,600
A lot of chaos.

822
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,760
Get him.

823
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,900
What do you think of the ticket debacle?

824
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, no, there he is.

825
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,520
Strumming her u-yolo in the background there.

826
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,140
The debacle?

827
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,540
Hello, you're on the air.

828
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh.

829
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,320
That's what I...

830
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,760
Hello, this is Philo Drummond.

831
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm a religious cult leader with the church of the subgenius.

832
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,880
Philo Drummond.

833
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,620
Long time no see.

834
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,860
You're not a religious cult leader.

835
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,440
He wasn't lying.

836
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,740
He really does introduce himself that way.

837
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,720
You're a hypo-cripes.

838
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,580
Well, is that...

839
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,300
No, no, he's not.

840
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,480
He told me earlier today.

841
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,000
He said that's how I introduce myself.

842
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,780
I say, I'm Philo Drummond.

843
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
I'm a cult leader.

844
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,700
Yeah, I used to introduce myself as a snake oil salesman back when I was one.

845
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,020
Oh.

846
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,380
Wow.

847
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,740
Well, that's to each his own.

848
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,740
That's what I always say.

849
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,500
I used to introduce myself as a refugee.

850
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,360
A Martian refugee.

851
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,060
Ah.

852
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,360
Hey, Dave.

853
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,140
How's it going?

854
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,740
Oh, it's going very, very poorly.

855
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,720
You should see how it is outside.

856
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,940
It's dripping blood instead of rain.

857
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,240
There's these rather large amphibian-looking things.

858
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,800
I guess you'd call them like some sort of nano frog crawling around.

859
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,680
And now they're starting to eat each other, but you don't want to get in the way.

860
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,180
Yeah.

861
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,180


862
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,180


863
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,180


864
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,180


865
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,180


866
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,840
Yeah, but it's only two minutes.

867
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,920
And the moon is blood red as well.

868
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,900
Now I want to listen to Slayer because you talked about raining blood.

869
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,420
Ashtabula is a rough place, man.

870
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,420
Especially if you've only got three kneecaps.

871
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,440
Or if you have protrusions in your body.

872
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
They're very uncivilized.

873
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,500
Very, very insensitive, crude people here.

874
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,160
There's mean streets.

875
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,400
Mean streets of Ashtabula.

876
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,160
Now, it's actually not too far, though, from a town that was named after Carl.

877
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,160


878
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,400
Connie.

879
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,800
Connie ought.

880
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,340
Yeah.

881
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:52,640
Connie ought to do quite a few things, but it's not really our place to tell her that,

882
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,920
really.

883
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,040
Now, Puzzling Epcot lives in Oakland, which is the second main...

884
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,040


885
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,960
But he lives in Calabula, so it's not that far away.

886
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,400
Oakland?

887
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,660
It's also quite occupied, too, isn't it, right now?

888
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,940
Yeah, everything's occupied.

889
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,660
Shut down the everything.

890
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,800
I was just reading something.

891
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,380
I was just reading something about this the other day.

892
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,680
Someone's saying it looked like a trap, basically.

893
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,340
Like...

894
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,160
What did?

895
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,440
The Martian guy?

896
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,380
The occupation...

897
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,900
Oh.

898
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
The site they were trying to occupy.

899
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,320
Basically, like, the cops just had everything ready to go.

900
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,980
It's like, Lord have been, so they could beat them and gas them.

901
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,860
We made a special place that you guys can occupy.

902
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,460
We've laid these bear traps out all over.

903
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,980
You can come and protest here.

904
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,920
Who's gonna occupy the house?

905
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,480
These electrified bear traps.

906
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,160
These computerized bear traps.

907
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


908
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


909
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,780
Digitized, highly, highly electrified bear traps.

910
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:52,060
So it's for trapping electrified bears, like it'll catch Teddy Ruxpin, but it'll leave Smokey

911
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,200
alone.

912
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,240
Right.

913
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,180
Leave the Smokey alone.

914
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,040
What if it touches everything with its own form of iniquity?

915
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,340
What if...

916
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah, we'll do that.

917
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,100
But this is the beauty of the universe, is that everything is touching everything.

918
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:06,960
Right.

919
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,940
And we can cigarette the rights for $20,000.

920
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,860
No kidding.

921
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
I paid my...

922
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,860
I had a text from the sub-genius church Ohio sales tax today from California, so everything

923
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,280
is touching everything and picking its pockets.

924
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,660
Oh, how convenient.

925
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,500
That's the world that I wanna live in.

926
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:27,600
No, I'm no crude Luddite that wants to go around and blow up information systems just

927
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,700
because I smell funny.

928
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,260
I mean, cause I...

929
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,600
You're not?

930
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,620
I honestly, Dave, all this time, I thought you...

931
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,920
that was exactly your deal.

932
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,800
Smelling funny in one of the, well, information systems.

933
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,020
I think we should go back to the days of growing up.

934
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm shocked.

935
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,980
We live in prisons of our own mind.

936
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,360
I saw like a dead man through the canyons of my mind.

937
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,580
Fleshpots, plenty of them.

938
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,840
What's in a Mai Tai anyway?

939
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,940
Never heard of them.

940
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,380
My mind.

941
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,260
Pickles, pineapples, urgent requests,

942
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,780
and some strange visions of another world, I think.

943
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,160
Think of all the amazing subgenius doctors on this show right now.

944
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,860
Ever saw the subgenius nurse?

945
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,300
All those collapsing doctors.

946
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,400
Collashing doctors.

947
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,500
Collashing doctors.

948
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,540
Collashing doctors.

949
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,360
Collashing doctors.

950
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,120
And you're probably wondering, who are these half-doctors on the clamshell?

951
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,660
Well, we're not going to just tell you, but you call up and say,

952
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,500
all right, who's the half-doctors on the clamshell?

953
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,200
Then we'll tell you.

954
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,040
Then we'll tell you just how and where.

955
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,280
Your boat is leaking.

956
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,580
Okay.

957
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,360
Okay.

958
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,680
Now be quiet.

959
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,360
Be quiet.

960
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,880
Be quiet.

961
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,820
Be quiet.

962
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,460
busy like a

963
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,440
jack see do a spell

964
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,120
Yeah.

965
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,740
Has my style.

966
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,780
So who needs help?

967
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,160
Yes, there are.

968
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,520
There's no one here.

969
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,240
Or Jane, or...

970
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,680
What is about to happen?

971
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,040
It's the romance.

972
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,620
It's the romance.

973
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,840
Barnyard.

974
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,800
Mohandas man.

975
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,700
Mohandas.

976
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,180
Mohandas.

977
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,900
Mohandas man.

978
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
Mohandas man.

979
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,720
echoed in high notes

980
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,180
Intense rumbling

981
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,900
head��눕

982
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,600
mother, mother.

983
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,000
Mohandas man.

984
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Mohandas man.

985
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,840
Oh, this man.

986
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,380
Oh, this man.

987
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh, this man.

988
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,720
Oh, this man.

989
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,060
Remember every hearing of this man that that recording.

990
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,620
Wow.

991
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,060
Wow.

992
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,720
Far out.

993
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,240
I like the new landing pads on the bottom of the show's show wells.

994
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,780
Thanks.

995
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,460
Yeah, you agree.

996
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,940
Everyone agrees these new show well landing pad struts or strut lifters are excellent.

997
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,800
Excellent.

998
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,840
You know, those are not immune to sabotage, though.

999
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,320
No, they're kind of delicate.

1000
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:38,980
Now, I'm sure that on a certain planetoid of unnamed origin, they would be rife for

1001
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,240
vacation.

1002
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,820
Vandalism.

1003
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:47,820
There are terrorists who use chemicals that slowly eat away at the infrastructure.

1004
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,600
I noticed that.

1005
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,740
Well, you know what I'd say to them?

1006
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,340
Time bombs, basically.

1007
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,880
You'd say Bohondas man.

1008
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,620
They set those rust viruses loose.

1009
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,660
What would you say?

1010
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,540
Bohondas man.

1011
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,440
I got away from them.

1012
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,460
No, no, I can't say that.

1013
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,040
We did that already.

1014
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,360
It was a Bohondas man.

1015
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,720
But what would you say to them?

1016
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,280
I would say, hello, boys.

1017
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,040
I'm back.

1018
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,980
But it's the wrong music.

1019
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,320
I think.

1020
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,220
Hello, boys.

1021
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,020
I'm back.

1022
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,960
Whoa.

1023
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,220
That's different that way.

1024
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,600
She is back.

1025
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,740
That got my attention.

1026
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,440
That was really, well, don't, well, careful with those struts.

1027
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,420
Don't pay.

1028
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,040
It takes millions of dollars to replace those struts.

1029
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,640
One thing at a time.

1030
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,060
There are lots of paperwork.

1031
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,420
I mean, they're good for clubbing baby seals, but other than that.

1032
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,260
The bio lifters.

1033
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,400
Yeah, we club the baby harp seals.

1034
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,360
You got to be tough and you got to be man.

1035
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,860
You can find a harp seal.

1036
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,020
Those are for you if you want them.

1037
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,320
Oh, my God.

1038
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,040
Let me tell you.

1039
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,920
Thank you.

1040
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,180
Yeah.

1041
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,840
Sure.

1042
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,480
And that's the sound I like to hear.

1043
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,440
Sure.

1044
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,620
Sure.

1045
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,200
People.

1046
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,580
Yeah.

1047
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,000
People.

1048
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,500
Sure.

1049
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:49,920
It's brilliant.

1050
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,540
Brilliant.

1051
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,800
I have to say that once a week.

1052
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,000
It's crowd pleasing.

1053
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm sounding cautiously optimistic about security there.

1054
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,440
Vice President Joe Biden is trying to move through a rugged canyon.

1055
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,400
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says it will not be possible until Palestinians

1056
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,340
have civil rights.

1057
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,620
Civil rights violations in schools and colleges across the country.

1058
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,800
Finally.

1059
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,160
The.

1060
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,400
The.

1061
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,620
The.

1062
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,000
And since one of those.

1063
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,240
Res.

1064
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,460
The.

1065
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:15,720
The.

1066
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,880
Way.

1067
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,180
No.

1068
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,400
It.

1069
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,720
For all.

1070
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:16,960
The.

1071
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,160
The.

1072
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,300
The.

1073
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,460
The.

1074
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,500
And in my last story, I misspoke.

1075
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,200
I meant to say, this is PR News.

1076
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,400
A global trade union says a whore has killed at least 12 people.

1077
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,340
The top U.S. general in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, says among the allegations are

1078
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,840
denial of Jewish college preparatory programs.

1079
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:38,320
Massive rock slides in western Colorado face big career obstacles.

1080
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,300
Stuckels NPR News from Washington.

1081
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm wondering now, did Shining Path send his video out from North Korea?

1082
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,580
Or did he smuggle it out?

1083
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,420
I'm worried about that.

1084
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,180
I mean, is he going to get a deal for that?

1085
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,980
Or disappear it or something?

1086
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,580
He will now.

1087
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,760
Yeah, he might be.

1088
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,980
And now that we've just brought that up and given him the suggestion.

1089
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,320
Of course, they're monitoring everything in North Korea.

1090
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,440
And the government really sucks there.

1091
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,880
The minute the minute the show comes on, they somebody in North Korea.

1092
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,900
It turns in.

1093
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,340
They listen to our slack too.

1094
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,360
And it's not for us or even J.R. Bob Dobbs is for Shining Path.

1095
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,140
But please resist.

1096
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,300
They're following him in case he calls in with codes.

1097
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,900
You know.

1098
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,480
So next week, we'll be this.

1099
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,400
We'll be deciphering the secret of the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail again.

1100
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,800
Well, next week.

1101
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,600
Not again.

1102
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
This is a new spin on an old subject.

1103
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,000
They're all based on satirical.

1104
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,360
Pamphlets written by young men making fun of the occult trends of their days.

1105
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,380
All religions were started that don't say that we're going to talk about it next week.

1106
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,980
I'm covering it ahead of time.

1107
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,500
You can do that.

1108
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,800
Covers all mail order calls.

1109
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,760
We're going to talk about how hog raising is a dirty business.

1110
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,920
You have to get rid of all that hog stuff.

1111
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,880
You have to just hold.

1112
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,220
Hog raising.

1113
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,960
And only one thing.

1114
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,220
Hog killing.

1115
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,860
And you got to do your hog killing in the right kind of weather.

1116
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,960
You can't sell.

1117
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,320
That's why your hog will go bad before you get it down in there.

1118
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,700
You can't sell a single quarter pound of bacon without killing a hog.

1119
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,300
You got to kill that hog sooner or later.

1120
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,200
There's only one way to kill that hog.

1121
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,680
That's with this knife here.

1122
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,040
This one right here.

1123
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,760
My grandpappy gave me.

1124
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,580
You're going to have to use this to prove your man.

1125
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,140
Get in there.

1126
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,880
And kill that hog.

1127
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,940
My granddaddy and his granddaddy before him and his granddaddy before him.

1128
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,120
Pass this knife down.

1129
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,520
This hog killing knife.

1130
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Just for the killing of the hog.

1131
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,340
There's a hog snorting right there.

1132
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,320
This hog killing day.

1133
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,340
Get down in there and kill me that hog.

1134
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,380
Now do it.

1135
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,700
Now do it or you ain't coming back to this family anymore.

1136
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,200
You got to kill the hog just like I did.

1137
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,780
Cold blood.

1138
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,980
Just wrestle with it.

1139
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,020
Slit it.

1140
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:07,400
Throat.

1141
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,300
String it up.

1142
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,620
Strang it up.

1143
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,460
Strang it up by its heels.

1144
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,180
By its heels.

1145
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,080
By its hind heels.

1146
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,180
That's how they got a bucking ham there.

1147
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,160
Cut little sleeves around his little.

1148
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,120
Listen to that bucking ham bucking up there next to that buck board.

1149
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,060
Its heels just a kicking at that buck board.

1150
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,080
It's a bucking ham.

1151
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,380
Now carefully slice down the middle there and you'll be able to get them guts out without making a big mess.

1152
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,040
You know that hog operation you got is devastating.

1153
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,060
It's devastating to the environment.

1154
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,700
On warm nights I sit up with my children and I wake up and I vomit from the smell.

1155
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,280
I put my wife and my two sons and my daughter in my beat up old pickup truck and I drive away from the farm as far as we could.

1156
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,640
Just to get away.

1157
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,360
To get a clip.

1158
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,520
Get a breath without getting sick.

1159
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,400
Puking.

1160
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,820
It's horrible horrible smell coming from your hog farm.

1161
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,960
Then we stop at the Amish restaurant and order scrapple to make us forget our problem.

1162
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,980
Scrapple pork chops.

1163
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,400
Spam.

1164
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,100
Mighty good.

1165
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,280
Thick sliced bacon they got there too.

1166
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,000
Not bacon.

1167
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,720
No not bacon.

1168
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,400
Scrapple.

1169
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,520
Then I drop back to my hog farm operation where it just smells bad.

1170
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,680
That guy's a true subgenius.

1171
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,100
What's better than one me a thousand me's?

1172
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,220
My family just have projectile vomiting all day long.

1173
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,900
We can't keep nothing down from the smell of my hog farm.

1174
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,940
Hog farms are nasty.

1175
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,140
A hog farm's so nasty I can't even go on it without projectile vomiting.

1176
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,660
That's what I'm walking through here.

1177
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,740
It's sloshing around by my feet right now.

1178
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,360
That's when we started.

1179
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,560
Sounds like the waves of a mighty lake.

1180
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,380
Puking.

1181
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,700
Give me some scrapple.

1182
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,520
I need scrapple.

1183
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,880
You know you hog killers.

1184
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,040
As big as a baby.

1185
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,680
You got to give away some scrapple with some jerky and some grits.

1186
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,260
Give them.

1187
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,420
And some harmony.

1188
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,640
We're just giving.

1189
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,020
We sell our scrapple.

1190
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,940
We don't have enough money to buy food for our children unless we sell our scrapple.

1191
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:17,340
We have to sell scrapple in order to buy hot dogs which are a step up.

1192
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,080
Is that like bacon with eyeballs and penises?

1193
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Okay now hot dogs are made out of rectums and penises right?

1194
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,440
Okay.

1195
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,340
Lips.

1196
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:27,940
Okay.

1197
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:35,040
Scrapple is made out of what's left after they've already taken out the stuff for the hot dogs.

1198
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,000
It's just stuff so gross.

1199
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,000


1200
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,740
That they don't even want to talk about it.

1201
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,380
And mix it with corn and hair.

1202
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,960
And cook it up real.

1203
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,920
It smells faintly like hair.

1204
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,260
Smells a little like hair.

1205
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
A little bit like bacon.

1206
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,780
A little bit like fried spam.

1207
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,320
It's got a lot of protein though.

1208
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,340
That's the important thing.

1209
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,740
And a lot of pink slime.

1210
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,720
Yes.

1211
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,400
Scrapple.

1212
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,520
Yummy pink slime.

1213
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,880
Pink slime.

1214
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,840
Scrapple is the official breakfast of the X Day World Committee.

1215
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes.

1216
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,120
The X Day X Committee.

1217
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,720
Are you going to explain?

1218
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,560
We do actually.

1219
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,580
We usually.

1220
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:18,240
You can usually get free scrapple at subgenius official X Day events in Ohio.

1221
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,600
It just sounds like it.

1222
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,460
Free scrapple.

1223
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,820
If you know the right people.

1224
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,160
Thank you.

1225
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,480
Give me some scrapple.

1226
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,800
Are you going to play a little metal woman?

1227
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,000
Give me some scrapple.

1228
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,420
I guess I should.

1229
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:35,780
But you know you can eat the insides of people's you know intestines and liver and kidneys

1230
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,320
and stuff.

1231
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,760
It's got a lot of vitamins.

1232
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,800
You got to clean them.

1233
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,040
You got to wash them out.

1234
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,340
Is that Michael Pepe?

1235
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,820
Oh yeah.

1236
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,760
You wash them out.

1237
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,060
Yep.

1238
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,820
And you know if you.

1239
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,280
Squeeze them.

1240
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,300
If you pluck the hairs from people's nostrils and fry them.

1241
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:51,620
Nostril tune.

1242
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,220
You get a nice little kind of a bug like.

1243
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,300
Once again we return to that subject of nostril hairs.

1244
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,800
Yes.

1245
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,540
Well nostrils are vital.

1246
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,020
What is it?

1247
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,440
What is it about the theme of this show that has suddenly become.

1248
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:01,980
Really?

1249
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,300
Fried nostril hairs on top of.

1250
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,000
Fried nostril pubic hairs.

1251
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,300
Yes.

1252
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


1253
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


1254
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


1255
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


1256
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


1257
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,680
This is a creepy creepy creepy subject.

1258
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,740
And you can cook and eat the dirt under your.

1259
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,340
Creepy subject.

1260
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,300
And a lot of people don't know this.

1261
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,960
If you're starving just clean out your toenails.

1262
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,940
Set them on fire.

1263
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,160
Cook them up.

1264
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,220
You know sterilize them.

1265
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,560
And you can eat them.

1266
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,340
And it will stave off.

1267
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,840
You won't have to eat your companion's buttocks.

1268
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,600
Why wait until you're starving?

1269
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,020
But your companion's buttocks seem like they're a lot more palatable than your toenails.

1270
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,240
Well it depends on your.

1271
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,280
There's more protein in there.

1272
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,280


1273
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,900
There's more protein in a buttock than the average toenail.

1274
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:45,540
Actually we teach you about this protein in step number four of the patented 13 steps

1275
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,320
to super sexy sales success.

1276
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,460
Oh not that again.

1277
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,580
The 13 steps.

1278
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,820
The 13 steps.

1279
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,900
Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps.

1280
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,100
Eight percent extra steps.

1281
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,080
To super sexy sales success course.

1282
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,020
Wow.

1283
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,140
With our eight percent.

1284
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,880
Yeah eight percent.

1285
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,500
Four.

1286
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,200
Extra steps.

1287
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,700
Yeah.

1288
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,260
And your average 12 step course.

1289
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,640
You know I don't even need the extra 12 steps.

1290
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,280
I'm already two steps.

1291
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,280


1292
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,280


1293
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,280


1294
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,280


1295
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,740
You're too sexy.

1296
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,240
You're too sexy.

1297
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:08,500
Yeah.

1298
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,920
Well good thing about Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps in step number four.

1299
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,200
Six.

1300
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,320
Step back.

1301
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,540
Yeah step number six.

1302
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:22,120
We teach you how to detone your super sexy self into a less super sexy self.

1303
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:22,720
Oh.

1304
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,940
So the people are more comfortable with you.

1305
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,520
With their sexiness right.

1306
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:26,900
Yeah.

1307
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,220
Yeah.

1308
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,740
Because people just can't handle the full on total sexiness.

1309
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,540
Right.

1310
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:31,960
We let.

1311
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,220
We help you tone down your sexiness.

1312
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:34,460
Yeah.

1313
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,320
But not in a way that's demeaning to you.

1314
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:36,600
Right.

1315
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,060
What about.

1316
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,140
Dr. Drummondian pheromones simply overcome all inhibition.

1317
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,160
Everybody thinks we should.

1318
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,160
That's in step six too.

1319
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,060
We cover that fully in step six.

1320
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,720
We spend about six weeks on it in step six.

1321
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,780
Six weeks to a new sexy.

1322
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,380
Six.

1323
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,160
Six weeks.

1324
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,380
Yeah so.

1325
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,740
In step six.

1326
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,720
You know you'll be moving on to other.

1327
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,060
Step six.

1328
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,460
Like other subjects in step seven you'll be learning the secrets to radio.

1329
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:03,800
Radio.

1330
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,280
Radio technology.

1331
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:05,880
Oh.

1332
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,180
So some people stay there at.

1333
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,420
Six.

1334
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,680
At step seven.

1335
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,280
The whole life.

1336
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:09,660
Radio and television repair.

1337
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,120
Wow.

1338
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,140
So you can plug your nostril hairs into the radio.

1339
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,140
You just stay there.

1340
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,700
You're just there all the time.

1341
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,580
Step seven.

1342
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,460
Step seven in radio repair you may be.

1343
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,660
You may get into the.

1344
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,400
The expanding.

1345
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,980
The mind expanding and.

1346
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:24,960
Huge.

1347
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,380
Fast growing market of radio repair.

1348
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,940
The nostril is the center of the soul.

1349
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:30,780
People.

1350
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,700
Know this.

1351
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,760
People are listening to the radio and.

1352
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:33,760


1353
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:33,760


1354
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:33,760


1355
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:33,760


1356
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:33,780


1357
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,680
It's smarter than they should.

1358
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,780
They're listening really really hard and it wears the radio out.

1359
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,380
That's right.

1360
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,160
You have to take the radio in and get it fixed.

1361
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,900
The nostril is like the sunroof of the soul.

1362
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,040
I know.

1363
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,560
And people wear their hair out to us.

1364
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,760
The sunroof of the soul.

1365
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,140
It rubs it down.

1366
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,460
Well that begs the question Reverend Stan.

1367
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,100
If the nostril is the sunroof of the soul.

1368
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,560
Yeah.

1369
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,540
What is the moonroof of the soul?

1370
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,280
Oh.

1371
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,680
That that hole that they drilled at the top of your head.

1372
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:03,760
Yeah.

1373
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1374
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1375
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1376
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1377
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1378
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1379
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1380
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1381
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1382
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1383
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:03,760


1384
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,600
You know that one in Dogstown Dr. Drummond.

1385
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,080
Yeah.

1386
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,980
Ah yes.

1387
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:07,780
Oh.

1388
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,880
And it's so much cooler inside.

1389
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,240
Yeah.

1390
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,980
I I just that released so much tension when that when that happened to me when that was

1391
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,200
done.

1392
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,560
I just didn't have thoughts anymore.

1393
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,120
I wasn't burdened by thinking.

1394
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,640
The the the heat of the thinking rises out the top.

1395
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,180
Yeah.

1396
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,820
You're so much cooler.

1397
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,280
Yeah.

1398
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:29,860
You're a cooler person.

1399
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,180
You're a cool person and the chicks did.

1400
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,600
Yeah.

1401
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,100
Exactly.

1402
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,760
Because they know that.

1403
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1404
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1405
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1406
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1407
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1408
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1409
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1410
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1411
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1412
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1413
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:33,760


1414
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,600
They know you're not thinking.

1415
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,340
You're not.

1416
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,640
They know you're rocks.

1417
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,100
You're not gonna you're not gonna notice how pathetic they are.

1418
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,420
Right.

1419
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,840
Because you're brain you're mindless.

1420
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,740
You've given up.

1421
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,680
That's right.

1422
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,340
That thing that held you back and society.

1423
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,480
Yeah.

1424
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,680
18 minutes left in the program.

1425
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,360
So uh too bad nobody can call in about acting.

1426
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,180
That's just the way it is.

1427
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,600
But they can hear us out there on the Yodeling radio which is cool.

1428
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,080
I might hang up on the Yoler.

1429
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,720
I'm hand over that pickle's mouth.

1430
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,420
I'm not gonna hang up on the Yoler.

1431
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,420


1432
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,420


1433
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,420


1434
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,420


1435
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,980
How many how many how many listeners do you have?

1436
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,540
On the internet right now.

1437
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,880
How many how many how many?

1438
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,060
How many how many how many?

1439
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,140
How many how many?

1440
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,760
How many how many?

1441
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,980
Uh right now on the internet we got 22 listeners including one in Canada and one in Germany.

1442
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,260
You can tell that Canadian goose right now that Ontario is a large land.

1443
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,640
It's Mario from Ontario.

1444
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,680
How can I help you?

1445
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,200
I'm sorry.

1446
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,300
That's me.

1447
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,480
Uh I'm in the middle of a podcast.

1448
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:35,480


1449
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:35,480


1450
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:35,480


1451
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:35,540
I'm the host of the Ask Dr. Hal Show.

1452
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,340
Hey Reverend Stang are you gonna be out here for the Ask Dr. Hal Show?

1453
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,000
The live one?

1454
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,040
Uh yeah I'll be here for every uh show.

1455
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,300
Um I just had a strange experience.

1456
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,740
I just went over and listened to my headphones uh to what is coming down the stream rather

1457
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,080
than what's coming over the phone.

1458
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,320
And I must say this is a very very strange sounding show.

1459
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,540
So you're actually.

1460
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:58,740
Why?

1461
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
You're actually seeing the renegade logic.

1462
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:01,700
You're actually seeing the renegade logic.

1463
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,220
Because we're a bunch of strange people.

1464
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,760
Oh technically or spiritually?

1465
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,800
The acoustics are very strange because of the proximity of the pilot phone and the

1466
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,160
phone.

1467
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,180
So there's this slight echo on top of the echo.

1468
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,940
So are you simultaneously on two shows?

1469
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,020
Echo and the Bunnymen.

1470
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,760
It's soul stealing is what it is.

1471
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,220
It's brain breaking and back hurting.

1472
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:30,940
Wait but wait.

1473
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,340
I have no evidence to stand against it.

1474
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:33,900
Ratings!

1475
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:35,100


1476
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,420
Ratings!

1477
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,420
Ha!

1478
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,740
Someone followed my soul and refused to return it after six weeks were already up in the

1479
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,020
wind.

1480
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,940
The soul stealing effort is already on the internet.

1481
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,700
See and that killed the show right there.

1482
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,800
The show died out.

1483
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,020
You can't steal anything.

1484
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,780
No no I was just thinking of a large library where every person is given a soul and some

1485
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:00,920
of them are dead.

1486
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:00,920


1487
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:00,920


1488
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:00,920


1489
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:06,060
Some of them are like written by Ruth Dixon other by you know the popular Christ figure

1490
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,740
of the time.

1491
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:13,060
You inhabit the soul as long as you fit the shoes you walk in.

1492
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,840
Actually you know Christ is my favorite deity because he's the only one who encourages you

1493
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,300
to eat him.

1494
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,920
Ha ha ha ha.

1495
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah and if you don't like it you can eat me right?

1496
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,980
But man cannot live on the body of Christ alone.

1497
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,220
Nor his blood.

1498
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,000
When you distill his blood.

1499
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,580
You can drink a lot of wine and eat a lot of matzos.

1500
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,900
But you can't live on the body of Christ alone.

1501
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:30,900


1502
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:30,900


1503
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,140
When you distill his blood it becomes Holy Spirit.

1504
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,220
That's where the Holy Spirit came from.

1505
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,800
You could live you probably could live on the flattened bread that they use to simulate

1506
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:47,020
the body of Christ as well as the wine or grape juice they use to simulate the blood.

1507
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,080
You think you could live on that?

1508
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,080
I think you could live quite some time on just those two things.

1509
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,020
Post and booze?

1510
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,300
Hell.

1511
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,080
Yeah you could live for a while.

1512
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,740
How long did you drink the booze?

1513
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,780
Of course it'll be yeah you might have to make sure that you're using grape juice

1514
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,780
instead of wine because you could probably get severely dehydrated drinking nothing but

1515
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,080
wine after a few days.

1516
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,280
Well there's those old expressions don't forget booze and bread goes straight to your head

1517
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,620
but bread and booze you got nothing to lose.

1518
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,720
Well there's a Christian statement brother if I never heard one.

1519
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:17,900
Yeah.

1520
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,020
Now I feel like falling down to my knees and retching violently.

1521
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,060
You know what I'll have a bottle in front of me and a frontal lobotomy.

1522
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,120
Why be forced to choose?

1523
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,500
You already had both.

1524
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,080
That's what I always say.

1525
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,660
Why does it have to be both?

1526
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,280
You have a bag of bees and a big old pound of...

1527
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,040
Transorbital.

1528
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,620
Oh never mind.

1529
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,500
Transorbital lobotomy.

1530
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,220
It's the Levern Stang.

1531
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,440
Is that a tape Michael?

1532
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,140
Oh my god.

1533
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,140
I'm not a tape.

1534
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,460
I'm not a tape this time.

1535
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,140
I'm alive.

1536
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,720
But Michael Pepe is a tape.

1537
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,160
Well I've been a tape for many years.

1538
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,240
I died as you know in 1997.

1539
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,820
Yeah I've got that tape.

1540
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,580
I've just...

1541
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,220
People...

1542
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,500
People working for me you know just make sure...

1543
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,160
They keep you alive into the future.

1544
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,800
I make pronouncements on various occasions and send out to you.

1545
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,440
You can afford to be secretive about it.

1546
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,860
Well you're doing a great imitation of yourself.

1547
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,120
And I always have said all mail addressed to me will be answered by me.

1548
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,940
You sound more like yourself now than you've ever sounded before.

1549
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:27,320
Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Michael Pepe, Department of Hidden Records,

1550
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,260
or seek out Oregon.

1551
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,400
I was actually Princess Wee for a while.

1552
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,040
You were?

1553
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,220
I changed back.

1554
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,280
Yeah I had a sex change.

1555
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,240
A little bit of Madam Psychosis.

1556
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,260
After you're tired of Reverend Stang's antics?

1557
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,860
I'm speechless.

1558
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,360
Yeah I really don't know how she puts up with him really.

1559
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,380
Madam Psychosis.

1560
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,280
Is that what you call her?

1561
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,080
Madam Psychosis.

1562
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,140
Yes they call her that.

1563
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,220
Well where is she by golly?

1564
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:56,800
Psychosis.

1565
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,300
Well she has a...

1566
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1567
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1568
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1569
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1570
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1571
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1572
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1573
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1574
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1575
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1576
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,300


1577
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,100
She had to withdraw owing to another engagement.

1578
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,680
She's sleeping out in a car on the street somewhere.

1579
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,280
She's freezing out in the car in her negligee on the street.

1580
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,620
She's in her negligee in the car on some street.

1581
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,280
That's my favorite singer, Dewey Cox.

1582
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,120
That's right.

1583
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,100
It's the end of the show.

1584
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:19,980
Coming up here at 10.

1585
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:20,440
There it is.

1586
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,060
That's the end of the show.

1587
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,600
Show after show after show after show.

1588
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,880
Everything's going to be with us next week.

1589
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,620
Are you going to call the next show?

1590
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:25,940
Maybe.

1591
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,640
Maybe after that.

1592
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,100
We'll see.

1593
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,360
How about you Mike?

1594
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,640
The neck and neck show.

1595
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,280
What I want to know...

1596
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,700
It's getting ready for X Day time.

1597
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,960
Well what about next week neither I nor thou shall be here.

1598
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,200
You should come over and visit sometime.

1599
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,880
I'm always here.

1600
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,120
It's my job.

1601
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:48,740
So you go down special other time super fast not regular slow crawl.

1602
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,800
Yes I have to move super fast.

1603
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,640
I'll be with Dr. Howell next week.

1604
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,140
Well that's a relief.

1605
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,240
I've studied Dr. Howell's techniques.

1606
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,880
You're in good hands.

1607
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,280
Oh.

1608
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,880
And you can be Michael Pepe.

1609
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,040
How about that ladies and gentlemen.

1610
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,400
I'm going to be puzzling.

1611
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,660
What about Sir Bishop Jones?

1612
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,300
Say ye to my soul.

1613
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,200
He's also on the bus with Reverend Howell.

1614
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,640
Dr. Howell.

1615
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,380
I'll bet you one puzzling evidence and I'll raise you a Bishop Joey.

1616
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,480
For lo the wicked bendeth their bow.

1617
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,500
Such is a good bus ride.

1618
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,920
They maketh ready their arrow upon the string.

1619
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,240
But they have to leave right about show time.

1620
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,640
They may shoot at will be.

1621
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,280
You guys won't be here.

1622
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1623
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1624
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1625
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1626
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1627
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1628
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1629
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1630
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,040
You may be able to hear the show.

1631
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:28,560
Upright.

1632
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,600
And call the show on the bus.

1633
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:29,720
In high.

1634
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,340
Because of the time delay.

1635
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,680
If the foundation is of the Lord.

1636
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,880
You're either on the bus or you're on the show.

1637
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,300
What can the righteous do?

1638
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,000
Those are the choices.

1639
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,860
What can they do?

1640
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,060
The Lord is in his holy temple.

1641
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,520
Don't walk so low.

1642
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,760
I'll tell you what they can do.

1643
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,220
They can join Dr. Drummond and his patented 13th of July.

1644
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:44,780
His eyes behold the night.

1645
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,040
His eyes will try the children of men.

1646
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,220
Because it's time for the show to go.

1647
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,520
Life's a race.

1648
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,560
Well here comes the bus.

1649
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,880
The show shall inherit the earth.

1650
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,380
And I'll walk as damn hard as I please.

1651
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,820
How do I walk boys?

1652
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,100
I'm a man.

1653
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:58,700
And I'm a man.

1654
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,540
When I meet my maker on my dying day.

1655
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,100
I'm afraid I'll have nothing to say.

1656
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,240
But praise Bob.

1657
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,780
And did I mention subgenius.com?

1658
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,060
Well that's where you'll find the real Bob.

1659
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,140
And links to all the shows and all the books and all the subgenius Facebook pages.

1660
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,060
You can also Google subgenius and see what happens.

1661
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,200
Thanks to all the contributors.

1662
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,600
And now.

1663
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,480
This.

1664
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,640
Sire, there is no more money.

1665
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,100
We gotta get some money.

1666
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,700
That dirty Turkish harker back flat.

1667
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,260
We wantin' Philip Buckaburton.

1668
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,560
Perkaluma Burton.

1669
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,620
Dirtin' first tonight.

1670
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,860
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1671
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,640
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going

1672
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,160
for another couple of months.

1673
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,860
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archives.

1674
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:05,180
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1675
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:11,740
go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1676
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:15,120
and help out financially as best you can.

1677
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:21,480
Now we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1678
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,140
to make their own situations worse.

1679
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,100
But some of you still have jobs.

1680
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:26,840
And we're glad you're here.

1681
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:26,840


1682
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:26,840


1683
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:32,980
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1684
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,340
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1685
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,500
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay

1686
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,160
Dobbs.

1687
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:49,640
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1688
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,360
P.O.

1689
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:51,840
Box 181417.

1690
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:52,840


1691
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,580
1-8-1-4-1-7.

1692
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:56,820
Cleveley, Texas.

1693
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:56,820


1694
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,400
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1695
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,080
44118.

1696
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,820
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
