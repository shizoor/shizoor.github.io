1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
It's been...

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,060
Oh, no.

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,920
Return to the swelling days of the Old West this weekend

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,180
with Mr. Rory's Hell is on a Big Diner Drive

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,680
as they celebrate their 100th anniversary!

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,840
Yes, 100 days in the business means a lot to the men and women of Mr. Rory's

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,880
and this weekend means a lot to you, too.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,560
It means Old West prices, like a Big Rory for $1.79

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,840
or a Killer Rat Burger for $1.78.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,180
It means Old West decor from the cattle skulls on the floor

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,320
to the bullet holes in the drive-up speaker box.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,460
And it feeds Old West excitement, too,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,220
like the thrill of a bloody shootout as man matches wits with hyena

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,700
or the spectacle of a herd of stampeding hyenas.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,740
But best of all, there's all that good Mr. Rory's food.

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,100
Whether your favorite is hyena tongue or tail,

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,740
you'll enjoy it even more at a Mr. Rory's Era

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,280
as all the big hyenas drive-thru.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,480
See your phone book for the one nearest you.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,540
Some people need to be mashed under a large rock, man.

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,020
You're probably one of them.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,100
Well, you're listening to the arm-twisting adventures

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,100
of your personal friend Huey on the bastard son of Food Bites of the Gods.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,800
You're listening to KPFT in Houston, 90.1 FM.

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,120
The radio station that transmits my sick mind

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,600
through electrical waves into a box in your personal...

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,480
From the largest stock in Texas...

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,940
Hey, NON, 90.9, and you did have a sexist...

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,160
...and could express every emotion with it.

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,940
Love.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,580
Hate.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,060
Anger.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,300
Chagrin.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
Even contempt.

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,520
Let the beat it, King.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,300
The Beat It King.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,920
The Beat It King.

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,600
This was only fantasy.

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,840
I don't see that as being something you can look at as being tangible right now.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't...

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,740
Well, I've lost my equilibrium, my car keys, and my pride.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,460
By this time, your fingers should be moving more quickly to the desired keys.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,360
Also in...

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,520
What can I say?

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,720
What can a person like myself say to a vegetable?

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,380
The answer is simple.

47
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,680
My friends, just call...

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
...and I'll...

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Jesus!

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,260
Oh, the intergalactic laxative will get you from here to there.

51
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,980
Relieve you and believe me without a worry or care.

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,900
This is Lou Grubb for Lou Grubb Chevrolet.

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,220
Listen, we've got some fine resale cars here at 27th Avenue in Camelback.

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,200
And what's more, if you'll stop out at 27th Avenue in Camelback,

55
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,840
you'll see us.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
You can ask me for...

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,800
Ah, yes, dear friends.

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,780
This is your host, Lou Grubb.

59
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,260
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

60
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,880
on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,940
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm amazed that upper tape deck works despite...

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,180
See, when George got off his show, he said,

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,260
I had an upper tape deck.

65
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,800
I had a...

66
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,220
Stay away from that thing.

67
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,640
It's warbling again.

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,220
And see, friends, there's nothing wrong with that upper tape deck at all.

69
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,980
It's playing that Walter Carlos stuff just fine in the background.

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,220
Oh, and maybe next time, I hope that next week that it's...

71
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,180
We know for sure it's going to work.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,020
I wonder if there's any way...

73
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,860
I bet I could distort this just by flipping this little switch.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,880
Yeah, there we go.

75
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,020
There we go.

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,360
Well, friends, you'll see next week,

77
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,980
I'm going to be out of town,

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,920
and Willa Dobbs is going to take over the show for one week.

79
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,240
It'll be his first time on this ugly, ugly board,

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
this mixing board here.

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,500
But, yeah, I've got to go on a special mission for Bob, so to speak.

82
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,140
But that doesn't mean that you bobbies can be breaking into my house

83
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,700
and stealing Bob's skull.

84
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,780


85
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,780


86
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,780


87
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,120
Or rather, the 1984 Bob's skull.

88
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,900
I'm sure he's got a new one by now.

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,680
Because the house, that's a subgenius castle,

90
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,180
will be guarded by both the Beast...

91
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,920
That's actually my Doberman Pinscher's name, Beast.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,480
Both Beast and the Willa Dobbs will be in there.

93
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Never mind the Beast, dear friends,

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,860
but beware the Willa Dobbs.

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,580
Because he...

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Oh, Willa Dobbs, he looks...

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,000
You know, you hear him in the background a lot,

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,440
and hopefully in the foreground this next time.

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,200
And you can't tell much from a voice, I guess.

100
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,340
But he basically looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger,

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,520
only with glasses.

102
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,640
Sort of like me.

103
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,980
Those of you who know me would pretty much know what I'm saying.

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,500
So you just better beware, dear friends.

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,520
Well...

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:39,080
Uh, you can call the Willa Dobbs tonight at 828-9500 or 823-7490.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,240
And meanwhile, we will continue with the horror.

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,160
Somehow, actually, I need to shut off that music

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,540
and get something a little bit more fitting in here.

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Do you know what I mean?

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,300
I don't know.

112
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,620
I don't know.

113
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,340
I don't know.

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,440
I don't know.

115
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,820
I don't know.

116
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,720
I don't know.

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,740
I don't know.

118
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
I don't know.

119
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,200
I don't know.

120
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
I don't know.

121
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,960
The sad, weakly self-denial preached by the New Age movement

122
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,920
is pure conspiracy pabulum.

123
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,520
The true son or daughter of Bob knows that our universe

124
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,160
is no laid-back, home-chanting cosmos

125
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,740
but an active, tumultuous, squirting universe

126
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,220
bent on rampant reproduction and easy grins.

127
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,720
The false cults may try to teach personal transformation

128
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,020
Psychic development, human potential.

129
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,480
But Bob goes straight for the glands and seeks to amplify the self,

130
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,360
to bloat the abnormality potential of his pupils.

131
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,480
Only through excess can one contact the lower self,

132
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,680
where the real decisions are made.

133
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,100
Don't just eat a hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

134
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,660
The advanced initiate, once freed from conspiracy programming

135
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,840
as well as the worldly goods that had enslaved him,

136
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,140
makes his pilgrimage to Dobbs Town,

137
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,520
the church's fabulous walled encampment deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

138
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,280
There, the initiate's third nostril is surgically opened by psychic surgeons,

139
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,080
allowing him or her to whiff-read the psychic stench of those around him.

140
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
He may even be able to see the world through the eyes of the blind.

141
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,280
He masters the mystic sciences of schizophreniatrics and memory editing,

142
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,100
creating a clean slate on which Bob may write.

143
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,440
The art of excremeditation is taught,

144
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,640
whereby the mind is voided upon the great throne of relief.

145
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,680
What is it that truly sets Bob apart from other would-be holy men and self-appointed gurus?

146
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,040
Everything.

147
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,360
For Bob

148
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,500
has always existed.

149
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,400
There have always been Bobs.

150
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,080
Every epoch of man's history has had its Bob.

151
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,320
Most were what we would call good Bobs.

152
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,560
Others?

153
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,660
Well, we didn't dwell on that.

154
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,400
Boy, no kidding.

155
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,740
We needn't dwell on those other Bobs, dear friends.

156
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,060
We'll have to talk about the other Bobs tonight.

157
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,400
In fact, actually, I guess, Dr. Dili Lama, who is here tonight,

158
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,700
I think could also help us talk about the other Bobs, the Bobs who are coming.

159
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,880
Once again, we're going to talk about Robert Anton Wilson coming into town.

160
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,720
Where and when is that, my dear friend?

161
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,020
That will be Friday, August 7th,

162
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,500
at 8 p.m. at the Scottish Rite Hospital Auditorium.

163
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,560
You know, that's down there off Oaklawn and Maple.

164
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,340
Oh, friends, you want to make, you want to go see Robert Anton Wilson

165
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,460
bespeak the hideous truths that you want to hear so bad,

166
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,280
and the ones that you don't want to hear, too,

167
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,860
and the ones that you can't possibly truly hear.

168
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,300
Your ears will hear, but only the truly attuned will listen.

169
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,040
Truly listen.

170
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,040
Are you aware?

171
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,820
So do whip on down there.

172
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,360
That mighty writer, that's what he is, by the way, for those of you who didn't know,

173
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,180
Robert Anton Wilson is a writer, but he's a writer whose pride opened the shell

174
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,120
surrounding the secrets of life and death and made them funny.

175
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,400
And also quite educational.

176
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,160
An agent of slack.

177
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,740
True slack.

178
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,720
An agent of true slack.

179
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,400
Slack.

180
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,080
What is it?

181
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,620
Where is it?

182
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,220
We're going to try to figure that out now.

183
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,540
Oh, by the way, I should mention, earlier tonight, what you heard,

184
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,620
the second version of the It's Not Just The...rant

185
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,900
from the great G. Gordon Gordon.

186
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,320
The Mercenary of Bob.

187
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,940
He shipped that up from Brazil, from the town of Ararauama, where he lives,

188
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,880
and where I hope to go for fun next Easter.

189
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,180
And then again, when they give us $40 million to do the subgenius movie.

190
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
We'll all go down there to write the screenplay.

191
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,640
Of course, we'll party for six weeks and then write the screenplay on the last day,

192
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,300
but that's what you want, friends.

193
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,480
That's the only true way to do it.

194
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:23,100
This coming up here is called The Blast Supper by Reverend G. Don Truby.

195
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,280
Put your headphones on for this, dear friends.

196
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,320
Daily Llama just did, and he knows, because he's been around.

197
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,680
Hail Eris.

198
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,220
Hail Eris.

199
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,060
Hail Eris.

200
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,260


201
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,360
Hail Eris.

202
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,660
Hail Eris.

203
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:43,780
Hail Eris.

204
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,400
Hail Eris.

205
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,460
Hail Eris.

206
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:44,460


207
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,740
Happy New Years.

208
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:05,160
Journey public.

209
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,060
Has this slash?

210
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,060


211
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,060


212
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,580
This is the retВ requires this.

213
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:06,600
.

214
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:14,320
Okay, I'm going to try YoU V multicolORinEvA fleasS.

215
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
.

216
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
As you're out to lunch.

217
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,740
I'll take care of this.

218
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,200
I brought my plastic.

219
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,640
Simon Peter recited to me as I flopped out my wallet.

220
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,940
His bulging, belching, bronze-tan voice carried through the cafe.

221
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,020
Intentionally.

222
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,060
Trying to impress the boss, eh, Pete?

223
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,480
Paul retorted.

224
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,780
His bracketed, enclosed, bombshell voice.

225
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,260
Blast!

226
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
Booming across the never-waxed floor tiles.

227
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,980
Boys!

228
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,620
Boys!

229
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,140
Boys!

230
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,960
Jesus cleared his trout accordionly.

231
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,620
Aye, but I like it drawn.

232
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,140
Maggie moaned to a greasy pair of glasses.

233
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,320
Jesus donned the spectacle and declaimed the onside click.

234
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,660
When in Rome, do the Romans.

235
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,420
Jesus jousted.

236
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,500
Indeed, the Roman enumerators bug us, man.

237
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,880
John announced from under the table.

238
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,580
John found his fork and thrust his precepts in a must.

239
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,260
Unkeenly manner upon his stablemates.

240
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,580
They count on us for an explanation.

241
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,480
John jumped.

242
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,880
But Judas couldn't explain his order.

243
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,700
And the waitress confused did utter.

244
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,920
Look, mister, you must tell me what you want, or I'll be forced to use my influence.

245
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,940
I can't read your mind.

246
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,840
Then Judas spent his second folding in and had a strange vision.

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,440
He was holding the bearded lord in his wrist.

248
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,560
In his wrist.

249
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,380
Radostyle.

250
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,040
Rockin' to a crazy beat.

251
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,820
Faster and faster.

252
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,560
Then slower.

253
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
He heard Cab Calloway singing.

254
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
Minnie the Moocher.

255
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,420
He smelled the hearty wrath of twice-burned toast.

256
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,360
And trembling egghead Ernestine.

257
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,460
He touched and tasted a thousand things.

258
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,320
And was unsure, and modestly bounced into the street.

259
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,040
To find wherefore and what not on the bench.

260
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,380
That's pronounced guilty.

261
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,920
The others tittered into a street.

262
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,360
But Jesus savored not the heart.

263
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,500
Safford not.

264
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,720
In the pent.

265
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,440
Of his ugly mug.

266
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,880
The sky rained a million volts.

267
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,340
Of lightning bolts and.

268
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,120
And forty buckets.

269
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,240
Of blood and beer.

270
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,680
And finally Maggie skittered over to our booth.

271
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,280
Heaving and hoeing.

272
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,980
And the streaming, steaming heap of feast.

273
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,360
She glared straight into the very soul.

274
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,240
Of our savior.

275
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,280
Questing.

276
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,180
You order this weather.

277
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,600
Red beans and rhymes in yesterday's brains.

278
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,080
Read the two-inch video monitor implanted firmly.

279
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,080
In the forehead.

280
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
Of our one-eyed waitress.

281
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,360
Maggie Magdalene.

282
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,880
Delittlewits.

283
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,080
Simon Peter.

284
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,440
Cupped his face.

285
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,280
To the side of my mouth.

286
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,340
And whipped.

287
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,320
I told you we should have taken him to the awful house.

288
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,020
Their food is fresher and cheaper too.

289
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,180
But let him look at his men.

290
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:08,880
You.

291
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,300
You.

292
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,520
You.

293
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,120
You.

294
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,780
Customer implicated by circumstance.

295
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,140
You fresh-faced side of bacon.

296
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,280
Too many rowers scraped the bow.

297
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,140
I could see, feel, and touch.

298
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,380
His healing glaze.

299
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,580
As it shot clean through the tabular sails.

300
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,920
In Maggie's hot sliding side slots.

301
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,880
Thomas touched it too.

302
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,020
And eagerly agreed.

303
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,940
Yes.

304
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,840
Yes.

305
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,780
They damn well.

306
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,360
Should have eaten elsewhere.

307
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,600
But.

308
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,460
Hell.

309
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,280
Here was where I was supposed to be.

310
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


311
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


312
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


313
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


314
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


315
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


316
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


317
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


318
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


319
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


320
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,280


321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,580
It was water.

322
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,260
Silver.

323
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,640
Leave now?

324
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,700
Why they looked like asses.

325
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,120
They'd break my glasses too.

326
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,100
Maggie recited to no man.

327
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,940
So with their heads.

328
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,240
On their knees.

329
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,400
They broke brains.

330
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,600
In the house.

331
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,540
Of the rising one.

332
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,920
It was over easy.

333
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,340
All around.

334
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
Black coffins.

335
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,100
Olive eyeballs.

336
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:00,860
A rim.

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,420
An English translation.

338
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,480
Please.

339
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,440
Mouths watered.

340
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,020
At once.

341
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,780
And as one.

342
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,980
But before feasting.

343
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,540
As always.

344
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,260
She's a swindler.

345
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,260


346
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,260


347
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,260


348
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,260


349
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,420
The boys rose.

350
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
He ass ended.

351
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,140
And performed a.

352
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,700
A mackerel.

353
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,520
Luke faked.

354
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,600
A knowing smile.

355
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,260
Of adoration.

356
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,260
As he had been hoping for his favorite.

357
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,900
The Messiah's interpretation.

358
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,780
Of Chinook salmon.

359
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,200
Fresh water.

360
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,060
The boys ate.

361
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,180
Feverously.

362
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,140
Judas.

363
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,740
The joker.

364
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,680
Choked on thirty slivers.

365
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,340
As usual.

366
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,360
He got a big pat on the backside.

367
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,280
For his deep trouble.

368
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,400
The lettuce braid.

369
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,700
And everybody.

370
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,000
Said it was gracious.

371
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,240
And the boys.

372
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


373
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


374
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


375
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


376
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


377
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


378
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,240


379
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,640
Fought.

380
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,300
For extolling the stone.

381
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
In front of the shameless.

382
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,400
Steel.

383
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,220
Vault.

384
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,680
The dirty dozen.

385
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,540
Ordered donuts.

386
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,260
In haste.

387
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,900
They ordered bagels.

388
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,320
Dry.

389
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,100
Then they ordered many hundreds.

390
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,100
Of hot dogs.

391
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,720
Then they ordered the tube steaks.

392
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,300
To jump.

393
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,200
Through.

394
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,700
The pastry hoops.

395
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,200
Sit up.

396
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,700
Big.

397
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,080
Roll.

398
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,780
Over.

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,500
And pop.

400
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,520
Onto their.

401
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,160
Twelve.

402
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,400
Twirling.

403
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,120
Tongues.

404
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,640
Imagine.

405
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,400
Their surprise.

406
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,180
When the dogs disobeyed.

407
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,200
And spelled out.

408
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,100
On Peter's placement.

409
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,400
The word.

410
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,280
Niall.

411
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,280
Yes.

412
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,460
The instantaneous.

413
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,580
Slashing.

414
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,400
Of teeth.

415
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,440
Sounded.

416
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,540
Like a lion cubs demolition derby of the salt.

417
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,320
A smoky robin's nest.

418
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,480
Arose from the brown.

419
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,100
James.

420
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,140
And haloed them all.

421
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,560
With the foul paw.

422
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,940
That eventually settled.

423
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,360
And circled around.

424
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,140
Judy's bolting purse.

425
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,520
You foot the bell.

426
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,480
They all bawled at the Jude.

427
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,120
Who had began to get under their.

428
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,240
Pants.

429
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


430
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


431
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


432
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


433
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


434
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


435
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


436
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


437
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,240


438
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,060
To make it better.

439
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,100
They all.

440
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,160
Fall down drunk.

441
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
And asleep.

442
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,440
And Jesus.

443
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,460
Was white.

444
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,840
As a sheep.

445
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,880
Knuckled under.

446
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,660
And blazed.

447
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,540
I'll never eat out.

448
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,140
Again.

449
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,860
And then he ate his words.

450
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,700
In remembrance.

451
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,280
Of red.

452
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,220
Bees.

453
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,080
And.

454
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,100
Rhymes.

455
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,460
Hi.

456
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,060
I'm Reverend Buck Naked.

457
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,720
Pastor of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

458
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Inviting you.

459
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,220
To a Bob Righteous.

460
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,400
Full squirt.

461
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,480
Devourable.

462
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
August 8th.

463
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,540
Saturday night.

464
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,360
At 8 o'clock.

465
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,200
At the Bar of Soul.

466
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,340
See and hear.

467
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,580
Many other wild schismatic preachers.

468
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,880
Uber Pope Strix dominatrix.

469
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,660
Cecilia Smith.

470
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,380
Bob Righteous Reverend.

471
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,180
Buddy West.

472
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Hill Swammy.

473
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,560
Satellite Weavers.

474
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,460
Dr. Chaos of the Chaotic Church of New Deep.

475
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,120
Deacon Tom Williams.

476
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,220
Not a Bob Righteous.

477
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


478
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


479
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


480
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


481
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


482
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


483
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,220


484
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,160
Bobby and the Bunch friends.

485
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,760
All the above administered repeatedly on the Hour of Slack radio show.

486
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,720
Plus.

487
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,440
Arch Doctor St. Margaret Moser.

488
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,320
High Priestess of the Cult of Chilkat from Austin, Texas.

489
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,280
And.

490
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs will be there.

491
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,640
Yes.

492
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,800
He's alive friends.

493
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,520
The San Francisco Cool Guy Bob may be dead.

494
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,340
But my Bob isn't dead.

495
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,480
Is yours?

496
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,100
Unfortunately.

497
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,400
Local broadcaster Ivan Stein is unable to attend.

498
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,200
But friends.

499
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,280
You can hear Stang on any radio.

500
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
Now these incredible ministers can spit fire.

501
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
Heal the sick.

502
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,340
And sicken the healthy.

503
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,440
Boom shakalemaka.

504
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,060
Way to this little snake here son.

505
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,640
August 8th.

506
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,160
8 o'clock.

507
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,900
Bar of Soap.

508
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
Across from the Fair Park Gate.

509
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,040
Praise Bob.

510
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,080
Free at last.

511
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm not a Bobby and the Bunch dear friends.

512
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,180
Actually despite all the nasty nasty things that I said about Bobby and the Bunch.

513
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,180


514
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,180


515
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:46,840
I wanted to give you a special complimentary gift.

516
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,880
At the dar Agora Y'all run through the west in this event of the day.

517
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


518
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


519
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


520
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


521
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


522
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


523
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


524
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


525
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


526
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:52,880


527
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,280
Yes out.

528
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,680
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,040
to give a seminar in the afternoon from 1 till about 6 o'clock at the same place, Scottish

530
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,580
Rite Hospital.

531
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,600
And then I'm pretty sure that old Robert's going to end up going to the DeVival to see

532
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,320
Buck naked and all the other local subgeni.

533
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,820
And did I understand that you won't be there?

534
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,680
Is that true?

535
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,560
Oh, I'm not allowed to be there.

536
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,160
This is an anti-Stang DeVival.

537
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,740
Honest to God, it is.

538
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,720
Buck and I are friends on a personal basis, but on a professional basis, we are bitter,

539
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,600
bitter enemies.

540
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:45,880
And I refuse to appear on a stage with anybody who takes subgenius so, I mean, so unseriously.

541
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,760
You know, I mean, this is a religion.

542
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,040
And apparently, some of these other people seem to think of it as some sort of a comedy

543
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,480
thing.

544
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,060
I'm glad to see you sticking by your principles of schisms in the church.

545
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,400
Yeah, of course.

546
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,720
I mean, and I can no more tell Buck not to do that.

547
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,160
If he's not going to do a DeVival, then I could tell, oh, say, the New York Bobbies

548
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,740
or the Philadelphia Bobbies not to do a DeVival.

549
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,420
I'm not Bob.

550
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,780
And neither are you.

551
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,280
Not really.

552
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,060
Not really.

553
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,180
And I don't want to be.

554
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,020
Don't get me wrong.

555
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,900
I wouldn't want to be Bob.

556
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,780
However, over the swinging love corpses, I should start talking about my DeVivals, friends.

557
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,400
These are the ones that Buck doesn't even know about yet.

558
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,660
And we've been working towards that with a kind help of David Hines.

559
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:38,060
St. David Hines, we should say, down at the Stark Club, of all places, has been donating

560
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,780
us video editing time.

561
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,500
And the mighty Reverend Court Holland, SLK, and I have been down there.

562
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,620
Well, last night, in fact, until four in the morning, we were down there editing the subgenius

563
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,200
video, Finishing Touches.

564
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,940
And that video will be world premiered at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts sometime in

565
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,300
October.

566
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,720
And you'll hear about it because it's going to be one of their main shows.

567
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,300
It's going to be the main featured thing.

568
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,360
It'll be the main Saturday night thing in their big video festival that Bart Weiss is

569
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,800
setting up.

570
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,940
So you'll finally see the world premiere of the much promised.

571
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,660
I mean, this is what's been taking, been holding up the Stark fist is this mighty videotape.

572
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,080
You wouldn't believe the stuff.

573
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,580
We got hold of some footage last night, friends, of J.R. Bob Dobbs as a six-year-old millionaire.

574
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,180
And when you see it, you will fall down on your knees.

575
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:36,420
You will be knuckle walking to Jerusalem when you see this incredible video presentation,

576
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,840
as well as, of course, the devivals that go with it.

577
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,700
And this will also be world premiered at the Stark Club at some point or another.

578
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,400
We're not sure.

579
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,060
Probably also in October.

580
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,300
I mean, that means we have to finish this thing by then, you see, friends.

581
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,440
We're putting a deadline on ourselves.

582
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,700
So I know that I can't compete with Buck naked at the...

583
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,000
What's the name of that?

584
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,980
That little tiny hole in the wall club?

585
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,080
The bar of soap.

586
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,580
Yeah, with the...

587
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,220
I mean, I know I'm selling out.

588
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,280
Jeez, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts.

589
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,260
Here we are telling everybody it's a religious...

590
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,420
That's the Museum of Art.

591
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,740
They put it in the...

592
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,840
That's right.

593
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,100
The Dallas Art Museum, whatever the hell it's called.

594
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,120
They put it...

595
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,680
They're going to put it on and call it art.

596
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:27,600
But, you know, I guess, you know, the Sistine Chapel was the subgenius video of its day.

597
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,660
You know?

598
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,120
Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo.

599
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,120
Well, that was the equivalent in those days.

600
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,860
And so now we have to...

601
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:42,480
You know, we can't show you the videotape on television because it's too nasty and bobful.

602
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,240
Listen, you can hear him in the background squirting.

603
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,580
Squirting endlessly in his endless dream.

604
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,420
He lives on in every one of those sandworms.

605
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,880
Bob is coming, friends.

606
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,440
And...

607
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
But, yeah, I really...

608
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,680
You should go to Buck's revival.

609
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,420
You should go to Robert Anton Wilson's revival...

610
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,560
The thing.

611
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,480
Buck does devivals.

612
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,900
I don't prefer to use the term revival for what I do because I like to think that it revives people.

613
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,600
I think Buck's definition is exactly accurate.

614
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,360
Absolutely accurate description of what he does.

615
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,600
And, friends, I do think you ought to...

616
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,100
You ought to...

617
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,860
Go ahead.

618
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,740
I mean, it's cheap.

619
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,980
And also, there are...

620
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,460
I mean, I believe Reverend Chastity Belt is going to be there.

621
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,780
And, of course, the Hell Swami.

622
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,960
And Pope S. Cecilia.

623
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,400
You know?

624
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,520
So there's people with whom I'm not having a terrible on-the-air feud right this minute.

625
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,980
So...

626
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,020
Gosh.

627
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,200
I get so carried away sometimes.

628
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,520
Just, you know, having this soapbox.

629
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,080
Imagine the temptations, friends, to say tasteless things.

630
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,280
It's...

631
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,000
About a rotten day.

632
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,240
But that's what I say.

633
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,280
Because that's what the word of Bob says.

634
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,900
I tell you, friend, there's no slack.

635
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,700
There's no slack.

636
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,420
There's no slack.

637
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,360
I tell you, in this world, in this flesh, in this devil, there's no slack.

638
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,220
And if you can't whoop it, go you down, my friend.

639
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,020
That's what I said.

640
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,260
Go ye down.

641
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,940
There's nothing that says you can't.

642
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,500
The devil don't have a rule book.

643
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,180
That's right.

644
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,940
The devil.

645
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,260
The devil does not have a rule book.

646
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,480
He is not humanistic.

647
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
He is not pacifistic.

648
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,320
And he owes you money, my friend.

649
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,700
That's right.

650
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,900
The devil owes you money.

651
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,040
And so does Uncle Sam.

652
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,400
You have to recognize the devil just like you recognize Uncle Sam.

653
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,100
Now, I'm going down there to pay taxes.

654
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,380
As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.

655
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,400
I'm sorry, but that's just the way things are.

656
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,080
It's a test of faith.

657
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,960
And that's why God put the devil down.

658
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,700
Here, to see if you can tell the difference between the devil and Uncle Sam.

659
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,260
Let there be slack.

660
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,760
And I want to know if you can tell the difference between the devil and John Birkeland.

661
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,360
The devil and Shelly Beeman.

662
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,800
The devil and Dennis Bennett.

663
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,060
Because these people are just the first three on the list of pledgers to the hour of slack

664
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,680
who have not paid their dues, dear friends.

665
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,060
To the word of God.

666
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,740
To the word of God.

667
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,100
There's two stangs.

668
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,780
God Almighty.

669
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,000
There's not enough room in this world for...

670
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,700
Friends, I want you to pay up those pledges that you made to the hour of slack.

671
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,800
Because the station really needs money right now.

672
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
And not only that, I need the status.

673
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:54,600
George's show, which precedes this show, has gotten twice as much money in as the hour of slack.

674
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,200
Now, how do you...

675
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,500
How do you think that makes us look?

676
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,000
Of course, they're on twice as long every Sunday night.

677
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,420
But that doesn't matter.

678
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,400
I want to see every cent.

679
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,740
Every red cent.

680
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,880
And I don't want to have to have, you know, the bad Bob show up at your door, friends.

681
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,880
Caprice.

682
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,420
Now, Caprice, I know you can spare that $5.

683
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,280
And Edgar Cayce out there in the before life.

684
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,660
I mean, he's a saint.

685
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,580
He's healed many thousands of people.

686
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,020
He's healed people magically.

687
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,080
But he hasn't paid that $10.

688
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,540
And in Bob's eyes, he's doomed to hell.

689
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,380
Mother Teresa here, she could only spare $25,000.

690
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,000
And we haven't seen a penny of it.

691
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,660
Now, Mother Teresa, doomed.

692
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,120
Doomed to an eternity in hell itself.

693
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,840
Because she hadn't paid up to this show, despite all the other good things she may have done.

694
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,700
And, I mean, I'm seeing some names on it.

695
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,200
These are supposed to be friends of the church enemies.

696
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,520
And I just...

697
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,980
I mean, I ain't...

698
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,160
I don't want to turn into that old drunk preacher again.

699
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,460
You know, I know y'all don't like that.

700
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,940
But before we get further into the tapes, I want to point out, I got this...

701
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,860
The last time I was at Glen Rose...

702
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,740
We have a creation science museum in Glen Rose, just like the Christians do.

703
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,200
But we never get any PR.

704
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,400
Just like the Dallas Morning News did that big section of book reviews of Dallas authors.

705
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,440
Who've been reprinted and never mentioned.

706
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
The book of the subgenius.

707
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,320
My bile is starting to rise.

708
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,300
I want that money.

709
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,120
I want those recountings of bad drug trips from y'all.

710
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,000
So as to prevent...

711
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,360
I mean, you and you too.

712
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,280
I mean, I know you guys don't do drugs.

713
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,180
But I'm sure you've had bad alcohol trips.

714
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,620
I mean, there's...

715
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,360
We need...

716
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,600
Bad aspirin trips.

717
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,680
You know, anything.

718
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,500
We need your personal recountings.

719
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:53,940
Nobody...

720
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,720
We've gotten one.

721
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,520
How about that?

722
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:55,760
One.

723
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,240
And he wrote and said, oh gosh, I...

724
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,340
When you first mentioned it, I thought that you'd be so flooded with material that, yeah, I didn't need to bother.

725
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,900
Well, apparently everybody thought that too.

726
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,720
And we aren't flooded with material in Dallas.

727
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,560
We hardly ever get any mail from Dallas.

728
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,800
The subgenius contributions, the stuff that we play on the air, all comes in from outside of the state.

729
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,440
Because I guess since we're not local to them, we're worthy of consideration.

730
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,940
But I guess since we're just local, well, that's not good enough.

731
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,620
But in...

732
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,320
And in Glen Rose, we're local too.

733
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,400
But here the Somervell Sun, this is a mighty paper, friends.

734
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,420
It says that creation evidence has been confirmed.

735
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:48,980
And that Dr. Carl Bough on June 16, 1987, this creation evidence team discovered a...

736
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,180
Within a few feet of each other on the same level of the Paluxy River.

737
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,440
A human tooth, dear friends, who has been dubbed Glen Rose Man.

738
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Soon, I'm sure, to take his history next to Piltdown Man.

739
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,840
And his place next to who else was a great...

740
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,740
Well, Peking Man was for real, but they never did find the bones.

741
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,440
Yes, Glen Rose Man, or Little David as they've called him.

742
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,720
How religious.

743
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,660
This human tooth was found within a few feet of a trilobite.

744
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,780
Three dinosaur track.

745
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,560
And human footprints.

746
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,880
Plus possibly mammalian, large mammal bones.

747
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:34,080
And this is actual scientific evidence of creation, it says here.

748
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:44,400
And absolutely disproves the ten uncountable millions of examples of evolution evidence

749
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,160
that have been found all over the entire planet by actual paleontologists

750
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,160
as opposed to the spacecraft control system business.

751
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:59,380
And the designers and the dentist who analyzed this incredible discovery,

752
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,800
which they say this juvenile human tooth found next to the dinosaur track was blackened by the ages.

753
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,300
Which is unusual in the case of a fossil, because usually they're not blackened, but turned to stone itself.

754
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,120
But nevertheless, friends, it must be true, because it says it right here in the Glen Rose Weekly Newspaper.

755
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,160
And not only that, but they've provided a new spelling of the word archaeology.

756
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Even when what they really meant was paleontologist.

757
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,960
So you know they must be, you know, friends, it's gotta be true.

758
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Uh, you know, the Glen Rose paper said it, I believe it, that settles it.

759
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,260
Well, I've probably been depressing and nasty and mean enough for a while, I'm just gonna...

760
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,800
Friends, call 823-7490 if you want to know what's going on, or 828-9500.

761
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,620
Uh, did you have anything more to say, uh, mighty, uh, uh, Dealey Llama?

762
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah.

763
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,940
I've got a lot to say.

764
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,640
Alright.

765
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,960
First, I want to tell all you subgeniuses out there that hadn't paid your dues.

766
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,640
Praise Bob.

767
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,800
Kill them!

768
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,960
Reverend Stang was being real nice to you when he was talking to you a little while ago.

769
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,160
And you know what Bob does to people who don't follow through?

770
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,960
He'll cut you off.

771
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,200
He'll cut you plum off.

772
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,760
He'll cut you off in places you don't want to be cut off in.

773
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:23,880
That's right.

774
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,280
It's worse than having your head cut off.

775
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,820
It's worse than having your gonads cut off.

776
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,220
It's being cut off from Bob.

777
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,740
Cut off from Bob.

779
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,040
Thanks, Buck.

780
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,340
Now, oh, who is in the, in the great subgenius video?

781
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,540
Quite a bit, by the way.

782
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,920
Um, with...

783
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,840
What would we do without it?

784
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,240
That's, with his earlier, more explanatory materials.

785
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,540
I, I, I just can't get into this inside joke stuff.

786
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,320
That some of these people treat...

787
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,640
I mean, this is a, it's a church, friends.

788
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,300
It's a church.

789
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,100
Well, before we, uh, we got some new Janer hypercleets coming up.

790
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:01,980
Oh, no!

791
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,880
Yes, we do.

792
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,240
We do.

793
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,840
The prophet Janer speaketh again.

794
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,720
Uh, so, so, uh...

795
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,240
Strap yourselves down out there.

796
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:09,780
That's right.

797
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,400
Girls, hang on, cause that mighty tongue of Janer's gonna be a-lashing at ya.

798
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,560
In just a few seconds.

799
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,280
Let me try that again.

800
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,540
We have this great technique, dear friends.

801
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,000
Uh...

802
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

803
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,620
Praise the...

804
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,040
You are my shining star, guiding light, my love, my sea.

805
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,660
There's must of one that I feel, a deep end, just a swimming.

806
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,800
Never too much, never too much, never too much.

807
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm a shining star.

808
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm a shining star.

809
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:49,520


810
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,880
I just don't wanna slip away.

811
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,340
This is not the fire show, sorry.

812
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,380
That huge, launching collar now.

813
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,640
The collar is in orbit.

814
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,820
All those worshipers.

815
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,740
I don't know.

816
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,260
See?

817
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,160
Collar dead.

818
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,460
Sometimes I think this was all just meant to be.

819
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,740
Collar all scooped up now in that collar bag, and we'll be able to set him up for a text

820
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,900
just in the way.

821
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,140
Yes, I, um, I have a question.

822
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,900
Private Stang?

823
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,520
Okay, uh, go ahead.

824
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,020
Fire away.

825
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,500
Okay, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

826
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:19,700
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

827
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:19,700


828
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:26,280
I, as I was waking this morning, I was looking into my frog stash and my dog had smoke and

829
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,880
all my frogs.

830
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,660
Is that, um, ethical or...

831
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,380
Should I...

832
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,700
Refrain from that?

833
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,520
Cowboy down.

834
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,740
Oh!

835
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,360
Just send your dog out on the street to get a job.

836
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
That's what I do when my kids do the same thing.

837
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:39,720
Well, you got a job.

838
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,540
The, my, my kids

839
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,040
He's got a job.

840
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,720
He does my job.

841
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,380
Well, then...

842
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,460
Collar's fading away.

843
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,240
He's going around the other side of the planet.

844
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,160
I mean, there's a...

845
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,940
The blueness of a wound cleanses away the evil.

846
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,900
So, you know, forget this animal liberation.

847
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,440
Yell, Collin.

848
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,220
You're going through the atmosphere.

849
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,080
You know what to do.

850
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,660
You'll have to yell as loud as you can, Collin.

851
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,800
You'll be eating your dog in a few years.

852
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,040
Once the ocean rises, you'll be...

853
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,840
I'll be sucking your dog in a few minutes.

854
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,460
...place of work.

855
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,860
The cat.

856
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,560
Out here.

857
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,580
Well, are you going to talk or do I have to turn on the Delta Interocitor?

858
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,740
It's so pretty. It's so clean. It's so dull.

859
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,960
And those little sparkling lights, they...

860
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,920
They seem to walk over my mind and tell me...

861
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,500
Tell me over and over again.

862
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,980
Never again.

863
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,680
You know, you're going to have to go through the tortures of hell to know what that's...

864
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,820
To really be able to appreciate the slack.

865
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,480
That's the whole point.

866
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,980
But it's the slack you don't know that gets you.

867
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,400
They never talk about the pain that comes before and after the slack.

868
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,600
If you look at the chart, the way they draw those charts, and the way their seminars run,

869
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,160
it's just, whoa, it's just one big solid line of slack.

870
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,440
Oh, wow, look at your chart.

871
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,520
Just a plateau of slack.

872
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
They don't even get into the agony.

873
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,800
It says your navel is in Vulcan and your punto is in the doghouse.

874
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,700
Therefore, Spudge, don't go out of the house today.

875
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,080
Stay inside and put your photograph on them together.

876
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Today could be a day to eat vegetables.

877
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,760
Or it might be time to put off some of that obnoxious mail you've been dreading to write.

878
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,380
As for you moon children, what are you doing on this planet?

879
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,380
Nuff said.

880
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,980
Next week we'll have asteroidology for the midnight.

881
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,440
Oh, they're really out there.

882
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,600
Did healing crystals kill the dinosaurs?

883
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,120
Yes.

884
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,420
Yeah, that fixed them up real good, those little dinosaurs.

885
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,820
It shows without a shadow of a doubt that dinosaurs practice psychic surgery.

886
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,300
Whoosh.

887
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,660
Here a dinosaur removes large goblets of flesh from a dinosaur.

888
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,580
Without using his teeth.

889
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,800
That's right, dear friends.

890
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,460
The dinosaurs were killed by psychic surgery.

891
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,980
And, uh, oh, oh.

892
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:13,020
The, uh, Reverend Dili Lama, one time pope of all Houston, just said to me, uh, not to

893
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,280
let him get on and start in on those dinosaurs.

894
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,280


895
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,280


896
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:27,020
So we here at this station, well the 19th century Christian, well what's he doing here

897
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,160
at this show?

898
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,340
центering us on the

899
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,440
issue at 9 cam place early on in the amid

900
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,280
of Halloween?

901
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:43,640
Cause semana just.

902
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,260
Yeah.

903
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,120
sickening views on this subject.

904
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Gotta get a hold of myself sometimes.

905
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,300
When I think about what's going on,

906
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,620
you know they're gonna make a law.

907
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,540
They're gonna make a law that you can't think for yourself.

908
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,920
They're gonna make a law that you can't buy a record for yourself.

909
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,260
They're gonna make a law that Reverend Stang

910
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,800
and all the others like him can't write books for themselves.

911
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,280
And friends, this is serious.

912
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,900
It's funny, oh yeah, it's real funny,

913
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,520
and you're in your BMW now,

914
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,100
maybe you're going out to the Madonna concert,

915
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,620
and oh, maybe you're in your little Volkswagen

916
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,700
and driving up North Central Expressway,

917
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,960
or maybe you're over there in Fort Worth.

918
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,360
I don't know where you are right now,

919
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,660
but you know, you're gonna be walking one of these days,

920
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,140
and you're gonna,

921
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,440
sit back and you're gonna remember

922
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,860
all those chances you had to,

923
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,860
to do something with yourself,

924
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,720
to think for yourself,

925
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,400
to act for yourself.

926
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,440
And you're gonna remember Reverend Stang screaming at you

927
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,880
about Bob.

928
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,960
And it's all gonna be because of

929
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,900
what these creationists are trying to do to your mind,

930
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,120
trying to convince you

931
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,240
that the world was created,

932
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,880
that the world was created on October 23rd,

933
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,820
4004 B.C.

934
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,880
Well, it said so in the Bible.

935
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,580
It said so, so it must be true.

936
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,280
Because I know God wrote the Bible.

937
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,460
It must have been God that wrote it.

938
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,100
It couldn't have been a bunch of old wise men,

939
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,020
a bunch of smart alecks like ourselves.

940
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,560
There's 23 different people that wrote the Bible,

941
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,020
and that's a fact.

942
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,980
And Bob was one of them, by the way,

943
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,400
because he figured it was another way to make money.

944
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,460
You know, it's one of the largest selling books in the world.

945
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,400
He owns many of the franchises on the printing operations.

946
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,240
So it's just a money-making scam.

947
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,760
Friends.

948
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,840
You know,

949
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,640
people tend to take things for granted.

950
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,220
They really do.

951
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,800
They forget how resilient their minds are.

952
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,200
And unfortunately, dear friends,

953
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,300
that's one of those processes that snowballs,

954
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,320
and by which even the most privileged people,

955
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,500
despite getting every opportunity to become self-reliant,

956
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,700
and they nevertheless,

957
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,240
they can degenerate into big pink boy crows.

958
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,240


959
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,240


960
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,240


961
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,240


962
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,200
They're just crybabies.

963
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,060
If people are less alive these days than they used to be,

964
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,380
it's only because for them,

965
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,740
there's less to being alive.

966
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,220
The line between life and death

967
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,300
can become blurred and indistinct.

968
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,260
A truly dedicated worker

969
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,380
can keep making an income

970
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,820
or cooking dinner for the family

971
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,100
long after his or her mind is dead.

972
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,520
long after his or her mind is dead.

973
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,000
Any sensible belief

974
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,360
in life after death

975
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,260
should include the hideous plausibility

976
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,240
of becoming a slave

977
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,820
of a sick invisible ghost

978
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,060
that keeps shuffling back to the office

979
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,220
or the kitchen

980
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,460
or the church.

981
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,440
What else happens to quote dead unquote people

982
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,260
whose instincts

983
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,400
are so ruined

984
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,460
that they can no longer differentiate

985
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,540
between the so-called light

986
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,160
and the so-called darkness?

987
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,600
Huh?

988
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,360
It might not.

989
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,800
Just on a off chance,

990
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,060
might not that light thing,

991
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,320
that aliveness of yours,

992
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,980
get overdrawn just as easily

993
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,000
as its body's checking account?

994
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,720
After all,

995
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,920
for most of you,

996
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,780
the checking account

997
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,640
would have probably been your top priority in life.

998
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,900
It's all too easy

999
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,820
for us to desoul ourselves

1000
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,220
by overdoing

1001
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,700
just what we thought might save us.

1002
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,920
Work, drugs, religion,

1003
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,700
so forth.

1004
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,560
Yet we can continue to plan

1005
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,480
and calculate

1006
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,100
and those things don't take many brain cells.

1007
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,220
But we cease to feel,

1008
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,040
dear friends,

1009
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,440
and that does take some brain cells.

1010
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,860
In trying too hard for things

1011
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,200
that turn out to be unsatisfying,

1012
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,240
we wreck the very

1013
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,160
instincts we need

1014
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,720
for walking that thin,

1015
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,380
thin line between

1016
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,120
self-lobotomizing lethargy

1017
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,900
and neurotic

1018
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,540
burnout.

1019
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,360
Oh yes.

1020
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,840
So,

1021
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,440
get up off your butt! Get up!

1022
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:12,820
That's what we're saying!

1023
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,580
Get off your butt!

1024
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,900
Give yourself a good butt kick.

1025
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,360
By the way, what we're saying is

1026
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,320
this isn't necessarily the opinions of KNON

1027
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,420
or its management.

1028
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,980
These are strictly the opinions of the

1029
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,100
outspoken subgeniuses

1030
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,100
of the Church of the Subgenius

1031
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,880
schisms of various kinds

1032
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,820
of Dallas, Texas

1033
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,580
exercising our freedom that we have

1034
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,340
in this country and practically

1035
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,500
no other.

1036
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,140
We want to save your soul.

1037
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,180
We want this country to be more like Russia.

1038
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,600
Uh,

1039
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,820
like your reactionary

1040
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,880
right-wing people

1041
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,940
or your liberal left-wing people

1042
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,700
or your middle-of-the-road

1043
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,560
fools, simp, dupes,

1044
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,560
nay-nay.

1045
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,500
We're subgeniuses,

1046
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,100
friends. We don't fit into any of the

1047
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,360
categories you're trying to fit us into

1048
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,260
right now. You're listening to this

1049
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,120
stuff going, what the heck

1050
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,600
are these guys talking about?

1051
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,500
Where are they coming from?

1052
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,900
Oh, friends,

1053
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,460
if only you knew where we're coming from.

1054
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,580
If only you knew. See,

1055
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,240
the whole thing about this creationist stuff

1056
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,220
is, uh,

1057
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,200
God, you know, these people are saying

1058
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,860
God made

1059
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,320
all people in only six days.

1060
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,280
Friends, the only ones

1061
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,960
that God made in only six days

1062
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,740
were the subgeniuses. That's right.

1063
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,200
It took millions of years for the rest of

1064
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,060
the pinks, the humans,

1065
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,000
uh, to, to, uh,

1066
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,940
to evolve up from

1067
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,660
the pinkies. But, uh,

1068
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,360
God only made the subgeniuses

1069
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,100
appear suddenly out of nothing.

1070
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,240
And, uh, for that matter, it wasn't really

1071
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,180
God anyway. It was Jehovah One,

1072
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,280
the alien space god from some

1073
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,640
corporate sin galaxy.

1074
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,140
Some UFO type of

1075
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,220
thing only a thousand times more

1076
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,000
powerful than your pathetic

1077
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,100
human conception of a

1078
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,880
UFO! And besides

1079
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,960
that, friends,

1080
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,140
when the humans evolved, so to

1081
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,180
speak, evolved, this is the one thing that's

1082
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,720
really wrong with the evolution theory.

1083
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,840
It was a step

1084
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,680
down.

1085
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,200
But friends, there's even worse things out there

1086
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,820
and Janer Hypercletes

1087
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,220
went on the air in our, uh,

1088
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,100
at the Sisters Station up in

1089
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,040
Little Rock, uh, on

1090
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,100
RC Guys Show, Real Cool Guys

1091
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,300
Show, to, uh, to talk about

1092
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,880
the, the terrible

1093
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,300
prevalence we've been seeing lately.

1094
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,340
Of buckets of naked girls.

1095
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,400
You can actually go out and buy a bucket

1096
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,220
of naked girls in Hollywood these

1097
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,400
days, and we're gonna get to that tape

1098
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,080
right after this

1099
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,960
message.

1100
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,400
Tonight's episode of the Hour

1101
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,160
of Slack is brought to you by the

1102
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,020
Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

1103
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,340
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia

1104
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,080
Company features jobs approved

1105
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,800
by the church where, and all

1106
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,440
manner of weird things.

1107
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,000
Serving the public since God knows

1108
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,160
when, Weeping Cyclops is

1109
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,820
at Box 595-148,

1110
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,320
Dallas, Texas,

1111
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,320
753-59-5148.

1112
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,300
Thanks,

1113
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,180
Weeping Cyclops, for supporting

1114
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,280
the Hour of Slack and

1115
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,140
KNON.

1116
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,220
Oh, thanks, Weeping Cyclops, and

1117
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,460
indeed, I don't know where we'd be without the Weeping Cyclops.

1118
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,320
And friends, you need to send for those Dobbs

1119
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,180
t-shirts and patches, buttons,

1120
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,680
all kinds of stuff from the Weeping Cyclops

1121
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,280
at that

1122
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,280
famous P.O. Box. Uh, I have

1123
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,080
to cut in here before we get to Jayner to

1124
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,460
announce it. I mean, when I put in Buck's

1125
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,220
cart earlier, it was

1126
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,140
playing only on one channel, and I was

1127
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,320
thinking, God, couldn't they

1128
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,220
have gone, couldn't Buck have gone to the trouble

1129
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,120
of doing that in stereo? Then I put in

1130
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,360
the Pope S. Cecilia's, uh, Weeping

1131
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,220
Cyclops cart here, and it

1132
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,200
was doing the same thing, coming out on one channel.

1133
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,660
And I was thinking, this,

1134
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,920
this is ridiculous, this shouldn't happen.

1135
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,520
And in frustration, I pounded

1136
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,000
really hard,

1137
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,200
pounded the, uh, cart

1138
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,180
player, and by gobs

1139
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,220
it came to life! It's a miracle!

1140
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,920
It's a miracle, praise Bob!

1141
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,060
And it proved, it just goes to show,

1142
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
I swear to God, this is true, friends, I

1143
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,180
have to work with tape decks all the time,

1144
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,180
and many, many times, those

1145
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,140
decks go down, and I

1146
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,220
spray them out and do things to them, and I, and they

1147
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,180
still not working right, and I think, oh gosh,

1148
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,340
I'm gonna have to take it to the, to the, uh,

1149
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,220
repair guy, and I find out how much

1150
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,240
they charge, I get so mad that I

1151
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,100
actually pick up those decks and slam

1152
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,360
them down, or put them in the car and drive

1153
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,660
over bumpy roads, and

1154
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,260
friends, 90% of the

1155
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,280
time, driving that tape deck

1156
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,140
over a bumpy road will

1157
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,240
repair your tape deck. Isn't

1158
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,200
it the truth, Willa Dobbs? It is the

1159
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,200
truth, man! I mean, I just

1160
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,320
hit this machine, and we got that

1161
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,100
right channel in. The, the

1162
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,040
acu-beating is the truth! Bob

1163
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,320
spoke of acu-beating, friends, and

1164
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,300
it, well, it's time to go to Jayner.

1165
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,260
Friends, this is

1166
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,240
sick, what he's talking about, and I, I hate to

1167
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
think it's real, too, but here we

1168
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,220
We've

1169
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,460
got here a girl

1170
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,840
that we recently

1171
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,320
got from

1172
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,520
a so-called Jayner Hyperclete's

1173
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,080
Rick Maverick brand

1174
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,380
bucket of naked girls.

1175
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,380
Now, when I first heard about

1176
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,280
this, I couldn't believe that this could

1177
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,060
even possibly exist, that

1178
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,400
Hollywood stars could be purchasing

1179
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,300
buckets of naked girls on the

1180
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,260
black market for their

1181
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,020
pleasure. I, I thought that was

1182
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,180
too decadent to even be real,

1183
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,020
to even, to even be happening.

1184
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,240
Now, now it's

1185
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,860
true that you came to Hollywood in

1186
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,740
1974.

1187
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,180
Is that, is that true,

1188
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,300
Miss Girl? Well, I don't know, I don't

1189
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,140
know what year it was, really.

1190
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,480
They just, they just blindfolded

1191
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,880
me, and I was just,

1192
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,440
like, 12 or 13, and they just,

1193
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,160
they just threw me in a bucket,

1194
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,600
and, you know, they just,

1195
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,320
they gave me acid and

1196
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,000
all kinds of drugs, and...

1197
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,260
Oh, my God. I know, it was just

1198
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,280
the most abhorrent thing

1199
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,620
I ever heard of.

1200
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,340
And so, you were led to believe that

1201
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,300
you could get a part

1202
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,140
in a film?

1203
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,280
Yes, they told me I would be a big star,

1204
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,220
they told me I would be the biggest star

1205
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,420
in Hollywood ever, and, and

1206
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,300
they showed me contracts, and

1207
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,900
everything, and,

1208
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,120
but, I've just been in a bucket

1209
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,980
since I was 13 years old,

1210
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,740
and, and now I'm 27.

1211
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,440
This is the most...

1212
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,020
I wanna know

1213
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,100
when my first movie's gonna be.

1214
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,400
I mean, what about this, what about this big movie

1215
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,980
I'm supposed to be starring in? This is the most,

1216
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,960
this is the most horrible, I think the public has a right

1217
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,400
to know. We found, this is,

1218
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,080
we found a warehouse

1219
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,040
of buckets of naked girls

1220
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,620
on the outskirts of Hollywood,

1221
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,300
believed to have ties to Rick Mayweather,

1222
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,880
and Jane or Hyperclete.

1223
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,500
I thought, I thought the whole thing

1224
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,120
was a joke, some kind of prop

1225
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,940
for one of their quote unquote

1226
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,980
skits. But,

1227
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,500
upon opening one of the so-called

1228
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,760
buckets of naked girls,

1229
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,200
we found this girl. It took us two

1230
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,440
weeks before she was even able to talk.

1231
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,260
So well had she been

1232
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,440
brainwashed and trained by the

1233
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,040
maniacal

1234
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,820
white slave owners.

1235
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,160
Now, is it true that your, your

1236
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,980
skin has been chemically

1237
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,140
processed to reject

1238
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,960
clothing? Yes.

1239
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,140
I can't even, I,

1240
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,220
one piece, one inch of

1241
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,040
clothing just touches my body

1242
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,120
and it just disintegrates. It just,

1243
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,760
I can't wear clothes anymore.

1244
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,300
Why are you flashing all that, baby? I just, I

1245
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,500
I can't put on gloves when the

1246
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,640
freeze comes down. I don't know what to do.

1247
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,980
I just, I'm just

1248
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,160
doomed to be naked the rest of my

1249
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,160
life in a bucket. I mean, what

1250
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,060
can I do? It's not so bad, really.

1251
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,880
This is tragic. I mean,

1252
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,180
I'm embarrassed that we're even having

1253
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,460
to talk to you up here

1254
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,180
with you naked. I mean, this is completely

1255
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,080
sexist for a liberal

1256
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,940
like me. Yeah, y'all oughta see this.

1257
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,320
I mean, really.

1258
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,080
Oh, come on,

1259
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,660
R.C., give her a break.

1260
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,280
This is a human being.

1261
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,320
This is just one of the most, this is the most

1262
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,260
sick, degenerative

1263
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,560
thing I've ever encountered in all my years of reporting. It is sick, friends.

1264
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,260
It is really horrible.

1265
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,160
And, and, uh,

1266
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,100
Dr. Hyperclete's here has been reporting

1267
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,960
for a long time. Of course,

1268
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,080
some think that this is just a giant

1269

But, uh,

1275
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,300
he walked in and said, uh,

1276
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,100
they are saying bucket, aren't they?

1277
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,200
Friends, I'm gonna try running, just out of a sense

1278
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,280

1279
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,980

Are you aware?

1328
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,280
Are you aware

1329
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,980
that sound is movement of the

1330
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:12,440
air?

1331
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,440
Are you aware?

1332
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,500

Can you feel it?

1340
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,920
Can you feel it?

1341
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,380
It's a physical force

1342
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,720
It's a physical force

1343
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,240
An unseen touch

1344
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,320
An hidden touch

1345
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,000
An expression of its

1346
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,460
source

1347
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,520

1352
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,180

1353
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,200

1359
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,180
And did you know

1360
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,020
And did you know

1361
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,040
That sound is a kind of light

1362
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,020
Moving slow, kind of blind

1363
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,400
Yeah

1364
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,940
Can you feel my sonic fingers?

1365
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,980
Can you feel these sonic fingers?

1366
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,940
Can you feel all sonic fingers?

1367
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,380
Can you feel my sonic fingers?

1368
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,680
Sonic fingers

Feel this now

1370
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,080
Can you feel it?

1371
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,380
Well, it's a physical force

1372
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,400
An unseen touching

1373
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,700
An expression of its source

1374
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,500
I'm touching your flesh

1375
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,700
I am touching your flesh

1376
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,760
I am touching your flesh

1377
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,700
Right now

1378
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,840
I am touching your flesh

1379
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,180
I am touching your flesh

1380
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:22,140
I am touching your flesh

1381
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,480
I am touching your flesh

1382
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:23,960
Right now

1383
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,140
I am touching your flesh

1384
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,140


1385
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,380
I am touching your flesh

1386
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:28,380


1387
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:28,380


1388
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,100
Are you equal to this test?

1389
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,820
Will you welcome this invisible guest?

1390
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,120
Are you equal to the test?

1391
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,820
Will you welcome the invisible guest?

1392
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,940
Can you feel my sonic finger?

1393
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:51,080
Can you feel a sonic finger?

1394
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,960
Can you feel a sonic finger?

1395
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,120
Can you feel a sonic finger?

1396
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,700
Friends, I know you can feel it.

1397
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,000
I know you can feel it.

1398
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,820
Are you up to it?

1399
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,620
Will you go through, will you make it in that final test?

1400
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,440
You can find out by writing for information.

1401
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,760
You don't even have to send money.

1402
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,360
You don't have to send money.

1403
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,340
Not even a dollar.

1404
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,020
Just free for information.

1405
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,920
Not like what you get.

1406
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,080
Well, at, and friends, you can write to that,

1407
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,220

01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,620
That's right.

1415
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,000
This, by the way, this instrumental going out

1416
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,640
is by Martin Mothersbaugh.

1417
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:22,940
I honestly have no idea where or how it got here,

1418
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,680
but it did.

1419
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,320
And I, we do know it's him.

1420
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,780
That's what G. Gordon Gordon said.

1421
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,580
And he'll kill you if you disagree with him.

1422
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,520
Praise Bob.

1423
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,600
Who he'll move?

1424
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,420
Muddy.

01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:06,680

Tell me who rakestop?

I mean, did you?

1457
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,720
