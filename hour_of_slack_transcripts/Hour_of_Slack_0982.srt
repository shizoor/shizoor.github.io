1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,300
Hey, what you got behind your back there?

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,680
What?

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,080
Behind your back, right here.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,220
Behind your back, behind your back.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,580
What's this?

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,640
I was just catching up on a little reading.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,580
Signs, omens, portents, and charms to ward off...

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,300
The subgenius.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,600
Our own subgenius.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,940
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:46,920
To our portals, the subgenius from ancient horror story tornados.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,220
The hours track will not be broadcast tonight.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,720
In favor of the subgenius.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,400
Commercials.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,360
News reports.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,380
Contest.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Phone calls.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,640
And most importantly, more of the music of the subgenius.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,120
I'm a smoker.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm a midnight joker.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,680
Let go, can't don't.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,940
Let go, can't.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,360
Can't come down, gotta be high.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,720
Say you never let me die, die, die.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,160
One more time, but just a little try.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,500
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,740
I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,520
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,760
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,800
Can't come down, gotta stay high.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,140
What'll I do without my high, high, high?

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,580
Life's too fast, I need a lot of slack.

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,900
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back.

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,020
I'm a smoker.

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm a smoker.

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,400


38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm a smoker.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm a smoker.

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,560


41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,560


42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,560


43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,560


44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,560


45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,560


46
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm a smoker.

47
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,240
I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.

48
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,500
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.

49
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,920
I want to be a hippie and I want to get goat.

50
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,340
I want to be a runaway god to leave hope.

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,700
I want to be a hippie and I want to get goat.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,180
I want to be a runaway god to leave hope.

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,600
I want to get high.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,560
I want to get high.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:09,220
When you head thunder, don't run under a tree, just walk in the rain and get stoned with me.

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:42,300
Now I want us to sunbathe, now I want us sun to death, all the kids want us to sunbathe, all the kids want sun to death.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,400
This generation rules the nation with vision.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,860
Music and some refood and vlog, sounds to really make you rub and scrub.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,980
Slam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,460
Bum, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, bum.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,640
I said, pass the dutchie by the left hand side.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,740
Pass the dutchie by the left hand side.

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,980
Roll another blunt.

64
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,820
Yeah.

65
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,580
Oh, good.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,720
La, la, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,320
Ew.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
La, ta, ta, ta, ta.

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,520
Just getting high.

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm getting stoned.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,160
And what's wrong with that?

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,920
The president seems to be too fine.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,420
I've got ecstasy.

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,400
I've got cancer.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Wait, wait.

77
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,320
I've got ecstasy.

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,320


79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,700
I smoke two joints in the morning.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,080
I smoke two joints at night.

81
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,920
I smoke two joints in the afternoon.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
It makes me feel all right.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,280
I smoke two joints in time of peace and two in time of war.

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,580
I smoke two joints because I smoke two joints.

85
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,300
And then I smoke two more.

86
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,940
I smell dope.

87
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,840
I smell dope.

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,920
I smell dope.

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm smelling dope.

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
I smell dope.

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
I smell dope.

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,020
I smell dope.

93
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,620
I smell dope.

94
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:24,620


95
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,840
I'm smelling dope.

96
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,040
I smell dope.

97
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go get some fast cooking.

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,900
Let's go get some fast cooking.

99
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:27,240
Let's go get some fast cooking.

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,420
Someone keeps saying I'm insane to complain about a round trip ticket when it's all gonna end.

101
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Well, I believe anything that ain't nice when you got Rippin' Striddle and the Jada device.

102
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,880
Just watch the face smiling there in the dark.

103
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,180
Burn all your money when they decimate the Taylor Park.

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,620
Yo, I can't do this.

105
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,300
Samper's so genius.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm so genius, baby.

107
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,840
So why don't you kill me?

108
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,160
Oh, look, a pantyhose.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,720
You're so genius.

110
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm so genius, baby.

111
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,300
So why don't you kill me?

112
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,200
Flesh-fried sauces in a Bobby Ken nightmare.

113
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,920
Stock fists pounding down the door of the world.

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,860
Cause one's gotta rant and the other's gotta brag.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,940
Bob's on some window painting, Connie's on the rag with the radio shows.

116
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,920
And the backstage blowjobs.

117
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,540
Can't get it right.

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,940
I've been invited to the first week.

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,640
What's the fuck?

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,880
Burn to death like a Buddhist priest.

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
Yes, men starving at the subgenius feast.

122
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,600
And it's all for those who fulfill their fate.

123
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,520
Trade the cash for the pills for the bodies for the hate.

124
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,460
And the time is a piece of crap.

125
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,420
Falling down the toilet with Bob's hand on the handle.

126
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,940
Samper's so genius.

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,280
I'm so genius, baby.

128
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,460
So why don't you kill me?

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
I'm a frog.

130
00:07:59,560 --> 00:07:59,780
I'm a noob.

131
00:07:59,780 --> 00:07:59,860
You lost.

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Samper's so genius.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
I'm so genius, baby.

134
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
So why don't you kill me?

135
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
guitar solo

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm a dog

137
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,220
Things are gonna change

138
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,000
I can feel

139
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,520
Oh, yes.

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
Semper Subgenius, dear friends,

141
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,180
by Phineas Narco.

142
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,920
Reverend Phineas Narco.

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,480
And he could do it, after all.

144
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
And friends, you can get more

145
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,160
Phineas Narco by download

146
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,200
from this website,

147
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,420
nationalcynical.com

148
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,740
He's part of a group

149
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,280
called National Cynical Radio.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,900
And that's national, one word,

151
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,360
cynical.com

152
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,420
Phineas Narco.

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
Before that drugged up collage,

154
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,480
God, what kind of a show is this?

155
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,760
Anyway, that was put together

156
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,080
by our friend Soso Dada.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,680
Reverend Soso Dada,

158
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,660
who lives in New York currently,

159
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,200
I think.

160
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,180
Oh, we have all sorts of fun

161
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,580
and games and tapes

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,260
and Fernanden and Elie Mer

163
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,900
cut-ups, which were in there

164
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,000
and which will continue to be in here

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,900
and in all shows.

166
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,340
And Lone Storm Cowboys

167
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,340
and Dave is here.

168
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,720
And Princess We Are Doe.

169
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,540
Hi, how are you?

170
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,900
Queen of all the UFOs.

171
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,780
And even Potter Nostril is here.

172
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,300
Good to see everyone out there listening.

173
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,640
Potter Nostril, who is

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,140
usually not in the...

175
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,480
in the studio,

176
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,560
but is our point man out at Brushwood

177
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
where we drill

178
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,780
for the end of the world.

179
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,700
And we prompt...

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,140
Next day coming up soon.

181
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,340
Pump, pump, pump.

182
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,140
Pump, pump, pump.

183
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
We prompt the jackass muscle.

184
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
We make them think without brains.

185
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,200
We teach them to see without eyes,

186
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,000
to smell without nostrils.

187
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,380
Even though Potter Nostril is...

188
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,520
And to live where there is

189
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,860
nothing to live for.

190
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,500
What is that?

191
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,140
Why, that's your own...

192
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,040
Home, home, town, USA.

193
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
Home, sweet home.

194
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
We're back at...

195
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,420
It's like a suppository

196
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,400
made of lawnmowers.

197
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,140
And lung tissue.

198
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,020
Let's not forget good old

199
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,200
wholesome lung tissue.

200
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,120
What powers our lawnmowers?

201
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,600
Hard as...

202
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,640
You been smoking lunk again?

203
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,080
No, I've been drinking...

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,560
Lung junk?

205
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
I've been smoking a little bit of lung junk,

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,940
but mostly I'm drinking Abyssinian peas water.

207
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,500
Really?

208
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:10,920
Yes.

209
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,980
It imparts wisdom.

210
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,960
Oh, no, you've missed your fancy pants.

211
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,920
Oh, I guess it's going to be absinthe next.

212
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,320
Oh, yeah.

213
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,780
I'm an absinthe smith.

214
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,500
Yeah, well...

215
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,800
Friends, welcome to another Hour of Slack.

216
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,900
This is Hour of Slack 982.

217
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,240
That's how many there have been.

218
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,520
Including a few reruns.

219
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
And this is a rerun of something

220
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,440
that happened only one or two seconds ago.

221
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,500
So it's almost like it's fresh.

222
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,240
Like...

223
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,160
And I wish we had some fresh jokes

224
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,100
or gags or gimmicks to tell you about.

225
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,020
All right, okay, we'll try.

226
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,480
But unfortunately, it's just the same old...

227
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,440
Something about Amish...

228
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,680
Yes, yes, yes, well...

229
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,260
An Amish vibrator.

230
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,600
That's a big crescendo for a bunch of nothing, ain't it?

231
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,020
Is there something?

232
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,740
I can't hear it.

233
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,400
But isn't nothing everything anyway?

234
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,400
Well, before we forget, we should mention,

235
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,600
because we will forget,

236
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,000
that we will mention the subgenius

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
upcoming event.

238
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,940
Such as the revival at Detroit.

239
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,220
The rhythmic undulation of the book.

240
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,100
March 19th.

241
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,660
We can't recommend that anyone go to that

242
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
for legal reasons.

243
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,940
Of course.

244
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,520
But it will be happening.

245
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,360
Right.

246
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,060
In Detroit.

247
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,860
In Detroit, March 19th,

248
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,680
with the amino acids,

249
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,300
who really are a man who is...

250
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,820
An acid.

251
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,280
The Christ punchers who do...

252
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,040
Actually punch.

253
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,720
Yes.

254
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,260
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc and yours.

255
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,220
Who does blunts.

256
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,280
Blunts.

257
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,860
Truly Reverend Stang.

258
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm sure you could come along if you wanted to.

259
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,500
If I wanted to be abused like a baby

260
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,780
and touched and fondled the wrong way.

261
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,000
Now, on the other hand...

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,120
And you meant to speak like this.

263
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,180
Well, this ain't Catholicism, Dave.

264
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,100
I could be fondled the right way.

265
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,380
I mean, I'm not saying it can't be done.

266
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,960
Are you... Is that an invitation?

267
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,020
It's a form of open invitation.

268
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
Fondle me how you dare.

269
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,360
But if you do not fondle me correctly,

270
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,020
you'll probably get the wrong sort of information back.

271
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,220
Well, we can do that.

272
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,700
We can do that.

273
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,620
We can do that on 8X day,

274
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,040
the eighth scheduled end of the planet,

275
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,820
according to Dobbs' prophecy.

276
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,800
And they keep letting us down, but maybe they won't.

277
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,040
There's gonna be 3X days, actually.

278
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,680
There'll be a Tex Day in Texas.

279
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,200
Instead of 7-5-0-5, it will be taking place on 5-7-0-5,

280
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,140
May 7th in Texas, in Austin.

281
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,620
Outside of Austin, in a hippy-dippy campground

282
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,000
run by... well, subgeniuses.

283
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,340
Dabsters in the...

284
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,000
Wicked bellies.

285
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,360
Yeah, wicka-billies.

286
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,280
Oh, wicka-billies.

287
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,280


288
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,440
Wicka-billies.

289
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Wicka-billy.com would actually be the place to find out about Tex Day.

290
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
I'll see you down there, partner.

291
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,260
When was the last time you had a steamin' hot bowl of

292
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,620
Wolf Brand Habba-Frap Zippy Lops?

293
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,020
Well, now that's too long.

294
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
Yeah, that's a long time.

295
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,780
Too long.

296
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,640
Then there's X Day at Brushwood,

297
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,700
the weekend before July 5th,

298
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,160
building up to July 5th,

299
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,580
when the saucers will arrive and rupture up the dues-paying subgeniuses,

300
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,640
leaving you, dear listener, behind.

301
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,500
Frying in your own fat,

302
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,920
like bacon in the pan,

303
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,240
because you put off that, uh...

304
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,960
Well, we can't, uh, solicit here on the air,

305
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,340
because this is a religious radio broadcast, friends.

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,120
We're here to praise Bob!

307
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,920
Praise Bob!

308
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
And his master!

309
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
His master's on the dark side.

310
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:24,900
Yes.

311
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,760
Yes.

312
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,680
The dark path of least resistance

313
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,220
proved to be the more powerful form of slack.

314
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
The tinky people.

315
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,300
Dark slack had more power than good slack,

316
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,300
or light slack.

317
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,140
Slack light.

318
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,420
Dark energy.

319
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:38,880


320
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,100
It is dark energy, Slack.

321
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,940
Hardcore slack.

322
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,340
Triple X slack, baby.

323
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,600
It is made directly from dark energy,

324
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,460
the force in the universe which we've yet to find a use for,

325
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,400
a way of concurrently massing to perform activities called work.

326
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,500
And work is what we want to avoid.

327
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,260
And...

328
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,840
We want to create slack with this dark energy.

329
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,680
Yep.

330
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,600
Well, they say that dark energy and dark matter comprise most of the known universe.

331
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,620
And that is most of our adenoids and our atoms.

332
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,400
And most of our embryonic tissues.

333
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
I mean our intestines.

334
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,020
That's so dark down there.

335
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,440
And most of your paycheck, Dave, will likewise be in dark money.

336
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,960
Yes.

337
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,460
A new subgenius invention we used to...

338
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,640
They have to make all the denominations.

339
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,380
I think they say.

340
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,660
And most of the people that Paternostril knows are in the dark.

341
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,640
Well, that's why they need to follow his nose.

342
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,180
Paternostril and his great third nostril...

343
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,360
What is he?

344
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,660
Actually makes mushrooms in his own house.

345
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,200
...which moves around on his body.

346
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,600
Sometimes it's in the center of his forehead like there's a...

347
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,540
I don't know where they're supposed to be, but...

348
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,180
Then they go under your nose, on your upper lip, slide around down your back.

349
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,620
What we need is an alignment close to the solar plexus.

350
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,760
If we do not have this, I'm afraid the poor man may die before triple, quadruple, 8x day.

351
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,540
But he can be healed at 8x day, friends.

352
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,760
Because some of the bands that will be there include Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band.

353
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,460
Pactin Salt.

354
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,860
The Amino Acids Man.

355
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Pactin Baked Bean Gravy.

356
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,760
Smokin' Stein.

357
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,340
Smokin' Stein.

358
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,820
The Drunk...

359
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,760
Well, we're going back to the Universal Monster of yesteryear.

360
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,740
The Rummy.

361
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,900
The Rummy.

362
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,320
Yeah.

363
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,660
Who else?

364
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,820
Crackula.

365
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,340
And the Vapyrs.

366
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,540
The Vapyrs.

367
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,000
That's the...

368
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
Doc Fropp knows about that.

369
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,600
That was the Phantom of the Froppra.

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,960
And did we say Crankin' Stein?

371
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,360
Yes, you certainly did.

372
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:27,900
Crankin' Stein.

373
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,080
No, that was Smokin' Stein.

374
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,740
Smokin' Stein.

375
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,420
Yeah, there's some litigation going on.

376
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,340
Oh, and the Creature from the Smack Lagoon.

377
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,240
Creature from the Smack Lagoon.

378
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,220
And the Hunch...

379
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,040
Smack.

380
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,240
The Hunch Slack of Brushwood.

381
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,740
I've got a hunch that you're kind of fabricating a lot of that list of bands.

382
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,660
You said Semi, Erstwhile, and the Tettles or something, and the Smallberries are going

383
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,020
to be there.

384
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,300
You mentioned also a lot of groups that I didn't think were real names.

385
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,240
Like...

386
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,920
You got Slackzilla.

387
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:57,800
Slackzilla.

388
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,380
Slackzilla.

389
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,520
Right.

390
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:58,520


391
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,440
You failed to mention Slackzilla.

392
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,900
That's a real...

393
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,880
Well, that's because that's a real band and we couldn't get Slackzilla.

394
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,540
Oh, and then they couldn't get them, they sure.

395
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,220
They were a little bit too expensive for us.

396
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,120
You know, we actually have tried to pay Mark Mothersbaugh, who is a dues-paying subgenius.

397
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,100
We offered to pay his way, but...

398
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
Plus $35.

399
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,800
He was too busy devolving in Hollywood, I guess.

400
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,260
Yeah.

401
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,680
We did have one of the members of GWAR come to X Day, and of all times, to be doused

402
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,620
with fake blood, it happened to him while he was on vacation.

403
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,420
He got a dip in the pig, huh?

404
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:28,540
It was an accident.

405
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,840
He happened to be under the World Globe when, like, you smashed it with his sword of justice

406
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,620
and the fake blood poured out.

407
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,620
And who'd it pour out on?

408
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,800
Like, one guy who gets fake blood dumped on him on his day job.

409
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,680
Well, they use real pig blood in GWAR.

410
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,240
They did use real pig blood.

411
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,340
They don't use fake blood, not prostituting blood.

412
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,080
No, no.

413
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:55,180
In the Church of the Subgenius, we use real blood and sperm and viscera and spit and sweat

414
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,960
and...

415
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,160
All of your precious bodily fluids, Bad Drake.

416
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,520
Not just those ones.

417
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,940
We need all of your precious bodily fluids.

418
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,640
P-A-R-E-F.

419
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,380
Must mix them.

420
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,860
P-A-R-E-F.

421
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,660
So precious, Bad Drake.

422
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:06,860
P-A-R-E-F.

423
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
What makes them so precious?

424
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,280
P-A-R-E-F.

425
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,180
The tiny value, the increments of wealth encapsulated into each molecule, your cells, look.

426
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,740
They're actually growing money, Bad Drake.

427
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
Sit down.

428
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,120
Yes, I'm afraid you're not going to be able to take the shark.

429
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
It's been going on for years, my dear friend.

430
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,240
Here, let me put my hand on your knee for a second.

431
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,600
No.

432
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,780
Yes, eh?

433
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,600
No.

434
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,680
Let me put my hand on your shoulder here, Bad Drake.

435
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,400
Dave.

436
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,720
Bad Drake, let me put my upper lip on your forehead, Bad Drake.

437
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,940
He uses these skits as an excuse to get fresh with Princess Wee.

438
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,300
To forget what I was talking about.

439
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,100
Bad Drake, your bodily fluids will be the template for a new mankind.

440
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
We shall take them.

441
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,420
We shall reform them.

442
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,720
We shall re-engineer.

443
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,860
We shall mutagen them.

444
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,860
Then we shall bake and shake them.

445
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,580
We shall make them.

446
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,580


447
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,140
Until a new man is created.

448
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,020
See, if you wait long enough, he just cracks up.

449
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,540
It just dissolves like that.

450
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,280
Yeah, it has to.

451
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,440
You have to believe that something for nothing can come your way, my friend.

452
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,460
Because even if it doesn't, if you did believe it, you'll think it did.

453
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,220
And that's the miracle of religion.

454
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
It's a miracle.

455
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,700
It is a milagro.

456
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,340
The milagro of Bob.

457
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
And, oh, other bands.

458
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,040
Other bands that will be at X Day.

459
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,340
The Mind Losers.

460
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,320
Popeye and the Shrimp People.

461
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:44,860
Uh-huh.

462
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,000
The stupid bleeped-up teenage drunks.

463
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,220
Oh, well, let me say that again.

464
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,480
The stupid fucked-up teenage drunks.

465
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,760
The guy with the surgical scar who claims he used to be on Johnny Carson but nobody can see him and he can go back and forward into the future as a carrot.

466
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,360
The out-of-minders.

467
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:02,920
Yep.

468
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,840
Will be playing.

469
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,660
Can't remember them.

470
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,040
And, mister, you don't know who you're dealing with.

471
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,760
Well, you don't.

472
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,660
You really don't want to mess with him.

473
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:09,980
Clearly, clearly don't want to.

474
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,700
He's kind of a jerk.

475
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,260
Know what I'm saying?

476
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,640
Know what you're saying.

477
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:12,980
Know what I'm saying?

478
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,620
Know what you're saying.

479
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:13,920
Know what you're saying.

480
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,500
Know what you're saying.

481
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:14,740
Know what you're saying.

482
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,820
Know what you're saying.

483
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:14,820


484
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:14,820


485
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't.

486
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,580
Well, what about the, I heard now people like to make jokes about garden gnomes and having sex with them and stuff like that.

487
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,860
You know, and this is really passe talking constantly.

488
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,980
But I heard that you're actually going to have an installation artist there who's going to make garden giants that you can have sex with.

489
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,820
No, you got mixed up.

490
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,640
That's Burning Man.

491
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,640
So there's actually a huge giant that goes around sexing everyone at Burning Man?

492
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:46,100
No, we have this little puppet that we pretend is a big giant that goes around sexing everyone.

493
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,020
But it actually has squirt vesicles and little tiny sweat drips from its forebrow.

494
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,460
I mean, at least they said it did.

495
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,840
Well, yeah, until the stuff runs out.

496
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:54,840


497
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,840
It's radio controlled.

498
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,760
Well, it's got a real tiny old gland, doesn't it?

499
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,060
I mean, it's got a real like.

500
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,620
Parts of it are alive, but mostly it's a puppet.

501
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,260
So, geez, man.

502
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,900
I mean, where are we now?

503
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,460
Let me put it this way.

504
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,800
You can catch a disease from it.

505
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,820
Well, we're on our way to ecstasy.

506
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,800
You can catch a disease from a puppet nowadays.

507
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,620
Yeah.

508
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,820
And, geez, man, the world.

509
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,660
Yeah.

510
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,420
Oh, oh, actually, we need.

511
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm not a victim.

512
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,380
I'm not a victim.

513
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,520
We need to take a break for PR news, I believe.

514
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,840
From PR news in Washington, I'm part of the problem, not the solution.

515
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:24,840


516
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,440
Federal officials are bracing for another shortage of roadside bombs during the flu season that begins next fall.

517
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:38,380
Senator Edward Kennedy says doctors and hospitals need to make better use of the Nazi concentration camp at PR news.

518
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,800
He spoke today at a Cleveland concentration clinic where thousands of patients have been murdered.

519
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,320
Kennedy's getting worse.

520
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:53,640
Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned and killed at least 67 people in an attack south of PR's PR news, Washington.

521
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,840
I still don't know.

522
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,160
What's happened in Washington?

523
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,560
Theộ.

524
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:21,920
And under the achievements of the so-called Viele grains of steel industrial repair house,

525
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:21,920


526
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:21,920


527
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
прирaw.

528
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,660
Fernanda and Andy LeMire live.

529
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm unknown.

530
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,880
Amid continuing insurgent threats, Iraqi leaders say they have paid $57 for a draft course today in Baghdad.

531
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,200
On Wall Street 40, 10-426-2035.

532
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,920
The criminal trial against PR News continues in the world's fifth largest brewery.

533
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,600
This is PR News.

534
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,660
Okay, now you can sing along.

535
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,080
Or bite my fry.

536
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,600
I went to a store.

537
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,840
When I got the gauze and took care of the rectal bleeding, I changed the bumps on my head.

538
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,560
And I knew that the electrodes in my neck were calling me.

539
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,460
How do you change the bumps on your head, Dave?

540
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,340
Well, you just focus your third eye.

541
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,940
Okay.

542
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,380
Well, actually, you have to focus your third nostril, I'm sure.

543
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,640
Anytime I see it, my heart starts bumping and bumping.

544
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,480
You focus. You think of your third nostril as a transmitter of energy.

545
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,100
Not as a receiver of sigh olfactory and things like that.

546
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,520
And concentrate on the bumps.

547
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,040
Oh, glory.

548
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,480
But it comes.

549
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Colors for which she sighs.

550
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,040
She sighs.

551
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,640
Red for the blood.

552
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,280
White for the guts.

553
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,320
Blue for the blue blood.

554
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,180
Sip.

555
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,300
Sip.

556
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:21,100
And I want to tell the story.

557
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,360
The story.

558
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,580
Of the United States.

559
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,420
Snakes of oil.

560
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,620
Chatuchin.

561
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,400
A buck for peptide.

562
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,540
Chatuchin.

563
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,260
A buck for a car.

564
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,520
Chatuchin.

565
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:34,940
Chatuchin.

566
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,060
A buck for Haliburton.

567
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,420
Haliburton.

568
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,000
Hey, yo, yo.

569
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,360
Yo.

570
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,360
Yo.

571
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,540
Yo.

572
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:46,940
Yo.

573
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:46,940


574
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,740
Yo.

575
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,080
Yo.

576
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,480
Yo.

577
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,680
Yo.

578
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:54,540
Yo.

579
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,120
Long may she wave

580
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,420
Long may she wave

581
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,880
Over Loughborough

582
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
And the people of Loughborough

583
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,100
Know no more

584
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,600
Of the colour score which she signs

585
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,960
She signs

586
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,620
Red for the fudge

587
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,300
White for the pitch

588
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,520
Blue for the be-mah-ree

589
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,680
Blue- yo-r-r-r

590
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,740
Blue rah-ろう-p George

591
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
Red Oh Red Red

592
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,700
Easy

593
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,480
Red The Red

594
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Easy

595
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Blue-lo-o-o-r-see

596
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,580
Red And black

597
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,260
Key Medley

598
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,760
You ain't nobody CR!

599
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,180
Hercule Mazur!?

600
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,260
And the caller asked,

601
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
Oh what did she say?

602
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,540
A gladly bird

603
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,760
When ludzi orgi

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,020

605
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,880
There fly their blue power

606
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,300
Hi, are you there?

607
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,860
ണ�ikitому,

608
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,460
notion

609
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Museum Inc

610
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,080
I respect her so well.

611
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,060
You do?

612
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,920
Yes.

613
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,120
She's so worthy of your urethra.

614
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,960
Oh, gooey, gory.

615
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,340
She's worthy of your urethra, I was worried.

616
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,340
And I know that we don't want to worry about that.

617
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,020
What was that?

618
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,460
She's worthy of more than your respect.

619
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,080
S'more?

620
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,040
She's worthy of your tinkles and your periwing.

621
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,500
What was that poorly recorded band we just heard?

622
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,620
Oh, that was Carlsbad and the Eskimos.

623
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,060
Punbo and the Tardos.

624
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,260
Punbo and the Tartars.

625
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,780
And they appear with raw meat.

626
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,500
No, it was Lonesome or Mad Cow Pie Dwayne.

627
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,480
And the Beachland Ball Rushers.

628
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,020
No, Mondo's Retardo Band.

629
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,700
Oh, right.

630
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:51,880
Right.

631
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,020
They were at the Beachland Bull Rushers.

632
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,320
Ballroom.

633
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,320
Yes, being waited to be picked up by old Pharaoh.

634
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,720
In Cleveland.

635
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,260
And said Moses came by, picked him up, put him in his sack, drove him home, and made a sandwich out of them.

636
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,080
Well, sometimes.

637
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,240
An open-faced, yeah, that's a bald-faced sandwich.

638
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,140
Is that part of that spooky religious stuff you guys are into?

639
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,580
Yeah, you've got to stop with this spooky religious stuff, man.

640
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,280
I mean, they were having a conversation last night on East 127th.

641
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,980
You know the old house over there?

642
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,580
With the top windows broken?

643
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,200
Yeah, the top windows broken out and stuff.

644
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,260
I guess there were like 35 people jamming on philosophical rap.

645
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,080
You know, they're just like laying there.

646
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,080
Oh, God, man.

647
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,560
Just think of this, you know.

648
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,560
That can't take, you know.

649
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,120
Don't continue.

650
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,820
And then your dad did it.

651
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,760
It's like, but God, that's not as bad a time to do that.

652
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,280
You know what I mean?

653
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,860
I used to do that when I was a kid.

654
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,220
Yeah.

655
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,540
I thank God.

656
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm surprised I'm still alive.

657
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:47,180
Well, most of these, I guess, people have serious diseases and don't mind discussing that either.

658
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,520
Well, you know, some people feel that they...

659
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,120
They have a rule book that they can go by.

660
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,600
Isn't it always so?

661
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,480
And then you can go by the rule book.

662
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,600
The book of the subgenius is still available.

663
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,120
You may pass it.

664
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,580
It's the book to go by.

665
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,340
Yes, and leave wind as you go.

666
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,280
Now, some people are into philosophy.

667
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
Some people are into religions.

668
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,940
Some are into science.

669
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,300
These are all false paths.

670
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,100
And they're all like divided up into...

671
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,080
They're okay for a while.

672
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,120
Yeah, and they're divided up into marketable names.

673
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,820
Like there's hardcore philosophy.

674
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,060
You know, there's rap...

675
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,800
Philosophy light.

676
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,880
There's dub philosophy.

677
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah.

678
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,880
You know.

679
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,220
Yeah.

680
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,100
You got a little something for everybody and you get what you pay for.

681
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,540
Right.

682
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,020
Cheap crap.

683
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,360
You can watch the philosophy time.

684
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,780
It lasts a while.

685
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,760
The philosophy network on cable.

686
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,720
Wrecks your liver.

687
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,040
Yeah.

688
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,880
Just sit there and be ruined by it.

689
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Sure.

690
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,560
Go ahead and be a philosopher if you want to wreck your life.

691
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:34,840
Yeah.

692
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,900
Look in the yellow pages.

693
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,160
How many philosophers you see in the yellow pages, Mr. Smarty Pants?

694
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,460
Okay.

695
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,000
All right.

696
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,520
Granted, there are more now than there used to be because of, you know, the conditions.

697
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,560
The government.

698
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,900
You know, I mean, I think it's a false philosophy.

699
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,540
There you go.

700
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,540
I think it's a false...

701
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, no.

702
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,340
False marketing philosophy.

703
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,260
Philosophy is such a good drink.

704
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,220
It tastes so good.

705
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,220
It blows up in your face just like all philosophy does.

706
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:57,880
That's right.

707
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,300
It pops in your pocket.

708
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,020
They're all self-verifying and that's the drawback.

709
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,260
Except for the Church of the Subgenius.

710
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,420
It's constantly Bob verified.

711
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,740
Nothing else is real.

712
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,020
It's a dream, baby.

713
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,180
It's all a...

714
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,060
Ride the snake.

715
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,060
A fabulous dream.

716
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,820
Focus on Bob.

717
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,220
If you can just lock on to that face, man.

718
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,340
That cute little face.

719
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,000
Ride.

720
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,920
It's cute as a bag of snakes.

721
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,780
That's a face.

722
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,660
A top star.

723
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,860
Not a face.

724
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,220
I can't get it up with my head.

725
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,660
I can't sleep anymore.

726
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,580
I can't dream.

727
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,360
Don't you understand what's happened to me?

728
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,940
That pipette is in my head.

729
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,920
I can't get it out.

730
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,980
Time for PR news.

731
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,700
From PR news in Washington.

732
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm against PR news in Washington.

733
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,440
An OPEC committee is recommending the oil cartels stick to its current polio vaccine.

734
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,560
The decision could heighten U.S. consumer consumption.

735
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:51,820
The government is making a decision.

736
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,680
They have a lot of concerns about PR news.

737
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,360
The Gates Foundation is giving ten religious and ethnic groups to PR's PR news.

738
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,600
Meanwhile today is the second day of Iraqis flying non-stop for the first time in more than 55 years.

739
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:11,540
Thousands of people in Russia have been protesting the loss of PR news in the heavily fortified Washington.

740
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,580
Now let's go get cleaned up.

741
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,080
If you're going to storm Kim Jong-il's palace single handed we have to make you a complete soldier in very little time.

742
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,560
How are we gonna do this?

743
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,340
I think I know just what we need.

744
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,580
Once remind everyone of what's going on.

745
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,160
And with every shot show a little improvement.

746
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,620
To show it all would take too long.

747
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,520
That's called a montage.

748
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,940
Girl, we want a montage.

749
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,780
And anything if you want to go.

750
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,900
From just a beginner to a pro.

751
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,280
You need a montage.

752
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,420
Even Rocky had a montage.

753
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,280
Montage.

754
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,600
Montage.

755
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,920
Montage.

756
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,040
Always fade out in a montage.

757
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Montage.

758
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,400
If you fade out it seems like more time has passed in a montage.

759
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,260
If you fade out it seems that more time has passed in a montage.

760
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,320
Can we briefly describe the encapsulated shots that floated by in those listeners' minds.

761
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,780
That they couldn't actually see in their pre-temporal lobes.

762
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,900
Was that that Irishman you were talking about?

763
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,180
Oh, the guy who put the montage together.

764
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,520
Yes.

765
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,240
The series of shots.

766
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,700
Yeah.

767
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,120
Yeah.

768
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,540
That now sounds stupid now.

769
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:53,940
But anyway.

770
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,560
It is a name, I guess.

771
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,080
It's like Carlo on oil, you know.

772
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,980
Cover him with dissolves and let him go.

773
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,640
Well, he was wiped anyway, wasn't he?

774
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

775
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,140
Oh, God.

776
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,520
That is.

777
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,580
Yeah.

778
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:09,960
Well.

779
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,080
That was from Team America.

780
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,140
And that brilliant computer animated movie, as my dad described it.

781
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
I said, no, I think those are really marionettes.

782
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,600
That's dad.

783
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,900
He goes, no, they just put the strings there to make it look like marionettes.

784
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,120
It's really computer animated.

785
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,620
No, they're not married.

786
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,520
Can't you tell?

787
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,160
Damn.

788
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,320
Damn.

789
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,260
It's marination.

790
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,300
Super marination.

791
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,200
Super marination.

792
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,600
The original technique used in Supercar.

793
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,240
Mm hmm.

794
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,940
And some of those other.

795
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,060


796
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,760
Oh, you remember Speed Racer?

797
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,020
Thunderbirds.

798
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,540
The effect he uses is based on the bird.

799
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,340
No, no, no.

800
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,760
Thunderbirds.

801
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,340
I'm sorry.

802
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,260
I got a little spooked up.

803
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,860
But how many.

804
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,280
So how many rock songs are there that glorify the work of the.

805
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,280


806
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,280


807
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,280


808
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,280


809
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,280


810
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,840
The work of the editor, which I, as a collage radio show editor, must point out.

811
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,760
But how many famous editors can you name?

812
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,420
Well, like maybe we could do a rap song.

813
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,820
Name one.

814
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,600
Perry.

815
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,100
Perry.

816
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,600
Yeah.

817
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:02,860
Perry.

818
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,460
No, no, no.

819
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,520
Great Caesar's ghost.

820
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,720
I'm talking about video film editors.

821
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,060
Perry Noid.

822
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,760
No, that's Avita.

823
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,460
Yeah, right.

824
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:11,740
Perry Mason.

825
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,860
The Queen of Norway.

826
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
No, Christ.

827
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:19,040
Actually, film editors don't miss the final cut, which the.

828
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,660
Uh.

829
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,980
Director often does.

830
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,520
Well.

831
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:21,940
No.

832
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,040
Yes, the director often does.

833
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,520
That glorified my career more than just anything.

834
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,420
And memory editing.

835
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,000
There's a movie about memory editing.

836
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,520
Unfortunately starring Robin Williams, but try to get past that.

837
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,620
It's a good movie anyway.

838
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,100
These are personal opinions and are not.

839
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,700
The hollow laughter.

840
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,220
The sounds of people with deviated sinuses.

841
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,960
Dee Dee Allen was the famous editor who edited Final Cut.

842
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,420
No.

843
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:49,960
Final Cut.

844
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,140
He had the deviated septum to begin with?

845
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,360
Her.

846
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,000
Dee Dee.

847
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,720
Dee Dee Allen.

848
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,180
She's one of the only well-known film editors.

849
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
Editors work behind the scenes.

850
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,120
We editors are like, we're the ones who really keep the whole thing together.

851
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,580
You're like the covert guys of the operation.

852
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:02,980
We keep the universe going.

853
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,140
We keep the dark matter separated from the regular matter, the anti-matter.

854
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,300
What a holy task, too.

855
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,620
And no one surrounds them.

856
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,540
No one suspends their disbelief for them.

857
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,340
Oh, the directors and movie stars get all the, you know, and the gurus, really.

858
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:15,800
Oh, Bob.

859
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,320
Everybody knows who Bob is.

860
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,540
How many people can name the sacred scribe?

861
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:19,640
He's a great guy.

862
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,180
How many can name the sacred janitor?

863
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,980
I can.

864
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,840
Hood's Foods and the Cabbage Rolls.

865
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,500
Well, sure, you can, because you're a hand.

866
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:25,620
Well, let's just stand.

867
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,840
That's your secret name when you're under some day job.

868
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,260
You said I was a sacred maid?

869
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,000
You said I was a sacred super maintenance guy.

870
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,740
Look, you know.

871
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,780
Not the janitor.

872
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,700
You said I was the super.

873
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:34,720
Okay, right.

874
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,180
Super.

875
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,860
You're the super.

876
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,440
No, you're right.

877
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:36,960
You're right.

878
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,460
Okay, right.

879
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,940
Because, I mean, who, you know, makes sure the boiler's going and keeps your freaking

880
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,060
radiator on?

881
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,800
That's right.

882
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,840
Subtracting our news, in Washington, I'm keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands

883
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,600
of Pope John Paul for a few more days.

884
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,460
The pope felt well enough to participate inside a nightclub after a bomb was found there.

885
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,500
Workers found the device next to his bed where hundreds of same-sex couples are stationed.

886
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,540
From Kansas City, PR state-run media reported that police were searching for the pope in

887
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:06,940
Washington.

888
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,360
Well.

889
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,560
Huh?

890
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,380
Eh?

891
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,420
No, that's Slim Myopia and Jerry Waxdorf, wasn't it?

892
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,820
Dr. Sinister, you know better than to mutter what you're saying.

893
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:18,820


894
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,820
You're supposed to mutter away from the microphone.

895
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,020
You're supposed to mutter way off.

896
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,500
Mutter on mic, dear.

897
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,560
If you're really cool, you put a coffee cup around your mouth and then mutter.

898
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,180
I did not realize that I was in on this conversation.

899
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Well, you are now, baby.

900
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,060
What's really pathetic is that I often recognize the voices of those people doing the PR.

901
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Well, yeah, they also work for NPR.

902
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,220
Yeah, yeah, they've been cut up.

903
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,380
No.

904
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,520
That was the work of Fernando Ndelema, that old cut-up.

905
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,600
He's another cutter.

906
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,440
That's what they call us editors.

907
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,440
Altspotspots.

908
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,300
The media editors.

909
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,880
Cutters.

910
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,140
Great Caesar's Ghost.

911
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,980
He's got his coffee cup.

912
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,920
It hasn't been fully prepared yet.

913
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,120
That's the high-tech level.

914
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,540
He's been preparing it over there by the garbage can for moments now.

915
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,560
You know, I created a little diaphragm in the bottom of this paper coffee cup by merely

916
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
placing my keys through it seven times.

917
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,880
And now you see that it works to transmute his voice into this fantastic altered thing.

918
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,580
And if you're not afraid of the way a juicer's contaminated the coffee cup, you can't do

919
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:17,720
anything about it.

920
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,920
You can't even tell it's contaminated even the sides of your head.

921
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,700
You can turn it around like this and make it sound like you're in a dark tunnel.

922
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,820
Who drank out of that coffee cup before you, Dave?

923
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,520
You don't know where that thing's been, do you?

924
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,160
Geronimo!

925
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,280
Now, speaking of high-tech, we were watching some really old Our Gang movies.

926
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:40,100
And notice that the level of technology used by those poor children in the Our Gang series

927
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,220
was very similar to that used by subgeniuses at, say, Brushwood.

928
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,920
That is sophisticated.

929
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,240
During that same thing.

930
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,320
The one we were watching...

931
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,680
They were struggling with some evil bootleggers who were trying to chase the kids away from

932
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:52,780
their camping trip.

933
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,140
I like a dusty area, kids.

934
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:03,560
And those kids used the tools, the weapons, the weapons of mass destruction that are available

935
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,220
to poor kids out in the woods fighting bootleggers, such as...

936
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,820
Pork kids?

937
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,860
No, poor...

938
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,640
You're talking about poor people again.

939
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,020
Little Pobucker, Punk, the Our Gang, Spanky, you know, Alfalfa, Chubby.

940
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,580
Actually, this was an older one.

941
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:16,880
Oh, yeah.

942
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,340
It was called Bunkie instead of Spanky.

943
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,340
That was well before Smacky.

944
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,400
It was before Buckwheat.

945
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,860
Weezer.

946
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,740
It was with Weezer.

947
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,560
Weezer was in it.

948
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,040
Weezer.

949
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Anyway, I noticed that back in them days...

950
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,860
Dr. Pankitch, I remember a podcast that you'll remember.

951
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,320
Back in them days, you didn't need your Home Alone, McCulkey Culkin.

952
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:43,540
All you needed was a beehive, a skunk, a porcupine, as Princess Wee pointed out.

953
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:43,800
A porcupine.

954
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,780
They didn't show that in this Our Gang thing, but that's another child weapon.

955
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,280
Oh, there's a skunk out there.

956
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,280


957
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,280


958
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,280


959
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,580
A stick, as Patronostro pointed out.

960
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,580
Or a bat, which they used.

961
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,260
Baseball bat.

962
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,720
And there's always an old, open, rusty bear trap.

963
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,460
In any forest, you're going to find an old bear trap, which you can use to foil the bootleggers.

964
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,440
There are some bloody old bear traps in the studio right now.

965
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,140
That's not as uncommon as an item as you think, Stan.

966
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,180
It's not as uncommon as an item as you think.

967
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,620
Well, the industrial bands use those for percussion, don't they?

968
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,440
They also use it for a quick snap.

969
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,160
But they use skeletons and cars and explosions for percussion.

970
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,060
And for neutering.

971
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,540
Art these days is just weird.

972
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,540
I mean, call me old fuddy-duddy.

973
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,720
I just don't get some of this stuff.

974
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,860
Why do they have to neuter themselves in a bear trap?

975
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,340
Because everything's neutral to begin with.

976
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,540
Reanimating corpses and saying, well, that's art now.

977
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,140
They're not doing anything special.

978
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,200
You're just shuffling around.

979
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,100
They call that art.

980
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,020
Yeah, yeah, watch it.

981
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,300
You sit there and you watch the plug-in.

982
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,620
And it's all found art, too.

983
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,360
Because most of the corpses are garbage.

984
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,220
And everybody, you know, that's not real art, man.

985
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,640
To me, real art is something that goes into the back, you know, the behind part of your eyes.

986
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,940
And tickles the little swirly things.

987
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,180
And makes the goo-goo gravy start going.

988
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,000
Next thing you know, you're befundling, you're vomiting.

989
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,220
You can't control your carrots or you can't, you know, you get swollen.

990
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,040
I've been there.

991
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,560
And that's what, you know, that's art.

992
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,480
That is art.

993
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,540
It stirs the soul.

994
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,180
Yes.

995
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,680
And it...

996
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
Personally, I have a theory.

997
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:27,840
I have a theory that art is nothing but a dysfunctional result of millions and millions of years of smiths chipping away at Flint to make stone hand axes.

998
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,520
Through one procreative thousand generation?

999
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,460
That's pretty much all guys did for about a hundred thousand years was chop at these rocks.

1000
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,940
They couldn't really talk or sing or do much of anything.

1001
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,100
But they could make these stone axes.

1002
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,580
They found, you know, you can find.

1003
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,180
They found stone hand axes all over the place.

1004
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,760
And yet human skulls are very rare from that stone age period.

1005
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,180
And yet you can find so many stone skulls around.

1006
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Because they didn't keep their hand axes.

1007
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,120
They would make the axe when they needed it to clobber the animal and skin it.

1008
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,760
Then they'd drop it right there when they were done with it.

1009
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,580
They didn't keep the hand axe.

1010
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:05,880
Right.

1011
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,340
Too much hand jobbing, animal clobbering, and not enough of the old, you know...

1012
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,200
So the smiths and other nearsighted cavemen sat and made things.

1013
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,420
All day long chipping rocks together.

1014
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:24,540
As far as I'm concerned, all human endeavor and obsessive compulsive disorder, specifically, and art,

1015
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,700
are results of a hog wild stretching of that old instinct of carving hand axes.

1016
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,540
We'd be perfectly happy if we were sitting in the dirt on our butts carving hand axes.

1017
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,200
But no, instead we gotta go,

1018
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,360
Oh, I'm Christo.

1019
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm gonna hang a giant parachute all across the ocean.

1020
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
Oh, I'm an artist.

1021
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,460
I'm Picasso.

1022
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,300
I'm a...

1023
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,780
Look at me.

1024
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,240
I paint dirty pictures and sell them for a million dollars.

1025
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm beloved by all humanity.

1026
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,340
Look at my use of color and depth.

1027
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,960
I'm a freaking genius.

1028
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,460
Love me, love me.

1029
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,280
Ah, it's ego.

1030
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:55,900
It's madness.

1031
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,940
It's nothing but a misfired stone axe carving instinct.

1032
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,740
That's gone...

1033
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,800
Gone awry.

1034
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,560
Yeah, it's gone awry.

1035
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,380
And one day...

1036
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,080
Time control must always go awry.

1037
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,340
One day, one of these befuddled axe artists accidentally discovered a pyramid.

1038
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,240
And then if you put the tiny little, like, weasel eye on the top,

1039
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,900
the juices will drip down to the mess below.

1040
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,180
And a priest will make an incantation.

1041
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,920
And then, you know, you know the sauce is right.

1042
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,740
And, you know, you know, work versus slack.

1043
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,080
That's it.

1044
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,660
Here you go again.

1045
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,320
Obsessive compulsive behavior that can't be...

1046
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,780
I still like...

1047
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,000
I still feel like I'm chipping rocks to get laid.

1048
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,140
Well, you actually are.

1049
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,760
Isn't that true, Wee?

1050
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm basically...

1051
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,740
I'm basically still...

1052
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,220
He actually is chipping rocks to get laid, though.

1053
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,760
Isn't that true, Wee?

1054
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,080
I mean, he's got a bunch of rocks laying...

1055
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,780
He has to produce a really nice one.

1056
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,240
To keep a roof over my head.

1057
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,280


1058
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,280


1059
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,280


1060
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,280


1061
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,280


1062
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,260
To keep the respect of the society,

1063
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:54,460
just like my ancestor did for a hundred billion trillion years of toil.

1064
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,680
So Wee actually has to check your rocks...

1065
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,420
But Bob paid!

1066
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,360
Before allowing you to perform quite a...

1067
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,440
Bob died and Bob paid and Bob sold again and again and again

1068
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,220
to justify our sins so that we would no longer have to do that.

1069
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,420
We don't longer have to chip rocks to get laid and get paid.

1070
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,640
Thanks to Bob,

1071
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,120
we can sit back...

1072
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:15,140
Allow him.

1073
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,940
...on our butts and have faith.

1074
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,940
That's all we need.

1075
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,560
Just faith.

1076
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,580
We don't have to work.

1077
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,080
We don't have to toil.

1078
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,220
We just have to...

1079
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,000
We don't have to spin.

1080
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,920
We're not like some flowers.

1081
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,100
We do have to bend.

1082
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,500
Or some...

1083
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,480
Anything like that.

1084
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,620
And friends.

1085
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,600
We're not in a disassociation.

1086
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,420
When was the last time you gave to Bob?

1087
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,340
Disassociation?

1088
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,840
No, we're perfectly well to sit where we are and be well.

1089
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,360
Be well misunderstood.

1090
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,340
That's all fine.

1091
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,100
Well and good.

1092
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,360
And I'll be well damned if I'm going to allow it to continue

1093
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,240
because I'm pretty well shot right now.

1094
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:45,500
I'm sorry.

1095
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,000
No, you're not.

1096
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,700
It's the thyroid problem again.

1097
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,040
It makes the eyeball pop out and then I complain.

1098
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,000
And then while I'm pushing the eyeball back in my head

1099
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,100
and complaining,

1100
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,360
then it's on to another problem.

1101
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,460
Glandular problem.

1102
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,300
But see, at least you're aware of that.

1103
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,540
As long as you're aware of it.

1104
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Now, you know, that's the first step in making it better, you see.

1105
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:04,900
Right.

1106
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,220
I mean, you're conquering it.

1107
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Yes, I'm aware of my glandular problems.

1108
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,540
I'm completely and totally in tune with my glands.

1109
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,020
I owe our rivers and rivulets an ebbing flow.

1110
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,620
I owe my glandular jowls.

1111
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,160
I'm aware of everything I am.

1112
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,160
You know, the plug-in that makes the same noise as that coffee cup costs $170.

1113
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:25,760
Yep.

1114
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,680
And much more in some places.

1115
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,220
City kids don't know how to make that sound effect with the coffee cup.

1116
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,280
They have to use this filter I'm using right now.

1117
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,640
And that's $170.

1118
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,560
And that's a Transvex, isn't it?

1119
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,340
Isn't that a beautiful new Transvex 16,000, which costs the studio a pretty penny.

1120
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,920
That's right.

1121
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,860
Thanks, listener.

1122
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,380
Thank you very much, listener.

1123
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:46,820
Yep.

1124
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,720
I hope you consider your money well spent on that little filter.

1125
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,080
It makes you sound just like Dave talking to a coffee cup.

1126
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,760
Someday we hope to meet you and perhaps even send you a photo of all four of us, three, five, however many we might be at the time,

1127
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,540
hugging the tortoise, you know, banging the weasel, and just doing all the stuff we do to animals.

1128
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,720
I bet people wonder what you look like, Dave.

1129
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,000
I look like one of the animals we bang on.

1130
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,520
I bet those listeners are going, what does that guy look like?

1131
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,680
I'm fantasizing about what Dave looks like.

1132
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,220
I figure he's got real long hair and this gray goatee.

1133
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,220
That's probably what Dave sounds like.

1134
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,200
Stang sounds like he's kind of fat.

1135
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,740
I'm long on scalp.

1136
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,180
I think Stang's a real tall, fat guy.

1137
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,580
He's almost blind.

1138
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,240
I heard that he's blind and he has these visions, and that's where all that stuff comes from.

1139
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,880
Well, the blindness comes from the same place, the same ethereal spring that we all drink from.

1140
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,900
It's the same place.

1141
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,880
It's the same water that's polluting us all.

1142
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,200
It causes ejaculation, premature ejaculation.

1143
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,480
And it's in the water?

1144
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,280
Of course it's in the water.

1145
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:45,280


1146
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,500
I've got my Bob blindfold on.

1147
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,720
Drink it down.

1148
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,040
I'm wearing my Bob blindfold.

1149
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,440
I follow him anywhere when I have that thing on.

1150
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,500
You're blind to what's going on around you?

1151
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,080
By the sound, or by the smoke.

1152
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,680
You follow the smell of the Bob's pipe smoke.

1153
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,240
Isn't that what makes us all secure and safe in the arms and the legs and necks of Bob?

1154
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,480
On the lap, on the bumpy lap of Bob.

1155
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,880
Put that blindfold on.

1156
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,020
Smooth down those bumps.

1157
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,800
Lap of Bob.

1158
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,480
The embarrassing lap.

1159
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,340
The demanding lap of Bob.

1160
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,220
The demented, disturbing lap of Bob.

1161
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,020
The distended, swelling lap of Bob.

1162
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,140
With more bumps than it should have in the wrong places.

1163
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,760
In the groping hands of Bob.

1164
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,640
The suffocating, milky egg of Bob's lap.

1165
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,560
The inappropriately groping hands of our lord, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1166
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,640
Smelly, gypsy-like lap of Bob.

1167
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:41,200
The confused, irritating, won't-quit-saying-something-about-the-lap-of-Bob-Bob-lap-of-Bob.

1168
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,540
Ugh.

1169
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,240
Damn.

1170
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,700
Oh, this music in the background.

1171
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:51,300
The one I want to mention is the swinging love corpses from their famous Bay Jam mixtapes.

1172
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:51,760
It's delicious.

1173
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,420
It is.

1174
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,960
It is quite the, you know, it sounds like these guys were actual musicians or something, you know?

1175
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,120
They were until, you know.

1176
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,400
Oh, Valentine's Day.

1177
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,460
We have a love song.

1178
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:02,880
Valentine's Day.

1179
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,600
And a new band.

1180
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:09,580
This is a band that I'm going to try to get to come to X Day without paying them like we do with almost all bands.

1181
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,260
Just so long as you don't take their secret powers away like you do to most bands.

1182
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,020
Tom.

1183
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:15,460
And Joe.

1184
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,600
Actually, Reverend Toilet Sucks sent me this CD and he said, I bought this from these guys because I thought you should hear it.

1185
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,380
He said that it was his favorite short-duration personal album this month.

1186
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:32,120
And it was these two spaz guys that I guess have been doing spaz music for a long time.

1187
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,440
And it kind of reminded me of Captain Beefheart crossed with Captain and Tennille.

1188
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,320
And they have a love song on there called Tell Me, which I wanted to play.

1189
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,960
Well, you've got time to do it because we need to be told.

1190
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,380
Man, these corpses are so great, though.

1191
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,340
That's Ray Hay on guitar.

1192
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,000
My hands are so icy now.

1193
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:05,140
I've been sitting here in my own urine for the last 45 minutes waiting for a bus or perhaps the MS vehicle to come by for some kind of help.

1194
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,600
And I'm stretched out and he's saying some money, a few dollars.

1195
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,180
If only I could read that.

1196
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,700
Tell me.

1197
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,480
You're the only one that loves me.

1198
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:33,140
Tell me your love will never die.

1199
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,920
Oh, and tell me you're the only one that I could be.

1200
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,200
Tell me.

1201
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,920
You'll never lie.

1202
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,200
Tell me I'm the only one that you need.

1203
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,860
Tell me your needs will never die.

1204
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:13,760
Oh, how to tell me you're the only one that I could be.

1205
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,600
Tell me.

1206
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,380
Tell me.

1207
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,660
You'll never die.

1208
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,680
It was raining from the start.

1209
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,780
But nobody came from out of the rain.

1210
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,100
Tell me.

1211
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,420
Tell me you're the only one.

1212
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,940
that loves me

1213
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,980
And tell me

1214
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,700
your love

1215
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,640
will never die

1216
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,800
Oh how

1217
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,880
tell me

1218
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,340
you're the only one

1219
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,420
that I could be

1220
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,940
And tell me

1221
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,820
you'll never

1222
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,340
lie

1223
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,920
It was

1224
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,400
raining

1225
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,840
from the

1226
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,300
start

1227
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,540
but nobody

1228
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,220
came

1229
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,680
from out of

1230
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
the rain

1231
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,720
And tell me

1232
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,100
you're the only one

1233
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,680
that you need

1234
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,720
And tell me

1235
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,600
your needs will never

1236
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,200
die

1237
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,360
Oh

1238
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,380
tell me

1239
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:42,380


1240
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:42,380


1241
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,280
your love

1242
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,300
will never

1243
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:43,300


1244
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:43,380
Oh how

1245
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,560
tell me

1246
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,180
you're the only

1247
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,000
one that I

1248
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,220
could be

1249
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,560
And tell me

1250
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,540
you'll never

1251
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,140
die

1252
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,080
One more time

1253
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,640
Tell me

1254
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,800
you'll never

1255
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,380
die

1256
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,380
You'll never die

1257
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:12,380


1258
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:12,380


1259
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:12,380


1260
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:12,380


1261
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:12,920
You'll never die

1262
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,960
You'll never die

1263
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,020
Yes, I was saying

1264
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,820
that they do have

1265
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,480
too many chromosomes

1266
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,420
meaning that there

1267
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:17,740
was some

1268
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,680
there was some

1269
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,460
mongolism there

1270
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,880
in the family

1271
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,760
I can smell it

1272
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,040
I'm quite good

1273
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,580
at smelling it

1274
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,040
by the way

1275
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,160
That's Tom and Joe

1276
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,520
and you can

1277
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,140
actually

1278
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:27,980
the only way

1279
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,560
to get

1280
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,720
to get that

1281
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,580
or any information

1282
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,180
about that

1283
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:32,900
would be to email

1284
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,620
Tom

1285
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,960
or Joe

1286
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,680
who actually

1287
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,420
whose real name

1288
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:36,940
is Bob

1289
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,060
or actually

1290
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,760
it may be Ed

1291
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,340
but he goes by

1292
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:39,780
the name Bob

1293
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,320
on email

1294
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,660

00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,300
I don't know where

1324
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,020
Anyway

1325
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,400
every song on this

1326
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,260
is really different

1327
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,000
and they're quite

1328
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,200
a spaz band

1329
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,200
and I was impressed

1330
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,520
I could smell

1331
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,620
their knees wobbling

1332
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,660
and talk about

1333
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,020
some old prom jackets

1334
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,300
with a lot of

1335
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,840
you know

1336
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,140
That album is called

1337
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,660
Yellow Stucco

1338
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:30,500
House

1339
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,720
Chocolate milk

1340
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,540
in those pockets

1341
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,740
smelling like the place

1342
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,040
you know

1343
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,280
You are listening to

1344
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,160
the Subgenius Radio

1345
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,540
Ministry Hour of Slack

1346
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,620
brought to you by

1347
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,860
the Church of the Subgenius

1348
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,560

1349
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,400

www.subgenius.com

1353
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,540
And Subgenius

1354
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,680
does not have an O

1355
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,340
in it

1356
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,480
And then you can also

1357
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:54,580
.hem

1358
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,040
By the way

1359
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,340
the show is archived

1360
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,600
there

1361
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,040
and you can download it

1362
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,320
and it's also archived

1363
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,760
on all the

1364
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,000
many stations

1365
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,660
Many of the many stations

1366
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,740
that play the show

1367
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,900
archive it

1368
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,700
at least for a couple

1369
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,540
of weeks afterwards

1370
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,880
Praise such stations

1371
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,660
as WREK

1372
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:11,640
WREK

1373
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,800
WCSB

1374
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,860
and Cleveland

1375
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,620
Cleveland State University

1376
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,600
Well, well, well

1377
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,720
Isn't that wonderful

1378
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,540
Oh, that's right

1379
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,820
We've got one more song

1380
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,440
This from Dave's

1381
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,980
last performance

1382
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,240
With the Caucasians

1383
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,640
The Caucasians

1384
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,720
at the Beachland

1385
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,200
Bullrushes

1386
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,980
Bullrombo

1387
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,400
The Beachland Bullrushes

1388
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,800
and Moses saved us again

1389
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,660
and took us to the pyramid

1390
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,220
to ever

1391
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,100
I issue it

1392
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,640
I think actually

1393
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,640
this is Mr. Sister

1394
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,380
in the background

1395
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,020
singing

1396
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,420
It sounds like

1397
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,600
from back in the old days

1398
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,840
the Volksreich

1399
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,440
when we'd all get together

1400
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,700
and have a few spears

1401
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,240
throw back the elements

1402
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,060
bark to the skies

1403
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,620
to heaven

1404
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,520
to the Asgard

1405
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,560
Valhalla

1406
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,140
it's

1407
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,320
It's on the floor

1408
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,500
talking to his mom and dad

1409
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,980
saying should I turn on the recordist

1410
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,660
or pick an old stone for that

1411
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,480
I'm not sure

1412
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,280
what the hell's going on

1413
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,220
I'm not sure

1414
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:22,980
I don't know what's going on

1415
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,380
I'm not sure

1416
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:27,880
I don't know

1417
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:27,880


1418
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,240
I don't know

1419
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,280
The person on the phone

1420
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,280
is having a chat with God

1421
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,500
The person's gonna save the world

1422
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,280
and maybe just

1423
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,680
have some fun

1424
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,780
The world outside the world

1425
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,840
is trembling down in a pile of shit

1426
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,740
The sound of a Russian star

1427
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,940
facing destitution

1428
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,060
from a presidency crowned with

1429
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,480
the

1430
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:54,900
the

1431
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,500
the

1432
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,320
the

1433
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,320
the

1434
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,160
I don't feel like drinking rubber this year

1435
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,020
I don't feel like drinking rubber this year

1436
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,260
I don't feel like drinking rubber this year

1437
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,780
that y'all

1438
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:22,340
I don't feel like drinking rubber this year

1439
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


1440
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


1441
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,340


1442
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,060
I'm talking liberty

1443
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,160
I'm talking liberty

1444
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,580
but you and I ain't free

1445
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,340
But you and I ain't free

1446
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,920
機기기기这个

1447
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,040

1448
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:09,820
I don't know.

1449
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,660
I don't know.

1450
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,560
I don't know.

1451
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:10,800
I don't know.

00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,500
I don't know.

1455
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,860
I don't know.

1456
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,420
I don't know.

1457
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,960
I don't know.

00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,540
I don't know.

1459
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,620
I don't know.

1460
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,400
I don't know.

1461
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm hard for social corporate culture cattle in Washington.

1462
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,480
This comes just days after six Canadian cattle announced they were merging.

1463
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,820
The move came as sporadic PR's Peter Koch continued.

1464
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,260
Our taxpayers are not going to be able to get their money back.

1465
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,060
Our citizens and constituents and their families are going to be ignorant and offensive.

1466
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,580
The National Transportation Safety Board says this continued PR News.

1467
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:57,020
As soon as you turn your back, everything in the universe snaps itself inside out with a hideous sucking motion.

1468
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:07,180
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible is because it is only through the world that you know the concept of impossibility.

1469
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
You have been led to believe that it is impossible.

1470
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,880
Everyone feels he or she may be the only living consciousness.

1471
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,780
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.

1472
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,120
I don't know.

1473
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,140
I don't know.

00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,180

00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:25,520
I don't know.

00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:26,780
I don't know.

I don't know.

1480
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,380
I don't know.

1481
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,480
I don't know.

1482
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,700

Thank you.
