1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Uh, hey, what's going on here?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,920
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,100
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,520
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,880
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,260
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,540
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,560
They're going to...

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,100
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,540
in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,760
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying,

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,700
receipt-in-the-pocket, paid-in-full-to-the-church subgenii,

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,360
The rest of them? It's a tough world, Jack.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,360
The crowd, the slack, the bar, the bar down in the saucer road

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,080
Round, round the slack flow Bob, the bar down in the saucer road

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,900
And in that air, there was a ship, a rare ship

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,940
An exeship with a ship in the air

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,860
And the air threw its smoke at the spook from theessen prop

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,560
And the prop, and the pipe, and the pipe, and the grit in the grit in the bob

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Bob down in the saucer road

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,420
Round, round the slack flow Bob, the bar down in the saucer road

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,320
Round, round the slack flow Bob, the bar down in the saucer road

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,760
And in that ship there was a bob, a rare bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:39,220
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air and the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop and the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin and the grin and the bob.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,220
Bob down in the saucer roll.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,200
Gordon, everything's going fine.

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,020
No, we're not recording.

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,780
Are we on?

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,400
Is this thing on?

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,920
Yeah.

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,800
All right.

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,480
We wanted to start a new elevated hour of slack, right?

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,600
We're going to be high-minded.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
15 minutes of collage stuff or songs.

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,600
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,940
Marshall, you have earned this.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,080
What about this reputed Jesus Starfleet that was supposed to have shown up?

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,520
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

40
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,680
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
What a space ovation.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,300
Now let's feel another.

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,980
Now in celebration of this great occasion, we have planned a lunar party.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,620
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,620
Bob?

46
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,140
What if there is a form of life in space?

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,840
Not on some planet, but just drifting.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,820
Not life as we know it.

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,720
With intelligence, yes, but pure energy with no organic structure.

50
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,380
Invisible.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,040
Invisible?

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,640
Now the rocket passed through its path.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,780
It entered the rocket.

54
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,060
It found living specimens of our form of life.

55
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,480
Cell organisms.

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Humans.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,000
Exactly.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,780
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures,

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,580
what a way to end it.

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,580


61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,580


62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,260
What if you invade the Earth?

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,680
Now look, sir, I'm not over-intelligent, but...

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,420
You saw the film, you know what happened.

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,780
Only God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
Something got into that rocket.

67
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,320
And it's found other forms of life.

68
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,620
The cactus.

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,220
The cactus?

70
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,340
You mean Kuruza?

71
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,000
The cactus.

72
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,660
He's now in the shell of a man being transformed.

73
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,680
If one of these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation,

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,700
there could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal,

75
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,040
with the ability to destroy.

76
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,000
And possess?

77
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,600
And multiply.

78
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,660
An alien cannot invade a dead man.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
We're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,640
We're all extraterrestrials

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,260
on a cycle that is ancestral.

82
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,440
We're off to see the wizards

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,940
on a paradise among the stars.

84
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,560
We're all extraterrestrials

85
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,140
on a mission that is ancestral.

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,320
We're off to see the wizards

87
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,060
on a world among the stars.

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,600
You know that scientists have said

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,380
that the Earth will soon be dead.

90
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,440
Philosophers have told us long ago

91
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,360
you'd think by now we'd all be in the North.

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,560
Next year, we'll be in the North.

93
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,560


94
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,560


95
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,560


96
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,560


97
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,780
I want more.

98
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,460
More flirting.

99
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,700
More time off.

100
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,180
Yeah!

101
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,740
More money.

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,580
Yeah!

103
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,240
We must get off.

104
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,260
We must get off.

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,400
We must get off.

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,460
We must get off.

107
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,480
We must get off.

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,480
We must get off.

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,420
We must get off.

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,420
We must get off.

111
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,920
We must get off.

112
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,960
Now, in some shows,

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,140
they have half an hour of collage

114
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,380
before they start talking,

115
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,440
so they can go out on the balcony

116
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,700
and smoke joints of marijuana!

117
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,900
Not us anymore,

118
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,380
if that's what you're talking about.

119
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,520
We're not allowed to do that anymore.

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,660
Are ya?

121
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,100
Back in our salad days, though,

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
when things were green and growing

123
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,220
and the sap was budding,

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,620
and the devil took the hindmost,

125
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,320
because life was hot and merry,

126
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,200
Yes, my hindmost.

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,040
Yes, we were able to go out

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,600
and get endlessly stoned on the balcony.

129
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,540
Oh, there we start the hour of slack up again.

130
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,100
Yep, right at the moment when...

131
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
...the generator goes.

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,020
Internal combustion.

133
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,340
Right at the moment that they start driving by,

134
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
the hour of slack begins.

135
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Yes, the internal combustion engine

136
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,640
circling the Earth with its petroleum products

137
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,940
and its fumes.

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,460
So we've officially started now?

139
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,700
Yes, we have.

141
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,060
The exciting hour of slack begins.

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,800
I just wanted to pull down.

143
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
I just wanted to pull it down

144
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
to make it lowbrow the second that we started.

145
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,060
It's a pity Philo wasn't here,

146
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,940
because he'd be in ecstasy

147
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,560
if these sound effects...

148
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,160
I have a little bug around.

149
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,820
Sound effects are terrible.

150
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,140
Well, why don't you get it set up,

151
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,280
and then we'll have a symphony of sound effects.

152
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,820
We have, like, springs and, like,

153
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,920
slide whistles and stuff?

154
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,920
I think if you're in a room,

155
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,840
if you go into toy stores,

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,180
you can buy these little...

157
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,200
Ha ha ha ha ha!

158
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,080
...

159
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,660
Good Lord, look at Stang.

160
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Oh, God, he's going into orbit.

161
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,680
Yes, somebody get a bucket of water.

162
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,720
Oh, I feel like a new man!

163
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,940
Well, you should after that.

164
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,920
And so, you see, we have unusual methods

165
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,860
of refreshment here at X-Day.

166
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,080
Denied to the world outside,

167
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,040
they know nothing of our ability

168
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,940
to divert ourselves with special esoterica.

169
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,900
Ah, if they only knew,

170
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,760
then all of those ignorant pinks

171
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,300
would be clawing at the gate,

172
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,980
trying to get in at the last moment

173
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,960
to become one of us.

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,140
They were. They were trying yesterday.

175
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,120
You guys missed it.

176
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,140
We beat them all back.

177
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,160
Is that what that...

178
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,100
We demoralized them.

179
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,520
I wondered about those claw marks.

180
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,940
The flame thrower up there,

181
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,800
is that what that was about?

182
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,480
Yeah, that's where the scorching came from.

183
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, the scorching by Stephen King,

184
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,580
America's most popular writer.

185
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,620
He's a national treasure.

186
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,380
Yeah.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,300
So that happened while I wasn't following that.

188
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,080
Oh, I was still en route, of course,

189
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,220
to X-Day at that time.

190
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,580
Driving...

191
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, I cleared out the path,

192
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,060
and then, who was it,

193
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,040
Fightsy Taj cleaned up the rest,

194
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,520
and then, well, not all of them,

195
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,980
and then Suds and Stick took it from there.

196
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,880
They sweeped out the rest

197
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,720
with the audio techniques.

198
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,520
Then mopping up started.

199
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Of the bad sounds.

200
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,380
Yes.

201
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,680
Hey, it's time for more radio comedy.

202
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,820
That's how you know it's funny.

203
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,560
Yes, we'll put all these sound effects in post.

204
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,420
Squeaky penis.

205
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,220
Get it right in the mic, right in the mic.

206
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,800
Oh, there we go.

207
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,300
Another radio sound effect.

208
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,340
Radio.

209
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,600
I wish that the audience could see

210
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,220
the thing that is squeaky,

211
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,300
because it is...

212
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,580
Well, it's a...

213
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:57,980
It's a...

214
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,600
It's like a dildo, basically.

215
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,020
It's the shape of the masculine lance,

216
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,100
but with a funny little crazy face

217
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,740
on the head of it.

218
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,880
You mean they don't all have that?

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,520
And his mouth open and smiling like...

220
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,580
I thought everybody was like that.

221
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,220
Well, okay.

222
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
There you go.

223
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,540
Okay.

224
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,240
Well, what do I think of next?

225
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,540
Not to be confused with Reverend Dildonics,

226
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,960
who is new to Ag State this year.

227
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,820
Praise Reverend Dildonics on the nose.

228
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,300
Praise Reverend Dildonics.

229
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,740
He's here listening to the hour of Slack.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Where are you?

231
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,320
Unlike everyone else who knows

232
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,980
that they can download it later.

233
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
He's stuck working a shift at the Slack Jack.

234
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,700
Are you about to take some special medicine here?

235
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,300
Oh, yeah, actually.

236
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,240
Oh, well, how about that?

237
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,820
Yes, you see, we are augmented,

238
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,340
not only electronically,

239
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,500
but biophysically here at Ag State.

240
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,180
This is the time when Ag State is coming.

241
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,280
You just let your yard go.

242
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't even mow your yard.

243
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,620
Don't pay off those credit cards.

244
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,020
I already wasn't.

245
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,840
Eat canned chili all day long if you want to.

246
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,620
I already did.

247
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,840
All the things that you normally won't do

248
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,380
because of your health.

249
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,820
Wait, did you say canned chili?

250
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,900
That was your...

251
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,180
You've made that item a staple of your diet.

252
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,440
I can't stop.

253
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,680
Someone should take it away from me.

254
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,960
I just won't stop doing it.

255
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,340
I'm going to throw it over there.

256
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Oh, you're doing fine.

257
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:30,780
No, no.

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,340
I don't want to be responsible.

259
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,960
But it puts Philo's noisemakers to shame

260
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,260
because he's got these electronic flatulators

261
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,780
that don't sound nearly as good

262
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,360
as the rubber analog that she was using.

263
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,640
Oh, now we'll hear again the...

264
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,540
Actually, I think it's worse to give it over to Stang.

265
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,180
...over the lake.

266
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,460
The terrible elephant man.

267
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm so mature.

268
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,500
No, back, Tantor.

269
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:02,980
Back.

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No, Tantor.

271
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,380
Praise Bob.

272
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,280
Oh, okay.

273
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,920
There you go.

274
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
Also in the news...

275
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,540
The microphone's attacking me.

276
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,040
We understand there's going to be a change in the weather.

277
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,620
And instead of thunderstorms, hailstorms, and rainstorms,

278
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:16,620


279
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,760
we will be gently caressed by the flaring beams

280
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,840
of the sun's effulgent rays.

281
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,820
Yep.

282
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
There was a tornado last night,

283
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,640
but it didn't come here because it was scared of us.

284
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,980
Was there really a tornado?

285
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,440
There was.

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,920
There was one south of us last night, actually.

287
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,820
There was a tornado.

288
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,440
Cool.

289
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,800
It formed and then it got close to Wisteria,

290
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,280
and then it was like,

291
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,280
oh, no, I don't want to go over there

292
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,020
with those spooky subgeniuses.

293
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,620
I don't have $35.

294
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,460
I can't go in there.

295
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm going to destroy that place.

296
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,720
It swept up the tiny inbred hamlets of Spinkville and Spudville.

297
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
And the thing is,

298
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,240
a tornado requires a flat place to race across

299
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,220
and a bunch of trailers to toss.

300
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,200
And so it just avoided the Wisteria refuge.

301
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,500
Is it...

302
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,460
Are they really attracted to trailers,

303
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,000
or is it that they hate poe-buckers?

304
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,340
Well, one or the other.

305
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,660
And the poor.

306
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,960
I should say, that's kind of an offensive thing to say.

307
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,620
Many of us may live in trailers and trailer courts.

308
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,300
It's quite true.

309
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,200
I never denied it.

310
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,560
In fact, Reverend Heathen does.

311
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,080
But...

312
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,580
More than I do.

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,880
So we shouldn't always associate trailer courts with poe-buckers.

314
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,260
Nor should we always look down our noses at the humble poe-bucker.

315
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,200
In Humboldt County, California.

316
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
Yeah, over there in Harrisonville.

317
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,700
Humble and dilligous.

318
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,840
Because they have the best dough.

319
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,980
Whole town full of them.

320
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,320
Right.

321
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,400
So, we...

322
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,500
But let me put it this way.

323
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,420
That's why I'm not moving to small town Texas.

324
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,580
Hmm.

325
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,240
But I thought you were considering it.

326
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,800
No.

327
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,740
Well, I move there for two weeks every now and then.

328
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,920
But then my dad and I start fighting, so we move on.

329
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,600
Oh, well.

330
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,260
You know, there's only one roaster to rule the roost here.

331
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,380
At Stang Ranch in Stangville.

332
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,840
This music is so soothing.

333
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,000
Stangville, home of the Creationist Museum.

334
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,660
Is this Monster Hunter music?

335
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,780
Yes, it is.

336
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,300
It's lovely.

337
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah, it's the official soundtrack album from Monster Hunter.

338
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,780
Monster Hunter 3.

339
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,540
Monster Hunter.

340
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:25,500
Believe it or not, that game is so huge in Japan that every year a big orchestra does

341
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,580
music from Monster Hunter.

342
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,720
The Monster Hunter Orchestra.

343
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,060
Actually, a lot of this was recorded in Prague by the Budapest...or the something something

344
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,980
European Fancy Pants Orchestra.

345
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,320
Well, we are a global village, I guess.

346
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,680
There's no doubt about that.

347
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,880
It's a huge fad in that land.

348
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,200
I guess.

349
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,760
A masterful beer after work.

350
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,380
Yeah.

351
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,020
Now that's a song I can get behind.

352
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,580
B-E-E-R?

353
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,800
Yes.

354
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,080
B-E-E-R.

355
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,560
Not B-I-E-R.

356
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,160
B-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-R.

357
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,600
Oh, a masterful beer after work.

358
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,160
Well, we don't got no beer here.

359
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,580
What?

360
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,140
What?

361
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,480
What?

362
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,800
What?

363
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:05,900
What?

364
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,760
We don't have no beer?

365
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,280
Where'd the beer go?

366
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,100
Not right here.

367
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,780
Not under the table right here.

368
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,640
Oh, really?

369
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,160
No.

370
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,000
There you go.

371
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,420
No.

372
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,040
No.

373
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,540
I need a beer and a really long crazy straw.

374
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:18,920
Crazy.

375
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,060
Or one of those beer hats.

376
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,760
It's goofy.

377
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,720
It's wacky.

378
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,300
It's wild.

379
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,880
It's wicked.

380
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
With the crazy straws on it.

381
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,480
See, Pobucker's come up with some good ideas.

382
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,000
They do.

383
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,620
That's a great idea.

384
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,280
That's efficient.

385
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,700
Yeah, but isn't that hat in the sun warming the beer?

386
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,480
Yeah.

387
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,400
So, you see, that's the flaw in Pobucker's ointment.

388
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,920
It's still beer.

389
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,960
It's not cold and frosty as it should be.

390
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,680
Well, just pretend you're English and drink your beer warm.

391
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,500
Well, there.

392
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,120
That neatly solves the problem.

393
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,380
This banner telling me to smile feels very threatening.

394
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,660
Smile, darn you, smile.

395
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
It's making me want to scowl.

396
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
What banner tells you to...

397
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,640
Oh, that banner tells you to smile, doesn't it?

398
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,540
Yes, I saw your impassioned rant about the glass being half full and...

399
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,300
and so forth.

400
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,360
That was a sizzling put-down of that one.

401
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,380
Which one, who?

402
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,380
A baby bear printed a thing online about how not only is your glass not half full,

403
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,760
but I will come to your house and utterly destroy you.

404
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,660
I don't know if that was mine.

405
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,540
I don't think that was mine.

406
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,520
I'm trying to remember it.

407
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm actually kind of losing track of my rants now.

408
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,460
I can't remember them.

409
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,140
Oh, perhaps it was a post from someone else that you forwarded.

410
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,040
That's possible.

411
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,280
I'm sorry, I'm just out of glib.

412
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,180
I've run out of words.

413
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,820
The Church of the Subgenius is a no-brainer, don't you think?

414
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,360
That line came from Dennis Murphy, founder of the cult called the Living Bull Cult.

415
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,380
That's a pretty cool cult.

416
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,640
Dennis Murphy is this old hippie who...

417
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,520
is always at Starwood and those pagan things.

418
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,860
He's a pagan dude.

419
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,700
But he started his own cult called the Cult of the Living Bull.

420
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,880
And the way it works is he'll take you out in the woods or into the hot tub or whatever

421
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,800
and start getting you to talk about everything that ticks you off in life.

422
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,300
And I mean, it goes into great detail.

423
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,100
And he starts...

424
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,840
He'll remind you, you know, what about your job?

425
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,480
What about the...

426
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:41,780
Yeah.

427
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,400
The can of chili that you don't like?

428
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,780
What about that rotten chili?

429
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,700
You paid for it.

430
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,120
What about, you know, your health infirmities?

431
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,240
Don't get me started on those.

432
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,500
Those damn Democrats with the cubic cubes and so forth.

433
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,560
And at the climax of it, when he's actually got you kind of worked up,

434
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,740
that's when you and everybody else screams,

435
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,600
BULL!

436
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,300
And you kind of scream the bull out of your life.

437
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,600
BULLSHEET.

438
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,900
You'd have to have been there.

439
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,320
It's better when Dennis tells it.

440
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't know what to say.

441
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,180
Now, Stang, you know a cow isn't a bull.

442
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,340
If he was cool, he'd be here at X-Day.

443
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,040
This table is making some interesting sound effects with the flapping.

444
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,380
Yes, that rustling sound that the table makes is a specialty of this broadcast.

445
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,080
Like the rustling of the wings of the fella in the bright nightgown.

446
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Okay, okay.

447
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Where are we?

448
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,860
What happened?

449
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:49,100
We're at Wisteria, a campground community inside Kevin's Cafe at Tarzan's radio station

450
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,920
with these Radio Shack mics and mixers and little beat-up Sony headphones

451
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,640
and an audience of at least eight people.

452
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,440
I guess they're the ones who can't download it later.

453
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,640
Amazing.

454
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,680
Incredible.

455
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,960
Unbelievable.

456
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,860
Fantastic.

457
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,960
Preposterous.

458
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,840
And?

459
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,900
And why are we here?

460
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,440
Why?

461
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,360
To praise Bob.

462
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,900
But I think we already did that for the last thirty minutes.

463
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,960
Rolling Stone says,

464
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,520
A masterpiece for those who can still laugh at the fact that nothing is funny anymore.

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,180
I think that quote was actually about Book of the Septuagint.

466
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,300
Jay Kinney says,

467
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,080
Genuine wisdom in the guise of utter bullshit.

468
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,160
What?

469
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,080
And Mark Mothersbaugh says,

470
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,780
Bob is an enema for a constipated society.

471
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,380
That's true.

472
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,340
He said that on Showtime television.

473
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes.

474
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,380
And he meant J.R. Bob Dobbs.

475
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,500
Argumentum ad veracundiam.

476
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,480
Bob is here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.

477
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,540
That's right.

478
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,980
You can't get it loose unless you get a boost.

479
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,860
The boost that you get from Looseners.

480
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,620
Looseners.

481
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,740
The all-weather breakfast.

482
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,400
Uh, so we're...

483
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,720
Yeah, so yeah, they were famous subgeniuses back in the olden days.

484
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,300
Of course, no one even knows who they are now, because they were famous in the olden days.

485
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,340
If we have any new famous rock stars, I wouldn't know.

486
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,920
I wouldn't know them by their human famous name, because I honestly don't follow that stuff.

487
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,640
Well, get with the program.

488
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,220
If the girl we know, Reverend Funny Name, is really...

489
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,440
Name, who's the biggest singer in the world right now?

490
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,800
Uh, Taylor Swift.

491
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,380
Okay, yeah, whatever.

492
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,480
That, him.

493
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,780
That's a girl.

494
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,660
Yeah, okay, sure.

495
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,620
I did that on purpose.

496
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,600
I knew Taylor Swift was a girl.

497
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
But that's all I know.

498
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,600
Not even a real Swift.

499
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,820
All right.

500
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,340
I'm going to read something about, uh, She Defied Apple.

501
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,680
I saw a headline about that and proceeded not to read it.

502
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,820
Whose mortal taste brought death into the world and all our woe with loss of Eden.

503
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,020
Actually, The Onion did an article about people like me who are so snarkily cool.

504
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Oh, Madonna?

505
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I've never even heard of her.

506
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,660
That's not on my radar.

507
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
But, you know...

508
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,260
The problem is, I really don't know about most of the things.

509
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,660
And then I discovered a room full of subgeniuses talking about hipsters.

510
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,880
Hipsters?

511
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,780
They're such posers.

512
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,420
How do you think they look to me?

513
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,400
These people calling everybody else hipsters, they're all covered with tattoos.

514
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,960
And they go shave their head, bald head, and look like circus strong men.

515
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,040
Why, that's what I call a hipster.

516
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,980
Well, now, just calm down and take your blood pressure pill, Stang.

517
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,000
It's the hour of slug time.

518
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,740
Funny.

519
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,520
Okay, that's funny.

520
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,920
Yeah, we're done.

521
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,340
Now the monster.

522
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,080
Over that little episode.

523
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,640
No more.

524
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


525
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


526
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


527
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


528
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


529
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


530
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


531
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


532
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


533
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


534
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


535
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


536
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


537
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


538
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


540
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,080
No more joy.

541
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,580
Yes, a time for melancholy.

542
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,200
Here comes old Sequa.

543
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Whose saintly features are too bright to get the human sense of sight.

544
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,760
Oh, God.

545
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:47,780
Oh, no.

546
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
I feel something coming up under us in the water.

547
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,580
Wait, there's something hard.

548
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
It brushed against my leg.

549
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,240
Wait, it's rising.

550
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,640
It's like an island.

551
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,840
It's the size of an island.

552
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,740
It's a gigantic turtle.

553
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,120
It may be that his shell is thick.

554
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,740
He seems asleep.

555
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,640
But he's not.

556
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


557
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


558
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


559
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


560
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


561
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


562
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


563
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:06,640


564
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,920
But he is quick and floats now in the sea with guile.

565
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,100
Am I the one on the, is that me being about to be eaten by old Sequa on the pamphlet for

566
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,460
this year?

567
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,200
I was wondering that myself.

568
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,060
It vaguely resembles me with long hair like I had last year.

569
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,460
You can't look closely under ultra magnification to see?

570
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I looked at it with my eyeballs as close as they would allow and it just, I can't tell.

571
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,760
But Stang, I sent you the large size version of that image.

572
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,120
Right.

573
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,200
And it was large enough to print about that big on it.

574
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,900
No, no.

575
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,740
The image of swimming with old Sequa is a separate image which I separately sent you

576
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,640
under separate cover.

577
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,780
I don't want to be eaten by old Sequa.

578
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,500
Well, you won't be because it only happens to those who are insufficiently respectful

579
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,560
of his domain.

580
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,640
Like fence jumpers?

581
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:01,980
Wow.

582
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,100
I heard a couple of subgeniuses jump that fence and make it look like they're going

583
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,100


584
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,100


585
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,100


586
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,100


587
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,100


588
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,400
swimming in the pond even though it's closed this morning.

589
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,540
Well, I hope they open it up soon because, oh it is?

590
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,380
There, see?

591
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,340
You merely need to wish something and it happens.

592
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,360
You can now go down there and baptize yourself.

593
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,600
Now I've seen...

594
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,760
You can yetitize yourself.

595
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,680
I've seen actually a majority of the subgeniuses who come down there to the baptism, they just

596
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,440
frog watch.

597
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,480
They won't get in that water.

598
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,160
They don't know what they're missing.

599
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,080
They walk up there and take one look and they're so fascinated.

600
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,080


601
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,840
They're like, oh, there's a water spider.

602
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,020
Oh my God.

603
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,540
Whoa.

604
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,320
It's perfect for those yetis that are the hirsute deficient yetis.

605
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,640
They can go into the pond and come out with a brand new coat.

606
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,300
Looks just as natural as if you were born with it.

607
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,680
Actually, that didn't happen this morning because the rain had pelted all that beard

608
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,060
of walnut oil or whatever it is away from the surface.

609
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,860
It's true.

610
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,660
The pond has this walnut oil on it.

611
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,540
It's true.

612
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,640
It's true.

613
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,180
And if you look much from it right, you look like you're covered with the fine downy fur.

614
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,200
Yes.

615
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,980
There's a great closeup of Susie the floozy's breast stitches looking just as if they were

616
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,600
gorilla tits or something.

617
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,440
They look like they have hair on them.

618
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,180
So friends, if you get in that pond and come...

619
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:33,260
If you get in the pond bald and shaved and get out hairy, then don't be afraid.

620
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,340
Yes, don't be afraid.

621
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,340
Further indignities are to come.

622
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,560
Towing a gigantic pyramid on the back of the truck.

623
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
Who just went by?

624
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,720
Lord Ferg.

625
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,640
Oh, all right.

626
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,220
There you go.

627
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,980
He has to bring his kingdom with him.

628
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,740
Apparently.

629
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,340
I guess a pyramid is really a monument.

630
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,120
Just in case he dies out here, he needs to be able to be in tune.

631
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,160
When we do these hours of slack on location here, we occasionally...

632
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,240
I'm sorry.

633
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,240


634
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,240


635
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,640
I'm sorry.

636
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,960
...hear the truck's trundling by.

637
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,180
Those are no sound effects, ladies and gentlemen.

638
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,260
The school buses full of subgeniuses are brought in.

639
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,120
We do.

640
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,320
They're not all these paying subgeniuses.

641
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,240
We hire people to cheer and...

642
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,280
Just like Donald Trump.

643
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,100
Yeah, right.

644
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,440
We hire audience collectors to come in and work it out.

645
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,940
Just add the cheering in post.

646
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,480
That's the best way.

647
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,780
I like adding these clinking sword effect sounds when we pretend we're sword fighting

648
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,660
and everything else.

649
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,200
It's actually very somnolent.

650
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,080
Nobody moves.

651
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,260
Everyone is sort of becoming part of the chair, sinking down, sinking into it.

652
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,340
Is this an audience or an oil painting?

653
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,620
Actually, I've often spoken of my late friend Pedro.

654
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,580
When you went to his house, the chair, you couldn't tell where the chair stopped and

655
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,600
the floor began.

656
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,240
The chair into which he was sinking over the years was also sinking into the floor.

657
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,640
It was a little bit of a struggle.

658
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,640


659
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,260
And really, you couldn't tell where the one...

660
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,040
The first time I saw photographs of Pedro's house, it wasn't explained to me what I was

661
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,620
looking at.

662
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,780
And I thought it was a haunted house, an abandoned ruins.

663
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,140
It very much looks like a haunted house.

664
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,900
Because no one could live among that much, that many spider webs.

665
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,980
Well, that's a different thing.

666
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,100
It was like a movie set.

667
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,180
The spiders, you come in the outer room, right above your head, the spiders started and they

668
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,160
went all the way up to the ceiling, which was 14 feet high.

669
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,440
You couldn't see the corners of the walls at all.

670
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:33,660
No.

671
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,760
You just saw a huge...

672
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,540
It was near the walls of spider webs.

673
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,960
A huge mass of webs.

674
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,340
And I saw a picture of that chair and I thought, God, who could ever...

675
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:49,380
And it was like cigarette butts reaching up to the top of the ashtray on a stand.

676
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,380
Pedro sat there, God bless him.

677
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,700
Anyway, the spiders, you could look up and see their little eyes glittering.

678
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,260
So it wasn't all dead spiders and old spider webs.

679
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,140
And I asked Pedro once, I said...

680
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,640
But...

681
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,300
Man, don't the spiders ever drop down on you out of there when you're going by?

682
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,020
And he said, oh yeah, sure, they drop down on you.

683
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,920
So...

684
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,960
That's it.

685
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,000
What was his deal?

686
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,860
He just wanted to live naturally?

687
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:12,880
They just do?

688
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,100
Okay.

689
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,620
He believed in laissez-faire, live and let live.

690
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,880
That was his philosophy.

691
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:25,100
And he never got angry, even though his whole reason for existing was smoking dope and telling

692
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,140
people the right way to smoke dope.

693
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,540
There's a right way and a wrong way.

694
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,620
Now, when you start to think about it, you start to think about the fact that you're

695
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:30,620


696
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:30,860
a fan.

697
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,400
When you start, you take little tiny puffs, little tiny puffs and then it burns evenly

698
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,840
all the way down, but if you go...

699
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,500
And pull on it, then you get a run and it ruins the joint.

700
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
He's telling this to Michael Peppy.

701
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,740
And Michael Peppy is not listening going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, and then takes the joint

702
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,820
and pulls on it and immediately creates...

703
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,020
Just snorts the whole thing.

704
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,900
...a huge run down the side.

705
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,020
You don't think it would make anyone angry, but not Pedro, he said, now, there you see,

706
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,620
you got made a run down the side, just like I said and it ruined the joint.

707
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,600
I've seen this scene.

708
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:00,600


709
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,300
whole thing enacted.

710
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,180
He's like the Aunt Bertha

711
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,400
pot smoking.

712
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,100
Yeah,

713
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,680
we should

714
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,280
have another moment of sound effects

715
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,440
for Pedro, who died unexpectedly.

716
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,260
Yes,

717
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,520
Pedro died in the service

718
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,360
of what he believed.

719
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,420
Pedro was where you got your

720
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,920
frappy. That's true.

721
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm still smoking

722
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,320
dead Pedro's stash,

723
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,340
which itself is dying

724
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,200
not a very wholesome setup.

725
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,320
Anyway, that's

726
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
just the way history works out.

727
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,480
You know,

728
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,920
there is a progression

729
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,360
from one state to another.

730
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,300
What, from alive to dead?

731
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,380
I've noticed that happening a lot lately.

732
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,300
Yes, there's

733
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,220
a lot of that going around.

734
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,120
Ah, but subgeniuses pass on to

735
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,480
another better world.

736
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,480
We're all hoping to do it.

737
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,160
It's called the grave.

738
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,260
That was

739
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,760
depressing.

740
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,420
That was. I thought we were going to get

741
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,500
cremated.

742
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,940
Now we have to be in the grave with those

743
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,140
ugly worms and skeletons and things.

744
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,660
I thought we were going to be

745
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,440
turned into a neat pile of

746
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
drifting ashes.

747
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,600
No, of course I was just trying to scare you, Dr. Howell.

748
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,800
Everything you ever

749
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,200
dreamed of will come true

750
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,020
and everything will be wonderful

751
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,480
and happy. So why don't you go ahead

752
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,380
and kill yourself now if you really

753
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,200
believe that. But all this work,

754
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,960
has to be done.

755
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,380
As soon as the bills stack up,

756
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,620
if you really believe there is a heaven,

757
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,000
you just kill yourself just to avoid paying the bill.

758
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,960
I don't see that many

759
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,940
people getting out of their bills that way.

760
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,120
I like not just paying back

761
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,480
what the checkers say.

762
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,420
Henry IV, part one.

763
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,600
I guess so.

764
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,860
I mean, surely there's a room for

765
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,100
various economic theories.

766
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,020
You don't get to the subgenius

767
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,900
heaven unless you buy that membership

768
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,000
pack from J.R. Bob.

769
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,940
I know that.

770
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,180
Well, that is true.

771
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,680
Then you just end up in the grave or the crematorium.

772
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes.

773
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,100
But for only $35, you can live forever

774
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,600
or do anything you want forever

775
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,740
once X-Day comes.

776
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,300
If you can make it to X-Day.

777
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
That's why you can't kill yourself

778
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,300
no matter how sad you get

779
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,680
and no matter how butthurt somebody makes you

780
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,340
on the internet. You can't kill yourself

781
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,180
because then you might miss your chance for X-Day.

782
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,460
It could happen tomorrow. X-Day could be today.

783
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,120
We don't know.

784
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,860
We don't know.

785
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,280
We don't know, but we have a better idea

786
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,000
than most people.

787
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,040
X-Day probably didn't already happen.

788
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,360
Yes. Probably.

789
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,240
Did we get left behind?

790
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,360
Some people like to say...

791
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,540
No.

792
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,100
Not me.

793
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,040
Nobody got left behind.

794
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,800
I've got two right behinds.

795
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,440
Well, Voltaire was born that way.

796
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,300
That's greedy.

797
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
There was that old lady

798
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,720
with only one buttock

799
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
in Voltaire's Candide

800
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,900
who'd had a hard life.

801
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,360
That book is so good.

802
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,060
She lost one of her cheeks.

803
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,780
Yeah, well...

804
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,100
But of course,

805
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,360
you could be left behind

806
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,940
if you simply fail at the last moment

807
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,840
to observe the proper procedures.

808
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,480
I cried because the sex goddesses

809
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,400
have 23 vaginas

810
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,660
and I only had 22 dicks.

811
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,120
And then I met a man

812
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,440
who had 24 dicks.

813
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,620
Boy, you're just bringing

814
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,780
everybody down today.

815
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,920
X-Day, where's your cheerfulness?

816
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,460
Everyone looks to you

817
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,480
for some kind of

818
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
inspirational statement.

819
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,780
That's right.

820
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,900
Oh, oh, oh no.

821
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm slacking in my duties.

822
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,140
Oh wait, slack is fine then.

823
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,480
You slacked in your duties?

824
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,520
I am the first subgenius morale officer.

825
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,500
Please note that I am saluting

826
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,220
on the radio, so...

827
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,720
Alright, look, she really is, ladies and gentlemen.

828
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,860
I can tell you she's saluting.

829
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,840
That really did happen.

830
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,860
I need to deputize.

831
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,280
I need to deputize people

832
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,900
because it's really hard

833
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,200
to be the cheery one all the time.

834
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,240
Well, we don't have to be

835
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,840
so unrelentingly negative.

836
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,940
That was my point.

837
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
We should be cheerful ourselves.

838
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,560
Yes, dang, help me out, man.

839
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,600
Cheerful Charlie here.

840
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,260
Come on, man.

841
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,440
He's got a million laughs.

842
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
You're just dead.

843
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,860
Now, none of that.

844
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,400
You know it's all rainbows.

845
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,640
Trying to cheer up subgeniuses is hard.

846
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,300
Subgeniuses are so cranky all the time.

847
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,780
You get a halo.

848
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,440
As soon as you get there,

849
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,940
they issue you one

850
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,340
and you get your wings,

851
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,180
you get your...

852
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,320
Palm branch, all that stuff.

853
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,760
Well, the way I've always put it is...

854
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,840
Get your nice long white robe.

855
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,520
If I die and I go through...

856
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,300
No, if when I die,

857
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,300
I go through a lovely tunnel of light

858
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,400
and meet the deceased loved ones...

859
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,520
Yes, there they are.

860
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,500
The spirit of Bob.

861
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,820
Winking and mugging and...

862
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,940
You won't hear me complain.

863
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,780
And if when I die,

864
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,320
I just rot in some grave,

865
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,500
you likewise won't hear me complain.

866
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,880
Are you sure?

867
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,440
Either way,

868
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,720
you won't hear old Reverend Stang complain.

869
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,360
However, oh, I've changed my epitaph

870
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
on my tombstone

871
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
or whatever you call it on the tombstone.

872
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,480
It was going to say,

873
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,940
Reverend Ivan Stang,

874
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,240
I'll get him for this.

875
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,200
But I've changed it to...

876
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,360
And this only works with a classic tombstone

877
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,380
in a graveyard.

878
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,900
Get off of my lawn.

879
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,420
How about not dead but living?

880
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,900
You can fix this all in post.

881
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,260
Hi, Reverend Stang.

882
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,000
Hi, hey.

883
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,140
You can just put another recording over this

884
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,720
and fix this whole show in post

885
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,200
by removing it from existence.

886
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,620
Oh, crap.

887
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,560
Now I'm being depressing.

888
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,020
What would you do to me, Stang?

889
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,700
All right.

890
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,760
Hearts and flowers.

891
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,800
I'm going to fix the depressing stuff.

892
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,860
That's right, boys and girls.

893
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,600
We've got a great cartoon coming up for you, too.

894
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,040
Well, you know,

895
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,240
I've been sitting here for an hour and a half.

896
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,020
This chair is really uncomfortable.

897
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,380
Yeah, it hurts.

898
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,120
There's something about it.

899
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,120


900
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,120


901
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,120


902
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,120


903
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,120


904
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,180
It's really uncomfortable.

905
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,020
My butt hurts.

906
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm butt hurt.

907
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,480
Put a cushion on there and stop soldiering.

908
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,320
Soldier on.

909
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,920
Who's going to fight the next war?

910
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,100
Chin up.

911
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,440
Yeah, come on.

912
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,280
Let's see some military toughness here.

913
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,800
Buck up, buckers.

914
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,700
After all, puzzling evidence never complains.

915
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,080
Even when he's feeling physical agony,

916
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,260
he's always as bland as he usually is.

917
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,660
Maybe he's dead.

918
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,140
Not bloody likely because he's at home doing my radio show.

919
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,540
You can still do that and be dead.

920
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,840
Oh, yeah.

921
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,720
Yeah, look at all those dead air.

922
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,240
Look at all those pinks working at their jobs.

923
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,920
They're dead.

924
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,300
They're not even cognizant of the fact that they're miserable.

925
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,580
They're happy to be miserable.

926
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm so jealous of them, those bastards.

927
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,380
The thing is, though.

928
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,960
Able to be happy in their misery.

929
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,000
Is this the subject of death special?

930
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
All I ever get is bored with my misery.

931
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,240
And that's if I'm lucky.

932
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,000
You know, complaining about your problems, your pains, your miseries.

933
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,920
Your dissatisfaction.

934
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,680
The complaining feels good.

935
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,560
Yes, it's a great painkiller.

936
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,420
Moaning is an excellent painkiller.

937
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,400
Of course, it makes everyone else feel bad.

938
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,500
But when you make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.

939
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,720
You know, what are you going to do?

940
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,140
That hasn't started working for me yet.

941
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,240
I'm not old enough to be able to fix everything by complaining about it.

942
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Well, it helps.

943
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,900
Like when you...

944
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,800
Practice makes perfect.

945
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,720
When you hurt yourself, you scream in pain.

946
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,000
The scream is a way of dealing with the pain, you see.

947
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,580
The scream is therapeutic.

948
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:36,180
And in the same way, some of us make art, which is equally therapeutic.

949
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,240
It's just a long, drawn-out process.

950
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,940
But it's the same thing as the scream.

951
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,920
And some of us just get on the internet and make everyone who reads our stuff feel terrible.

952
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,300
And they should.

953
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,160
Because they're not doing it right the way we are.

954
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,800
And we're always right.

955
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,080
Actually, I get a lot of slack reading the miserable posts of the wretched...

956
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,000
...po-buckers and pinks who are so upset at the end of news articles.

957
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,780
Slack.

958
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,220
Especially if the news article mentions...

959
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,860
Slack.

960
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,560
...the word climate, Obama, or...

961
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,740
What's the...

962
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,940
Nature, basically, or science.

963
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,780
Any of those things, you can...

964
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,020
Anything or just anything.

965
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,780
You just skip the article, go straight to the bottom...

966
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,380
How about anything?

967
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,720
...and enjoy the anger.

968
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,440
The sheer angriness of all those comments.

969
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,280
That comes vigorously boiling out.

970
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,620
A huge load of bile.

971
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:28,940


972
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,120
It's not even...

973
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,960
You don't even have to categorize it into different types of news articles.

974
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,220
It is literally any news article that you can imagine.

975
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,400
It could be about adoptable kittens.

976
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,120
Right.

977
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,860
And it will still become...

978
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,600
Thanks, Obama.

979
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,440
...just the most awful, evil...

980
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,840
I can't read it anymore.

981
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,060
Kittens are breeding wildly just the way liberal perverts want.

982
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,940
Well, the last week, after those Supreme Court decisions,

983
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,540
was so juicy.

984
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,140
God, they were butthurt.

985
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,820
They were waving.

986
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,380
That was fun.

987
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,640
That was actually fun.

988
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,280
They were fizzing like a Science Project volcano.

989
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,080
I could have done five hours of Slack just reading the comments on Yahoo News.

990
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,460
Well, you should have saved them.

991
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,540
No, I do that every now and then.

992
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,600
And it always angers the three conservatives of the Church of the Century.

993
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,300
Well, it's time that their horizons were widened, too.

994
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,120
I had...

995
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,380
Well, why don't you read the retarded comments by libtards?

996
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,920
It's like, I'm reading this stuff uncut.

997
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,600
I didn't edit these.

998
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,400
This is all there was on the internet.

999
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,960
And it's all funny.

1000
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,800
Not if it's meant to be.

1001
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,980
I enjoyed watching...

1002
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,260
But it's reading a stupid accent.

1003
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,340
The backlash of the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing.

1004
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,040
I loved watching people get riled up over that.

1005
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,940
And I actually delighted in messing with people.

1006
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,100
Which I generally don't do.

1007
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,180
I don't do that much on the internet.

1008
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,780
Generally?

1009
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,900
Generally.

1010
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:09,560
Did you ever see the movie Can't Stop the Music with the village people, Valerie Perrine and Bruce Jenner in it?

1011
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:09,980
No.

1012
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:16,180
If you ever did, you would realize there was something hinky about that guy long, long ago.

1013
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,400
I'm just saying.

1014
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,540
What's the title of that movie?

1015
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,460
Can't Stop the Music.

1016
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
From the 80s, right?

1017
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,920
From the 80s.

1018
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,500
And it has Bruce Jenner as Bruce Jenner.

1019
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:27,840
Yes.

1020
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,820
In a midriff-bearing, short shorts-wearing portrayal with the frolicking village people.

1021
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,340
It was the 70s, though, right?

1022
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,880
Bruce Jenner was ahead of his time.

1023
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,760
No, the 80s.

1024
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,660
It was the 80s.

1025
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,300
But the thing about this movie is when it came out, it got a good review in the paper.

1026
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,920
And Alien, which came out at the same time, got a terrible review.

1027
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,820
And I always thought, well, you know, here it is, a light-hearted gay musical.

1028
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,180
This is what people like.

1029
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,100
And what I like with weird, slimy monsters eviscerating.

1030
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,560
You've got to admit, that's not for everybody.

1031
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,160
So you should just stifle your irritation at the juxtaposition of these two reviews.

1032
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,180
Then years later, many years later, at Bad Movie Night,

1033
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,820
which is where a bunch of yocksters get together and make noise at the screen and show a terrible movie,

1034
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,880
they showed Can't Stop the Music.

1035
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,820
And it really is unbearably rancid and awful.

1036
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,540
And Alien is a masterpiece compared to it.

1037
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,740
So forget...

1038
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,400
Justified.

1039
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,060
Justified.

1040
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,100
Justified.

1041
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,440
Yeah, I was justified.

1042
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,140
Vindication.

1043
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,100
And Bruce Jenner, his behavior in this movie kind of illuminates everything he's done after.

1044
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm just saying.

1045
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,480
Just saying.

1046
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,260
Well, I think we've been complaining for 35 years about how fucked up the pinks are.

1047
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,380
Yes, they are.

1048
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,440
This is no surprise.

1049
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:56,100
1969, the year that 2001 and Planet of the Apes and Midnight Cowboy came out, what got the Academy Award?

1050
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,740
Oliver.

1051
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,160
The musical.

1052
00:38:59,540 --> 00:38:59,860
Yes.

1053
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,220
Oliver, Oliver.

1054
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,800
You watch that every couple of years?

1055
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,220
No.

1056
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:10,180
But it was parodied in The Meaning of Life by Monty Python, so at least it had that good...

1057
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,480
What lost out?

1058
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,400
Was it Shawshank Redemption that lost out to Forrest Gump in the 90s?

1059
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,360
That is sad.

1060
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,580
Am I remembering that right?

1061
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,000
That's right, Baby Bear.

1062
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,160
It did lose out.

1063
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,040
And it's a far more popular movie than Forrest Gump ever was or will be.

1064
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,540
There's a scene in that movie, This is the End, which is my favorite Rapture movie.

1065
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,820
It's a fine movie.

1066
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Two thumbs up.

1067
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,400
Craig Robinson and...

1068
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,520
Seven arms.

1069
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:51,860
And Hermoine from those Harry Potter movies for making fun of this other actor because he didn't like Forrest Gump.

1070
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,400
They go, oh, you must be a hipster, huh?

1071
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,840
No, no, I'm not a hipster.

1072
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,060
Yeah, you're a hipster.

1073
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,060
You didn't like Forrest Gump.

1074
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,480
No.

1075
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,080


1076
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1077
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1078
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1079
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1080
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1081
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1082
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1083
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1084
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1085
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1086
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,100


1087
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,600
You were doing charming things, made other people feel good, and you don't like it, so you're a hipster.

1088
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,800
And it's like, no, no, I'm not a hipster.

1089
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,140
Again, I'll say it again.

1090
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,380
They're all hipsters.

1091
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,100
Only hipsters even use the word hipster.

1092
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,860
Quite true.

1093
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,520
Okay, I'll lay off it now.

1094
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,060
I'll shut up about it now.

1095
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,600
God damn it!

1096
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,720
There you go.

1097
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:28,100
But Forrest Gump, it takes something like that to bring out such declarations and to reveal uncomfortable and intimate psychological...

1098
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,960
...truths.

1099
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,660
Reverend Irazu and Shadow Coppet have entered the room.

1100
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,520
It is true.

1101
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,480
They are here.

1102
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,740
Oh, and she has beautiful purple hair.

1103
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,800
Yes, where's Crevette?

1104
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,380
I was hoping to see the new Yeti child.

1105
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,980
Where is the bean?

1106
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,440
The little bean.

1107
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,500
Friday.

1108
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,560
Friday.

1109
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,760
Oh, okay.

1110
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,680
She's going to give birth on Friday.

1111
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,960
Okay, we'll all be there.

1112
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,540
From the Dayglo Daygler Center.

1113
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,680
Is that where the baptism is going to be?

1114
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,160
Yes.

1115
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,800
Baptism.

1116
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,260
In the placenta.

1117
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,680
Oh, man.

1118
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,340
The baptism in the birthwaters of Rachel Weard.

1119
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,000
In the Central Placenta Center.

1120
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,500
Oh, no, the quote on that.

1121
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,020
Now, the quote's all messed up on the other side of that sign.

1122
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,400
It says, smell.

1123
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,920
It says, smell, but then that means on the other side that the quote is missing from Bob, and that means it's sacrilege.

1124
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,940
Somebody do something.

1125
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,800
But we don't want you to have to see that thing say smile all the time.

1126
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,760
It's harmful.

1127
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,240
Smell.

1128
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,040
Oh, that's what was probably making me so depressed.

1129
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Smell.

1130
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,780
Darn you, smell.

1131
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,380
The sign that said smile changed to smell.

1132
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,820
We're describing a special custom sign that Reverend Suds Basha altered.

1133
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:45,840
It was a K-mark smile party favor sign with five letters.

1134
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,020
But if you turn a smile upside down, it spells Bob.

1135
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,460
Because it's still five letters.

1136
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,380
Why is it necessary to...

1137
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,920
If you count the quote mark as one letter.

1138
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,920
Why is it necessary?

1139
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,980
It's necessary to exhort people to smile.

1140
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,060
It seems an exceptional mass of cruelty.

1141
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,820
Space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension.

1142
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,100
And you know what I really hate, huh?

1143
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,480
What I really, really hate?

1144
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,520
You know what I hate?

1145
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,880
It's when they take their fingers and try to turn your frown into a smile by manipulating your face.

1146
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,260
Oh, turn that frown upside down, little fella.

1147
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Catch your fingers out of my face.

1148
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:22,960
Bite them.

1149
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,660
Yeah.

1150
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,080
Bite your fingers off.

1151
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,760
I'll catch your belly open.

1152
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,600
I'll make you look at the black stuff you got in there.

1153
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:29,960
Oh, goodness.

1154
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,480
You've upset the gods with those words.

1155
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,700
The wind occasionally comes through this radio studio.

1156
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,880
I caught that, and there's a little bit more nectar left.

1157
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,180
Maybe later in the week we'll have thunder and lightning during the radio show.

1158
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,360
Don't get...

1159
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,700
Like that one time, Hugh Lightning cracked recording.

1160
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,260
That's why.

1161
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,300
Holy head.

1162
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,360
Don't worry, folks.

1163
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,380
Yes.

1164
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,640
Yes.

1165
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,740
Well, we've been...

1166
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,800
We've been broadcasting, and there was a lightning crash, flash right outside the studio here.

1167
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,260
Oh, lightning struck the grindhouse.

1168
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,040
Yes.

1169
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,820
It traveled down...

1170
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,080
Fightsy Josh had his antenna up, stealing all these movies off the internet, and the lightning...

1171
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:20,560
God tried to stop and shut down the grindhouse by sending a thunderbolt, which we got an excellent stereo recording of.

1172
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,700
Holy head.

1173
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,800
Not so fast.

1174
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,120
It's a very beautiful recording.

1175
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,900
And it didn't get...

1176
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,540
And none of the electronics were touched.

1177
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:40,740
The power of Bob shielded those expensive DVD players and TVs and things against the power of God Almighty.

1178
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,960
So maybe, maybe the war on God isn't going so badly after all.

1179
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,140
Yes.

1180
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,220
Well, see, I wasn't going to mention the subgenius war on God this time, but you have brought it up.

1181
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,480
So you're saying that there's some evidence of...

1182
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,660
That's a big order, a tall order to make war on God.

1183
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,040
Yes.

1184
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,380
Since...

1185
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,200
Theoretically, God's the one who is making you make that war on God.

1186
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:01,820
Well...

1187
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,720
For his own amusement.

1188
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,380
Yes.

1189
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,200
Seeing as how you can't beat God.

1190
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,600
Another one of those subgenius endless war campaigns.

1191
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,860
God respects a feisty subgenius.

1192
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,760
Exactly.

1193
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,720
And the idea is that by opposing God, you get to heap damnation on yourself.

1194
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,640
So it's allowed.

1195
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,720
And John loves that stuff.

1196
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,120
Jesus take the wheel of pain.

1197
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,860
Obviously, God has a sense of humor, and it is a sick...

1198
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,260
Sick...

1199
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,500
Sick...

1200
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,460
Sick...

1201
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,400
Sense of humor.

1202
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,120
Oh, yeah.

1203
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,120
Sick.

1204
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,000
One glance at the TV...

1205
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,620
Wait, wait, hold on.

1206
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,420
Is it sick or is it...

1207
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,020
In the microscope.

1208
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:35,800
Is it sick?

1209
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,120
You'll know.

1210
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,640
God is a tool.

1211
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,000
Which one is it?

1212
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,460
You didn't say...

1213
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,260
Is it sick or is it sick?

1214
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,900
The sickest way you can say sick.

1215
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:44,960
Sick.

1216
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,760
You need to specify.

1217
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,060
The words are fluid these days.

1218
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,900
I don't know what they mean.

1219
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,740
They changed the definition of literally to now include figuratively.

1220
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,140
That's part of the definition of it.

1221
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,480
Now.

1222
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,640
That's awful, but I think your...

1223
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,760
It's true, too.

1224
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:07,280
More dramatically articulated sick is better than the blandly articulated one.

1225
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,220
Sick was a big word of the 60s.

1226
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:17,680
There were supposedly sick humor and sick jokes, which were not that...

1227
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,760
And tasty waves, brah.

1228
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,740
Yes, that's true.

1229
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,080
Well, Lenny Bruce was called a sick humorist.

1230
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:34,260
And South Park makes him look like a lute-stroking angel in heaven.

1231
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,140
So things change, you know.

1232
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,760
Time marches on.

1233
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,540
By the way, I just bought the South Park video game, The Stick of Truth.

1234
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,820
I've heard that's actually pretty good.

1235
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,240
I've heard it's actually pretty good.

1236
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,180
Have you played it?

1237
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,480
No, I have not.

1238
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,060
So far, well, you know how when you start a game and...

1239
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,620
At some point, you have to make up a name for yourself.

1240
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,080
Yeah.

1241
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:07,120
A cartman who's playing wizard demands to know my name.

1242
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,580
I'm a little character I didn't get much control over.

1243
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,200
And what did I call...

1244
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,180
Oh, Lil Stangor was my character's name.

1245
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,500
That word?

1246
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:16,980
Lil Stangor.

1247
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,560
And the game goes, are you sure that's the name you want?

1248
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,020
Yeah, yeah.

1249
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,080
Okay, are you sure that's the name you want?

1250
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:23,860
Yeah, yeah.

1251
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,980
Then cart...

1252
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,020
Cartman says to you, okay, I see, your name is Douchebag.

1253
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,560
Is that right?

1254
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,280
And you push no.

1255
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,800
And he goes, I see, your name is Douchebag.

1256
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,040
Let's double check.

1257
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,080
Is your name Douchebag?

1258
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,020
No.

1259
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,480
So you shall now forth henceforth be known as Lord Douchebag.

1260
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,700
Now, Douchebag, you have to buy a weapon.

1261
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,860
You know, and so forth.

1262
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,080
Yeah.

1263
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,680
It's just like every other video game, except it's South Park.

1264
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,280
Yeah.

1265
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,480
That's about it.

1266
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,980
Well, I've heard it actually has really solid RPG elements.

1267
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,660
In order to move ahead in the game,

1268
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,420
I had to buy a wooden sword from Butters or somebody,

1269
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,120
and then hit another kid a bunch of times with this stupid wooden sword.

1270
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,740
And the kid would just go, ow, ow, ow.

1271
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,200
And finally run away.

1272
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,820
And at that point, you've learned how to use the sword.

1273
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,100
So it's like real life.

1274
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:13,720
Oh, okay.

1275
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,540
In other words, very, very much like real life.

1276
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,280
Everybody calls you Douchebag, and you hit other people with a sword.

1277
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,200
It didn't really work.

1278
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,580
Please, sounds like in the beginning of...

1279
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,500
It made me feel young again.

1280
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,620
Reverend Douchebag.

1281
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,040
Sounds like the beginning of Roman Polanski's Carnage.

1282
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,320
So no matter what name you choose in the South Park game,

1283
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,540
you're going to be Douchebag.

1284
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,500
Lord Douchebag.

1285
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:36,980
The whole time.

1286
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:37,680
Yes.

1287
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,500
And that's supposed to be different from life, I guess.

1288
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,380
Yeah, it's funny.

1289
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,180
Okay, I agree with that.

1290
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,820
In some of the old Zelda games, you could steal from shops,

1291
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,640
or you could try to, and if you got caught,

1292
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,480
you would be forever no longer.

1293
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,180
And that's known for the rest of the game as Thief.

1294
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,680
No matter what name you put in, it would always say,

1295
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,960
Thief looked in the dresser drawer.

1296
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,620
That's like being tattooed.

1297
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,040
Yeah.

1298
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,760
Having the A stitched onto your forehead,

1299
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,640
or the V for Vagabond branded on your hand,

1300
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,500
or the S for Subgenius.

1301
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,980
P for Pirate.

1302
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,820
F for Runaway Slayer.

1303
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,660
With the boots of cops.

1304
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,260
Yeah.

1305
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,160
Wait, no.

1306
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,100
No, that didn't happen to me.

1307
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,740
Well, anyway, it's possible for these things to happen,

1308
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,780
but not likely here at X-Day,

1309
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,640
where we're away from the ruck of society's destructive path.

1310
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,360
For me, I believe,

1311
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,660
Lester, there was a rape, two murders,

1312
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,080
a bunch of animal abuse,

1313
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,860
and a lynching.

1314
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,980
Yes, well, nobody's perfect.

1315
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,520
These are ideals that we point toward.

1316
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,220
They are not things that we are absolutely able to abide by.

1317
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,180
This is a religion.

1318
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,000
What is presented?

1319
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,240
It is the form of ideals that we work toward.

1320
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,640
We do not extend as perfect exemplars of what we're talking about.

1321
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,120
Yeah, no kidding.

1322
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,560
It was our guru, Bob, that did all those crimes I just mentioned.

1323
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,740
See, even Bob used to blow off steam.

1324
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,820
You know, boys will be boys.

1325
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,760
Yeah, that's what they all say.

1326
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,620
It's true, though.

1327
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,960
We had some pretty disturbing events here at Mysterio Last X-Day.

1328
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,820
We were just having a little fun, Sheriff.

1329
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,780
Oh, let them up, boys.

1330
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,460
My little dog, Snuckles,

1331
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,900
has been turned inside out!

1332
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,960
Right, a dog was turned inside out.

1333
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,440
Well, that's the worst thing that ever happens at X-Day.

1334
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,360
I swear to God, Sheriff Stang,

1335
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,220
we weren't drunk.

1336
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,860
We was in the car, and it was on,

1337
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,040
and Bob grabbed the car,

1338
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,360
and he started raping it right up the muffler tube.

1339
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,160
But it ran better after that.

1340
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,440
Yes, he had the Midas touch with that muffler.

1341
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1342
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,080
All right, that's a good one.

1343
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,140
I miss the club.

1344
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,880
I miss the climactic battle.

1345
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,180
I had, like, a whole barbarian costume and everything,

1346
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,220
and I miss the climactic battle because I felt sick.

1347
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,300
Oh.

1348
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,220
I managed to get almost 20 subgeniuses

1349
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,620
not only off of their butts,

1350
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,400
which was a great challenge to begin with.

1351
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:12,480
But racing.

1352
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,560
Now, when did this happen?

1353
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,460
And not just off the road a little bit,

1354
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,060
but actually about 100 yards into the forest.

1355
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,180
Bounding through the forest like deer.

1356
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,020
I got 20 subgeniuses to go.

1357
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,200
They go into the woods.

1358
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,980
It was majestic.

1359
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,880
For a very brief time.

1360
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,540
That was the greatest achievement I've ever had at X-Day.

1361
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,120
That was my moment.

1362
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,560
I realized that, don't push it.

1363
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,060
After 20 minutes, they're going to start whining and complaining.

1364
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,360
They'll come away telling stories about the mosquitoes

1365
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,040
and the bugs and the thorns

1366
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,920
and all the terrible things in the woods.

1367
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,340
Well, nobody ever said it was going to be a bed of roses.

1368
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,740
You know, we had to try to catch Bob and save Philo.

1369
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,020
We failed.

1370
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,900
You buttered your bread, now sleep in it.

1371
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,200
You've made your bed, so now eat it.

1372
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,760
Shut up.

1373
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,820
It is.

1374
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,480
It's not just subgeniuses.

1375
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,740
During Starwood, there's like 500 people here.

1376
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,960
And there's no one on those trails.

1377
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,860
There's beautiful, natural trails all around this place.

1378
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,080
Well, you know where to go when you want to get away from...

1379
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,940
I mean, in the old days, there'd be people copulating out there.

1380
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,840
You'd have to step over them every 10 feet.

1381
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:22,760
Not.

1382
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,580
No more nowadays.

1383
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,560
Oh, since 9-11, no open copulation at Hippie Pagan Festival.

1384
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,540
There might be Arab terrorists out there.

1385
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,100
Actually, it's not 9-11.

1386
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,020
It was the advent of everyone having a camera on all the time.

1387
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,700
Well, there is.

1388
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,560
That has cut down on the toplessness and nakedity terribly.

1389
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,160
There's always someone photographing you

1390
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,000
and you have no idea that it's going on.

1391
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,080
I've had to take a lot of naked pictures down for years after these festivals.

1392
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,740
It's a pain in the butt, too.

1393
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,780
Well, I say...

1394
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,000
They run around in front of me.

1395
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,580
All the cameras naked.

1396
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,980
The sun comes and puts a camera in my face.

1397
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,160
Blocking in front of the stage, between the cameras and the stage.

1398
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,920
And then when you put the pictures of them drunken on the internet,

1399
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,440
then they suddenly don't want to be seen.

1400
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,420
Oh, now, if our fans are sharing that on Facebook, please take it down.

1401
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,520
I do it.

1402
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,360
Maybe if we put some artful leaves and foliage in places.

1403
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,060
But I'm glad to know that it's already gotten loose on Facebook.

1404
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,540
Facebook used to be a different place.

1405
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,080
And then everyone's parents got on it and ruined it forever.

1406
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,900
I'm not kidding.

1407
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,440
There were old starwoods where I did have to politely step over copulating couples.

1408
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,200
After dark.

1409
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:38,000
I didn't know they were there until I just about tripped over them.

1410
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,080
But, yeah, the cameras.

1411
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,740
The cameras changed everything.

1412
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,560
The ubiquitous cameras.

1413
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,840
How many people got in the pond with their clothes off for the baptism?

1414
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,240
About five.

1415
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,440
Last year.

1416
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,240
Last year?

1417
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah.

1418
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,680
I didn't.

1419
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,640
How did he?

1420
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,460
What are you talking about?

1421
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,200
Yes, I did.

1422
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,360
I just do it after.

1423
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,800
You didn't take your clothes off.

1424
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,380
Yes, I did.

1425
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,840
I do so after the ceremony is over.

1426
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,420
Oh, after the cameras leave.

1427
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,120
Well, people can stay around if they want.

1428
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,980
I suggest there's better things to photograph.

1429
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,820
Anyway, the people here are sensitive.

1430
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,700
They will never betray your confidence.

1431
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,280
Yes, it's true.

1432
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,360
You're among friends here at...

1433
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,740
X Day.

1434
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,120
This is why I just keep my con Facebook separate from my subgenius Facebook.

1435
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,100
Otherwise, they might see it work.

1436
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,920
You know, my God, look what she does in her off hours.

1437
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,720
Yeah, and then I don't have to worry about these things.

1438
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:47,000
Princess Wee, my wife, worked for the county weather control office for 30 years.

1439
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:47,880
Wow.

1440
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,940
And at no point did any of her co-workers know that...

1441
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:01,480
She was Jewish, a Democrat peace activist, a folk singer, and helped run a pagan festival.

1442
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,220
Those main elements...

1443
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,320
Oh, there she comes right now.

1444
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,400
Let alone the church of the subgenius.

1445
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,280
Her ears must have been...

1446
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,460
And here comes Wee Mama.

1447
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,220
Grandma Bob is here.

1448
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,460
Yes, in mid-broadcast.

1449
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,200
The queen of the queen of all the UFOs.

1450
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,320
There's lots of them again.

1451
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,180
Has made it to the building.

1452
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,380
Thankfully, the show is almost over.

1453
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,920
When do we actually go off the air, Stan?

1454
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,260
Wee Mama, a radio audience, is 85 years old.

1455
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,440
And doesn't look a day over 79.

1456
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,080
She's super cool.

1457
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,700
Maybe we'll get her on the show later.

1458
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,720
Well, as we end at the hour?

1459
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,760
We can end at the hour anytime.

1460
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,380
Because I can put 10 minutes of collage stuff at the beginning.

1461
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,220
I kind of want to.

1462
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,540
My back really hurts.

1463
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,020
Erazu, give me that shirt.

1464
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,580
I'm not kidding about that.

1465
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,600
Give me it.

1466
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,140
I want it though.

1467
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,180
I'm on a stage with a microphone.

1468
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,280
You have to do what I say.

1469
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:05,820
No!

1470
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,360
Ah!

1471
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,680
Listening to the radio...

1472
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,600
Wait a minute.

1473
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,240
What show is this?

1474
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,060
The subgenius...

1475
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,480
The church of the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1476
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,360
Broadcast live from Wisteria Community Campground.

1477
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,020
From Caffeina's Restaurant.

1478
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,160
In the center of the subgenius.

1479
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,900
This maelstrom.

1480
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,780
Brought to you...

1481
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,540
In the days counting down to X days.

1482
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,760
By Beer God Beer.

1483
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,140
And by the...

1484
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,680
Listen to subgenius.com.

1485
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,340
And if I didn't say it earlier, which I didn't, the collages that I played at the beginning,

1486
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,340
which I'll have to edit in, were by the great Reverend Susie the Flusie, greatest collage,

1487
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,600
sound audio collage editor on the planet Earth.

1488
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:50,920
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1489
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,140
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1490
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,500
Yes.

1491
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:06,660
We have got a great moment.

1492
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,680
It's been...

1493
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,900
Another week.

1494
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:21,420
Another broadcast opening of ourtapplingastone께서104 channel.

1495
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,940
Neeson Wesley-Rollins does not play music and he is closed.

1496
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:21,940


1497
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:21,940


1498
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,140
Ed Jagat shows the sound of therites-

1499
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,140


1500
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,140


1501
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,140


1502
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:27,600
or see www.subgenius.com.

1503
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,920
Please make a note of it.

1504
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,880
Op, op, op, op.

1505
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,700
There you have it.

1506
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,340
Now you have another one.

1507
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,380
Official sign-off of the Church of the Subgenius radio show,

1508
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,320
broadcast here from the Wisteria campground.

1509
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,540
As all eyes turn skyward,

1510
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,820
waiting for the advent of the saucer ships from beyond.

1511
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:56,360
God, is this the year that all our preparations will come to final fruition?

1512
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,320
Please stay tuned and hear the answer

1513
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:06,440
in the immediately following iteration of this exciting radio broadcast.

1514
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:16,280
With Phosmo the Clown and Flatulo the Magnificent.

1515
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,600
53 minutes.

1516
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:23,820
Oh, God.

1517
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,420
Seven more minutes.

1518
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,460
No, that's how long we did it the second time.

1519
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,800
All right, that's okay, because you need to put in the...

1520
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,480
You see, I prepared for 10 minutes of collage.

1521
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,020
10 minutes of sound effects and cheap gimmicks and trickery.

1522
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,960
You can squeeze a song in there on the radio.

1523
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,680
These really helped.

1524
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,420
I thought these were like the...

1525
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,160
A song?

1526
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,240
I don't know how I ever did it.

1527
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,040
Yeah, I mean, when he makes a recording later,

1528
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,060
he can put in a song for next day at the beginning of that.

1529
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,800
But not...

1530
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,740
Not a song from you, I guess.

1531
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,880
Actually, I didn't prepare a rant,

1532
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,340
and the only thing that I have to do as backup is a song,

1533
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,740
but I don't know if I'm going to do it,

1534
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,200
because I might whiz out.

1535
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,180
Well, we'll have to see about that.

1536
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,640
I should just write a rant.

1537
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,460
Everyone just writes their rants last minute.

1538
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,060
Anyway...

1539
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,860
I've got to write a rant for...

1540
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,280
You've got to write a marriage service, man.

1541
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,040
Yeah, that too.

1542
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,260
You have to marry two subgeniuses.

1543
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,660
I'm going to do that one off the top of my head.

1544
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,620
That might be best.

1545
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,720
Go to the well and font of inspiration.

1546
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,360
Inspiration itself.

1547
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,260
Who needs chicken scratches on paper?

1548
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,520
Well, it's a lot easier if you know the couple,

1549
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,760
although I don't know them that well.

1550
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,420
And I know Reverend Fox.

1551
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,740
You know they're card-carrying subgeniuses.

1552
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,860
But it's fun when they're your friends.

1553
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,620
Because you mean it.

1554
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,480
That's a good one.

1555
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,540
You actually mean it.

1556
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,480
Yeah, there you go.

1557
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,240
Bro, that's a strange sound.

1558
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:47,580
The thing is changing.

1559
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,960
Ah, no.

1560
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,680
He's turning.

1561
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,020
He's turning into a horrible monster.

1562
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:51,980
Oh, no.

1563
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,760
Good Lord.

1564
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,220
Look at the size of that thing.

1565
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,720
Back.

1566
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,220
Back.

1567
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,360
Well, monsters aren't what they used to be.

1568
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,000
Oh, my ears.

1569
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,460
So that concludes our Bobcast.

1570
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,340
It's like talking on the phone for two hours.

1571
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,380
Only it hurts both ears.

1572
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:18,240
Thanks for sitting in there and elevating this sad presentation.

1573
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,280
Hour of slow-mo time.

1574
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,700
Okay, that's over.

1575
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,160
No more joy.

1576
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,300
joy.
