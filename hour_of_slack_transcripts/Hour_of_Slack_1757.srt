1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm indecently assaulting thousands of lawyers over the internet.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,620
Hundreds of the attorneys were injured.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,740
A nursing home fire in Russia has called on Oprah Winfrey to restore the country's new media, including DVDs.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,140
They said firefighters were searching for short or careless women's bodies to perform indecent acts.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,820
It has to happen every once in a while, and it's alright.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,200
On Wall Street 3-13-5-6-7-4-4, the Supreme Court has agreed to kill at least 29 people in the third quarter.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,360
Talk show host Condoleezza Rice has pledged to use tear gas and clubs to disperse PR News from Washington.

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,220
Bob.

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,180
Doves.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,440
Bob.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,480
Doves.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,880
Bob.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,680
Doves.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,800
Doves.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,340
Hello, Mrs. Dobbs. What is it?

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,940
Well, it's probably not...

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,620
The Self-Genius Power of Slack.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,500
By God.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,880
Well, well, well.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,760
Sober he couldn't think, drunk he couldn't talk.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,940
Why, he couldn't even identify himself in a mirror.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,860
Careful now.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,380
That's right, Captain Shotgun.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,380
Well, well, well.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
I found this little piece of grass.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,880
What you'd better do is dig up that grass.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,280
Tattooed.

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,020
Tattooed?

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,280
Tattooed?

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,080
I got bitten by a...

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,940
Tattooed whack once.

32
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,760
All right.

33
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,620
Okay.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,440
Okay.

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,100
Right.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay, boss.

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,760
That's right.

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,300
Yeah.

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,940
Okay.

40
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,460
Yeah.

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,360
Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,300
Okay.

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,320
Thank you, Mr. Fernandinende Lee Murr.

44
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,580
Friends, did you know all of his stuff is available on archive.org?

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,840
Well, it is.

46
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,300
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,757.

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,220
We're going to call Lonesome Cowboy Dave in a little while to see how his buzz is doing.

48
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,880
And later we'll go to the earlier 22X Day with Dr. Howell, Dr. Drummond, Reverend Angry Larry,

49
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,600
and the man known as X.

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,440
But first, from the brand new Rudy Schwartz Project album,

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,380
Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick Powell,

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,700
a little ditty called The Medicinal Properties of Chicken.

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,840
Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick Powell,

54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,240
a little ditty called The Medicinal Properties of Chicken.

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:53,240
Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick Powell,

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:23,200
a little ditty called The Medicinal Properties of Chicken.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,100
Did you ever feel like dancing on the ceiling when you're reeling from the karma of your body?

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,440
Don't you think you're straining from the training that's remaining in your struggle to become a sedentary turd?

59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,400
Lick your spoon.

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,080
Force the issue neatly when you find yourself humming so sweetly

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,140
to the sound of poultry praying while the chemicals are spraying.

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,400
Oh, and the things you've been saying seem absurd.

63
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,800
Practicing Registered Nurses and Paramedics recommend

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,360
that you never underestimate the medicinal properties of chicken.

65
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,120
Practicing Registered Nurses and Paramedics recommend

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,240
A man that you never underestimate.

67
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,920
The medicinal properties of chicken.

68
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,900
Like the same registered person.

69
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,300
Hello?

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,900
Hello?

71
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,980
Okay, Dave, I guess we're going to start the show.

72
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,500
Is that okay?

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Should we start it?

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,860
Yeah.

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,980
I've got Nino Rota's 8.5 score in the background, but you can't hear it.

76
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,460
Oh, I love 8.5 score by Nino Rota.

77
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,620
I've always thought it was silly.

78
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,100
It was Sarangina's Roomba.

79
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,480
Remember Sarangina's Roomba?

80
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

81
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Sure.

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah, that'll be coming up somewhere in the background.

83
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,520
You won't be able to hear it because of our special Tarzan sound.

84
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,120
What makes you think I would even want to do that?

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,860
Well, in the writing?

86
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,820
In the radio station, it was sort of fun.

87
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,980
You could hear the same thing everybody else heard.

88
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
That's what I say.

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,640
All you can hear is what's coming through my phone.

90
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,940
That's all I want to hear, I guess.

91
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,120
Yeah.

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,460
Who needs to hear anything except what's coming through Reverend Stagg's phone?

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Now, I don't have much of a buzz right now, but perhaps...

94
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,060
Here, take some of this.

95
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,680
Hey, don't bogart that.

96
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,140
It doesn't work except for on Tuesdays.

97
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,120
I hate it.

98
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,080
Oh, here it comes.

99
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,720
I stretched the phone in the yard too far, and there was a big buzz right there.

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,400
Yeah, yeah, I heard it coming.

101
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,080
I was just turning the music up, going, why is there singing in the background?

102
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,620
And there's the buzz.

103
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
But I don't care.

104
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,440
Just let it buzz away.

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,680
I'll let this Italian sing.

106
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,660
It's a fierce buzz, though.

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,400
It might even be a fierce...

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,960
It's a fierce...

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,000
Now, this is a defeating buzz.

110
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,660
It is a pretty fierce buzz.

111
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,860
Yeah, listen to that buzz.

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,620
It makes your voice kind of saw-toothed.

113
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,400
It makes me sound kind of rodent-like.

114
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,220
Yeah.

115
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,040
If you looked at the wave file...

116
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,760
If you looked at the waveform, I mean, it would look like a sawtooth pattern.

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,540
A form of artificial intelligence-gathering devices?

118
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,940
All masked into one?

119
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,760
One small device?

120
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,080
Well, that's probably what we're hearing is feedback from all the surveillance things

121
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,360
that the government turns on once they realize we're recording.

122
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,480
Yeah, they never miss the hour.

123
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,020
It's like, I've had requests, though, and I just told them where to go.

124
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,260
You know, just go to the website, and you can download any damn show you want to,

125
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,240
and just leave me alone.

126
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,140
They didn't even care.

127
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,380
I think it had something to do with this.

128
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,980
Have you ever heard this phrase?

129
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,460
It's you can flunk it, you can flop it, and you can get titties or something.

130
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,180
I think it's German.

131
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Yeah, since it's German, no, I haven't.

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,800
I don't worry about that.

133
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
De flunking, huh?

134
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,980
What?

135
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,820
De flunking, I forget.

136
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm not sure if I even remember it ever to begin with.

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,520
You know, you forget something, you have to remember it to start off with.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,440
Right.

139
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
That's the big problem.

140
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,320
But maybe what we ought to do is, to grapple with the buzz, maybe we should hang up,

141
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,540
and I'll just call you back again.

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,520
Oh, that would be quite all right.

143
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Let's try that.

144
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:55,780
Bye.

145
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,460
Bye.

146
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,460
Okay, now I've got to call him.

147
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,100
Let's see.

148
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,780
Oh, it feels wonderful.

149
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,320
Oh, so much better.

150
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,360
Oh, my God.

151
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,420
Hello?

152
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,880
Go to hell.

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,060
You.

154
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:45,760


155
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,140
Need a helping hand.

156
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,220
I'm going to have a stuck.

157
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,940
Touched by monkey.

158
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:52,940


159
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,100
Bob Dobbs pipes never go out.

160
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,260
Of the dog.

161
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,020
Of the dog.

162
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,820
Of the dog.

163
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, hey, hey.

164
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:32,280
That wonderful collage was by our old, old friend, Reverend Rasta Billy Bob Diddley, called Diddlin'.

165
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,100
But kids, I have to cut in here with something serious.

166
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm 66.6 years old, and I started hearing something like this OK Boomer thing years ago.

167
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,940
Some of my fellow old folks may not yet know that OK Boomer...

168
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:11,200
OK Boomer is a phrase lately used by snarky young people to blow off old folks' opinions or otherwise scold us for being luckier than they are due to accidents of birth or, as some would see it, evil, conscious, and deliberate greed.

169
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:20,200
And I have a response, of course, a little rant that I call, I'm OK Boomer, You're OK Boomer.

170
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,680
A title I stole from Philodrum.

171
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,980
Rummined, which probably only boomers would get.

172
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,480
Here goes.

173
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,260
Sorry, non-boomer.

174
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:45,000
Sorry you received one-tenth the education I got in world history, math, and science due to my generation selfishly using up all the available learning resources, such as, apparently, brain cells.

175
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,880
Thus, you can easily imagine the thousands of generations before boomers.

176
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,380
Those billions born.

177
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Before 1946.

178
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,100
Living in perfectly balanced harmony with nature.

179
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:16,820
Up until exactly 1946, when callous boomers unanimously began their carefully constructed plan to deplete as many material and economic resources as possible, specifically in order to deny them to our own children and grandchildren.

180
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,120
Except, hey, wait a minute.

181
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,380
Admit it.

182
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,660
You younger generation.

183
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:22,920
You younger generation.

184
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:35,400
Deliberately stole all the miracle cures for chronic and fatal diseases for yourselves and stashed them all away in your future where we can never get to them.

185
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,840
Therefore, the only rational response is death to all resource users.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,920
All of them.

187
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,860
Because let's face it.

188
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,400
This is the, no, you are decade.

189
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
I've never seen it this bad.

190
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,180
Hey, that guy you admire so much turned out to be a lying, thieving bastard.

191
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,580
Nuh-uh, you are.

192
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,480
Hey, that guy who says he's a huge patriot actually dodged the draft.

193
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,240
Nuh-uh, you are.

194
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:15,580
Don't you wonder if that one news network you watch that says all the other news is fake might actually be the fake one?

195
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,620
Nuh-uh, you are.

196
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,580
Why is that rich, honest, stable genius?

197
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:22,900
Why is that?

198
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:34,000
Because that's the one guy you voted for, the genius family man you voted for, hiding his grades, his taxes, his bankruptcies, his payoffs to hookers, and throwing snowflake temper tantrums.

199
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,080
Nuh-uh, you are.

200
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,760
And so on.

201
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,980
As the unpronounceable French philosopher said, no persons are more frequently wrong than those who will not admit they are wrong.

202
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,300
Easy for me to say, huh?

203
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,480
Yeah.

204
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,540
Yeah.

205
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah.

206
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:52,660
Yeah.

207
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:52,660


208
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:52,660


209
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:52,660


210
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,240
Churchill said, I have often had to eat my words, and I must confess that I have always found it to

211
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:09,320
be a wholesome diet. Still, we all need someone to blame. The poor have sometimes objected to

212
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,900
being governed badly. The rich have always objected to being governed at all, as G.K.

213
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:22,940
Chesterton put it. And as Uncle Dr. Onan Canterbite so famously said,

214
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,300
the conspiracy is vast enough that all efforts to combat it are valid.

215
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:38,080
Full-time street activism or mild temporary annoyance, a lifetime of screaming or a single

216
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,700
click of the tongue, railing against global economic and ecological collapse, or an eye roll

217
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:52,340
that the preferred crisps are on a different shelf than last time. Class revolt against the

218
00:14:52,340 --> 00:15:00,700
powers that be, or sniping against one's peers. Any anti-conspiracy action by a subgenius is correct.

219
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:11,200
All non-subgenius action is suspect. And as Uncle Onan also opined,

220
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,540
think of the thing that you like the most.

221
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,220
Do that for a living. You're guaranteed to like it less over time. Think of the thing that you like

222
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:30,200
pretty well. Do that and keep special things special. You can apply this principle to beliefs

223
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,900
as well. Tell the world that you believe pretty well. Do that. Keep special things special.

224
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,480
Or you can insist on sharing your most special beliefs with everyone and insist that,

225
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:52,320
they share them too. Let me know how that works out. Thank you, Onan.

226
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,540
And Paul Mavridis of the Lies Foundation recently had this to say.

227
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,120
One of the many reasons why a free press is vital, and one of the reasons why warlords and

228
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,600
war profiteers in every country try to destroy an independent critical press,

229
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,400
as their first strike at any conflict they engineer. In America, the independent

230
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,520
press is on its knees. Our public eyes and ears blocked or taken to pieces at every turn by

231
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,840
corporate vulture capitalist ghouls, cable quote news unquote network choke points,

232
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:35,940
anti-democracy libertarian right tech titans like Zuckerberg, and extremist right billionaires like

233
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:43,040
Murdoch. When the Republican eco-terrorists are finally routed from office, the next targets for

234
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,140
political extinction are the moderate.

235
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:52,920
Or corporate right Democrats. Most of them are as corrupt as Republicans when it comes to addressing

236
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,020
this planetary emergency. There's no more slack left in this battle for corporate stooges,

237
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:07,100
neoliberals, and pseudo-environmentalists to sabotage forward motion. But finally,

238
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:15,460
friends, let me quote the saint of sales, our guru and God King man, J.R.

239
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,660
Bob Dobbs, who said, concerning all of it,

240
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,640
Balderdash! Yes, friends, Balderdash! I dare repeat it. I say it too. Balderdash!

241
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:34,200
Sure, non-boomers, we boomers aged. Fancy that! Some of us guessed wrong. Fancy that!

242
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,300
I didn't, though. It's just that my most pessimistic guesses turned out to be grotesquely

243
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,560
optimistic, as proved by my 1973 movie, Let's Visit the World of the Future,

244
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,600
as seen on YouTube, if you don't believe me. And yes, it was a hell of a lot easier for us

245
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,020
boomers to get a college education if we were white and middle class.

246
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,620
Here's a good quote. By the way, I'm getting these from The Week magazine.

247
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:13,280
It may be risky to impugn the worthiness of old age, but I'll take my cane to anyone who tries

248
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,680
to stop me. Those who feel that it's not worth it to be a man of the old age, I'll take my cane to

249
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:15,680


250
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:15,680


251
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,280
a man of the future. I'm not a man of the future. I'm not a man of the future. I'm not a man of the

252
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,280


253
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,600
Welcome respite from the passions, anxieties, and troubles of youth and middle age are either

254
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,660
very lucky or toweringly reasonable. Yes, we should live as long as possible,

255
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,040
barring illness and infirmity, but when it comes to the depredations of age,

256
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:41,440
let's not lose candor along with muscle tone. The goal, you could say, is to live long enough to

257
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,220
think, I've lived long enough.

258
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:52,180
Mae West put it more succinctly. You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.

259
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,760
And President Theodore Roosevelt said, death is always, and under all circumstances,

260
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,400
a tragedy, for if it is not, then it means that life itself has become one.

261
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,040
As a consequence of all this philosophizing, Dr. Philo Drummond, with the approval of his

262
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,660
close personal friend, John F. Drummond, said, I'm not a man of the future. I'm not a man of the

263
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:15,800
future. I'm not a man of the future. I'm not a man of the future. I'm not a man of the future.

264
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:25,460
They are Bob Dobbs, has handed down these new revised subgenius slogans, updated for older

265
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:38,780
subgeniuses, as follows. The subgenius must have snack. You'll pay to know what you really ate.

266
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,360
Have sex with your beautiful live self.

267
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:54,740
Pull my eyelid over my own eye. Too much is still almost always better.

268
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,980
If I can't whip it, I will avoid proving it. And any head good, any head good.

269
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,940
And now, back to the battle of the buzz, in which we finally figure out what the problem is.

270
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,840
It's Dave's head.

271
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, the buzz is worse.

272
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,380
I heard it go off for a second.

273
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,220
Try picking your nose or scratching your butt.

274
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,400
Disappear something on there.

275
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,660
There's a radio on another room that is buzzing itself and it doesn't make much sense for it to be buzzing for no reason.

276
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,860
Maybe it's causing the sound, so hang on just for a minute, all right?

277
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,260
Okay.

278
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,300
Princess, we just arrived. We're, we're, come back. The buzz went away.

279
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,600
Dave's still on the line, but the buzz went away.

280
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,320
I want a buzz. I thought I was going to get a buzz.

281
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,420
Well, I'm sorry I removed the buzz. Maybe I can do something and the buzz will come back.

282
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,700
Oh, okay.

283
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,020
We need to restore the buzz now.

284
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,660
No, that's okay.

285
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,660
Okay, good.

286
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,100
Yeah.

287
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,220
Dave ran off.

288
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,500
Oh, boy.

289
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,880
To turn off his radio, which was in the background going .

290
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,340
Oh, no.

291
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,640
What's that?

292
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,700
That's the buzz.

293
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,700
That's, it came back again?

294
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,920
Not like it was. It's not as bad as it was, but there's still some buzz. And the funny thing is-

295
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,260
Now it's off again. On my line.

296
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,980
What did you do? Anything?

297
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,680
I took a step with the phone.

298
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,680


299
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,680


300
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,680


301
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,680


302
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,680


303
00:21:45,140 --> 00:22:05,440
That's what it is. You need to take a step because when you were, when you ran off to deal with the radio, Dave, when you ran away from the phone to deal with the radio, very shortly the buzz ended completely. And then when you came back, it went . So I think it's something inside your head that interacts with the speakers.

304
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,640
I think it would have to be.

305
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,860
It sounds good right now.

306
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,660
Yeah, it's a self-created universe. This is what I want to hear right now. So live with it or live with it.

307
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,100
Live with it or live with it. That's what they always used to say.

308
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,820
Self-created universe. Yeah, sure.

309
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,300
Well, what, you don't think we should all be exhumed from the outside?

310
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:37,540
I did that time I took acid. I thought, oh, this is self-created universe. I invented this whole universe myself. And now I've woken up from the dream and I want to get back to the dream. This is confusing.

311
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,980
Yeah. Who doesn't really? You know, that's all I dream of every day.

312
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,120
I was 16 years old.

313
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
One of these days I'm going to walk in a room.

314
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,780
I thought, this is self-created universe, just like Lonesome Cowboy Dave said when I was 16.

315
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,280
And I was wrong. I was wrong because after the answer.

316
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,220
Have you heard of the philosopher Descartes? Have you heard of Rene Descartes, the drunken old fart?

317
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,760
Descartes, the French philosopher, Rene Descartes. How do you pronounce it?

318
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,860
Yeah, that's Descartes.

319
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,660
Descartes.

320
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,560
Descartes. I always read it.

321
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,100
Yeah. It was a Monty Python.

322
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,520
It was a Monty Python song about Descartes.

323
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,920
Rene Descartes was a drunken old fart. He could drink you under the table.

324
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:37,420
Well, all I know is that when the acid wore off, it stopped being my self-created universe and went back to being God's self-created universe,

325
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,100
which meant I wasn't getting any special treatment anymore.

326
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,840
And it was back to normal. And when I stubbed my toe, it was going to hurt.

327
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,720
So make your own reality, man. But can you really make that stubbed toe go away?

328
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,660
At least you're not raising, you know, fighting gophers anymore. That could be a crime, I guess, in Oklahoma or St. Louis or someplace.

329
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,180
You know, raising them to fight, you know.

330
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,960
Oh, yeah. The fighting gophers. And that was a great team.

331
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah.

332
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,080
It sounds like a great team, but actually it was a bunch of substructurally different people.

333
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,080


334
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,180
Yeah.

335
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:19,180
And they were disoriented scientists, starting with the name Bill and continuing on into, you know, South America,

336
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,820
Tierra del Fuego and all those places where the walls are melting.

337
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,060
I don't think Dave's acid has worn off yet.

338
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,000
How long has it been since...

339
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,820
Okay, we were 16 years old when we dropped.

340
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,460
It's been 116 years since then now.

341
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
That would be 50 years for me.

342
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,560
That means you're 20 years old, yeah.

343
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,700
Yeah, 50 years for me.

344
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,100
And that is one long, strange trip.

345
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,500
Yeah. Long, strange dream.

346
00:24:50,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Actually, that was... Long, strange dream was the wink, wink type title of an art movie I wrote a script for after my teenage LSD trip.

347
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:11,800
And it was about a young man who had grown up on a concrete plane about the size of a spillway outside of a lake.

348
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,920
An abandoned spillway.

349
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,780
And there was a whole society of people living on this little concrete square.

350
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,660
And they never stepped off of the concrete square.

351
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,420
They felt that they did have to be there because that was reality.

352
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:32,420
And they grew up knowing that if you left this concrete square and went out into messy, confusing nature,

353
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,420
which was all around this big concrete square at this abandoned lake spillway where I was going to film it,

354
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,780
then you would trip.

355
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,340
You'd go to hell.

356
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:51,600
And sure enough, self-created prophecy, this dopey kid who's going to be played by my friend Gary Potts

357
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,180
sneaks off the concrete and goes around a bend and instantly becomes disoriented and lost

358
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,140
because he's on uneven ground for the first time in his entire life.

359
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,480
And it was a metaphor, Dave, for a bad acid trip.

360
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,220
I like allegories and animal...

361
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,620
It was a mighty metaphor.

362
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,120
For whom I do not know.

363
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,460
Like acid, a wind ripping through a gigantic tuba.

364
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,940
We're going to ignore Dave for now and go back in time six months to 22X Day.

365
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,880
In four seconds.

366
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,200
It said it was running.

367
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,260
It's subgenius.

368
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,860
It looks a lot like one of our charts.

369
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,660
Look at this.

370
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,460
Wow, that is a...

371
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,640
It's a very subgeniously looking chart, but I don't see any overt subgenius...

372
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,580
Well, you see, you've got your masonic symbol...

373
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,100
The dick is labeled dick.

374
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,540
That's the one part of it that's like, well, yeah, that looks subgenius-y.

375
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,160
The hand lettered.

376
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,660
Add it on to everything else.

377
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,160
Man. God. Dick.

378
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,520
Oh, Potter and Petal Nostril have entered the room.

379
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,460
Yes, it's all coming together.

380
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,760
At least we know that these aliens have four fingers, a thumb, and a dick.

381
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,920
They're just lazy.

382
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,620
Too lazy to draw all the fingers.

383
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,300
I wasn't sure of that one.

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,320
I know we heard that it's not a visual radio show today, so...

385
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,120
That's why we have to describe in relentless detail everything.

386
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,660
I thought if anyone could describe it, it would be you.

387
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,620
Well, I did my best.

388
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,100
I mentioned masonic symbols and other things that were present in that document.

389
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,100
It was indescribable.

390
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,260
It kind of looked like what I'm wearing, the Tree of Knowledge.

391
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,340
Yeah.

392
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,200
Yeah, except it was...

393
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,220
Somebody else getting in on that bandwagon.

394
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,360
Mm-hmm.

395
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,080
On that hayride.

396
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,860
That's me.

397
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,480
Yes, we have the special pills.

398
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,680
We're all set up for the broadcast, but I sense a lack of will to go forward.

399
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,080
A lack of will to proceed and make it.

400
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,080


401
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,080


402
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,620
Make actual hay while the actual sun shines in the sky.

403
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,240
I sense a lack of sense.

404
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,960
But, I...

405
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,920
That's because my sense of hearing is wrecked.

406
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,780
The other part of my hearing, my headphones, fallen off.

407
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,640
The soft part.

408
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,680
Do you see it anywhere?

409
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,780
You must have...

410
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,900
Oh, it's over there.

411
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,340
It's way over there.

412
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:31,840
God!

413
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,900
Over there.

414
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,520
How in the world did it make its way over there?

415
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,680
Here, let the dog get it.

416
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,760
It's trying to get away from...

417
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,040
There you go.

418
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,940
Well, that's why it's loose.

419
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,060
The dog got it.

420
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,060
And it leaves weird little crust on my ear.

421
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,660
What's up with you?

422
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,460
People have been looking at me like, boy, Stan...

423
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,000
Your face is on fire.

424
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,800
You could take a little bit of...

425
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,520
I've been getting that.

426
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,560
When I take these headphones off, it leaves this crust on my ear and people will be talking

427
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:53,980
to me.

428
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,980
I can tell they're looking at the ear and thinking, he doesn't bathe.

429
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,400
I have a set of headphones that do that.

430
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,280
Stan's like bathing.

431
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,700
He doesn't bathe.

432
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,880
I have headphones that are black and you get it off there and it's like, it looks like

433
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,160
he pelted you with some coal.

434
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,680
Disgustipating.

435
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000


436
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,300
You have to say, I fell down the stairs.

437
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,200
I fell down the stairs.

438
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,180
Those are Chinese headphones.

439
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,540
It wasn't Lucy hitting me.

440
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:15,780
No.

441
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
I fell down the stairs into the coal bin.

442
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,760
They're super cheap though.

443
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,440
They're much cheaper than other headphones.

444
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,660
They eat your ears.

445
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,640
Well, that's a pretty cool album here.

446
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,840
There's a lot of vision.

447
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,180
They're cheap.

448
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,220
So cheap they fall apart before you get to the end of the line.

449
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,220
No.

450
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,400
They usually fall apart before you get to the end of the checkout line.

451
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,940
The center cannot hold.

452
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,060
The front.

453
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,840
Mere energy.

454
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,000
The front end, not the back end.

455
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,420
When you get in the checkout line, that's when the Chinese product puts it on.

456
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,340
Lean into the microphone, Dr. Trump.

457
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,360
You get into the checkout line and that's when the little old lady way up at the front

458
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,200
starts arguing about a coupon that she's got in the bottom of her dusty reticule.

459
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,640
Wow, Philo.

460
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,740
You sounded just like Dr. Holliday.

461
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,880
right there. That was an amazing ventriloquist.

462
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,900
Did you see how I threw my voice?

463
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,680
I'm standing there with my melting ice cream

464
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
raging impotently.

465
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,440
An impotent rage.

466
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,020
Anybody can sound like Dr. Howell

467
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,400
for a little while.

468
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,780
And then what happens?

469
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,840
Well, then it becomes obvious

470
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,440
that it's an imposter or a robot.

471
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,560
A robot?

472
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,180
A robot?

473
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,720
The Howellbot 3000.

474
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,700
Yeah, there's a picture of it right there in that paper.

475
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,940
The first thing I seen on here

476
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,020
was that the bear cubs stomp lovebirds.

477
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,600
You're looking above the fold.

478
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,680
That's an inside joke.

479
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,660
Above the fold.

480
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,280
You have to look below the fold.

481
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,560
This doctor was apparently

482
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:50,560


483
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,260
a quack.

484
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,320
And I should have known from his haircut.

485
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,920
You should have seen this doctor, Hoffinstetter.

486
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,660
In Dallas.

487
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,720
He had this poofy haircut like a sportscaster.

488
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,520
In the days when

489
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,340
hippie long hair was real cool

490
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,520
and sportscasters started to try to look

491
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,320
a little bit hip.

492
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,260
So he'd have this boofy...

493
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,260
Carl Sagan could pull it off

494
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,520
but these guys couldn't.

495
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,640
They were just jocks.

496
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,040
Carl Sagan as a sportscasting weatherman?

497
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,640
No, he could pull it off

498
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,680
with that kind of haircut.

499
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:33,780
He could never do.

500
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,480
Because he wasn't trying very hard.

501
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,880
Did you know that Carl Sagan

502
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,380
was a habitual pot smoker?

503
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,960
Can you believe it?

504
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,020
He could have had frop all that time

505
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,860
but instead he smoked May Rwana.

506
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,460
Daily.

507
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,680
Carl Sagan.

508
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
Smartest guy in the whole world.

509
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,460
I can't believe a person who's smart

510
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,900
could possibly be on that stuff.

511
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
It wasn't until I tell Dr. Howell.

512
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,060
Yeah.

513
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,300
Yeah.

514
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,600
That's the way I answer those questions.

515
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,080
I don't look you straight in the eyes

516
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,060
as if you were the Federal Bureau of Policemen.

517
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
I would say I did not know anybody

518
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,620
who compressed that sound attack

519
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,460
through the tuba

520
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,000
that we were talking about before

521
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,540
nor did I know that Carl Sagan

522
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,460
was a famous pot smoker.

523
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,480
Yes, he was.

524
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,600
He was a pot smoker.

525
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,420
He didn't talk about it

526
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,920
until he was about to die

527
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,700
of old age or something.

528
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,280
But he did.

529
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,060
Yeah.

530
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,760
Of pot smoking.

531
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,580
He's about to die.

532
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,160
Pot smoker.

533
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,920
He finally made it.

534
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,120
Yep.

535
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,680
Been a pot smoker every day for years.

536
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,220
Fool him.

537
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,740
His last words were

538
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,940
pass that over here, please.

539
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,520
Yeah.

540
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
The compression's deep too.

541
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,320
I guess when you're dying

542
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,240
and stuff like that

543
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,860
and you want somebody

544
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,180
to smoke a joint with you

545
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,540
and everything.

546
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,420
If they were to lift you up

547
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,680
there'd be like real dark,

548
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,120
deep bun ridges

549
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
and head ridges

550
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,740
from where you've been

551
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,680
laying in a pillow

552
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,520
for a long time.

553
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,800
That must be what happened to Philo

554
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,680
because he was a pot smoker.

555
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,280
That's what happened

556
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,480
to Mr. X too

557
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,800
but they're confused

558
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,020
about his real identity

559
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,240
so they just call him

560
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,260
Mr. and Mrs. X

561
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,860
in case he shows up.

562
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,620
I didn't know he was married.

563
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,880
Mr. X?

564
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,120
There's a Mrs. X?

565
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,940
He has a transgender personality

566
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,180
where he dresses up

567
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,000
like Betty Fulton

568
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,760
and then he walks across the room

569
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,780
and shakes his hips.

570
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,440
Oh no.

571
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,960
I know X.

572
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,560
Oh yeah.

573
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,340
He was at X Day.

574
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,080
X was at X Day

575
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,260
and he was on the show.

576
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,780
I got tired

577
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,680
after two hours.

578
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:33,680


579
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:33,680


580
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,120
I said,

581
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,120
somebody come up here.

582
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,720
Anyone from the audience.

583
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,140
Well, there was only one person

584
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,860
in the audience

585
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,560
and that was him.

586
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,240
It was X.

587
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:40,980
X.

588
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,900
And he came up

589
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,520
and sat down in my place

590
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,480
and held his own pretty well

591
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
with Hal and Philo.

592
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,000
He did.

593
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,040
He was fairly sparkling and funny.

594
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,620
So your rants were held down

595
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,480
by the appearance of X.

596
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:53,960
No.

597
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,280
I wanted X to get up

598
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,440
and relieve me.

599
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,920
Tell some trigonometry jokes

600
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,600
and stuff, right?

601
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:00,900
Yeah.

602
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,340
Yeah, and he did.

603
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,980
He was great.

604
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,400
He was great.

605
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,480
He was really pretty funny.

606
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,240
World's smartest

607
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,560
Trump

608
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,200
versus the world's

609
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,080
dumbest genius.

610
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,580
That would be Bob.

611
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,260
And who would win?

612
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,120
It's really

613
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,160
because the world's

614
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,840
dumbest genius

615
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,160
is a little bit dumber

616
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,980
than the world's

617
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,740
smartest Trump.

618
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,280
Well, dumb

619
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,300
could be interpreted

620
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,160
in a number

621
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,860
of different ways.

622
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,580
I know.

623
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,560
If you

624
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,640
dumb as someone

625
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,500
who doesn't talk.

626
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,120
Have the resources

627
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,800
but not

628
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,920
employ them

629
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,480
to solve

630
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:33,680
the problem.

631
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,760
The problem is

632
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,360
a dumb thing to do.

633
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,620
So if you're

634
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,860
a dumb genius

635
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,260
by definition

636
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,600
since you can't talk

637
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,520
you're probably

638
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,360
almost certainly

639
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,620
definitely not

640
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,580
a subgenius

641
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:45,860
because

642
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,800
well,

643
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,100
here we are.

644
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,200
You might be

645
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
a dumbass though.

646
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,220
I might be.

647
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,900
A dumb, dumb bullet.

648
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,640
You might be

649
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,500
a dumbass.

650
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
Well, I think

651
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,780
I reworked that old thing.

652
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,140
But maybe I just

653
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,420
act like a dumbass.

654
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,500
Yes.

655
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,240
So everybody

656
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,120
will treat you

657
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,640
like an equal.

658
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,180
It's a good method.

659
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,080
Good plan of attack.

660
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,560
Act like a dumbass.

661
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,820
It's the, you know,

662
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,780
it's disarming

663
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,280
people.

664
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,980
But what kind of an ass?

665
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,780
They're so stupid

666
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,960
they can't hurt us.

667
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah.

668
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,840
People feel friendly

669
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,440
toward you.

670
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,680
Do I need to act like

671
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,500
for them to treat me

672
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,920
like a superior being?

673
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,100
You've got to start

674
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
by being treated

675
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,820
like an equal.

676
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Then after that

677
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,420
you can aspire

678
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,680
to a superior being.

679
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,300
Superior being status.

680
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,700
But I want to

681
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,840
perspire to greatness.

682
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,620
So we want to leap

683
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,800
from the low status

684
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,780
to the high status

685
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,880
without going through

686
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,080
the various changes

687
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,560
of degree

688
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,200
and slight alterations

689
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,460
of the personality

690
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,540
to leave them.

691
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,520
So you're going to be

692
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,080
doing those

693
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,700
ontogenetic reverations

694
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,180
on me again,

695
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,760
is that right?

696
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm just suggesting

697
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,460
you may.

698
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,240
You know,

699
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,420
as a sort of

700
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:05,900
pig,

701
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,660
as a sort of

702
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,720
guidance counseling

703
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,600
thing,

704
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,140
to try to

705
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,660
suggest.

706
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,760
I mean,

707
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,680
I already gave up

708
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,360
my 47th chromosome

709
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,220
because you said

710
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,260
it wasn't doing nothing.

711
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,660
Well,

712
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,900
I wouldn't want

713
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,220
to be

714
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,400
misunderstood.

715
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,520
And now my hat

716
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,100
don't fit.

717
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,240
So I've got to

718
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,820
work harder

719
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,900
so I can buy myself

720
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,720
a new hat.

721
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,940
That doesn't seem

722
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,580
worth it, man.

723
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,120
Why all the hats

724
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,780
in the world

725
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,500
will be yours

726
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,300
in a few days.

727
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,060
Oh, you're probably

728
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,040
talking about that

729
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,720
revulsion X

730
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,960
that, you know,

731
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,760
X day is coming.

732
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,620
X marks the spot.

733
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,960
X is the answer.

734
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,760
If X is the answer,

735
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,700
what is the question?

736
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,520
The question is why?

737
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,180
X, why?

738
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,560
I can only say

739
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,460
you must be hard up

740
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:00,900
for religion

741
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,880
if you want to smoke

742
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,320
a smoke.

743
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,660
Smoke a book.

744
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,140
A bunch of X.

745
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,600
Yeah, if you want

746
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,140
to smoke too many Xs.

747
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
X, not speaking

748
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,060
specifically of Xs,

749
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,440
my friend.

750
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,740
I'm speaking of Xs.

751
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,020
X equals MC Square Dance.

752
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,100
MC.

753
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,340
That sounds horrible.

754
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,940
I'm MC Square Dance.

755
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,040
No, nobody's ever

756
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,800
used that name.

757
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,200
MC Square Dance.

758
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,180
It would take a minute

759
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,680
to, especially in a club

760
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,320
where they were selling

761
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,080
a lot of E.

762
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,400
Right.

763
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,680
You know,

764
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,280
where'd you get all that E

765
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,120
you're tripping on?

766
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,060
And you'd go,

767
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,900
E equals MC Square Dance.

768
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,020
And MC Square Dance

769
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,620
would be up there

770
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,800
playing square dance music

771
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
and all the disco hipsters

772
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,080
on Ecstasy

773
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,060
would be doing

774
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,580
very, very bad imitations

775
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,860
of, you know,

776
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,820
formulaic square dancing.

777
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:55,980
Yeah.

778
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,220
I can see it all right now.

779
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,680
I don't know.

780
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,460
I think you'd make

781
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,060
a lot of money

782
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,840
but you'd have to sell

783
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,720
an awful lot of cowboy hats

784
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,560
and yellow buses

785
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:03,680
and all that stuff.

786
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,620
And E.

787
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,720
You'd have to sell

788
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,040
a lot of E

789
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,000
and Ecstasy

790
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,500
and...

791
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,080
Oh, yeah.

792
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,620
And...

793
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,100
What's...

794
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,020
MOL...

795
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,680
MDA and...

796
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,840
Antler Dust.

797
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,840
Yeah, and MOLLE

798
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,040
and all of those

799
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,960
different drugs.

800
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,560
Tiger Ball.

801
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,460
MDMA and MOLLE

802
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,020
and E and Ecstasy

803
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,000
and all of those things.

804
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,040
You might even...

805
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,660
Each one of them.

806
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,840
But don't mix them, man.

807
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,960
Don't mix them.

808
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,520
And whatever you do,

809
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,540
stay away from the

810
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,680
hydrogen dioxins.

811
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:33,680


812
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,000
No other way.

813
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,000


814
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,680
I thought I'd revved up

815
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,560
my motor pretty well.

816
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,340
But now I learned about

817
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,260
porting and relieving

818
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,640
the block,

819
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,520
cylinder bore,

820
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
racing flywheels,

821
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,900
custom camshafts,

822
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,440
exhaust headers,

823
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,220
dual exhaust,

824
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,280
tolerances,

825
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:46,880
new ignition,

826
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,040
high compression heads,

827
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,000
hemispherical combustion chambers,

828
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,680
dual carbs,

829
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
dual point distributors,

830
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,540
dual intake.

831
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,620
Well,

832
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,980
I needed a mechanics dictionary

833
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,860
to even follow

834
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,880
what they were talking about.

835
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,340
guitar solo

836
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,040
guitar solo

837
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,360
guitar solo

838
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,000
What superhero feeds the bears?

839
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,500
Uh...

840
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:33,680
Uh...

841
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:33,760
Uh...

842
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,640
Ranger Smith?

843
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,440
Oh, yeah.

844
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,900
That's it.

845
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,120
Oh, yeah.

846
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,140
Hey, everybody.

847
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,700
We're at X-Day.

848
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,040
That brings to mind

849
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,800
that fabulous John Kay

850
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,940
Yogi Bear cartoon.

851
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,980
Isn't that wonderful?

852
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,480
I'd like to see that one again.

853
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,260
It's a Ranger Smith cartoon, actually.

854
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,780
Boo-Boo Goes Feral.

855
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,440
Oh, yeah.

856
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,360
Boo-Boo Goes Wild.

857
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Because they realize

858
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,180
that they're bears.

859
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,020
Right.

860
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,300
They're still a bear.

861
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,160
They might look cuddly

862
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,680
and everything else,

863
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
but they're still bears.

864
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,020
He takes off his bow tie

865
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,320
and slobbers.

866
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,620
He goes,

867
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:03,760
he goes,

868
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,900
I have it on DVD.

869
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,860
Well, first they leave the cave

870
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,720
and they're reminded

871
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,700
by Ranger Smith

872
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,680
that every animal

873
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,620
in Jellystone Park

874
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,060
has to wear at least one item

875
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,020
of human clothing.

876
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,940
So they go back

877
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,040
and they get their little hat

878
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,960
and necktie

879
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,440
and so forth.

880
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:19,920
But eventually

881
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,960
they give it all up

882
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,760
and they're out there

883
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,880
surrounded with flies

884
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,820
and feces

885
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,320
and slobber.

886
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,380
And then when,

887
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,900
when, uh,

888
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,100
what's it, Daisy Bear?

889
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,820
Who's the female?

890
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,640
Cindy Bear.

891
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,580
Yeah, Cindy Bear.

892
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,740
Cindy Bear sees Boo-Boo

893
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,600
in his feral house.

894
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,860
In feral state,

895
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,700
she goes native.

896
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,140
Yep.

897
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,960
And pretty soon

898
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,020
they're both in the bushes.

899
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,480
Arrgh!

900
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,520
Arrgh!

901
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Arrgh!

902
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,040
And Ben,

903
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,740
he's horrified.

904
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,040
That's a great cartoon.

905
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,500
And Ranger Smith is going,

906
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,440
Yogi,

907
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,260
I'm going to have to shoot Boo-Boo.

908
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,560
You know,

909
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,820
what the rule book says.

910
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,320
When,

911
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,520
when they get this way,

912
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,060
I have to,

913
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,300
I'm going to have to put a bullet

914
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,880
through his head.

915
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,560
You know,

916
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,240
Yogi can't argue with it.

917
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,340
They're,

918
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,520
they're about to do it.

919
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,800
This isn't,

920
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,120
this is an actual cartoon.

921
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,800
Yeah.

922
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,060
Yeah.

923
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,300
This is,

924
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:03,580
this is,

925
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:03,880
they,

926
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,440
they did make these,

927
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,640
they end up

928
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,000
clawing each other's buttocks

929
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,560
into bloody shreds

930
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,640
in the joyful finale

931
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,380
of the,

932
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,060
of the cartoon.

933
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,880
Well,

934
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,120
it's like,

935
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,740
what would happen

936
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,720
if real nature

937
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,820
entered the Hanna-Barbera universe?

938
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,100
Oh,

939
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,260
yeah.

940
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,420
You have to put Boo-Boo down.

941
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,000
Deputy Dog.

942
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:21,840
Yep.

943
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,080
Oh,

944
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,580
let's not go there.

945
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,060
No,

946
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,040
let's not go there.

947
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,340
Deputy Dog is not,

948
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,760
I don't believe

949
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,220
He also did the Jetsons too.

950
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,600
They did a version of the Jetsons

951
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,120
like the,

952
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,200
Really?

953
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,100
He did.

954
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,320
Well,

955
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,560
that was,

956
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,480
that one would be well worth

957
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,520
catching up with.

958
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,840
John Kay.

959
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,240
He's in the

960
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,140
Clampett School of,

961
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,560
Clampett Style.

962
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,100
Yeah.

963
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,380
Yeah.

964
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,100
Boy,

965
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,640
he sure got shafted,

966
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,080
didn't he?

967
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,460
Well,

968
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:48,700
yeah.

969
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,280
John Kay.

970
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,060
Just like anything.

971
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,200
Hope Judy plays a prominent role.

972
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,260
I thought she was hot.

973
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,020
Of course she was.

974
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,520
She was like,

975
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,440
what's her name

976
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,220
from Lost in Space?

977
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,540
Linda Clark.

978
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,140
Yeah,

979
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,440
Penny.

980
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:01,880
Penny.

981
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh,

982
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,220
my God.

983
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,620
Judy.

984
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:03,640
Yeah,

985
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:03,980
Judy.

986
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,180
Judy was,

987
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,520
wasn't Judy the mom?

988
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,120
Judy is the daughter.

989
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,520
Who was Penny?

990
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,420
Penny was the,

991
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,520
Penny is on Lost in Space.

992
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,600
That's what I said.

993
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,100
Yes.

994
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
On Lost in Space,

995
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,500
it was,

996
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,200
it was Penny.

997
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,820
Yes,

998
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,120
Penny.

999
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,440
Well,

1000
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,820
there was like a teenage girl,

1001
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,240
a mom,

1002
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,140
a teenage girl,

1003
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,340
and a 12-year-old girl.

1004
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:21,580
Right.

1005
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:21,880
Well,

1006
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,360
I was 12 at the time.

1007
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:23,640
Right,

1008
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,180
so that'd be Penny.

1009
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,720
Therefore,

1010
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,640
it was okay for me

1011
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,760
to think certain ways

1012
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,300
about this underage girl.

1013
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:31,980
Right,

1014
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,080
I mean,

1015
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,820
you're talking about

1016
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,600
the Jetsons or Lost in Space.

1017
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,940
I was thinking,

1018
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,180
when I was 12,

1019
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,180
I was thinking about

1020
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,120
the 14-year-old Judy,

1021
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,280
or 16,

1022
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,060
17.

1023
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,580
That's sick.

1024
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,440
Well,

1025
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,400
it wouldn't get you

1026
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,260
very far today.

1027
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,940
It could happen.

1028
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,760
I always thought

1029
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,700
the mom was pretty hot.

1030
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,080
Actually,

1031
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,200
we should never,

1032
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,660
none of us will ever

1033
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,040
be able to run for Senate

1034
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,880
having said the things

1035
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,620
we just said.

1036
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,880
We're tainted forever.

1037
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,520
Good.

1038
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:01,900
Unless the,

1039
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,080
the Senate loosens up.

1040
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,500
I thought just hanging around

1041
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,340
with everybody here

1042
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,080
would just kind of

1043
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,760
taint you for,

1044
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,020
you know.

1045
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,660
It will fully besmirch you

1046
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,920
and darken your career.

1047
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,540
There's way too much

1048
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,200
taint up here,

1049
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,420
as Susie just said

1050
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,860
from the second row.

1051
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,480
There's way too much

1052
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,280
taint up here.

1053
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,140
Well,

1054
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,340
some of us are ready to go,

1055
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,660
willing to serve.

1056
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,000
Yes,

1057
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,200
anytime you want.

1058
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,060
We are willing to

1059
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,040
do something here.

1060
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,700
Yeah,

1061
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,460
I've been sitting here

1062
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,800
jabbering for 55,

1063
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,340
five minutes,

1064
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,280
so anybody else

1065
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,420
who wants my mic,

1066
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,140
you can hunt it.

1067
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,260
Hey, listen,

1068
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,580
you know what'll happen

1069
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,380
if he leaves,

1070
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:39,760
right?

1071
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,400
Mike, hunt.

1072
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,120
Then I can play my shit.

1073
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,000
See,

1074
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,360
so he might want to

1075
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,060
think differently

1076
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,780
about his,

1077
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,000
uh,

1078
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,700
Well,

1079
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,900
you want me to play my shit.

1080
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,160
Oh,

1081
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,280
no,

1082
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:49,580
I do.

1083
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm just saying.

1084
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,300
Oh,

1085
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,600
shit,

1086
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,520
this microphone's on.

1087
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,140
This mic is hot.

1088
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,100
This microphone's hot.

1089
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,340
It's a hot mic.

1090
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,520
Now he's gonna know everything.

1091
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,100
I,

1092
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,800
I'm not in

1093
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,560
with anything

1094
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,820
that the dog is doing.

1095
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,660
Yeah,

1096
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:02,980
sure.

1097
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,220
He didn't,

1098
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,240
he didn't really care.

1099
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,780
You guys are,

1100
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,300
you're a bad influence

1101
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,180
on each other.

1102
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:08,960
You don't,

1103
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,620
Philo's already bad enough.

1104
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,260
He doesn't need

1105
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,020
any encouragement.

1106
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,100
Yeah,

1107
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,420
were you,

1108
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,380
were you brought back,

1109
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,620
held back a grade

1110
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,460
because of some kid

1111
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,340
that you wanted

1112
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,000
to hang around with?

1113
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,500
No.

1114
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,320
No,

1115
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,060
neither was I,

1116
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,020
but could have been.

1117
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,500
Instead,

1118
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,160
he went to a Catholic school.

1119
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,620
Should have been.

1120
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,660
Moved this kid,

1121
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,760
who's my best friend

1122
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,700
in like fourth grade.

1123
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,540
We did,

1124
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,360
you know,

1125
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,500
everything.

1126
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,400
And yeah.

1127
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,380
What kid was this?

1128
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:33,800
thought I was some kind

1129
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,420
of a bad influence,

1130
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,240
so they put him

1131
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,380
in Catholic school after that

1132
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,820
and I would never

1133
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,680
see the kid again

1134
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,380
until high school.

1135
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,820
And did he come out

1136
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,520
a full-fledged Catholic priest?

1137
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,160
I would think so.

1138
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:42,400
Yeah,

1139
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:42,540
no,

1140
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,260
maybe not a priest,

1141
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,620
but,

1142
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,020
you know.

1143
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,000
Oh,

1144
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,360
the other night at,

1145
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,340
we had fireworks

1146
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,940
in our town

1147
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,580
and tons of people

1148
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,180
and this guy,

1149
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,100
these two guys

1150
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,360
in a really hopped up

1151
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,140
brand new-ish Corvette

1152
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,400
come rolling around

1153
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,020
the corner going,

1154
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,560
hey, hey.

1155
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,780
And they're handing out,

1156
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,720
I should have grabbed them,

1157
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,520
but I think they were like

1158
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,660
Chick Tracks or something.

1159
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,640
But it was all about God.

1160
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,160
He was like,

1161
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,080
you need to know God.

1162
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,440
And I go,

1163
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:05,780
dude,

1164
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,160
I am an ordained minister.

1165
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:07,600
And he goes,

1166
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,100
well,

1167
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,420
then here.

1168
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:08,820
And I go,

1169
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,700
I don't want your,

1170
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,040
I know all about your God.

1171
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,680
But Chick Tracks

1172
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,760
are intensely collected.

1173
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:13,860
And then he got pissed at me

1174
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,240
and then he insulted me

1175
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,040
essentially by,

1176
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,520
you know,

1177
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:16,800
saying,

1178
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,040
well,

1179
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,620
if you know God,

1180
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,800
you sure don't like to share.

1181
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,980
And I didn't know

1182
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,500
what that meant

1183
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,280
and I kept saying

1184
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,460
praise Bob after that

1185
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,020
and then we kept,

1186
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,360
and I wanted to ask him,

1187
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:25,600
it's like,

1188
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:25,800
oh,

1189
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,000
did your God help buy you

1190
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,420
that Cadillac or that Corvette?

1191
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,100
Because he probably did.

1192
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,140
They believe in the prosperity gospel.

1193
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:32,580
In the future,

1194
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,120
you should just take the pamphlet

1195
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,580
and grin

1196
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,640
and then like pretend

1197
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,200
like you blow your nose on it.

1198
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,600
Those pamphlets

1199
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,760
are collected

1200
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,240
by Kurt Kirsteiner

1201
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,000
and other unspeakable persons.

1202
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,600
I don't know

1203
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,460
if they were Chick Tracks.

1204
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:44,820
Actually,

1205
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,440
they almost look like business cards.

1206
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,140
And on the back of this Corvette,

1207
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,300
it said dumpster rental.

1208
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,760
So it was his own.

1209
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,400
Now the truth comes out

1210
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,840
about this religion.

1211
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,860
It's like dumpster rental.

1212
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,760
Great big letters.

1213
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,080
I'm like,

1214
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,640
oh yeah,

1215
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,400
you get a nice vet

1216
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,280
confirmation.

1217
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,380
Invertible,

1218
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,020
riding around.

1219
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,580
What would Jesus do

1220
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,440
dumpster rental?

1221
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,300
So much for Buzz and Todd

1222
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,620
and their flashy car.

1223
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,020
But you know,

1224
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,960
they want you to evangelize.

1225
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,980
That's what the thing

1226
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,680
about sharing is all about.

1227
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,700
And I hate your stinking guts.

1228
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,100
I can smell you

1229
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,500
from a thousand miles away

1230
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,420
and you smell like air.

1231
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,780
Oh,

1232
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,120
we just finished breakfast

1233
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,860
that morning

1234
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,320
and Phyllis went out

1235
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,240
on the front porch

1236
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,020
to see if they burned the paper.

1237
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,640
When she noticed something

1238
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,380
sticking up out of the ditch

1239
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,340
over by Mr. Lopez's

1240
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,380
hydrangea bush.

1241
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,860
The neighborhood dogs

1242
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,540
all started circling it

1243
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,620
and making all kinds

1244
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,500
of commotion.

1245
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,160
So I figured I'd better

1246
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,000
go have a look.

1247
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,340
I noticed some blood on it

1248
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,540
once I was about 15 feet away.

1249
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,880
And I was afraid someone had done

1250
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,760
run over one of the dogs.

1251
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,760


1252
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,900
I thought it was a local

1253
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,320
propyopithecus

1254
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,780
that are indigenous

1255
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,800
to these parts.

1256
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,320
But it turned out

1257
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,380
it was just some fella

1258
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,660
in a black uniform

1259
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,900
with leather boots

1260
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,940
and some sort of

1261
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,260
funny looking arm band.

1262
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,500
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1263
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,680
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1264
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,960
He wasn't twitching or nothing.

1265
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,560
So I figured I'd better try

1266
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,460
and flip him over

1267
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,500
with a tree branch

1268
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,180
so I could see if he had

1269
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,300
any personal identification on him.

1270
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,480
Just in case the city road crew

1271
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,780
wanted to notify his next of kin.

1272
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,440
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1273
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,700
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1274
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,200
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1275
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,900
Once I flipped him over

1276
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
I noticed someone had done drilled

1277
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,700
a two inch diameter hole

1278
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,680
in his forehead.

1279
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,080
Some of his brains were sticking out

1280
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,280
like when you mash down too hard

1281
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,120
on some toothpaste.

1282
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,060
There were some bugs

1283
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,920
that bit off a chunk of his face.

1284
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,020
And his eyeballs were looking off

1285
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,120
in different directions.

1286
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,000
Like he wasn't sure where he was coming or going.

1287
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,460
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1288
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,620
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1289
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,080
Dead Nazi by the side of the road.

1290
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,160


1291
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,700
And lie face down

1292
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,340
where the grass got mowed.

1293
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,700
Mrs. Cooper's Cocker Spaniel Rex

1294
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,760
ran up and started

1295
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,320
humping on that hole

1296
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,080
with the brain sticking out of it.

1297
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,060
Lord, I never seen that dog get so excited.

1298
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,000
He was just panting.

1299
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,580
And pumping his little behind

1300
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,000
up and down so hard

1301
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,100
I thought he was going to dislocate one of his hips.

1302
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,140
But after two or three minutes

1303
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,880
he lost control of his doggy bowels.

1304
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,500
He lost control of his doggy bowels.

1305
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:40,500


1306
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,080
Music

1307
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:44,780
Music

1308
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,720
Music

1309
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:46,720


1310
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,300
Music

1311
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:47,300


1312
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,620
Music

1313
00:49:49,620 --> 00:50:00,900
Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music.

1314
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:00,900


1315
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,220
Music Music Music Music Music Music.

1316
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,240
Music Hofhofs Spiel encouraging music.

1317
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,240


1318
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,460
Well, when she finally got up

1319
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,720
the brains was gone.

1320
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,120
But there was a trail of Rex's seed

1321
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,640
oozing up out of the hole

1322
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,520
and Splattered across the deadfeller's mega-cat.

1323
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,280
Philiss had called The City.

1324
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,880
so they pulled up and scraped up what they could.

1325
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,020
But a few days later, I noticed they'd missed a couple of fingers.

1326
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,320
Again for Mr. Lopez, and he's been using them to keep squirrels out of his soffits.

1327
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,220
Dead Nazi by the side of the road

1328
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,600
Dead Nazi by the side of the road

1329
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,880
Dead Nazi by the side of the road

1330
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,160
Lied face down where the grass got mold

1331
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,580
Dead Nazi by the side of the road

1332
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,960
Dead Nazi by the side of the road

1333
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,200
Dead Nazi by the side of the road

1334
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,600
Lied face down where the grass got mold

1335
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,960
Lied face down where the grass got mold

1336
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,280
Lied face down where the grass got mold

1337
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,980
Dead as a rotting corpse at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

1338
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,960
The Rudy Schwartz Project did that song, Dead Nazi by the Side of the Road.

1339
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,540
Good old Rudy and Waldo.

1340
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,360
Before that X-Day conversation featuring guest Reverend Angry Larry,

1341
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,520
we heard the instrumental Cheater Slicks by his band, The Slot Rods.

1342
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,680
And now, the news.

1343
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:37,440
From NPR News in Washington, I'm still a threat and still trying to get weapons, pointing a gun at the camera.

1344
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:44,540
The government jumped by the fastest rate in four years and went up nearly 5% in one hour of work.

1345
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,560
On Wall Street 1456.

1346
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,260
NASA's watching the nation's most extensive Supreme Center.

1347
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,620
It's watched closely because it's a key indicator of NPR News in Washington.

1348
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,360
George W. Bush.

1349
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,020
Moleskine molest.

1350
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,160
Yatka vichyta. Yatchit vichyta. Chytatka vichyta.

1351
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,860
Papagool.

1352
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,700
He knows it's more than a haircut.

1353
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,120
We're partying here.

1354
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:20,880
Dave can't hear it, but we're all marching around like a big circus in Felliniland.

1355
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Now we're not. Now we're not.

1356
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,780
Oh, the part, the parade went by.

1357
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,540
It's the fight we heard in the distance.

1358
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:39,060
Some of these interpretations of this music I have never heard before.

1359
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,480
It's crazy.

1360
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,880
Crazy stuff.

1361
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,340
Can you hear?

1362
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,560
I can hear.

1363
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:56,820
Oh.

1364
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:01,960
Thankfully.

1365
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,920
I don't hear those.

1366
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:03,940
Do they bother you when they're together?

1367
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,140
They're, they're friends.

1368
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1369
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1370
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1371
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1372
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1373
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1374
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1375
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1376
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1377
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1378
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1379
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1380
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,140


1381
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,880
They're doing it too fast.

1382
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,160
See, I did three of them so far and you don't even have me, my microphone on.

1383
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,180
And you can't even hear it.

1384
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,780
It's a lot of notes, too.

1385
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,820
Dave knows this.

1386
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,960
And Dave knows it, though.

1387
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,940
He just sang it.

1388
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,860
Yeah, it is a wonderful soundtrack for a wonderful movie.

1389
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,960
It's one of the few movies I've watched every year.

1390
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,400
Wait, I haven't watched it in three years.

1391
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,720
Uh-oh.

1392
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:31,120
We better pull out our eight-and-a-half subtitled DVD.

1393
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,000
Are you building a rocket ship, and do you have, like, many different types of female affairs?

1394
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,040
No.

1395
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,680
Well, no, there was a short, there was a real brief time when I thought,

1396
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:51,140
this movie is just like my life, only minus the money and Hollywood or Shinichita

1397
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:56,800
or any of the beautiful zillions of affairs.

1398
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:04,000
Well, he was only having one affair with that babe.

1399
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,000
Who, Claudia Cardinale?

1400
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,700
No.

1401
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,720
No, I forget.

1402
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,540
And our audience is too young to even know what the hell we're talking about.

1403
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,700
There's like three people going, oh, yeah, eight-and-a-half.

1404
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,660
Yeah, that was a weird day.

1405
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,680
It's the polka dots, girl.

1406
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,220
Yeah, these people are all dead by now, too.

1407
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,620
They're 20 years dead.

1408
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,200
Yeah, even the young people are already dead by now.

1409
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,780
So I don't even know why the hell we're talking about this stuff.

1410
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,140
By the time the show comes out, we'll be dead.

1411
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,920
I'm not an in-think.

1412
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,820
It is of historical interest, dear.

1413
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,980
It is?

1414
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,420
Yes.

1415
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,380
Yes, somebody has discovered.

1416
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:40,880
Historical interest.

1417
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,180
One of these days, they'll discover it, and everything will be just peachy, creamy, yellow gizzard.

1418
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,940
What happened to Dave?

1419
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,500
Screaming yellow gizzard, huh?

1420
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,280
Did you just shrink?

1421
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,240
Did I shrink?

1422
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,160
Oh, it's big again now.

1423
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,540
There he is again.

1424
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,480
Oh, I can't.

1425
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,040
I don't know.

1426
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,740
You were shrinking me and deflating me and inflating and coflating.

1427
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,400
Well, you were talking like this, and then you got smaller and smaller and smaller.

1428
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:13,260
I was like, you were like just a little atom-sized voice, and then suddenly you were back big again.

1429
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,320
Well, don't you think that's important?

1430
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,400
Don't you think that's earth-shattering that I can do that?

1431
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,400
He's, well, Tickman, Ant-Man and Tickman.

1432
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,700
You think I'm going to be able to mess around over here and smoke frop all day or something like that?

1433
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,140
I wish.

1434
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,120
Ant-Man and Tickman can do that, but they're just characters.

1435
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,980
Wait a minute.

1436
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,100
Dave's a character, too.

1437
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:31,960
Yeah.

1438
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,720
He can do all kinds of stuff.

1439
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,260
Yeah.

1440
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:34,900
Yeah.

1441
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,140
He's on the radio.

1442
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:41,320
Never forget you and your character, and make sure that plenty of people will never let you forget your character.

1443
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,740
Yeah, Dave's a character.

1444
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,540
He could have long hair or short hair.

1445
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,920
He could be a giraffe or a person or a penguin.

1446
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:51,980
He's a character.

1447
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,160
He could be wearing cowboy boots or sandals.

1448
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,680
Yeah.

1449
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,540
He could be a...

1450
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,260
Any way you want to look at things from the upside down.

1451
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,900
Well, you're a lonesome cowboy, so you have to have the cowboy boots and the hat.

1452
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,620
And you have to be lonesome.

1453
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,120
And you've got to be singing the lonesome wail, moan the lonesome phone.

1454
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,500
Yeah.

1455
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,420
But otherwise, you could be any...

1456
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,120
Yeah.

1457
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,200
Yeah.

1458
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,140
One of these days, you know, I'll get around to it, I'm sure.

1459
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,340
Characters can fly.

1460
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,560
Characters have super strength if they need to.

1461
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,360
Characters.

1462
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,700
Yeah.

1463
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,640
Characters, sure.

1464
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

1465
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,360
Yeah.

1466
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,880
Characters, sure.

1467
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,820
But this...

1468
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,700
Okay.

1469
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,360
But Dave, look, it's getting late here.

1470
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,400
The sun's going down.

1471
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,220
What time is it?

1472
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,280
What time is it?

1473
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,560
It's 3957.

1474
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,520
That's pretty long.

1475
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,820
That gives me 20 minutes of music, which...

1476
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,440
And what we just heard was, you know, that kind of thing.

1477
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,780
Yeah, all that stuff.

1478
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,820
I'll have to do that part later.

1479
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:57,820
Okay.

1480
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,060
Yeah.

1481
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:03,640
But that means I still have time, daylight, to walk the dogs and mark a trail.

1482
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,440
Because I'm Mark Trail, Bob-looking character.

1483
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,420
Some people would say Bob looks like Mark Trail.

1484
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,100
But Bob was born in the 20s.

1485
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,880
And Mark Trail's just a drawn comic book guy.

1486
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,900
You're a comic strip, newspaper strip character, right?

1487
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,940
I'm not familiar with it.

1488
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,980
Yeah, yeah.

1489
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,320
It looks like Bob.

1490
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,260
Look it up in your funk and waggon.

1491
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,280
Yeah, Dave.

1492
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:33,940
Okay.

1493
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,220
Well, we're going to go now.

1494
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,020
And we'll release you.

1495
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,200
And you can go back and immerse yourself into the buzz.

1496
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,740
Rejoin the buzz, Dave.

1497
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,100
Go into the buzz.

1498
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,640
No, wait.

1499
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,020
Turn around.

1500
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:52,880
Don't go into the buzz.

1501
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,780
Don't go into the buzz.

1502
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,140
The monsters are in there.

1503
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,520
It's hell.

1504
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,120
No.

1505
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,500
Whoa.

1506
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:03,900
He did.

1507
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,440
He hung up.

1508
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,000
He hung up.

1509
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,420
Well, friends, this is my excuse to say you've been listening to the Hour of Slack number

1510
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,640
1,757.

1511
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,500
Yay, we got another one done.

1512
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,420
57.

1513
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,000
All right.

1514
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1515
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,200
All right.

1516
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:32,460
And if you want to know more about the Hour of Slack, Church of the Subgenius, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1517
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,620
or pretty much anything else, go to the Hour of Slack.com.

1518
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,560
Anything that is not worth knowing.

1519
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,840
Or it's opposite.

1520
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,060
TrySubgenius.com.

1521
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,000
Praise Bob.

1522
00:58:54,660 --> 00:59:00,240
And now that we're in the section that's not on broadcast radio, I can tell you that the

1523
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,600
Slack Friday sale is going to be on the air.

1524
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,160
The sale is still going on through Excessless Nesmus.

1525
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
December 24th, conspiracy dating.

1526
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:15,980
You can get two Subgenius ordainment kits for the price of one.

1527
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,800
Although, albeit, the postage of two.

1528
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,600
It's not the same price as buying one because of the postage.

1529
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,940
But, friends, and you can get Lonesome Cowboy Dave's book, Neighbor World, directly from,

1530
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,160
well, not from Dave, but from me.

1531
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,620
Yeah.

1532
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,580
Personally, I'll be the one who stuffs it into the book.

1533
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:33,580


1534
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:33,840
I'll be the one who does the envelope.

1535
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,040
They go to Subgenius.com to order it, eh?

1536
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:36,920
Subgenius.com.

1537
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:36,980
Yeah.

1538
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,860
Subgenius.com.

1539
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,920
Subgenius.com.

1540
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:45,560
And Dave, and also, if you look at the radio section of Subgenius.com, I'm not lying, all

1541
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:52,800
of the Hours of Slack from number one through number 1757 are there.

1542
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,540
Or will be there after I quit talking.

1543
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,920
Available to delight your eardrums.

1544
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,220
Yeah.

1545
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,460
And also, you can...

1546
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,500
There's a link.

1547
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,220
There's a link to donate to Dave.

1548
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:12,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, well, just between you, me, and the public listening to the internet,

1549
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,140
Dave's pretty perpetually broke.

1550
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:22,360
He used to work as a newspaper reporter, but the newspaper's all closed down.

1551
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,700
And there is a GoFundMe.

1552
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,680
And as much as I'd love to tell people to help me personally, Dave needs it more.

1553
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,100
Yeah.

1554
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,080
A lot more.

1555
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:33,640
Yeah.

1556
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,160
And so, be like Anonymous.

1557
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:44,740
That great guy, Anonymous, who gave Dave 500 bucks last week when I told him, no, give

1558
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,380
it to Dave.

1559
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,740
Mm-mm-mm.

1560
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,600
I really did.

1561
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,420
I know.

1562
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,200
He was going to give it to me, and I said, no, give it to Dave.

1563
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:51,220


1564
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,120
You're a wonderful person.

1565
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,900
No, I'm not.

1566
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,960
I just...

1567
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,540
What?

1568
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,900
No, you are a wonderful person.

1569
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,340
I can't do what Dave does.

1570
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
We need him.

1571
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,960
I can't talk like that.

1572
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,360
I know.

1573
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,500
I can try, but it wouldn't be the same.

1574
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:03,560
I know.

1575
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:03,560


1576
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:03,560


1577
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:03,560


1578
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,660
It'd be like trying to play like Jimi Hendrix.

1579
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,420
Sure, for about three seconds, you can do it.

1580
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,680
Okay.

1581
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:11,860
Friends...

1582
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,260
Oh, and what else?

1583
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,820
Oh, Triology Soap.

1584
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,240
Have you tried Triology Soap from TriologySoap.com?

1585
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,060
That's T-R-I, not T-R-Y.

1586
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,820
TriologySoap.com.

1587
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:31,860
Our good friend, Lord Ferg, makes Triology Soap, including numerous flavors and scents

1588
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,280
of Dobbshead.

1589
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,360
Yes.

1590
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,040
Yes.

1591
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:42,040
Soap shaped like a Dobbshead embedded in a square bar of translucent other soap.

1592
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,680
It's not only good soap, it's high-quality glycerin soap.

1593
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,620
It's delightfully wonderful to use.

1594
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,260
Yeah.

1595
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,260
TriologySoaps.com.

1596
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,840
Subgenius.com.

1597
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,420
Woof!

1598
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:33,540
Soap shaped like a Dobbshead embedded in a square bar of translucent other soap.

1599
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:34,760
Thank you.
