1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,720
Achtung! Achtung! All cruise cars be on the lookout for strange invaders

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,060
believed to have landed from outer space somewhere in the vicinity of Berlin.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,500
Car input, computers, tapes, all go.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,420
Place of the encycling normal cryogenic systems go.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,260
Cathodes at 67,000 volts and steady.

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,940
Time selector set at present.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,760
All set, Al. Stand by for a time synchronization.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,280
Standing by.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,400
Date, 5 July, 64.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,500
Time, 11 hours, 14 minutes.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,740
Counting.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,060
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,300
Mark.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,300
Mark.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,180
Right.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Mark.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,020
And by to activate image stabilizer switch.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,100
Ready.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,040
Switch on.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,760
Switch on.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,900
This is an hour that comes to all,

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,360
except in states that don't have daylight saving.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,900
I, sir, was referring to your...

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,820
So genius.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,900
Power of...

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,060
The dead.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,640
Kill me.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,380
Never laugh.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,080
I heard there's a man down there.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,640
He pays folks money, singing to his cane.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,660
They say he pays next year.

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,140
If you play real good.

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,600
Join us now for the Bob Hour, coming to you from the campus of Bob.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,260
Join us now for the Bob Hour, coming to you from the campus of Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,780
Study the essence of Bob, which, by the way, is the official name of our savior, according to the flesh.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You've been listening to Bob onvenue,

37
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,760
coming to you from the campus of Bob.

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,180
Spirit preferably the lion.

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,180


40
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,180


41
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,920
Send a check, send a.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,140
Manly take me easy.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,200
All, until death I fall apart.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,220
Bob's skin.

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
Bob.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,400
Just blows me away.

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,160
Bob's skin.

48
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,260
Bob.

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,380
Just blows me away.

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,160
All night and day.

51
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,780
Join us now for the Bob Hour coming to you from the campus of Bob.

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,320
Our speaker today is Bob.

53
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,960
What the hell is going on?

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,460
What the hell is going on?

55
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,300
Join us now for the Bob Hour coming to you from the campus of Bob.

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
Our speaker today is Bob.

57
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,660
Sponsored by Bob.

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,180
Why, this is bigger than the Whispering Steeple in Kansas City.

59
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,940
It's bigger than the Headless Ballet Dancer in Dublin, Ireland.

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,000
And it's even bigger than the day our dear Teresa received that personal message from Rudolph Valentino in Toledo.

61
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,320
Cool!

62
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,080
Cool!

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,200
What is it?

64
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,620
To steer, you gotta turn the handlebars.

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
Break if you must.

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,380
Do it!

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,900
Okay, here we go.

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Ten, nine, eight...

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,040
Wait a minute!

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
What are you doing?

71
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm putting a frog in the room!

72
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,520
Rock it!

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,040
Is that a good idea?

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,960
It is if you want to be the owner of a frog that breaks the world record for traveling in space!

75
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,420
Is the frog gonna be okay?

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,020
I guess so.

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,880
This is just a test anyway.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,180
Besides, he has a space suit!

79
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
It looks like he's just wrapped in tinfoil.

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,100
That is correct!

81
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,140
Let the countdown continue!

82
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,220
Eight!

83
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,320
Seven!

84
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,460
Five!

85
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,240
Wait!

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,280
Wait!

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,360
Seven!

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Five!

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,160
No, wait!

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,680
Stop!

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,760
I don't like this.

92
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,300
I didn't build this rocket just so you could send some poor little defenseless frog into outer space.

93
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Well, that's why I bought it!

94
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,040
Besides, this is just a test!

95
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,100
The real launch comes later!

96
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,580
And then my little frog will break a world record!

97
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,660
For being the only frog to fly!

98
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,200
And then my little frog will break a world record!

99
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,340
Into outer space!

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,700
Then I'll be even more famous than I am now!

101
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
You're famous now?

102
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,860
I thought you were just kidding.

103
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,900
But it doesn't matter!

104
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,000
I still don't like this.

105
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,880
Five, four, three, two, one, blast off!

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,880
Wow!

107
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,500
Look how powerful that engine is!

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,240
This is a great rocket engine you've built for me!

109
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,980
It pushed so much air!

110
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,040
It knocked that statue right over!

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,480
Unbelievable!

112
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,140
Look at this frog!

113
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,480
He's scared to death!

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,820
Beware the Beast-Man, for he is the Devil's Pawn.

115
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,680
Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust, or greed.

116
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,600
Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land.

117
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,720
Let him not breed in great numbers,

118
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,820
for he will make a desert of his home and yours.

119
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,380
Shun him.

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,780
Drive him back into his jungle lair,

121
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,860
for he is the harbinger of death.

122
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Oh, look.

123
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,840
I appear to be lying at the bottom of a very deep, dark hole.

124
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,140
That seems a familiar concept.

125
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,100
What does it remind me of?

126
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,640
Ah, I remember.

127
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,980
Life.

128
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,960
Yep.

129
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,920
I said it before and I'll say it again.

130
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,380
Life moves pretty fast.

131
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,100
You don't stop and look around once in a while.

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,320
You could miss it.

133
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,260
So very wise.

134
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,860
Well, we missed it, because it was cancelled.

135
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,740
Uh, that Cytopia doping festival in Jamaica, that is.

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
Gee, I wonder how that happened.

137
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,620
But friends, we vacated anyway.

138
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:18,960
We're going to the next festival.

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,360
Also, we got to attend the annual Devotional in Akron,

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,700
and a Devo concert, which will inform our shows as they come along.

141
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,620
And we slaked our slack-off need.

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,500
But L'Emoire didn't, nor Norell.

143
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,260
Norell Preff did some of our openings, as did, as always,

144
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,040
Mr. F. L'Emoire, and also Puzzling Evidence.

145
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,920
And, um...

146
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,980
We have a lot of wonderful movie clips for this and upcoming shows

147
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,340
from various movies that came in from a new member,

148
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,480
Reverend Jacques Patti, a W.O.R.T. listener

149
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,460
in, uh, around Madison, Wisconsin.

150
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,460
Praise W.O.R.T.

151
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,460
He sent this huge stash of audio and notions.

152
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,620
And in general, friends, there's going to be lots of music

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,840
in this all-around hour.

154
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,680
And, uh, in the course of the last hour of Slack Number 1010,

155
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,760
the background music is by Hell Pope Huey.

156
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Uh, but now, here's my dad.

157
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
Well, well.

158
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,240
If it isn't the square bookworm we laughingly refer to as our son.

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

160
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,300
Hey, ya square bookworm!

161
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,200
Have a cigar!

162
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,440
Yeah.

163
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,820
Go ahead, go on.

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,260
Pure Havana, straight from Havana, yeah.

165
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,660
As one who has traveled back in time, Commissioner,

166
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,060
let me tell you, it was an interesting experience.

167
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,580
Where did you plant that terranium bomb, eh?

168
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,840
Where did you bury it?

169
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,600
Slack.

170
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,860
Try to find slack.

171
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,120
In this house.

172
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,500
Mmm, popcorn, peanuts, and real buttery slack.

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,420
It sure tastes good right now.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,300
See what I mean?

175
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,880
Why not? I see it coming.

176
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,540
Why not? I see it coming.

177
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,240
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

178
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,620
See it coming.

179
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,480
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

180
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:32,760
No!

181
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,020
Slack!

182
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Slack!

183
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,040
For many generations,

184
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,280
men have spoken and sung of the romantic, queenly, banjo-plunking negro.

185
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,880
They simply put their children to bed and waited for them to die.

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,460
Help!

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Send us help!

188
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,880
Send us a man to work in his government lab.

189
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,520
To him, the message that assigned him to spend the rest of the day in ignorance and starvation

190
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,660
goes south at once.

191
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,940
Blood from the bodies of dying hog butts and masses.

192
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,480
What if this thing is simply a butt?

193
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,820
But one butt.

194
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,160
Why?

195
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,020
Like a good doctor laughing at the fact that he knew that the man would die insane.

196
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,500
What butt behind him?

197

and go grooving out someplace,

213
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,360
just remember, somebody in an office someplace

214
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
is rubbing his hands together

215
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,100
and saying what a wonderful thing it is

216
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,980
that you're so tore up that you'll never be able

217
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,120
to think your way out of the stuff that they lay on you.

218
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,600
Well, the first thing that you ought to do

219
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,580
is stop using drugs

220
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,980
and start paying attention to what's really going on

221
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,520
and stop believing what everybody tells you

222
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,960
in the newspapers and on television

223
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
and read between the lines

224
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,020
and get it through your head

225
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,540
that the best thing that you can be

226
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,160
if you want to stay alert as an American today

227
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,380
is be cynical.

228
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,500
Cynicism is a positive value

229
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,920
and the more cynical you are,

230
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,100
the better off you're going to be.

231
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,460
We as a nation have decided to choose cheese

232
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,600
as a way of life

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,940
and we always seem to opt for the cheesiest

234
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,060
of whatever is available

235
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,460
because we now believe thoroughly

236
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,480
whatever the accountants tell us

237
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,540
and all of our decisions that relate to the quality of our lives

238
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,840
are based on the bottom line

239
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,300
and that's the big mistake

240
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,100
and it's those plastic people that you're thinking about

241
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,620
are the ones that have bought that idea

242
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,960
and live by it

243
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,460
and if you can just remember

244
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,000
that you're going to have a better life

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,480
with more beautiful things in it,

246
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,380
if you realize that the best things

247
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,580
that you can consume

248
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,240
are not necessarily the things that you have to buy.

249
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
You hear that, man?

250
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,600
That's pretty.

251
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,900
You hear it, man?

252
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,900
I'm going to go.

253
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,620
I'm going to go.

254
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,540
But when my pace has fallen slack, I catch myself thinking back.

255
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,840
A certain night, a certain summer, long gone long.

256
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,140
August, she was swinging low, town of about a thousand.

257
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,400
So out of school, ready to get out of here.

258
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,300
Off to farm, off to state, each going our separate ways.

259
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,340
Graduation message still sweet in our ears.

260
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:20,000
Whoa, come singing now, man these clocks are slowing.

261
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,700
Heart beat on and on and long gone long.

262
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,280
Got into a car that night, drove out past the street.

263
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,080
Signal light, past the city limits, guess it wasn't that far.

264
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Stopped out on a rural route, Gooch got out his 22.

265
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,020
Shooting at a freight train that was hauling new cars.

266
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,460
Drinking underneath the stars, watching counting meteors.

267
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
Robert said, you know those fell a hundred years ago.

268
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,200
The light is just now reaching earth.

269
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,140
I said, man.

270
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,160
For what it's worth, I think you were wrong.

271
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,300
And you really don't know.

272
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,140
Whoa, come singing now, clocks are slowing.

273
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:30,040
Heart beat on and on and long gone long.

274
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,400
There's something going on.

275
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,280
I tell you now.

276
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
Nothing's going on.

277
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,740
Nothing's going on.

278
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,760
Going on, going on.

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,820
There's something going on.

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,020
I tell you nothing's going on.

281
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,120
Nothing's going on.

282
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,400
Going on.

283
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Goodbye to the home team, goodbye to the rinky dinks.

284
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,980
Goodbye to a girl down my street heading home, she stepped out from behind me.

285
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,060
And a tree tears are running down her cheeks

286
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,140
Goodbye to more than either of us could have known

287
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,220
La la la la la la la la la la la la

288
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,020

La la la la la la la la la la la

291
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,180
Some apes it seems are more equal than others

292
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,560
Ridiculous! Tell us bright eyes

293
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,180
Why do men have no souls?

294
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,100
What is the proof that a divine spark exists

295
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,180
in the simian brain?

296
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,280
Ah!

297
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,620
Oh well he's very popular Ed

298
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,240
The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts,

299
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,280
bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads

300
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,140
They all adore him

301
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,840
They think he's a righteous dude

302
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,300
Cigarette butts on the ground

303
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,300
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack

304
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,540

Friends, alt.slack on Usenet is where all

328
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,220
the latest news is happening and

329
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,100

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,920
lovely contributions as these.

331
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,280
Okay, well, all right. So we will ask one

332
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,080
more question.

333
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,300
Okay, so we will ask one more question

334
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,340
from this stack of questions and I hope

335
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,540
that for your sake. Do them fast. Do a speed

336
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,620
round. Okay, here we go. Speed round of

337
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,880
questions. You get a one, you get a one

338
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,800
sentence answer for each of these

339
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,060
questions. Ready? Here we go. Dr. Howell,

340
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,340
one. Why can't white people dance? They're

341
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,540
too worried about it. What does Bob's

342
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,680
wafer taste like? Like a hostess Twinkie.

343
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,020
What is the singular of feces? Sterkos.

344
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,540
My seven-year-old nephew keeps asking

345
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,600
about Bob. What should I tell him? Wait

346
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,280
till you're older, dear. Okay, so much for

347
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,500
deep throat, but who is deep pipe? You're

348
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,320
looking at him. If we get bodily fluids

349
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,500
on our clothing, does it get ruptured

350
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,480
during the rupture or does it just stay

351
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,600
on our clothes? You shall have new

352
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,160
arraignment in a new heaven and a new

353
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,020
earth and don't you dare get those dirty.

354
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,660
And oh, one more question, Dr. Howell.

355
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,680
Better. Charged up. And this, the final

356
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,840
question, the one that you've all been

357
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
waiting all night for, the one we've left

358
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,640
for last because of its great

359
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,040
significance, particularly in a

360
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,060
philosophical mode relative to these

361
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,220
times and this evening. Now you shall

362
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,440
find out the most significant question

363
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,600
this evening. All right, let's have it.

364
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,320
And that question is... Please hold the music,

365
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,060
Reverend Stang. What would that question

366
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,240
be now? Is the chupacabra more of a threat

367
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,640
than the Jersey devil? And especially at

368
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,660
these latitudes. Is the chupacabra more

369
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,620
of a threat than the Jersey devil

370
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,340
at these latitudes? And of course, let's

371
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,780
also throw in Mothman and whatever lake

372
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,520
monster may inhabit our local pond. We

373
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,040
tend to think of all these as threats

374
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,160
and menaces and indeed they are unknown

375
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,700
quantities that lurk just beyond the

376
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,900
firelight of our comfortable and

377
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,860
familiar circle. But let's put the shoe

378
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,620
on the other foot. You know, do they...

379
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,660
You're the monster. Yeah? Everything about

380
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,540
that? Yeah? It's a cliche. But in fact, they

381
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,140
have far more to fear from us than we

382
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,860
would ever, ever, under any circumstances,

383
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,820
have to fear from them.

384
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,460
Do you think chupacabra, a shy being which

385
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,980
hardly ever shows itself is really going

386
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,560
to put itself at risk to go after the

387
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,180
dh screenshots, which you stamp one down

388
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,700
and six more spring up in their place?

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,160
If they're wise and they are because

390
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,760
they've done this so far, they will

391
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,660
retreat their dens, their fortresses of

392
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,520
solitudes, their remote quietness in the

393
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,400
distance and at the margins, and hope that

394
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,280
that we get ourselves out of the way sooner rather than later.

395
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,220
Eh, jackalopes.

396
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,420
Do you remember the Delmar Bandit?

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
Dr. Howell, the Delmar Bandit?

398
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,260
The guy with the carrot top hair that stuck out sort of like carrot top,

399
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,080
but more like pointy out the top.

400
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
And he didn't have any feet.

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,640
He just had these stumps, and on the end of his stumps he had these pads.

402
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,240
And he would run around outside people's houses late at night

403
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,060
when it was really quiet.

404
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,100
And he would go up to the windows at night and he would say,

405
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,460
la, la, la, la, la, la.

406
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,600
And he'd do this because he was sad,

407
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,620
because he was deserving of our pity.

408
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,640
And if we could, deserving of our...

409
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
You didn't even know why he did it.

410
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,100
Because he was lonely, because he was an outcast.

411
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,260
But we are subgeniuses, and he is not outcast.

412
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,100
As long as he comes around our campfire.

413
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,420
We will high him into the circle.

414
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,680
We will make him one of us.

415
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,740
And he will ascend with us into the glowing, churning, burning wheel of the saucers.

416
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,460
In fact, he can go before me.

417
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,140
The first time I heard those sounds outside my campsite

418
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,500
just flipped me out completely.

419
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,540
I was just completely shit-faced, first of all.

420
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,620
But he...

421
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,580
I'm just totally out of my mind.

422
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,020
No harm was done to you.

423
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,920
And then the next thing I know, there's these...

424
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,060
La, la, la, la, la, la.

425
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,480
But you were made better for the experience.

426
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
La, la, la, la, la, la.

427
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,620
Well, sure, yeah.

428
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,640
You are refined and purified.

429
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,800
Thank God I was made better.

430
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,400
That was the easy part, was making me better.

431
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,300
But I mean, the shock, the pure horror, the pain, the suffering.

432
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,420
These are all good things.

433
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,580
Well, it's good from a transitionary, transitory...

434
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,080
We need shock, horror.

435
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,620
We need...

436
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
We need to be jolted.

437
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,720
We need to be waked up.

438
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,220
We need to see lots of monster movies.

439
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,380
La, la, la, la, la.

440
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,980
And we need this because it's an essential part of our development.

441
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
La, la, la, la, la, la.

442
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,280
There's no growth.

443
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,160
There's no development in experiencing blandness and monotony.

444
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,100
Although this is, of course, what we cultivate and love.

445
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,200
It creeped the fuck out of me, man.

446
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,020
I heard it.

447
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,380
We need the jagged, unsuspected incursion.

448
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,860
Sure, yeah.

449
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,620
Jolt, yeah.

450
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,760
An unknown way.

451
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,300
People, yeah.

452
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,080
Sure, sure.

453
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,540
To stay healthy.

454
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,740
To stay alive.

455
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,400
This is different.

456
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,720
No, you say people, but it could be anything.

457
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,380
This is the damnedest thing I ever heard on KFJC.

458
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,380
Both hell and heaven are other people, you know.

459
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,300
But people aren't all of what we think about.

460
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,700
There's more than people.

461
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,820
It's important to remember.

462
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
People are only a piece.

463
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,060
This would be a hell of a place if it wasn't for all these people.

464
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,420
But think of how many other people might be here that you wouldn't care to...

465
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,000
Meet.

466
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:57,940
That's true.

467
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,360
I mean, these people, these are my favorite people in the world.

468
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,300
I mean, I feel closer to these people than anybody.

469
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,120
I mean, you're camping with your friends.

470
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,820
We're like this, you know, every night.

471
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,340
What's wrong with that? It's good.

472
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,260
In my bunk together.

473
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,340
All of us.

474
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,660
It's crazy.

475
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,760
It's just crazy.

476
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,280
He's inviting you folks, though.

477
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,400
And the Miracle Whip and the...

478
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm going to have to get a new bunk.

479
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,580
And the Zola Oil.

480
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,680
I mean, it's just wild.

481
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,980
Mine is collapsed in the middle.

482
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,140
It's sagging towards the top.

483
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,060
Yeah, I noticed yours was collapsing last night under the weight of all those...

484
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,760
Masses of people.

485
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,600
There's another one available in the trailer where we are.

486
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,420
Well, folks, I guess that about wraps it up.

487
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,260
And I hope you have taken advantage of our snack bar and the cheeseburgers and other...

488
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,220
Fifteen minutes left for snack time.

489
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,000
Fifteen minutes left for a delicious trans-fat saturated repast,

490
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,080
which shall remain with you for quite a while

491
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,760
and influence your thinking to a certain degree,

492
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,540
as everything which we take...

493
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,980
invariably does.

494
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,620
But it will precipitate a delightful bowel movement tomorrow morning.

495
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,720
Or not.

496
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,520
We prefer to say excremeditation, Dr. Drummond,

497
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
although that's not always the same thing as...

498
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,560
Because at these private moments, often...

499
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
Take advantage of it.

500
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,060
Great thoughts are birthed as well.

501
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,580
Surely Beethoven's quartets and other things

502
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,840
were the product of meditation behind that little door with the moon.

503
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,340
A sacred place where...

504
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,720
Well, even the basal pleasures of just defecation can't be discounted,

505
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,260
but added to that, excremeditation will then...

506
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,280
You elevate it to a plane of one that we can all agree would be...

507
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,340
Yeah, you just don't want to stay in there too long.

508
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,800
You also want to agree with that.

509
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,140
It takes the time to...

510
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah, you stay in there too long, and then that can cause other problems.

511
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,340
Yes.

512
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,380
You know, emotions.

513
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,060
Emotions too long.

514
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,380
Change your scene.

515
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,000
Change your path.

516
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,320
Yeah.

517
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,020
Change your underwear.

518
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,040
Change.

519
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,260
It's important.

520
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,940
Forget about it.

521
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,580
Yeah.

522
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,220
It's about почему your a lunatic.

523
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,220


524
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,760
But nobody cares,

525
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,040
without your heart.

526
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,520
This is the kind of missions youvre doing,

527
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:26,540
and pioniures during,

528
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,540


529
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,540


530
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,600
like,

531
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:26,620
there's no why.

532
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,100
Closed to your face,

533
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,100


534
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,720
tonight,

535
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:28,980
in your room of a damn doubt,

536
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,240
IT'S SO Rifiord.

537
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,240


538
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,240


539
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,240


540
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,580
Shall we go there again?

541
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,500
That's simply,

542
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:32,500


543
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:32,500


544
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,240
None of you would help me when I bake my bread

545
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,180
Not all of you would help me eat it

546
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,080
I can see that you are very well fed

547
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,020
This indicates that you don't need it

Stop and let me tell you about a plan I have for you

552
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,880
Take all the leaders from around the world

553
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,360
Put them together in a great big ring

554
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,760
Televise it at the lowest show on earth

555
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,120
And let them fight like hell to see who's king

556
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,200
Oh

557
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,800
Hey

558
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,400
Gather up the people when the fight is done

559
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,740
Then you'll find out living really can be fun

560
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,540
The next thing I say to you will be true

561
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,120
The last thing I said was both

562
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,640
Remember to do nothing when you don't know what to do

But something happened while you were asleep

576
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,180
You wanted a good life you could brag about

577
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,480
Too badly to had the time

and let them know

591
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,880
it's your honor

592
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,420

Yeah

596
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,220
Gather up your pieces

when the fight is done

598
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,320

Go ahead and do it

We have the Monroe Doctrine

But don't let him stop you

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,840

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,860
Now wait a minute

652
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,180
I need protection from the fellow behind you

653
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,740
There isn't a living man big enough

654
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,880
I want to tell you something

655
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,640
Wait a minute

656
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
At the right moment

657
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,760
when he finishes his job

658
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,260
Don't let me soften up

659
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,040
Don't let me pull back

660
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,000

00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,540
Never mind

You know

Now wait a minute

664
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,620
But the big gun

665
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,100
If the big guns

The guns mounted high

669
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,000
Are no gun equal to his gun

Was his name-o

Bob's neighbor

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,400

Danny

684
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,220
the 10th straight time. Investors were relieved today when oil prices rose after tomorrow.

685
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:10,200
On Wall Street, 710.610.14.4. The Environmental Protection Agency today proposed radiation

686
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,640
exposure for PR News in Washington.

687
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:19,340
Sure. On Monday, and we get more Tuesday. Wednesday, making its way into Thursday, finally

688
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,600
moving on down towards Friday, right into the early part of next week. Notice that we've

689
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,340
got a slightly more concentrated area of southeast as that northwest begins to lift

690
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,640
a little farther northward across the southeast, right back into the southwest here in the

691
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
Midwest and the Northeast.

692
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,120
Sure.

693
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,960
A long stretch of Lemurian news just then, and now more Norell also.

694
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,820
I mean, what do you think you're doing? That's something special for the Baron's birthday.

695
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,580
Let me tell you.

696
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:02,480
Let me tell you, toy maker. This news of mine has never failed me. And if there are

697
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,840
children here, my friend, you will die.

698
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,180
Talk about contempt. Just throw the cards out on the table, let the chips fall where

699
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,660
they may.

700
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,400
Dark, foreboding, almost evil. I took a bunch of Black Sabbath. Evil, killer kangaroo

701
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:39,060
out to take vengeance on people. Like a pink thumb thumb piece and a love Black Sabbath.

702
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,680
They're playing thump thump and making lasciviousness.

703
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,320
I personally don't believe

704
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,600
in

00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:49,920

709
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,580

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,580

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,580


716
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:05,080
But when you go down into it, if you go down, sexual churches, fanatical illusion, you can't even think, you can't even hear.

717
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,200
Good song for you.

718
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,660
It's me, Bob.

719
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,900
It's me, Bob.

720
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,300
Your current wait time is, your call is very important to us.

721
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,300
Your call is very important to us.

722
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,340
There is no one to take your call right now.

723

Thanks for listening.

724
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
How are you, Bob?

725
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

726
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,360
It's me, Bob.

727
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,140
It's me, Bob.

728
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,120
Have you heard about the guy that invented this thing?

729
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,120
Well, yeah, actually.

730
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,420
There are all kinds of things.

731
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:56,940
Yeah.

732
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,180
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution, and he sleeps only one hour a night.

733
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,240
He's a great man.

734
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,260
Oh.

735
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:07,740
Wow.

736
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,500
Jehovah.

737
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,020
Feed me.

738
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,400
Feed me.

739
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,660
Feed me.

740
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,720
Oh, oh.

741
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:19,980
Jehovah.

742
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,260
Jehovah.

743
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,460
Jehovah.

744
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,640
Jehovah.

745
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,020
Jehovah.

746
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,520
Jehovah.

747
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,180
Jehovah.

748
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,600
Jehovah.

749
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,280
Jehovah.

750
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,300
Jehovah.

751
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,880
Jehovah.

752
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,560
Jehovah.

753
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:28,780
Jehovah.

754
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,800
Jehovah.

755
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,620
Jehovah.

756
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,920
Jehovah.

757
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,800
Jehovah.

758
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,560
And the videos this year are only $15.

759
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,460
We're not five bucks off of them just because the world is ending.

760
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,040
Why would we need them?

761
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,660
So we're practically giving this stuff away, friends.

762
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,520
You can say shit.

763
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,560
Call us crazy.

764
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Call us insane.

765
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,680
Call us subgeniuses.

766
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,100
It's an insane giveaway.

767
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,460
But it's yours for only $15.

768
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,540
And you're in it.

769
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,660
Wait a minute.

770
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,480
Wait a minute.

771
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,360
You're probably saying, say, Reverend Stang, if I'm in it, shouldn't you be giving me $15?

772
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,700
Praise Bob.

773
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,540
This is the church of the subgenius.

774
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,840
We don't do things like those normals.

775
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,700
We'll do them the way Bob said to do them.

776
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,300
The way that will benefit Bob.

777
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,500
That's right.

778
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,860
It's all about Bob.

779
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,780
It is.

780
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,440
All about.

781
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:41,340
And, you know, we can sit up here and talk and talk and talk about the facts of Bob and the doctrine of erasability.

782
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,460
The doctrine of erasability.

783
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,240
And the show and all that bullshit.

784
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,920
But all that really matters is that face.

785
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,160
That face is the key to everything.

786
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:58,260
Either you instantly see that face and know that it is the coolest face, or it's just another face to you.

787
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,980
Really, you know.

788
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,880
That's the test.

789
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,840
That's what it comes down to.

790
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,940
That's the test.

791
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,120
The coolest face you've ever seen or not.

792
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,280
The inherent coolness of the Dobbs head.

793
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,460
That is the test as to whether you're a yeti or just one of us.

794
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,280
If those others.

795
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:20,800
If the blood of the yeti, even the tiniest smidgen of that code, courses through your genetic history.

796
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,400
Then you saw that Bob head and went, what is that?

797
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,780
And that's why you're here, friends.

798
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,460
Yes, you said, what the?

799
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,240
Giggling insanely.

800
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,000
What the?

801
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,800
That's why I'm here.

802
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
That's why Dr. Drummond and I were here.

803
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,880
And I remember the day you and I first saw that particular picture of Bob.

804
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,140
Layed eyes upon it.

805
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,940
This is getting scary, ladies and gentlemen.

806
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,600
Well, it scarred Philo for a while.

807
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,880
He used to have to wear a mask.

808
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,420
Well, I actually saw him in the flesh.

809
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,820
Yeah, but Dr. Drummond at times played with the young Bob as a kid.

810
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,040
And later in high school.

811
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,920
I mean, not played with him like in the sexual sense.

812
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
No, Bob was much older.

813
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,700
It was the other way around.

814
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,700
Be careful here.

815
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,700
Bob played with Philo.

816
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,280
Bob played with Philo throughout Philo's life.

817
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,540
Game balls.

818
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,780
You might say.

819
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,660
Philo is Bob's main toy.

820
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,820
Many kids when they grow up play with fire.

821
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,560
But Bob.

822
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,100
He's not dittling me or anything.

823
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,680
Played with Philo.

824
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,180
The sense of dittling toys or things.

825
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,240
Well, don't be embarrassed, Philo.

826
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,900
We've all taught.

827
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,960
We've taught for years that if it's Bob, it's not queer.

828
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,040
It's nothing to worry about.

829
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,000
And even there's nothing wrong.

830
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,640
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

831
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,420
But really, boys, you know, when you have those thoughts about Bob,

832
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,320
that's nothing to worry about.

833
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,420
There's nothing unusual about it.

834
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,120
It is natural to want to have sex with cuddly cartoon characters.

835
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,200
And some people think that Bob Dobbs is one of these.

836
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,660
One of the cuddliest of all cartoon characters.

837
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,060
Remember, I think it was Gore Vidal who recently said,

838
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,320
there are no such things as homosexuals or lesbians.

839
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,840
There are only homosexual and lesbian acts.

840
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,980
And there are certainly subgenius acts.

841
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,320
Individual forms of expression.

842
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,200
Perhaps taking a sexual dimension.

843
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,080
Only a subgenius could or would want to perform.

844
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,740
These.

845
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,760
Are you talking about those sex acts?

846
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,040
What is the Latin name for the kissing of the devil's fundament?

847
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,220
That's called the osculus infandum.

848
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,480
Ostrus infandum?

849
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,920
Osculus infandum.

850
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,140
The kissing of the devil on his anus.

851
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,140
That was required of witches.

852
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,540
But it's not required here in the Church of the Subgenius.

853
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,140
In fact, I'd like to be called that.

854
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,180
What do you think?

855
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


856
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


857
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


858
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,180


859
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,140
I won't fly.

860
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,660
Will we go there again?

861
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,660


862
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,860
That's any good?

863
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:06,860


864
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,620
Would you like to see Bob evenly?

865
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Could it be knightly-looking, or cheaply pretty, and yet left pouty like a rocking horse?

866
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,120


867
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,120


868
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,080
so fast

869
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,900
and it's one

870
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,740
more day up in

871
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,020
the saucer

872
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,440
and it's one more night

873
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,080
in the brushwood

874
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,600
if a Friday

875
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,540
Jones could be my

876
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,160
island

877
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,740
I wish she

878
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,080
would

879
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,280
na na na na

880
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,440
na na na na

881
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,600
na na na na

882
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,540
na na na

883
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,440
yeah

884
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,560
the smell of the boys

885
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,220
and of normals

886
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,300
and the feeling that

887
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,940
they all can't help

888
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,760
but sit in my

889
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,660
face

890
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,200
with my third eye I look

891
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,840
across the mill

892
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,480
no way to see

893
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,640
he exists

894
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,380
I

895
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,420
I

896
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,560
not

897
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:10,900
lamp

898
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:10,900


899
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,260
and

900
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,860
the

901
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,340
me

902
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,880
I

903
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:24,900
could

904
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:24,920
through

905
00:42:40,440 --> 00:43:00,240
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

906
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,480
I'd cruise this laddered mansion sometime after 2 a.m.

907
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,620
And talk a little while about the church

908
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:21,280
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower

909
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,500
Makes you talk a little lower

910
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,820
About the day that we take over

911
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,720
It's been a while since next day

912
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,420
And I guess I will believe

913
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,680
Maybe next year will be better than the last

914
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,660
I can't remember all the times I played the hour of slack

915
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,480
And wished my wish would make it come to pass

916
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,620
So it's 6.59 on Gordon's Saucer

917
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:02,940
Yeah

918
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:03,780
Yeah

919
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


920
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


921
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


922
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


923
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


924
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


925
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


926
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


927
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


928
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


929
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


930
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


931
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


932
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


933
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


934
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


935
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


936
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


937
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


938
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,600
But it said no one in Marshwood

939
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,040
I have never made it to a next day

940
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,480
I guess I should

Uh

951
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:57,820


952
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:57,820


953
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:57,980
The

954
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,300
It did

955
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,300


956
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,300


957
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,300


958
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,300


959
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,300


960
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,600
Oh

961
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,420
Uh

962
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,400
Oh

963
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


964
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


965
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


966
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


967
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


968
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


969
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:01,400


970
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,620
Oh

971
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,060
Uh

972
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,380
Here

973
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


974
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


975
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


976
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


977
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


978
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


979
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


980
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


981
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


982
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


983
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


984
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


985
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,100
Yeah.

986
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,680
Yeah.

987
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,320
Yeah.

988
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,800
Yeah.

989
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:19,600
Yeah.

990
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,300
Yeah.

991
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,560
Yeah.

992
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,560
of the CDs. We did like

993
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,560
ten collections

994
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,420
on cassette tape before those.

995
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,880
But now let us hear some

996
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,480
Phineas Narco with

997
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,520
National Cynical Radio.

998
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,460
I just couldn't

999
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,440
take it anymore.

1000
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
This is better.

1001
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,140
So much better.

1002
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,780
Hey!

1003
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,020
Hey!

1004
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,000
You wanted me.

1005
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,960
And here I am.

1006
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,720
It's hard, I guess,

1007
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,160
if you figure

1008
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,140
I'm experiencing

1009
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,880
the reason, I suppose.

1010
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,220
Except

1011
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,600
you would do this.

1012
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,600
You would simply

1013
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,120
I

1014
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,880
guess that's okay,

1015
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,500
but

1016
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,140
I

1017
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,700
How?

1018
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,580
Here it is.

1019
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,440
Okay.

1020
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,420
Enough of that.

1021
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,680
I was really running

1022
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,220
on fumes, I guess.

1023
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,700
I get dependent

1024
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,740
on what other people think.

1025
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,780
What's his name?

1026
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,000
He's

1027
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,940
becoming a butterfly.

1028
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,300
I was mesmerized.

1029
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,140
I sometimes regret

1030
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,740
all that nonsense

1031
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,300
floundering in this

1032
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,280
holding pattern.

1033
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,260
We're just here

1034
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,920
to play.

1035
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,940
I can see the bliss

1036
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,460
in what you surrender to.

1037
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,280
Not knowing.

1038
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,760
Stop now.

1039
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:48,980
I'm going

1040
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,720
back in

1041
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,620
the Garden of Eden

1042
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,860
for a short while,

1043
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,440
anyway.

1044
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,920
Okay.

1045
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,840

1047
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,180
And now some remix of

皇 12

1057
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:48,760


1058
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:48,760


1059
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:48,760


1060
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:48,760


1061
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,200
Three guys, they're all packing.

1062
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,680
It's too crowded.

1063
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,720
There are too many people.

1064
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,520
FBI!

1065
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,460
Hold your fire!

1066
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,640
Stop!

1067
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,680
Use the firepower rather than judgment.

1068
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,940
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1069
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,440
Everyone's going to be happy.

1070
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,500
Come on.

1071
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,900
There are shallow rollers and there are deep rollers.

1072
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,700
It'll be short.

1073
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Thinking about the others?

1074
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,560
No, he's speaking of the others.

1075
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,900
What kind of doctor are you, by the way, sweetie?

1076
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,540
Sawbones, is that the idea?

1077
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,560
Or a head shrinker?

1078
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,420
I went to them once.

1079
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,760
Head shrinker.

1080
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,840
Told me he had a dual personality.

1081
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,220
You know, split, schizo, and all that jazz.

1082
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,860
Then he lays an $82 tab on me,

1083
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,400
so I give him $41, and I said,

1084
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,740
get the other $41 from the other guy.

1085
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,180
Ha!

1086
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,040
Is Commander Gilmore U.S. Strategic Command

1087
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,100
and General Bolshevsky Russian Intelligence?

1088
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,400
Russian Intelligence?

1089
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,480
Are you mad?

1090
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,160
A lot's happened since you were frozen.

1091
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,200
The Cold War's over.

1092
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,320
Well, finally those capitalist pigs

1093
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,900
will pay for their crimes, eh?

1094
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,160
Hey, comrades, eh?

1095
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,560
Austin, we won.

1096
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,480
Oh, groovy, smashing.

1097
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,720
Yay, capitalism.

1098
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,000
Hello.

1099
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,900
Hello.

1100
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,920
Well, that was some fun, though, wasn't it, George?

1101
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,480
Yeah.

1102
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,400
Almost makes me wish I hadn't have been saved.

1103
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,240
Jacking up banks.

1104
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,660
I can see how a fella'd derive a whole lot of pleasure

1105
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,200
and satisfaction out of it.

1106
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,400
I'm so infuriated by what I'm refusing to do.

1107
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,840
I know I'll have a mission here,

1108
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,800
and it's more than just promoting X-Day.

1109
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,400
I want to get people to join up and enlist.

1110
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,560
Well, I'm proud to salute

1111
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,880
old Gory.

1112
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,640
Old Gory.

1113
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,240
And the colors for which she sighs.

1114
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,240
She sighs.

1115
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,660
There's some red for the blood.

1116
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,860
Choo-choo-choo-choo!

1117
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,440
White for the guts.

1118
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,440
Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo!

1119
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,580
Blue for the people.

1120
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,200
Bye.

1121
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,060
Bye.

1122
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,280
Zip.

1123
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:20,860
Oh!

1124
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,740
And I'm proud to tell the story.

1125
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,840
The story.

1126
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,300
Of the United Snakes of old.

1127
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,780
Cha-ching.

1128
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,720
With a buck for a back tail.

1129
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,380
Cha-ching.

1130
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,560
Mobile X on a unicow.

1131
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,780
Cha-ching.

1132
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,760
A buck for Halliburton.

1133
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,420
Halliburton.

1134
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:48,940
Cha-ching.

1135
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,640
Game awardated.

1136
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:49,640


1137
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,300
Cheep ken-ditch the

1138
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:01,100
Oh, drake myself off.

1139
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,020
All nation's way.

1140
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,740
All nation's way.

1141
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,620
Wave it all over our head.

1142
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,540
We're gonna tell the story.

1143
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,480
Something can forward back town,

1144
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,960
We're gonna fuck for a back towel,

1145
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,520
I feel right for a Halloway town

1146
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,560
Albert!

1147
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,640
I'm about time to salute an old girl

1148
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,680
For the reeds

1149
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,940
And the colors for which she sang

1150
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,740
She sang

1151
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,420
Red for the black

1152
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,120
White for the black

1153
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,680
White for the blue

1154
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,680
I'm about to use a sip

1155
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,300
Oh!

1156
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,560
Oh, don't let she wait

1157
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,460
Oh, don't let her swing

1158
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,440
No one makes you wait

1159
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,180
No one makes you wait

1160
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,420
Oh, don't let her swing

1161
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,260
I'm coming home, mama

1162
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,140
Coming home on the big jet plane

1163
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,140
I'm coming home to Andrews Air Force Base

1164
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,500
Yeah, it's gonna be great

1165
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,000
But you better cancel my bowling

1166
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,920
My soccer league

1167
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,360
My soccer league too

1168
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,120
And I ain't only got a

1169
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,720
A finger or two

1170
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,880
Oh yeah, but think of the why

1171
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,960
Why I ain't got no legs

1172
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,020
What about tomorrow?

1173
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,920
No, I can't be that day

1174
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,800
I'm fucking dead

1175
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:11,700
That's a Maverick

1176
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:11,720
John Osprey

1177
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,000
Tommy Batter

1178
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,220
California

1179
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,220


1180
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,140
Mmm, smell that bacon.

1181
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,400
Paper Action.

1182
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm the man who pleaded guilty to committing PR News.

1183
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,860
Israeli forces have now raided President Bush's Texas ranch.

1184
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,000
The U.S. military says the trip will include outreach to Jews limbs as well as Europe.

1185
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,580
Ohio's in Columbus today.

1186
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,940
Ohio State criminal forms in Columbus.

1187
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,840
The Vatican says four American soldiers are demanding a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI, first foreign pope.

1188
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:48,540
Hundreds of anti-PR candlelight vigils were staged last night in support of an anti-PR protest being held near PR News.

1189
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,440
Reminds me of the Bobby Girls.

1190
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,680
Never was my hobby girls.

1191
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,380
Can full of worms and a pole fishing.

1192
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,740
Cork bobbing like a hot red bulb.

1193
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,960
And a blue jay squeaks his beak open an inch above the creek.

1194
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,500
Gone fishing for a week.

1195
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,120
Well I put down my pole and I dropped my pants and felt free.

1196
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,340
Breeze blowing up me and up the canyon far as I can see.

1197
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,800
It's night now and the moon looks like a dandelion.

1198
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,640
It's black now and the black bird is feeding on lice and his red wings look like diamonds and rice.

1199
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,240
I can hear the mice toes scampering.

1200
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,100
Gophers rumbling in pile crater rock holes.

1201
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,760
One red bean stuck in the bottom of a tin bowl.

1202
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,880
Hot coffee from a crimped up can.

1203
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,500
Me and my girl named Bimbo.

1204
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,540
Limbo.

1205
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,560
Spam.

1206
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,460
Captain Beefheart, thank you.

1207
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,040
Thank you, thank you.

1208
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,180
It's the only poem I know.

1209
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,620
Yes, the only poem I ever memorized.

1210
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,660
That was some live eight.

1211
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,820
X-Day stuff.

1212
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,900
We all were getting up and doing poems.

1213
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,440
Wait until you hear what Hal did.

1214
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,640
But now, uh, uh, let, well no.

1215
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,100
Now let me give the URL of the Church of the Subgenius.

1216
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,500
That's subgenius.com.

1217
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,480
There, now you got it.

1218
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,300
Because you're listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1219
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:36,240
The one world religion preaching the slack of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1220
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,780
And, uh, as I said, subgenius.com has all of that.

1221
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:49,400
You can download everything, including entire DVDs, at alt.binaries.multimedia.slack.

1222
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,260
And now, let's catch that Norell Prev.

1223
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,300
Surprising, you bet.

1224
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,500
Shocking?

1225
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,660
Of course.

1226
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:08,280
Because nothing in the whole spectrum of American life is so emotionally charged as marital responsibility.

1227
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,720
Nothing as socially stigmatized, legally entangled, morally mixed up.

1228
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:23,000
Surely no drive so basic in mankind, so potently felt and widely exploited in modern life, has ever been so little understood.

1229
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,460
Thus so fraught with fear and venom, passion and prejudice.

1230
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,560
A much higher percentage is attracted and aroused.

1231
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,040
No one knows with any certainty its cause or its cure.

1232
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,680
They cannot possibly enjoy heterosexuality.

1233
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,980
Surprising, you bet.

1234
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,180
Shocking?

1235
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,340
Of course.

1236
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,060
I am a big, fat Muslim.

1237
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,560
I am a feminized, homosexualized, savage nation.

1238
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,640
Crip, crip, crip, crippled.

1239
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,840
Uh, reaching out, mental disorder.

1240
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,020
Savage nation.

1241
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,080
Mental disorder.

1242
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,460
Sounds good, right?

1243
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,300
Savage nation.

1244
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,020
Crip, crip, crip, crippled.

1245
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,800
Mental disorder.

1246
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:02,560
Savage nation.

1247
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,320
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, demeanor.

1248
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,260
Here is the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
