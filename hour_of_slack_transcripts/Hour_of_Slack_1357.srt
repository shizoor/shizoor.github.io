1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,020
Well, Wilma, do you like my little contraption?

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,680
It was wonderful, Doctor. I told you it would work.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,580
Well, is there anything else you'd like to ask before I turn off this green ray?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,220
Uh-uh. Let's wake him up and see if he remembers anything that happened.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,020
All right. Go ahead.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,480
All right.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,160
Hey, where'd you come from?

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,360
Uh, yeah.

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,980
Oh, doggone it. Instead of helping you, I fell asleep.

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,480
I put you to sleep with this machine.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,240
Oh, really?

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,680
Right.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,400
Oh, my God. How'd it work?

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,640
Even better than I expected.

15
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,080
Oh, good.

16
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,480
Oh, it was marvelous without even opening your mouth.

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,440
Hey, now, wait a minute.

18
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,060
Oh, I see.

19
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,420
Let's put Wilma under it.

20
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh, no, you don't.

21
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,100
Oh, your excitement.

22
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,280
Come on, Wilma.

23
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,160
Oh, I see.

24
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,700
Something exciting going on.

25
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,020
Wait until we start making tests of the new type of gyro-goreage cosmic relativator I've just devised.

26
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,580
Even?

27
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,280
That's right.

28
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,300
Good night.

29
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,660
Thank goodness for that.

30
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,020
Imagine getting into the control cabin, opening the power lever, and going a couple of times around the clock.

31
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,180
Just like that.

32
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,160
Boy, that hardly seems possible, does it?

33
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,620
But, uh...

34
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,100
Uh, no.

35
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,380
As a matter of fact, I...

36
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,560
Huh?

37
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,320
Oh, uh...

38
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
I don't understand.

39
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:00,980
Wait, look.

40
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,360
Listen.

41
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,560
Oh, yes, Doctor.

42
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,160
I hear it, too.

43
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,540
Oh, yeah.

44
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,480
Hear it?

45
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,240
Yes, sir.

46
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,700
But what under the sun is it?

47
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,000
Look, here, out of the window.

48
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,820
Look, there's Wilma.

49
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,200
And it's coming right down this way.

50
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,760
Wilma!

51
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh!

52
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,260
Oh!

53
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,340
And now, the self-genius, our old swat.

54
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
And now, the Sicilian Union.

55
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:40,860
We may get an erection soon either way.

56
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,220
But in any case, hey!

57
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,020
I believe in one thing.

58
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,020


59
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,280
We have a greatimonious man.

60
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
I believe you'll be over.

61
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,720
Besides, you're the only computer in town here.

62
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:55,720


63
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:55,880
Just.

64
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,180
Suck.

65
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,880
Yeah.

66
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,960
Yeah.

67
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,220
Get rid of it.

68
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,000
outburst of street violence. The Federal Reserve is having an effect north of the border.

69
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,340
Canada's central bank could also drive up the value of the Canadian PR News in Toronto.

70
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Police in Philadelphia arrested about 50 mobs responsible for random attacks on Egyptian

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,960
President Hosni Mubarak, whose regime cut cell and internet service for days

72
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,240
during protests against PR News in Washington.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
Okay, get ready for this.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,320
Okay, just coincidentally, this was his name, Bob.

75
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,940
This is a real person. His name is Bob.

76
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,900
You gotta be effing kidding me.

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,400
Bob.

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,560
Dude.

79
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,900
Bob.

80
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,420
You pass it through your system and you wash it and you pass it through your system again, bit by bit.

81
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,620
And then you sit on the bed of nails and you wonder, why the fuck am I doing this?

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,920
Right.

83
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,700
Cleansing your chakras.

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,540
Yep.

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,920
I just swallowed.

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,420
30 feet of cotton.

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:30,780
Yeah.

88
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,340
Yeah.

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah.

91
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,360
Yeah.

92
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,020
And I think we have time for one more, and that is Bob.

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,620
Hello, Bob.

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,640
Oh, hi.

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,900
Yeah, I'm high.

96
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,940
I don't think...

97
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't think...

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,500
Get rid of the loopholes that are out there.

99
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,040
You gotta get the money somehow.

100
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,640
Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?

101
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,100
And if you did, would she cry?

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,600
Crying, crying.

103
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,940
Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me,

104
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,420
tell her I'm sorry.

105
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,980
Tell her I need my baby.

106
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,940
Whoa, won't you tell her that I love her?

107
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,620
I woke up this morning and realized what I had done.

109
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,320
I stood alone in the cold, grey dawn.

110
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,540
I knew I lost my morning sun.

111
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,320
I lost my head and I said some things.

112
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,140
Now comes the heartaches and bone and brains.

113
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see.

114
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,960
I let my world slip away from me.

115
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,340
So, hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?

116
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,760
And if you did, would she cry?

117
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,200
Crying, crying.

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,460
Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me?

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,140
Tell her I'm sorry.

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,500
Tell her I need my baby.

121
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,520
Whoa, won't you tell her that I love her?

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,740
Crying, crying.

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Crying, crying.

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Crying, crying.

125
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,600


126
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,140
Crying, crying.

127
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,680
Crying, crying.

128
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:26,740
Crying, crying.

129
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,060
Crying, crying.

130
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,060


131
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,060


132
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,140
Crying, crying.

133
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,260
Crying, crying.

134
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,420
Crying, crying.

135
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,460
Crying, crying.

136
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,620
Crying, crying.

137
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,240
Tell her I'm sorry.

138
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,640
Tell her I need my baby.

139
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,620
Whoa, won't you tell her that I love her?

140
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,240
If you did, would you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me?

141
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,100
Can we stop crying here?

142
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,260
Tell her I need my baby

143
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh, won't you tell her

144
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,360
That I love her

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm gushing through coastal streets.

146
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,980
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is still a force to be reckoned with.

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,460
If you receive a warning to evacuate,

148
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,920
millions of people along the eastern seaboard are in the path of PR News.

149
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,940
A moderate earthquake is expected to churn its way along the east coast throughout the weekend.

150
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,180
I'll curl up in a sleeping bag, you know.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,360
It ain't gonna last forever.

152
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,620
It's only gonna be one day.

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,600
It's one day out of life, man.

154
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,720


155
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,460
The Justice Department has sued Muslim leaders over allegations of religious bias.

156
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,320
And PR reports Muslims violate a 2000 law known as the Religious Institutionalized Persons Act.

157
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
PR News, Washington.

158
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,660
GOP presidential primary hopeful Michelle Bachmann called for repeal of President Obama last year.

159
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,320
PR News, Washington.

160
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,640
April 10th, 7 p.m.

161
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,180
Notes on possible malignant organism.

162
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,960
Overall configuration, that of a human arm.

163
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,640
Severed just below the elbow joint.

164
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,780
Muscle tissue seems to be a sea anemone.

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,580
Species of protozoa.

166
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,580
These organs are exactly like human organs, except that they have been replaced by the protozoans.

167
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,160
Of course.

168
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,320
This creature needs the ordinary necessities of human life.

169
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,800
Proteins, fats, sugars, and so forth.

170
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,960
But since his organs are so decomposed,

171
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,600
that they can neither produce nor retain the oxygen necessary,

172
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,420
nor save for its survival,

173
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,020
it needs the only food which can keep it alive.

174
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,960
Blood.

175
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,680
Human blood.

176
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,400
If a human body, a drowned person,

177
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,460
were attacked by tiny sea plants which became parasites,

178
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
and completely dead?

179
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
No, it's still alive.

180
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,160
But it's changed into a...

181
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,780
Well, is it a plant or an animal?

182
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,960
It's both.

183
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,960
It's a giant protozoa.

184
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,460
Dr. Gavin.

185
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,220
Can they be killed?

186
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
I don't know, Lieutenant.

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,440
They are the living dead.

188
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,140
They're zombies.

189
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,680
Nothing so dramatic as that, Elaine.

190
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,260
They're more like a jellyfish.

191
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,900
You can't kill them by shooting them or cutting them up.

192
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,600
Well, then how can you kill them?

193
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,020
Pshh.

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,740
Say goodbye to everything you knew.

195
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,980
Say hello to what a man can do.

196
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,560
Monster Man.

197
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,760
Monster Man.

198
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,540
This is one and only dream.

199
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,460
It's all I've seen.

200
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,560
Two Monster Man.

201
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,200
Man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man.

202
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,160
The man's a hunter, a beast on the run.

203
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
He's a virus you can't stop with a gun.

204
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,760
You can plan from a mind insane.

205
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,180
Loud springs flow so clean.

206
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,180
There is no

207
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,340
zombie in the closet.

208
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,700
There is no

209
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
fish underneath the bed.

210
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,460
There's no alien in the dark tunnel.

211
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,680
The monster's in your head.

212
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,620
Say what you want.

213
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,460
Say what you will.

214
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,880
Said and done.

215
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,740
The threat is still.

216
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,580
Monster Man.

217
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,860
Monster Man.

218
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,620
They say beauty's in the eyes.

219
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:21,680
But the truth is,

220
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,680


221
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,680


222
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,680


223
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,680


224
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,680


225
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,780
I'm the beholder so don't try.

226
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,180
To understand him.

227
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,340
Every day is Halloween.

228
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,640
It's all obscene.

229
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,620
Two Monster Man.

230
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,120
Man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man.

231
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,220
Man.

232
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,540
Man.

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,700
Man.

234
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,140
Man.

235
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,860
Man.

236
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,140
Man.

237
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,580
Man.

238
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:47,640
Man.

239
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:47,640


240
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:47,980
Man.

241
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,440
Man.

242
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,940
Yeah,

243
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,980
I know they've been in the bunker down there you know messing

244
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,820
with things.

245
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,560
With top top top top.

246
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,120
With top top top

247
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,540
who?

248
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:14,980
Mein Team

249
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,540
Mein Team

250
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,960
The same old thing

251
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,360
The same old thing

252
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,320
The same old thing

253
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,260
The same old thing

254
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,860
The same old thing

255
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,040
The same old thing

256
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040


257
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040


258
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040


259
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,080
The same old thing

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,120
In your mind, voices, emotions

261
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,520
They got it all figured out

262
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,100
You know, to the hurt

263
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,880
The cat dancing spiders

264
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,300
In polka dot waistcoats

265
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,920
And the fangs, peanut brittle

266
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,740
And things like that

267
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,180
They might have come up

268
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,600
With some really weird ideas

269
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,220
With Bob

270
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,260
Don't know this board

271
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,320
On a mixture of magic mushrooms

272
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,640
And ayahuasca

273
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,740
With Bob

274
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,620
Don't know this board

275
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,680
On a mixture of magic mushrooms

276
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,040
And ayahuasca

277
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,220
Is there any indication

278
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,480
To what kind of journeys

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,680
If you will, or visions

280
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,500
That the people who are taking this drug

281
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,280
Might have had

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,140

Bob's head broke

Bob's head broke

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,580


286
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,500
Bob's head broke

287
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
Bob's head broke

288
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,860
Bob's head broke

289
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,020
Bob's head broke

290
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,100
Bob's head broke

291
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,220

Doesn't mean it's true

302

That's right

303
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:36,820
Okay

304
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,200
It's no more different than kept written in the Wall Street Journal

305
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,060
Come on

306
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,820
You know?

307
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,700
We appreciate the call, Doc

308
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,580
With Bob, uh, Bob's head broke

309
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,680
And ayahuaskara

310
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,780
And ayahuasca

311
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,420
Come on, dog

312
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,340
Uh, so

313
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,340


314
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,100
With Bob

315
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,960
Be—

316
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,600
лена

317
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
Mushrooms and ayahuasca.

318
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,800
With Bob.

319
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,380
Bob.

320
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,120
Bob.

321
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,860
Bob.

322
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,500
Bob.

323
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,000
Bob.

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,220
Bob.

325
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,120
He's getting very.

326
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,920
He's in there.

327
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,680
The great part about it is that Bob is so invested.

328
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
He's 110% for it.

329
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,140
You got enough dirt on my face?

330
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,420
You gotta roll with it.

331
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,420
Anytime you get a chance to work with Bob, it's just fun.

332
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,720
He is an icon of.

333
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,160
Bob was completely interested in using it.

334
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
You learn something new every day.

335
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,500
Absolutely.

336
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,900
I can try things that I couldn't try in a straight.

337
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
He's better than ever.

338
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,100
We're really enjoying that.

339
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,420
And also just chemistry.

340
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,200
Ah, yes.

341
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,400
Dear friends.

342
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,620
This music in the background is great.

343
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
Something called the Como Zoo.

344
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,740
Sick carousel or something like that.

345
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,360
It's Como Zoo carousel.

346
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,500
76 trombones.

347
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,400
Well, well, well.

348
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,300
Before that, the little collage we just heard was by Reverend Royal Decapitator.

349
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
He also did the titles and some other stuff in between.

350
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,820
He has contributed a whole lot of cool little cut-ups that we'll be using.

351
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
And have been using.

352
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,920
And he did the song Hardcore Tiddlywinks just before that.

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,740
The Bob song.

354
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,320
Under the name Dr. Slapjaw.

355
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,300
And before that, Monster Man was indeed by Devo.

356
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,620
Yes, that was the Devo's doing.

357
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,400
And it's an unreleased tune, sort of.

358
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,720
As I understand it, some TV show called him up and said,

359
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,280
Hey, can you whip out a song real fast for this show?

360
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,900
It's a monster show or something.

361
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,480
And if you ask me, it was probably Jerry who whipped that out.

362
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,740
He said he did it in about 10 minutes.

363
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,260
I got it off of Rollingstone.com.

364
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,440
And the stuff about monsters there at the beginning.

365
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,420
Here, let's see.

366
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,080
I'll pause that one and turn on something.

367
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:41,380
The stuff about the monster protozoans that are not animal or plant is from The Horror of Party Beach.

368
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,540
A 1964 movie.

369
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,340
That I've been wanting to see since I was a little kid.

370
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,680
Because I saw the newspaper ads.

371
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,500
And it had girls in bikinis and monsters.

372
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,180
Not like that's anything special.

373
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,780
But it was a movie I never actually got around to seeing.

374
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,500
And finally did.

375
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,560
And it was wonderful.

376
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,100
You're in for it your whole life.

377
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,900
Princess Wee, you need to move a microphone near your mouth when you're talking to it.

378
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,420
Oh, near my mouth, you say.

379
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,400
Yeah, that's how those work.

380
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,060
Oh, okay.

381
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,600
I was kind of expecting Dave to call in.

382
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,780
But who knows?

383
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,080
If he doesn't, we're prepared.

384
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,560
What else?

385
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah, Horror of Party Beach.

386
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,320
It's one of those really low-budget movies.

387
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,220
It reminds me of the movies I used to work on when I was a young feller in the film business.

388
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,100
It was all shot in some beach town in Connecticut.

389
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,720
And used local people as actors for the most part.

390
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,560
And boy, can you tell.

391
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,080
Before that, oh, the new PR news, friends.

392
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,020
You may have noticed we've got PR news back again.

393
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,380
Those are not by Lee Murr anymore.

394
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:02,820
They're by Reverend Cosmic Debris, who plays the Hour of Slack on Shortwave.

395
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,800
He's the main guy behind the Hour of Slack on Shortwave.

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,240
And he, several months ago, I think, whipped out a bunch of PR news.

397
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,500
And I didn't even know it until recently.

398
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,500
So we'll have...

399
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,440
We'll have PR news back.

400
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,520
The song, The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,

401
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,140
was by the Death Billies of the deathbillies.com.

402
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,320
Thanks to Sister Decadence for turning us on to that band.

403
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
Yes, thanks, Sister Decadence.

404
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,940
We love inappropriate covers.

405
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,920
Oh, the song before that, that sounded like the Psychoskeletons,

406
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,140
was the Psychoskeletons.

407
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,140
And the song is called Song for Music Critics.

408
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,560
Princess Lee, why don't you phone Dave and see if he's...

409
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,780
He should be calling any second now.

410
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,820
Why do you say that?

411
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,860
Because I talked to him.

412
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,420
Oh, I learned something.

413
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,060
And he's going to call.

414
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,980
I learn something new every day.

415
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,600
I just went and talked to him seconds ago.

416
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,060
Two, three, four seconds ago.

417
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,160
What else?

418
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,360
The Ministry of Slight and Little Bit of Stuff,

419
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,760
Reverend Royal Decapitator, The Large,

420
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,700
did the I'm Bob song near the beginning.

421
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,120
I mentioned Reverend Cosmic Debris and Reverend Royal Decapitator.

422
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,080
And that's it.

423
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,540
In the background is Devo without lyrics.

424
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,320
It's from their latest album.

425
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,400
But I think Reverend Abnorm Nighthill gave us a copy of this.

426
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:52,700
Somehow he got a halt of Devo music so you could karaoke that newer album.

427
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,000
Or Blither Blather on Hour of Slap.

428
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,140
Yeah, that too.

429
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,520
Abnorm may be showing up at our house tomorrow night.

430
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,160
And I'm not even sure if that's going to happen.

431
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,620
Oh, not tomorrow night.

432
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,820
Tax night, Tuesday.

433
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,540
Yeah.

434
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,440
Tuesday.

435
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,080
Yes, friends.

436
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,620
It's...

437
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:12,780
We're...

438
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,040
We're...

439
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,380
In the time we're recording this,

440
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,100
which may not be the time that you're listening to it.

441
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,980
I mean, at best, it's seven seconds earlier than you're listening to it.

442
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,700
At best.

443
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Could be months earlier.

444
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,900
It's tax time.

445
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,800
And taxes for the church or the subgenius are really tricky.

446
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Partly because one of us has or had a real job and now is retired.

447
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,200
And I...

448
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,400
The subgenius business, I just...

449
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,940
We're not tax-exempt, of course.

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,880
You know, we didn't...

451
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,800
We didn't go that route because we're...

452
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:05,080
We don't want to take the money from people who may not believe in our religion.

453
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,820
Now, all the other religions will take your money in that they don't pay taxes.

454
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,780
So you have to...

455
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,080
You have to pay higher taxes.

456
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,240
Well, we Texans didn't...

457
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,480
Philo and I, when we first started doing this for Bob and Bob himself, we went,

458
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,980
no, we want to...

459
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,600
We just felt like it was going to lead to trouble if we officially called the church of the subgenius or religion.

460
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,300
So officially, it's a Texas novelty company.

461
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,840
And I like it much better as a Texas novelty company,

462
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,760
even though it hasn't been in Texas for a long time.

463
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:51,300
In fact, as far as I know, there's hardly anybody left in Texas besides my family and Reverend Zaphod.

464
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,460
But the novelty of it comes on again and again as each new person meets Bob.

465
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,800
Yeah, I wonder what that's like.

466
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
I mean, I remember what it's like.

467
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,920
I remember what happened when I first...

468
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,720
When Philo first told me about Bob.

469
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,780
I was perplexed and inspired.

470
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,640
And excited.

471
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:11,760
And excited.

472
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:11,760


473
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:11,760


474
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:11,760


475
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:11,760


476
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm everywhere.

477
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,400
And then the day of calls and...

478
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Is it a good time to make foley noises?

479
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,620
Yes.

480
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,160
Like walking through cans of beans?

481
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,940
Yes.

482
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,180
Toilet paper going through the air real quickly and making that flapping sound?

483
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,400
Yes.

484
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,920
You know, it's funny you should mention that because I was just thinking that exact same thing.

485
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,140
I figured we were on the same wavelength about that.

486
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:40,060
Yeah, I was just thinking, yeah, this is about time to have somebody flapping toilet paper on their feet.

487
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,640
Or they could take one.

488
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,020
This is a part of TV.

489
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,760
You guys, head Deadline Nice

490
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,560
Oh, that would be fun.

491
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,160
Please say I'm off.

492
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,100
This is Paul Abbotdy enрей.

493
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,900
r

494
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:10,900


495
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,760
I forgot to whispering.

496
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:11,760


497
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:11,760


498
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:11,760


499
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:11,760


500
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:11,700
Shit is this??

501
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,620
So I did that for like five years.

502
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,140
Yeah.

503
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,180
A spanking every day or two.

504
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,440
Whipping with a briar switch.

505
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,980
That sounds like the film industry.

506
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,940
Coarse and manipulative.

507
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,260
Vile to its heart.

508
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,580
Well, I guess it depends.

509
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,940
Well, I'm not talking about independent filmmakers.

510
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm talking about...

511
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,720
Oh, it's worse.

512
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,560
It's worse for...

513
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,140
If independent filmmakers don't sleep,

514
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,460
people involved in indie films,

515
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,740
they just go without sleep.

516
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,140
That's because they chew Prylis in,

517
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,880
or whatever it's called.

518
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry, that's a commercial.

519
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,120
And they're not in the unions either.

520
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,780
So they're not...

521
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,380
The unions make you sleep.

522
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,240
They even make kids go to school and stuff.

523
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,240
You know, kid actors.

524
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,500
Yep.

525
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,380
So...

526
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,480
I don't remember.

527
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,300
Do you remember anything they taught you in school?

528
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,120
Because I don't.

529
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,540
I don't remember anything they taught you in school.

530
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,600
Not a bit of it.

531
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,400
Of what they taught me in school?

532
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,120
You don't remember what they taught me in school?

533
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,300
No.

534
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,940
I clearly don't remember what they taught you in school,

535
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,260
or we in school either.

536
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,100
I wouldn't think that you would.

537
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,980
Well, here's the sad thing.

538
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,440
I don't remember what they taught me,

539
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
and I'm trying to relearn it.

540
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,400
But it's different now.

541
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,020
I can't remember the facts.

542
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,340
They just slide in my head.

543
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,120
They're very interesting while I'm reading them.

544
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,360
And then they slide right out again.

545
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,000
They pile up.

546
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,160
If you look at my desk,

547
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,800
there's just this pile of facts

548
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,940
stacked up on the floor all around

549
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,380
that fell out of my ears after I read them.

550
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,900
Do pop quizzes help?

551
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,260
Yeah.

552
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,220
Can you just like maybe pop it back and...

553
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,480
There's too much sugar in those.

554
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,620
I can't...

555
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,300
You know, I'll take the sugarless pop quizzes.

556
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah.

557
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,320
Well, I'm taking all kinds of tests right now,

558
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,100
and I found that I can't remember them.

559
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,100


560
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,420
I can't remember a damn single thing,

561
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,520
and it's very frustrating.

562
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,740
And then I have these funny glasses,

563
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,300
like these reading glasses and stuff,

564
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,160
and they have a crack in the middle.

565
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,260
And I'll look down to check something again,

566
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,380
and the little crack will fall off.

567
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,900
And then I'll reach down to get my glasses,

568
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,680
and I'll bump my head and knock myself out.

569
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,200
Usually...

570
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
Well, sometimes I just pretend I've knocked myself out

571
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,580
and make the appropriate noise.

572
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,300
But usually I have actually done it.

573
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,340
I have a big crease right in the middle of my forehead now.

574
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh, no.

575
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,420
And a second stage concussion.

576
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,480
Just from reaching over to get those damn glasses.

577
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,000
Now, you'd think a normal person would go and buy a new pair.

578
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,820
For 88 cents, right?

579
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,120
Yeah.

580
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,580
But I don't know.

581
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,280
I get attached to those things and...

582
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,940
I knew a man with grease.

583
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,980
He had a little crease right in the middle of his forehead.

584
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,700
When he was bad, he was very, very bad.

585
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,940
Because he was mostly bored.

586
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,960
Yeah.

587
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,300
That'll...

588
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,740
Man, that'll lead to evil and crimes.

589
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,620
Boredom will.

590
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,580
I wonder what that's like.

591
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,820
I mean, I've been led to evil and crimes,

592
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,220
but not by boredom.

593
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,960
I know.

594
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,500
I hate that.

595
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,580
I can't...

596
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,700
It's actually hard for me to imagine boredom,

597
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,400
but I'm an emergentile.

598
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,440
So I'll make my own problems.

599
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
If I start...

600
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah, unfortunately, I get that.

601
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,460
Before I get bored.

602
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,840
Yeah, me too.

603
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,680
And in fact, now I've reached a level of post-emergentilism

604
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,660
where I'm kind of like an enraged factor.

605
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,140
I'm a factory worker in the 1890s or something like that.

606
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,040
And if somebody says,

607
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm bored,

608
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,740
I start strangling them and I have to be restrained.

609
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,780
I hate that.

610
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
Because there's nothing to be bored about

611
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,600
because everything is too freaking busy anyway.

612
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Don't you know what I mean?

613
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,640
I envy the bored sometimes.

614
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,060
Me too.

615
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,460
But maybe I shouldn't.

616
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,280
I don't really know.

617
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,360
Like I said, I don't really know what it's like.

618
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,280
Well, apparently there's a feeling of not having something to do,

619
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,400
but it's similar to having too many things to do

620
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,500
where you can't figure out what the freak you're going to do next

621
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,100
because there's so many things and paper and a pencil won't help you.

622
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,580
Well, see, that always just led to panic.

623
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,720
And that's my normal state of affairs

624
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,060
is a kind of a controlled, channeled panic.

625
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,020
Yeah.

626
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,180
I dig it, in a way.

627
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,000
I mean, that's my slack.

628
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,800
I hate it worse than the anti-feeling, which is boredom.

629
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,880
You like to wallow in panic, Reverend Stang?

630
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,020
Well, it's more like swimming, like swimming, dog paddling in panic.

631
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,280
Sprinting in panic.

632
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,520
Because you don't know how to swim.

633
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,000
You need to do the breaststroke.

634
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
It's like drowning in panic.

635
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,360
That's why you're married.

636
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,640
But now.

637
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,100
Well, I'm sure you've tried swimming dog style many times,

638
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,780
but what you need is, you know, is the breaststroke probably.

639
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,900
I mean, just ask.

640
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,580
You're close enough.

641
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,320
I'm sorry.

642
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,700
Wasn't there some gag about stroking and the stuff that I played earlier?

643
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,040
Or, no, it's in the stuff I was going to play in case you didn't call.

644
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,480
That's what it was.

645
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,460
I have a whole lot of stuff that I could.

646
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,760
So, you know, if you hung up, then the show would suddenly be, you know,

647
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:31,760


648
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,060
not boring.

649
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,180
Well, no, it would probably still be boring.

650
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,120
Well, let's see.

651
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,340
Let's see what I would have played.

652
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,200
Yeah, you're right.

653
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,220
You're absolutely right.

654
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,900
It was puzzling evidence show.

655
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,220
Philo reads junior high letter.

656
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,740
That's actually pretty funny.

657
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:58,800
His wife, Chaos McMamacat, found a letter written by a junior high kid outside of a school that,

658
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,740
well, it's pretty funny the way Philo reads it.

659
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,680
It'll make you puke next week.

660
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,540
You should never plagiarize children's schoolwork.

661
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,460
That's really sick.

662
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,060
I know they had movies about that.

663
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,760
They're supposed to be comedies and everything.

664
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,140
But just think of the poor plagiarized child like you're on the air someplace and you're receiving lots of money.

665
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,860
And you're going, if Mrs. Walker would prefer it, I would stand by the window.

666
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,760
Well, that's not homework.

667
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,700
That's more like when you're being reprimanded.

668
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
But you know what I mean?

669
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,360
They feel real creepy about it.

670
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:39,580
My third grade teacher had to tell me not to do that thing in the back of the room.

671
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,620
And she said, or you'll have to go to the doctor.

672
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:56,320
When my mom picked me up, I said, mammy, if I like push my hands, hold myself up on my desk using my hands, will I have to go to the doctor?

673
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,720
I was lying by omission because I left out what supported me.

674
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,400
And parting myself with my hands allowed me to do on that slightly curved third grade school desk.

675
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,320
But I didn't know.

676
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:16,480
Nobody ever said, you know, you only do that in private.

677
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,600
That's your private thing.

678
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,500
I didn't want my son to end up that way.

679
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,200
The first time I caught him having his way with the jets in a hot tub, he was about four.

680
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,820
I said, now, son, don't ever do that in front of mammy.

681
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,460
And really, that's just you.

682
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,540
You shouldn't do that around other.

683
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,220
You should wait until other people go away.

684
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,320
That's your private thing.

685
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,940
And he paused for a minute.

686
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,040
He goes, Dad, would you leave so I can finish doing my private thing?

687
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,220
And I said, no, you'll have to wait like I did.

688
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,100
So chances are he's happily he's happily just doing his private thing.

689
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,800
I wonder if he found a hot tub or if he's.

690
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,440
Maybe he doesn't need a hot tub to do that anymore.

691
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,820
Well, I don't know if it happened that long time ago.

692
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,480
I'm sure he's way past hot tub.

693
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:08,980
Oh, wait a minute.

694
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,420
That explains why he got married.

695
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,040
That's that's why.

696
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,820
Now I know why he got married.

697
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,640
So he could do his private thing with somebody else.

698
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,020
Yeah.

699
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,600
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

700
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,820
Of course it does.

701
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,860
Well, actually, it's the of of inter familial relationships.

702
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,580
My son married his high school sweetheart.

703
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,040
So I.

704
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,360
I.

705
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,100
I got married.

706
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:38,900
And they were in musical school musicals and plays together for five years before they left high school.

707
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:47,020
So I sat and saw his wife to be, you know, every time they did a play.

708
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,120
And I have to admit, I used to think I think that's prettiest girl in the school.

709
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,880
I really did.

710
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,940
I mean, just in terms of just being classic movie star type pretty.

711
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,780
She's real shy.

712
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,720
But you like that, too, do you?

713
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,460
Staying real talented.

714
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,960
My son ended up marrying that that shy, nice.

715
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,140
And rest her from your incredibly hot looking girl.

716
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,960
And now she teaches English in a south central L.A.

717
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,300
high school, the kind of high school that Snoop Dogg sings about.

718
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,580
And she's never had any trouble at all.

719
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,600
And I assume that's because all the boys in the class are in love with her.

720
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,740
Well, she probably she actually kind of likes it.

721
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,880
She likes her job.

722
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,620
Teaching.

723
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,400
Can you imagine that liking teaching high school?

724
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,400
Those are the people where there was a snout dog was rapping about snouts and stuff.

725
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:49,740
Yeah.

726
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,440
How how could you stand that for more than twenty five years?

727
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,180
Especially if you if the principal invaded your privacy.

728
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,880
Then you'd be really disrespectful.

729
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,740
Well, I don't care because all my schools have been destroyed by tornadoes.

730
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,880
Have they really?

731
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,380
No. But for what?

732
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:17,060
I don't know. But the last I heard on the news, we're all going to die in the Midwest because the tornadoes are going to kill us all.

733
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Where did they go?

734
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,780
Oklahoma.

735
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,660
They went to Oklahoma and then there are they still coming here?

736
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,200
I don't know.

737
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,060
I didn't look at the news again after that.

738
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,840
It was too scary.

739
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,420
Yeah. They try not to tell you, though, too much.

740
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,720
Because you might get, you know, freaked out and run around and.

741
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:47,340
Well, I was I was just telling Charleston earlier on the previous show that I swore off the news except for science and health, because that's usually good news.

742
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
But it's not.

743
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,360
I know.

744
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,100
Because of the stuff they don't remind you every day, such as that the oceans are dying.

745
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,280
And that when the oceans die, then the air dies.

746
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,980
And when the air dies, then everybody dies.

747
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,640
And then the rota first get a new chance to build a great new civilization.

748
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,740
Great.

749
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,260
A thousand million years from now.

750
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah. And we'll be I don't know where we'll be waiting in the wings, perhaps to start the cycle again.

751
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,760
But, yeah, I know what you mean.

752
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,180
It's very, very depressing.

753
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,620
Not to me. It's just a circle of life now.

754
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,980
So.

755
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,200
So you don't mind that beyond X day and the truth is the world may end real soon.

756
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,580
Thanks to what they've been doing to the ocean.

757
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,180
Don't care. I kind of that's that's what I do my private thing to man.

758
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,340
You know that that show.

759
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,580
Did you ever see that show?

760
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,060
Life after people is a subgenius pornography show.

761
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,940
It was predicated on what if all the people were gone?

762
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,960
How long would it take for everything in the world to die?

763
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
What if the world to turn back into jungle?

764
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,920
And what would happen to the animals?

765
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,020
One of the things I remember that was very charming was that the queen of England's little dogs are corgis.

766
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,840
Is that what they are?

767
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,200
Yes.

768
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,700
Corgi.

769
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,680
Corgi tire biters.

770
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:22,720
They said that within within 50 years, say, if the queen's corgis were able to escape from Buckingham Palace after eating the queen and all the butlers,

771
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,340
their descendants would no longer be recognizable as corgis.

772
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,020
Pretty much all dogs would look kind of alike.

773
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,360
50 years down the road, the Chihuahuas and the Great Danes would be no more.

774
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,100
And just between you and me, I think that would be a kindness.

775
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,800
Yes. Just think of the elaborate cruelties they staged to make a dog be like three inches tall and have big ears and stuff.

776
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,600
It's kind of weird.

777
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,220
Yeah, kind of weird.

778
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,700
I don't actually know.

779
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,040
I don't actually approve.

780
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,520
I understand, you know, terriers were bred for centuries to kill rats.

781
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:07,280
And certain dogs were trained for centuries and bred, selectively bred, might as well be franken dogs, to hunt.

782
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,280
But why would anybody breed a Chihuahua?

783
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,400
Well, they were often bred.

784
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,840
I can understand a Great Dane.

785
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,640
They're scary, but they're unhealthy, too.

786
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,700
You know, they're inbred.

787
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,500
They're born with bone diseases and arthritis.

788
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,800
And they get crazy.

789
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,340
You know, they have mental problems real easily.

790
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,220
They all have like weird thyroid eyes or something.

791
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,740
Like high inbred humans, like the royal family or the Bushes.

792
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,180
But weren't they bred so that you could carry them around in your purse?

793
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,040
Or your pocketbook.

794
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,060
Yes, or your pocketbook.

795
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,440
Or the handy addition to the shelf.

796
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,140
Or your fashion pocket of your outfit.

797
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,500
Those things give me the creeps.

798
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,520
Princess Weenie knows that.

799
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,220
That's where you put your carriers.

800
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,060
Oh, man.

801
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,600
Those little bug-eyed pug-nosed dogs with the...

802
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,800
I mean, they look like bats.

803
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,080
They have faces like a bat has.

804
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,300
And...

805
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,520
They seem cute and sweet.

806
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,440
No, they're not.

807
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,180
They're monsters.

808
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,100
Yeah, they are good eating.

809
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,440
Hey, Dr. Sinister.

810
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,920
They were originally Mr. Tacos.

811
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,720
Dr. Sinister just phoned in.

812
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,220
His phone is so beautifully clear that it sounds like he's in the same room.

813
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,760
Yeah.

814
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,140
You could hear a pin drop.

815
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,240
Wow.

816
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,280
That is the greatest phone I've ever heard in my life.

817
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,060
In your lice?

818
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,100
That is subnormal.

819
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,360
That's ex-ex-excentuous.

820
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,420
It's squeaky, man.

821
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,600
That sounds like a real person.

822
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,040
Well, that's the amazing thing.

823
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,240
I know Dr. Sinister is not a real person.

824
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,900
Right, exactly.

825
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,280
Dr. Sinister can sound just like a real person.

826
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,100
Isn't that amazing?

827
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,100
It's...

828
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,920
It's an essential skill for survival amongst the pinks.

829
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,200
Well, in your case, you're a real person.

830
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


831
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


832
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


833
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


834
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


835
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


836
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,200


837
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,340
In your case, it's survival among non-robots.

838
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,300
I think that's the thing we have to worry about in the coming century, if there is a

839
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,580
century coming in advance at any time, is that tiny little nano machines will ruin us.

840
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,080
They're ruining us.

841
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,660
How do you know they don't already, Dave?

842
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,380
Well, they already iron our shoes.

843
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,480
They cook our house.

844
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,380
They clean our clothes.

845
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,840
Oh, and mine aren't.

846
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,200
You got your shoes ironed?

847
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,980
I didn't get my shoes ironed.

848
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,560
Yeah.

849
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,060
They gave me some nano...

850
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,180
I don't know.

851
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,180


852
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,180


853
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,180


854
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,820
Blocks gave me a haircut the other day.

855
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,240
I mean, not in the conventional sense.

856
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,680
They actually just depilated my forehead again.

857
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Yeah, I was going to say, you just lost some hair.

858
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,780
Is that what you're saying?

859
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,580
Well, it's their fault.

860
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,900
Sometimes I suspect my barber of being a nanobot.

861
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,600
That would be horrible.

862
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:44,820
Then there's the onanobots who rant and preach subgenius stuff.

863
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,740
And satisfy themselves only, true to their onanistic nature.

864
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,680
Right.

865
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
I resemble that remark.

866
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,760
You know, it's funny.

867
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,600
We got...

868
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,120
There's a famous subgenius named Reverend Onan Kanabite.

869
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,540
Last week, I got...

870
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:09,320
We got a new member by the name of Reverend Onan, like an Irish name, O apostrophe nan.

871
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,580
Reverend Fred Onan or something.

872
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,240
And a Douglas Smith in Texas.

873
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,280
My, oh my.

874
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,160
Can you imagine?

875
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,080
Now, somebody named...

876
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,580
I've never heard of such a weird name.

877
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:20,660
I've never heard of such a weird name.

878
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,660


879
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,660


880
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,660


881
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,660


882
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:20,820
I've never heard of such a weird name.

883
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:20,820


884
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:20,820


885
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,280
What a weird coincidence.

886
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,800
I think when you walk in the wrong door, Stang, that's where you come out, if you know what

887
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,180
I mean, psycho-parathetically.

888
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,600
That's from another dimension.

889
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,940
That's your other you.

890
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,140
You sent that letter.

891
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,380
And you don't even...

892
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,100
And you were so advanced in your thinking when you did it.

893
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,820
When you were down in Texas, you actually wrote the letter.

894
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,120
You gave it to the post office and said, don't send until...

895
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,500
And then you opened it, and you went, wow, that's really weird.

896
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,880
I guess so then, back to the Future Three.

897
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,660
Well, I guess I'm going to have to...

898
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:50,820
Yes.

899
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,380
He was playing with himself again.

900
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,820
I didn't do that this time that I remember, but I should try that.

901
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
I could easily play tricks on myself.

902
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Like that guy in the movie, Memento, who gets mad at somebody and says, well, I'm just going

903
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,260
to convince myself that he's the guy who killed my wife, and then I'll kill him and I won't

904
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,200
feel guilty about it.

905
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,340
And then I'll forget about it.

906
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,720
Makes perfect sense to me.

907
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,640
I mean, that's very...

908
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,560
It follows, so logistically, from A to B to C.

909
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,760
Well, if you've seen that movie, and I have about ten times, forwards and backwards,

910
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,040
which doesn't make any difference in the case of that particular movie.

911
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,280
You actually can watch it backwards, and it sort of makes more sense.

912
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,840
Is it actually better?

913
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,440
No, no, it's perfect the way it is.

914
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,300
It's one of my faves.

915
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,480
We saw an interesting movie I didn't expect to see the other night called Enter Nowhere.

916
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:59,020
Yeah, well, I started to call it Enter Nothing, but it's called Enter Nowhere.

917
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,060
Not to be confused with Enter the Void.

918
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:07,760
Very low-budget movie, had a cast of four people stuck in a house in the woods.

919
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,620
They didn't know each other at all, but you find out they're connected.

920
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,240
When I started the movie up,

921
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,100
Princess Weave was going,

922
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,600
I don't want to watch this, this is one of those slasher movies.

923
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,380
And they make you think it is at first,

924
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,800
but it's really an hour and a half long twilight zone.

925
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,560
And I would have to sort of recommend such a movie

926
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,440
if someone were to want to watch an obscure movie.

927
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,580
Enter Nowhere shows what you can do with four people in one location.

928
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,940
A little chunk of woods, that's all it was.

929
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Yeah, a little bit of woods and a country road.

930
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

931
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,280
And a really good screen.

932
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,640
It's a really good script.

933
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,000
And most of the set is just in that little farmhouse cabin area, isn't it?

934
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,380
You know, I can get the farmhouse and the four actors.

935
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,500
It's the really good script that we seem to be dragging our feet on.

936
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,380
I just, I thought it was, that that was the main,

937
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
that was the focus of the place and stuff.

938
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,300
And that's why, you know, like who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

939
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,780
That's why the intensity was there.

940
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,460
Except for that they didn't know each other.

941
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,140
They tried to.

942
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,700
They looked out their windows every morning and thought,

943
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,480
what if I could perceive myself as greater than I am?

944
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,060
A better person.

945
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,180
A friendlier, happier.

946
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,040
Isn't that what everybody does every day?

947
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:37,340
They can go, I'm friendly and happy and good and smart and better than everyone else.

948
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,160
And doggone it, people like me.

949
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,720
And they lie every day.

950
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,300
And every word of it.

951
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,520
You know, what is that?

952
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,600
Every word is a lie.

953
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,340
How is that?

954
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,500
It's some cult where they can't.

955
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,140
Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better.

956
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,620
I can't remember where that came from, actually.

957
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,620
Yeah, it's from a particular self-help cult.

958
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,540
Every day and every way, I'm getting better and better.

959
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,220
Every day and every way, I'm getting better and better.

960
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,640
Every day and every way, I'm getting better and better.

961
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,160
Namiho, mani, yin, rengi, kyo.

962
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,220
Namiho, rengi, kyo.

963
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,220
Namiho, rengi, kyo.

964
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,540
Better.

965
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,160
Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha.

966
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,660
You can't even remember their names.

967
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,280
I'm not thinking about anything else.

968
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,280


969
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,440
No.

970
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,480
Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha, Harukisha.

971
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,740
Namiho, rengi, kyo.

972
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,020
Namiho, rengi, kyo.

973
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,680
You can't see me.

974
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm not here.

975
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:31,320
Think of your longevity, Stan, as a cult of non-self-help, as a cult of self-destruction, perhaps.

976
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,980
Just think how long you've lasted.

977
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:41,200
Those other guys named Dave, unfortunately, who are also bald, their credibility is gone

978
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,760
once they, you know, find out, they vet them and find out that they've been dead.

979
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,200
Diddling Pomeranians or whatever they do after midnight.

980
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,800
And then they're returned to the fold.

981
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,280
That's what they do to Pomeranians in Pomeroy.

982
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,340
After midnight, we're going to let them palms go down.

983
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,940
It's palm one.

984
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,540
You're delicious.

985
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,100
Pommy.

986
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,400
I'm going to be performing a wedding in Pomeroy.

987
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,660
Priestess Pisces and Reverend Suds Bashar are going to get married the next day.

988
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,840
And they're going to have to go.

989
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,060
To the Pomeroy courthouse and get a marriage license.

990
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:28,340
Which won't be nearly as weird as the time Pope S. Lilith and Reverend Thea went to the Sherman courthouse

991
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,940
to get a wedding license, since they're both...

992
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:33,960
Neutral?

993
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,320
Female.

994
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,180
Legally?

995
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,500
Female.

996
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,020
No, legally, at that time, Lil was still legally a male.

997
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,720
But Lil's driver's license said,

998
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:45,800
Lilith...

999
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,480
Well, nowadays, in New York State, it doesn't matter.

1000
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,240
Didn't I?

1001
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,260
Huh?

1002
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,300
Nowadays, it doesn't matter in New York State.

1003
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,680
Well, thank goodness for that.

1004
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,160
It doesn't?

1005
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
Yeah, they passed away in marriage a year or two ago.

1006
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,220
And aren't you glad now?

1007
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,240
I mean, just think of the rejoicing in the streets of LA.

1008
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,260
That sounds like fun.

1009
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,100
Evil people.

1010
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,220
I'm going to marry five lesbians.

1011
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,440
Wait, that wouldn't do me any good.

1012
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,840
No.

1013
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,860
If I marry five lesbians for one night,

1014
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,120
that might be kind of good.

1015
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,900
You know, here's, I think, a solution to the whole marriage equality issue

1016
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,740
that I think Republicans could get behind.

1017
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,060
Let's replace all marriages with corporations.

1018
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,920
Right.

1019
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,580
You know, like, if you want to get married in a church, that's one thing, but...

1020
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,780
And say BP could, well, we'll use another one,

1021
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,320
but one of the major oil companies could be the groom,

1022
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,560
and, you know, have an elaborate group of others.

1023
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,780
And the U.S. government could be the bride, or the bribe.

1024
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,160
Or two individuals.

1025
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:44,620
That happens.

1026
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,220
That's about 50 years ago.

1027
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,440
And then...

1028
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,080
Right.

1029
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,760
Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,980
Princess, we're meant to...

1031
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,680
We should just forget the whole marriage thing and form a...

1032
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,120
Just incorporate.

1033
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,940
Yeah, just incorporate.

1034
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,100
Yeah.

1035
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,440
Period.

1036
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,300
You know what, though?

1037
00:45:59,320 --> 00:45:59,920
I mean, say for...

1038
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,100
But then it would be limited to two individuals.

1039
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:02,840


1040
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,700
You know, I actually am president of a corporation.

1041
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,820
And Dr. Philo Drummond is the vice president,

1042
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,160
so that kind of means me and Philo are married.

1043
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,540
And that's a horrifying thought.

1044
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:14,720
Ooh.

1045
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,400
If you've ever...

1046
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,720
Scary.

1047
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,520
You know how Philo sounds?

1048
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,360
Well, that's the way he looks.

1049
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,600
He looks like that, too.

1050
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,600
Yeah, yeah, that's...

1051
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,080
Yeah.

1052
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,280
You might as well have a rhesus monkey in your house

1053
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,360
and dress it up in scanty little thong panties and stuff.

1054
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,700
That's a good description.

1055
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,340
A big rhesus monkey.

1056
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
A big rhesus monkey and thong panties.

1057
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,720
Yeah, he's a little taller than I am.

1058
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,740
But you're not going to tell him that I said that, are you?

1059
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,600
Because he might think I'm saying he's a little rhesus monkey.

1060
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:44,600


1061
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:44,600


1062
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:44,600


1063
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:44,600


1064
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,200
He's a rhesus monkey wearing thong panties.

1065
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,060
No, he wouldn't mind that,

1066
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,980
as long as we make it clear he's a big rhesus monkey.

1067
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,440
Actually, he's more of a marmoset.

1068
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,460
I have the wings of a chimpanzee.

1069
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,400
I fly over the western sea.

1070
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,120
I climb a million hairy trees.

1071
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,100
What's this song?

1072
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,340
Oh, that sounds like Men of Athens, right?

1073
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,740
I thought it was White Rabbit at first.

1074
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,860
Yeah, it starts just like White Rabbit.

1075
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,680
This is my new favorite music.

1076
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,280
It's music from 1970s porno movies

1077
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,260
collected on some album.

1078
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,560
And yes, it opens just like White Rabbit

1079
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,800
and then gets like this.

1080
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,220
But the reason I unearthed it was

1081
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:40,360
I got a new microscope that has a built-in camera.

1082
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,720
I've been filming bugs.

1083
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,360
Bug porn for hours a day.

1084
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,500
And lately I've been editing it.

1085
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,300
And I was going, besides narration,

1086
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,860
this should have some kind of music.

1087
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,680
And I went, this stuff, this is perfect.

1088
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,900
When you see these single-celled

1089
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,880
and multiple-celled animalcules

1090
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,780
accidentally rubbing against each other

1091
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,800
with this porno music in the background,

1092
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,900
I think,

1093
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,040
I think men out there know what I'm talking about.

1094
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,500
Yeah.

1095
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,060
When you get you a Philodena rotifer

1096
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,300
with his corona wriggling his cilia at full speed

1097
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,040
and his little mastax pumping away in there.

1098
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,640
Oh, I finally got a shot.

1099
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,580
I love cilia.

1100
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,840
I didn't know I'd done it.

1101
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,600
Can I put my pseudopod on you?

1102
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,060
I did not know I'd gotten a shot

1103
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,600
until I was looking at old footage.

1104
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,240
But I've been trying for a long time to,

1105
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:50,900
get a shot of a particular type of rotifer excreting.

1106
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,860
Because I have a cladocerone with diarrhea.

1107
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,280
I have a whole, like, 20 minutes of that.

1108
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,860
I don't want to lose it. Make sure.

1109
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,360
A couple of other, a couple of,

1110
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,100
a couple of annelids or roundworms or something.

1111
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,440
Oh, annelids are very hot.

1112
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,740
You can watch these things eat.

1113
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,280
But I didn't know where to look.

1114
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,240
I know there's rather eerily no глазure on those.

1115
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,660
My first hit of neres şehrewführing

1116
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,340
was actually when I went to the flower nursery

1117
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:21,940
to try and get one of those hard liverys,

1118
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:30,340
the Erguotlis ye busyμέkeli which have sting this year.

1119
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,780
It's so hot, it'll always hop on me switch isn't it?

1120
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,620
That one, that one's kind of pursue climate.

1121
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,720
Oh, yeah, I intend to call it a break shoot

1122
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,500
if you want to go download it.

1123
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,260
Well, I do have these.

1124
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,260


1125
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,300
It doesn't look any different than it did when he ate it.

1126
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:51,040
So I'm assuming that what he does is sucks in these single-celled algae things,

1127
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:57,040
grinds them up, and digests the juices somehow, but the skin comes out.

1128
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,080
So it's like this floppy, emptied-out algae cell.

1129
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,460
I have an interesting pet, you know, Dave.

1130
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,460
They all have names, too. Do you know that?

1131
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,060
What that can do to your mind?

1132
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,740
It's a good thing you're not into subatomic particles,

1133
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:18,600
because all of those cats went insane just because of the laws of physics they so faithfully followed.

1134
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,540
Now, as a subgenius biologist, or is that what you would call a biologist?

1135
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,780
Zoologist, really.

1136
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,280
A zoologist, yes. I'm sorry.

1137
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:27,840
Much like animals.

1138
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:37,140
Down at that level, though, the difference between plants and animals and fungi becomes blurred.

1139
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,940
I'm a fungi.

1140
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,920
Dr. Sinister.

1141
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,000
Sinister is a real fun guy, despite his name.

1142
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,740
And his anus is in his feet, like many fun guys are.

1143
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,280
Well, actually, your soul of a subgenius is located in the foot.

1144
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:51,880
The foot gland.

1145
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,480
The foot is a gland. Did you know that?

1146
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,680
That's the first time I've said that since 1980, by the way.

1147
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,740
Mine overexcretes.

1148
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,220
Your foot gland?

1149
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,140
Yeah.

1150
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,680
Is that what that smell is?

1151
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,980
Well, that's not the problem there.

1152
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,420
I thought that was something in the studio, but that's you?

1153
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,620
No, that's coming...

1154
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,800
All the way coming over the phone lines from Ashtabula?

1155
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,740
You can smell my foot gland all the way from Ashtabula?

1156
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,320
Well, it is your soul, Dave.

1157
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,200
That's where the soul is located.

1158
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,940
Well, I've heard, and I'm not sure if this is correct or just maybe a bad lecture,

1159
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,680
that I don't have one.

1160
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,760
A soul, so to speak.

1161
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,380
I mean, they claim everybody does.

1162
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:34,880
You have two.

1163
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,120
There's the S-O-L-E and the S-O-U-L.

1164
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,040
And then there's also a...

1165
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,420
There's a third one called the S-O-A-L, but I'm not supposed to talk about that.

1166
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,100
No, it's...

1167
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,620
That's for the fourth subgenius Bible.

1168
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,720
Well, it's a data diagram anyway.

1169
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,840
To begin with, you don't want to lead people down the wrong trail, if you know what I mean.

1170
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,140
You go check in the wrong places and have them...

1171
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,120
I've made a career out of leading people down the wrong trail.

1172
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,740
And, you know, it's not by telling them to go down the wrong trail.

1173
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,080
I don't tell them anything but the truth.

1174
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,000
But...

1175
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,000
I just tell part of the truth.

1176
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,180
I don't tell them everything.

1177
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,280
They fill in the blanks and go off down the wrong trail.

1178
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,380
Are you saying that that's what Goebbels did and others like him?

1179
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,320
Yeah, Rush Limbaugh.

1180
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,080
That's why Rush...

1181
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,620
That accounts for Rush Limbaugh's gigantic audience.

1182
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,820
It's not that he lies, except by omission.

1183
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:37,300
He will tell a tiny piece of the truth and his audience, being hoopoe heads for the most part,

1184
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,040
like my audience, fill in the blanks.

1185
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,220
He will tell a tiny piece of the truth and his audience, being hoopoe heads for the most part,

1186
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,320
like my audience, fill in the blanks.

1187
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,500
With what they most want to hear,

1188
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,320
which is usually that all their problems are somebody else's fault.

1189
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,000
You know, it's funny.

1190
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,060
It kind of reminds me of this time I had eaten some strange mushrooms

1191
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,880
and lied down and took my glasses off.

1192
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,900
You know, and then I sit up after some length of time I couldn't determine,

1193
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,500
not putting my glasses on, but I'm looking around

1194
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,180
and the entire room is covered in shag carpet.

1195
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,240
Like every single surface is shag carpet.

1196
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,420
And, you know, it's like I could see the individual fibers.

1197
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,900
You know, but then I realized,

1198
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,040
you know, I'm not going to be able to see the individual fibers.

1199
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,580
So wait a second.

1200
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,080
I had taken my glasses off.

1201
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,440
Everything's fuzzy for that reason.

1202
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,960
My imagination, which had been poisoned by those unfortunately selected fungi,

1203
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,900
my imagination was filling in the gaps in what my eyes could provide.

1204
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,880
It's wild when your perception does that.

1205
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,660
What you omitted, I'm sorry to say,

1206
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,140
is if you listen very carefully to the music in the background,

1207
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,960
you will realize that either the milkman or the utility man was on his way to the room.

1208
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,800
And you'd better get that negligee on pretty quick.

1209
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,820
Yeah, it's fucking sad.

1210
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,300
That's what the shag carpet was.

1211
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,920
You were filling in the first part of the 70s porn film.

1212
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,660
The carpet who shagged me.

1213
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,100
I can see this music being used for more than just porn.

1214
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,460
Like this, you could use this in a chase scene or something.

1215
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:03,700
Well, and it's especially good for footage of the badass guy walking down the street, you know.

1216
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,680
Yeah, I can see like, I can see a couple of...

1217
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,300
I can't tell, by the way, I've moved my feet.

1218
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,500
I'm a woman's man.

1219
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,140
No time to eat.

1220
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,800
Something like that.

1221
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:20,480
I can see like a cutlass and a GTO chasing each other through the streets of San Francisco to this music.

1222
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,100
Yes, definitely going up and down those hills.

1223
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:28,840
I can also see like pirates, like kind of transvestite pirates, like Ruby and stuff like in the old comics.

1224
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,140
I'm fighting it out, duking it out like in semi-fast motion.

1225
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,800
No, I can see a paramecium rubbing up against a diatom.

1226
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,800
I guess I have a different approach.

1227
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,400
I can see that as well.

1228
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,360
I actually, I have footage.

1229
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,000
I was seeing that earlier.

1230
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,940
I see myself in the 70s.

1231
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,840
Speaking of Kant.

1232
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,760
You did?

1233
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,780
Which we can't really do very well.

1234
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,180
We can't.

1235
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:56,820
No, we can't.

1236
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,740
Dr. Sinister, have you heard of a band called Descartes?

1237
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,200
A Kant?

1238
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,720
No.

1239
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,000
The two philosopher names, Descartes.

1240
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,960
If I'm pronouncing Descartes.

1241
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,420
Okay, I didn't take French.

1242
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,100
Me neither.

1243
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,620
Me neither, but I always heard people say Descartes.

1244
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,520
Okay, well, see, I don't hear either.

1245
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,700
So that's why I pronounce everything.

1246
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,320
That's why the headphones are always turned up to maximum volume when I come in here, and I've got to be very careful.

1247
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,800
Yeah, you noticed.

1248
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,420
Well, can I just.

1249
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,800
Anyway, yeah, yeah, Descartes, a Kant.

1250
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,800
Can I very briefly just quote something from Monty Python?

1251
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:32,420
Yeah.

1252
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,780
René Descartes was a drunken old fart who could drink you under the table.

1253
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,420
I've heard that.

1254
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,180
Continue.

1255
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,440
Yes.

1256
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,440
That was Bruce.

1257
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,520
That was the Bruce skit.

1258
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,520
There's another one that we can't say outside the city of Harvard.

1259
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,900
Ah, but I can tell about walking with my friends through the woods in the 70s,

1260
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:55,000
and they all wanted me to take my shoes off so I could connect with the earth directly with my feet.

1261
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,860
And I said, no, I can feel it just fine through my rubber soles.

1262
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,520
Mm-hmm.

1263
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,500
What a useless memory.

1264
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,600
It is useless.

1265
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,120
I remember those same times when I was thinking about walking around.

1266
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:08,420
It's completely useless.

1267
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:08,420


1268
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:08,420


1269
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,480
The rubber sole in the woods.

1270
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,220
I was usually way, way too.

1271
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,020
I like to revolve her better.

1272
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:21,200
Yeah, well, I had taken far too much of the snug, snug, and was feeling insufferable.

1273
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,280
And so I killed everyone.

1274
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,520
I'm sorry.

1275
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,520
I'll shut up.

1276
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,480
No, that's okay.

1277
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:34,900
You know, since everybody's talking about their drug experiences, when I was 16, I made

1278
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,320
the big mistake of taking some.

1279
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,120
What do they call that?

1280
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:40,780
LSD?

1281
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,780
It was LDS.

1282
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,480
That's what Mitt Romney was on back in the 60s.

1283
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,600
He did way too much LDS.

1284
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,900
No, I actually, I did the LDS later.

1285
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,280
Years later, I caught a chronic syndrome.

1286
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:59,420
But I was in a car with these buddies, and they didn't have as bad a reaction as me.

1287
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:05,360
In fact, if that day hadn't happened, I'd probably be working in the rotoscope department

1288
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,080
at Digital Domain in Hollywood.

1289
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:07,580
But.

1290
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:13,560
Be that as it may, we picked up a stray kitten, and it crapped in the car.

1291
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,720
It dropped a little kitty dropping in the car.

1292
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:24,480
And in my hallucinating state, I saw and smelled the car as being completely covered, ceiling

1293
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,860
to floor, in cat poop.

1294
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,500
And with that, friends, we must leave you.

1295
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,320
You've had toxoplasmosis ever since.

1296
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,340
Could I tell my one now, too?

1297
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,100
It's very short.

1298
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,600
It explains a lot.

1299
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,460
Okay.

1300
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,220
Okay.

1301
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,180
I had taken far too much.

1302
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,320
We didn't know when we were going to get off, so to speak.

1303
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,220
So we just kept on taking more and more.

1304
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,820
And there was a little bit of sweat in the crack of my derriere.

1305
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,320
And I became convinced that I had done my pants.

1306
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,820
So I'd run upstairs.

1307
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,200
Embarrassed because I was with the girl and stuff.

1308
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,540
I'd run upstairs, and I'd look, and it would be there, and then it would be gone.

1309
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,600
And then I would say, no, it's not there.

1310
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,420
And I'd come back downstairs, and then I would do that again.

1311
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,560
Like, I did that about twice.

1312
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,200
Twenty times.

1313
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,660
I could never once convince myself I hadn't, even after I looked down there.

1314
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,540
I'm sorry.

1315
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,920
Subgenius.com.

1316
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:24,320
If you need more information, which you probably don't, but if you were curious, you could

00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:32,500

1319
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:35,900
Thank you.

1320
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,140
Dr. Sinister.

1321
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:37,540
Thank you.

1322
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:37,880
Princess.

1323
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,660
We are our doe queen of all the UFOs.

1324
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,000
Thank you.

1325
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,500
And your host, your truly, Reverend Ibn Singh.

1326
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,900
Praise Bob.

1327
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,940
And, uh...

1328
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,720
And Hail Connie.

1329
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,540
And, uh...

1330
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,080
Hail.

1331
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,780
Hail, yeah.

1332
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,960
Hail, yes.

1333
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,720
83.

1334
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:53,960
And...

1335
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,240
Are you suffering from issues?

1336
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,360
Pain.

1337
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:57,800
High.

1338
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,060
Fear.

1339
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:58,440
Pressure.

1340
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,260
Congestive.

1341
00:58:59,280 --> 00:58:59,840
Vitality.

1342
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,260
Failure.

1343
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:00,860
Unbalanced.

1344
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,400
Sickness.

1345
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,260
Irregular.

1346
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:02,860
Youthfulness.

1347
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,800
Clogged.

1348
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,160
Energy.

1349
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,340
If so, you are not alone.

1350
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,060
Million.

1351
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,680
Millions of people are suffering from problems.

1352
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,740
If you'd like to live your life free of sickness, pain, and fear,

1353
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,160
increase vitality, energy, and youthfulness, your body healing itself,

1354
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,600
this might be the most important message you'll ever hear.

1355
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:25,140
An effective and exclusive formula of wild-crafted 100% organic...

1356
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,320
What?

1357
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,760
And organic herbs is now available.

1358
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,460
It is extremely effective and starts to work within days.

1359
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,780
In all directions down there.

1360
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:45,040
Friends, I've been listening back to this show and I realized that I made a horrendous

1361
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:53,160
sort of a scientific mistake in that I was talking about phylodina rotifers and I referred

1362
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:02,460
to them in every case as him, when in fact, phylodina rotifers, all rotifers are parthenogenic,

1363
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,760
which means...

1364
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,700
Basically, they're females that can just kind of fertilize themselves in a way.

1365
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,760
And they don't need males.

1366
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,840
There are male rotifers, but one in a thousand.

1367
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,680
So I just wanted to make sure that my listeners did not feel misled regarding sex of the rotifers.

1368
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,280
I was just...

1369
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,420
It's easy for me to say him because when you look at one, you know, it's a male.

1370
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:33,600
It's a female.

1371
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:33,600


1372
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,560
It doesn't look very girlish, really.

1373
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,860
Especially not the phylodinas.

1374
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,940
It's not like many fun guys are.

1375
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,340
Sire, there is no more money.

1376
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,760
We gotta get some money!

1377
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:52,220
That dirty, Turkish, hark-a-back, flackin' wharton, Philip Buckaburton, perkaluma, Burton,

1378
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,580
Dirt, and Buston, I don't know!

1379
01:00:54,800 --> 01:01:00,940
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show and we're even more glad that some listeners

1380
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,860
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1381
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:09,840
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archives that are out there.

1382
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:09,840


1383
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:09,840


1384
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:09,840


1385
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:17,840
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1386
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:24,420
go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1387
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,780
and help out financially as best you can.

1388
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:34,120
Now we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1389
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,780
to make their own situations worse.

1390
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,720
But some of you still have jobs.

1391
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,640
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1392
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,020
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1393
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:56,160
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay

1394
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:56,820
Dobbs.

1395
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,300
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1396
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,040
P.O.

1397
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,680
Box 181417.

1398
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:14,780
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1399
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:20,020
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1400
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:37,960
Like subscribe if you haven't already.

1401
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:37,960


1402
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,940
We are here for the top five of this year's nut job series.

1403
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,980
Beat gas and drive your car 80k to that awesomestuy.

1404
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,040
3 days of school grad from the deshalb school district you might ever imagine you know literally

1405
01:02:52,040 --> 01:03:01,240
0.001Bit back inside the door.
