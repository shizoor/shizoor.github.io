1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,540
This is an hour that comes to all except in states that don't have daylight saving.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,620
I, sir, was referring to your Antipodeans of Jesus show.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,640
The dead never laugh.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:17,640


5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,660
The sounds of summer.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,760
The waves on the beach.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,440
The smack of tennis ball against cricket bat.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,380
Chasing it in the sand.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,940
Swimming in the sea.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,620
Feeling your skin blister and burn under the ultraviolet light.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,600
Radiation.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,320
The smell of meat burning on the barbecue.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,160
The salads.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,340
The beer in the chili bin.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,920
Sand between your toes and in your jandals.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,700
Summer.

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,820
Summer in the Antipodeans.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,960
Yes, it's a...

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:14,680
What?

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,600
What's going on?

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,580
What am I doing in this lift?

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Where are we?

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,020
What's that...

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,420
What's that...

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,220
What's that music?

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,920
What's going...

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,220
Ooh.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,140
That's awfully strange.

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,600
What the hell is going on?

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,220
Why am I hearing this horrible jangly music?

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,420
Why am I in this ancient 1950s style lift with an ancient 1950s style lift attendant?

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,640
What's going on here?

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,500
Oh no.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,040
Oh no.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,620
Of course it's a jangly music.

36
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


37
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


38
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


40
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


45
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


46
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


47
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


48
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,800
I forgot.

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,020
Summer in the Antipodeans.

50
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,060
That's the Christmas period.

51
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,360
Oh crap.

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,160
Christmas is here again.

53
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,740
It's come around.

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,540
That horrible, horrible time has come around.

55
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,360
When they play that ancient Christmas music again and again.

56
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,340
All the old Christmas favorites.

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,940
White Christmas.

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,300
What a joke.

59
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,840
I mean, what a joke.

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
The...

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,600
The...

62
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


63
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


65
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


66
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


67
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


68
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


69
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


70
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


71
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


72
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


73
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


74
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


75
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


76
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,600


77
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,140
What the hell is he getting to?

78
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,820
What is the...

79
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,760
Is he...

80
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:20,760


81
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,180
Is the vanilla ice cream in your cone?

82
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,880
Or more likely falling on the ground because you didn't know how to lick it like I did when

83
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,920
I was your age.

84
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,620
Anyway, I've got to...

85
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,760
I've got to fight the Christmas.

86
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,720
I've got to fight...

87
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,300
Look here.

88
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,140
I want to register a complaint.

89
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,960
Next please.

90
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm sorry.

91
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm sorry.

92
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,580


93
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,580


94
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,580


95
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,580


96
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,580


97
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:47,580


98
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,540
I'm sorry!

99
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,880
The Christmas powers that be.

100
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,180
Damn, what are we going to do?

101
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,780
Oh, I know.

102
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
I'll just dive inside.

103
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,020
Wav'em off these ultraviolet radiations and I'll...

104
00:02:59,920 --> 00:02:59,960
I'll...

105
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,120
Yes.

106
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,180
That's what I'll do.

107
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,040
I'll create a show.

108
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,720
In which we spit...

109
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,700
We pit.

110
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
The X-mas man.

111
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,500
In the fat, red suit.

112
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,960
Against the ex-day man.

113
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,440
In the suit of dye.

114
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,980
And we'll see who wins!

115
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,580
Wait.

116
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,080
Yes, that's what I'll do. We'll fight it. We'll fight it. Yes, we'll fight it.

117
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,380
Because X-Men cannot... Because Santa Claus cannot stand up to J.R.R. Bob-Dogs.

118
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,680
No, honestly. No, really. Yes. Really. True. Yes.

119
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,980
You'll see. You'll see. You'll see. And you'll be sorry.

120
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:17,560
To be continued...

121
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:47,420
To be continued...

122
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:57,560
To be continued...

123
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:47,560
To be continued...

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:06:17,560
To be continued...

125
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,960
To be continued...

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:35,280
To be continued...

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,380
To be continued...

128
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,640
To be continued...

129
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,220
To be continued...

130
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
To be continued...

131
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,020
To be continued...

132
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,020
To be continued...

133
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,000
To be section 18...

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000


135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000


136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,060
To be section 18...

137
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,320
Also, give a bang for your money.

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Thank you.

139
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,660
Thank you.

140
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,940
Thank you.

141
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,240
Thank you.

142
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,540
Thank you.

143
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,760
Thank you.

144
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,460
Thank you.

145
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:47,880
Thank you.

146
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,680
Thank you.

147
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,180


148
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
Thank you.

149
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,140
Thank you.

150
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,320
Thank you.

151
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,180
Thank you.

152
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,620
Thank you.

153
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:27,760
Thank you.

154
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,300
Thank you.

155
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,940
Thank you.

156
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,340
What was that all about?

157
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,580
Well, let's see what we had.

158
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,180
Firstly, we had the

159
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,940
French subgenius, Saul Soleil,

160
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,760
explaining to us about

161
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,760
and Joe's apartment, although what those two things have to do with hedgehogs I still don't quite understand.

162
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,440
Then we had some old ESO swamp radio with Professor Chaz Smith, Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

163
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,900
discussing the fact that we're in the Jesus season, or rather they were, about the 20th of November 2002.

164
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,860
Next we had the Jethro's, there'll be another one of theirs coming up pretty soon, with Holly Golly Christmas.

165
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,680
Immediately followed thereafter, in triplicate actually, cheap reverb you know, were by Just John,

166
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:30,740
which you can reach at just-john.com, explaining just what does Santa do.

167
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:40,280
And now, I think we need some advertising. After all, it is the season to advertise, isn't it?

168
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,060
Your husbands will be more cheerful on dark mornings if you polish their Johnsons.

169
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,840
In fact, they're not.

170
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,920
I've heard several women say they were glad of a chance to help polish their husbands big or little.

171
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,180
Like all of us, they're glad to help in any way with self-polishing.

172
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,620
In fact, the regular use of rubbing or buffing will make your husbands last five times longer.

173
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,440
It will sparkle like new. It's a tremendous labor.

174
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,540
But, to get results, may I make a helpful suggestion?

175
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,840
Be sure to keep it protected with coat. Simply apply and let dry.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,020
To know and act is one in the same.

177
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,160
If you know what's right, do it.

178
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,580
Take control of your customer. Get them up.

179
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,520
Let her feel your individuality. Your good taste unique.

180
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,280
There's no reason for her to shop department stores and see the same old.

181
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,020
Get it? We ain't McDonald's.

182
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,240
Muse, we're special. Your customer's special.

183
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Enthuse, any piece can be done anyway. Imagine.

184
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,980
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

185
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,500
Mithras won his fight.

186
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,440
Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Come one, come all!

187
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,960
It's He-Bob. Hey kids, you can help the mighty Sub-Teenus Rice overthrow the evil normals with new Bobcops action figure with Rockin' Pie.

188
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,360
What I wouldn't do from Bobcops.

189
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,000
Get new one.

190
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,100
More chocolatey pebbles from you know who?

191
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm a chocolate space cadet. Life support system down to zero cocoa.

192
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,180
Feeling space free.

193
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,120
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles. Now so chocolatey.

194
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,000
Mmm, smells coconut.

195
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,840
Space cocoa lipid.

196
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,580
Blue.

197
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,320
Well friends, what do you think? Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

198
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,940
Or is it...

199
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:51,340
The horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

200
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,440
It's so separate. It's so separate.

201
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm a winner.

202
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,040
I know my goals.

203
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,460
I am intelligently aggressive.

204
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,820
I sell.

205
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,640
From my total knowledge of merchandise.

206
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,720
Using appropriate adjectives.

207
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,240
I act with an always positive mindset.

208
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,840
The more I sell, the more I'll have.

209
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,040
Try Uncle Bob's Vermilion Fentworm Bittles.

210
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,600
We use the whole worm, fry it up right, and give you the tasty soft parts and the crispy skin.

211
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,420
Yep, that's a mighty fine worm, and it doesn't taste like chicken.

212
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:52,700
You'll need those 999 sub-nutrients, because the evil alien flying reverse vampire monkeys stole my astral boy blushie during one of my last seven moves,

213
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:59,000
as I tried to stay one step ahead of the brain-sucking, snake-handling, tri-lateralist zombie Shriner Chuds.

214
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,720
Besides, it was falling apart.

215
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,420
Now if that's not a straight line, give me narwhal wang stew or deer head chili, or a Nigerian ee handjob,

216
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,300
or heavy sedation, or a second chance, or kill me!

217
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,520
The more I sell,

218
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,700
the more I'll have.

219
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,700
The more I sell,

220
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,700
the more I'll have.

221
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,720
The more I sell,

222
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,860
the more I'll have.

223
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,000
The more I sell,

224
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,400
the more I'll have.

225
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll have the more I sell, the more I'll have.

226
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,480
Wait, bring up...

227
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,980
You'll wonder where your teeth went when you brush your teeth with Danso Peps.

228
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,180
Danso Peps.

229
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,300
Danso Peps.

230
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,600
It's Candy Frappy.

231
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,860
It's Frappy Candy.

232
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,640
Stop.

233
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,020
Eh?

234
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,260
You're both right.

235
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,160
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

236
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,540
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors and colors.

237
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,280
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

238
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,220
And the taste?

239
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,500
Yeah, Frappy Candy.

240
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,540
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms.

241
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,320
For several days now, I should say, I think.

242
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,280
So don't forget, that's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

243
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,620
Now with extra dimension Love Hamster 16.

244
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,360
Habitual not included.

245
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,720
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends, this one's the beans for maximum best fun.

246
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,540
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

247
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,540
From Squidco.

248
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,860
The Gobi Bar People.

249
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,000
The Gobi Bar People.

250
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

251
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,840
Sleigh bells ringing all around, all around.

252
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,100
I'm worried, goodness knows.

253
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,220
Cause when Santa came to my eyes last year.

254
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,540
He went away and left his club.

255
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,460
I knew he was gonna bring me lots of things.

256
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,780
So happy I could dance.

257
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,160
When I went down to buy my present, I also found Santa Claus' head.

258
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Poor old Santa Claus, poor old Santa Claus, my kids will stay.

259
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,220
When they see him bring their presents, they're sure in his long-tailed underwear.

260
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,840
I asked my daddy who knows everything, how such a thing could be.

261
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,100
His face turned red and he scratched his head, and this is what he said to me.

262
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,580
Well now, my dear, like when Santa Claus made it down the chimney last year to lay the loot on you,

263
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,720
he forthwith crept along on his tippy-toes and quite by accident flipped on the stereo.

264
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,900
And like a rock-and-roll sound which came forth, panicked old Whiskers out of his clothes.

265
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,780
So he split the scene forthwith and made it up the chimney post-haste.

266
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,100
And he said, poor old Santa Claus, poor old Santa Claus, my kids will stay.

267
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,380
When they see him bring their presents, they're sure in his long-tailed underwear.

268
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,060
Oh, good Lord!

269
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:34,700
Oh, good Lord!

270
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,060
Yuviu, stop fetching me.

271
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,040
He was carrying a compiled notice with Players Christmas Jill tag on the board.

272
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,400
icknett should

273
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,880
Well, I wanted to give a special thanks to Maximum-For-M versa.

274
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,380
We started off with an advertisement for husband Polish.

275
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,900
Then we had the old Bob ads again.

276
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,060
Yeah, those old things.

277
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,960
You heard them in the last Christmas show I believe.

278
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,700
And then, there was Help Hope Huey selling the old vermilionㅋㅋㅋㅋ

279
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,600
�rìnklviren Arkansas until this are very tasty indeed.

280
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:15,500
called Densopep, which you would need after eating Dr. Bleepo Abernathy's Candy Frappy

281
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,080
Frappy Candy.

282
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,880
What was it?

283
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,620
Frappy Candy Candy Frappy.

284
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,860
I can't remember, but it was off Bob's Media Pollution, I believe.

285
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:33,040
And then after that was a piece of the 365 Days Project, which was run by Otis F. Fodder

286
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,280
at ubu.com.

287
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,100
That's how it's spelled, U-B-U.

288
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:48,100
A strange little vanity number called Poor Old Santa Claus, which is obviously even stranger

289
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,800
than it sounds.

290
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,100
In any case, we've only got through about 15 minutes.

291
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,320
We've got longer to go.

292
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,200
But I think it's time we had a bit more Bobbly stuff, because we've had quite a bit of...

293
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,840
Oh, maybe I should explain about the strange, wonky...

294
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,960
version of Jingle Bells that's been playing ever so often, and is still playing now.

295
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,520
This is off, or out of, a modification for the computer game Quake, the old chestnut,

296
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,500
which is still going strong, called Twisted Christmas, which was reasonably fun.

297
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,140
It takes place in a shopping mall overrun by evil Santa and his evil minions and his

298
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,760
evil rocket-toting reindeer.

299
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,680
And you've got to go in with your shotguns and your nail guns and eventually your rocket

300
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,020
launcher, if you find the damn thing, and blow up the evil...

301
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,740
Santa and rescue the good Santa.

302
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,400
All rather silly, obviously, but part of the fun was that in the background there is this

303
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,940
wonky and not-quite-working-like music.

304
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,160
And if you've got the computer game Quake, this is the original Quake.

305
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,080
It's not got a number in front of it.

306
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,860
It's not Quake 4, Quake 3, or Quake 2.

307
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,760
It's just Quake.

308
00:21:51,740 --> 00:22:00,480
You can get it through me at www.planetquake.com slash fatty.

309
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,640
And then you go to files.

310
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,260
And you look down for Twisted Christmas.

311
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,200
And there it is.

312
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,900
Quake 3

313
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,720
Quake 4

314
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,580
Quake 4

315
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,800
Quake 4

316
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,040
Quake 4

317
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,100
Quake 4

318
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,260
Quake 4

319
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,380
Quake 4

320
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,600
Quake 4

321
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:32,620
Quake 4

322
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,160
Christ was not our Savior, nor born on Christmas Day,

323
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,620
to save us all from atoms bombs when we have gone astray.

324
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,200
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

325
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,700
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

326
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,240
God love ye weary citizens, for it is such a shame

327
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,620
to think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name.

328
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,040
Remember when you go to church, believers are to blame.

329
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,600
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

330
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

331
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,580
God help ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in

332
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,940
by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

333
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,400
Though you may knock at heaven's door, they will not let you in.

334
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,600
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

335
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,980
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

336
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,580
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

337
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,880
God save ye weary citizens, for this will make ye sick.

338
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,380
That Christ was just another Jew they nailed upon a stick.

339
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,800
He couldn't save himself, you know religion is a trick.

340
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,380
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

341
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,820
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

342
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,600
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

343
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,760
Stray! Stray! Stray!

344
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,180
Stray! Stray! Stray!

345
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,620
Ho! Ho! Ho!

346
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:36,680
Ho! Ho! Ho!

347
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,400
Come with the ho-ho-ho's fat boy, we've had enough to share with you.

348
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,140
We want minimum wage, we want postage, we want pensions.

349
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,940
Ho! Ho! Ho!

350
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,740
Ah, you really suck!

351
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,780
Yeah!

352
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,560
Ugh!

353
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
Ho! Ho! Ho!

354
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,040
Back to work.

355
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,300
Ho! Ho! Ho!

356
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,960
Hey, who cares?

357
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,140
Yes, all right.

358
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,140
You can't stop the rush.

359
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,080
Hey, who cares?

360
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,020
Hey, who cares?

361
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,080
Yes, all right.

362
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,040
You can't stop the rush.

363
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I am Santa Claus.

364
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,760
Flying through the snow, can you hear him ho, ho, ho?

365
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,300
He's so full of cheer, only has to work one day a year.

366
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,380
Children in their beds, visions of sugar plums fill their heads.

367
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,260
So many kids out there, Santa must be a billionaire.

368
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,360
Red suit, boots are black.

369
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,720
Big set of toys hanging off his back.

370
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,860
How much does he weigh?

371
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,180
How do the reindeer pull his sleigh?

372
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,440
Nobody sees him as he travels the world.

373
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,820
Leaving his presents for the good boys.

374
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,340
Hey, who cares?

375
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,340


376
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:27,220
Hey, who cares?

377
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,440
Give a hear of the boy's

378
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,080
You can't stop the rush.

379
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,220
Get lost, I can't see what you feel,

380
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,540
I got a growing kiss on my hand.

381
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,480
Get lost, I can't feel who I am.

382
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:36,760


383
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,240
Leave him a little kiss on my hand.

384
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:40,320
Get lost, I got a growing kiss on my hand.

385
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,320


386
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,100
You'll be back to your house first next year

387
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,660
I am Santa Claus

388
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

389
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,980
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

390
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,220
A tiny lady

391
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,680
Little driver

392
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,640
So lively and quick

393
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,800
I knew in a moment

394
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,120
It must be Saint Nick

395
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,740
Jelly

396
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,780
Oh, hold it, hold it, hold it!

397
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,600
Wait a second!

398
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,140
Perhaps we should talk about what exactly are the

399
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,180
differences and similarities

400
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,380
Yes, let's do a comparison

401
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,440
between Xmas

402
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,080
and Xmas

403
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,080


404
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,200
Day. I think that's very important

405
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
for us to understand the differences

406
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,020
After all, they are fairly similar

407
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,820
For one thing

408
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,120
they both involve male

409
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,260
authority figures that are loosely based

410
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,380
on the real ones that existed

411
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,080
before, well

412
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
before Christmas was invented, basically

413
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,220
Xmas has

414
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,160
Santa Claus, based on

415
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,860
Saint Nicholas

416
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,340
Xday has Bob

417
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, actually, they have a Bob-load

418
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,920
of Bobs, all based

419
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,040
on the original J.R. Bob Dobbs

420
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,060
the salesman of Slack

421
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,600
the channel for

422
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
Neegi's pre-scriptures

423
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,040
to come to Earth

424
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,740
you get the idea

425
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,940
Xmas comes but once a year

426
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,460
Xday

427
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,700
The world ends tomorrow

428
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,960
and you may die

429
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,360
Xmas

430
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,400
preceded by three to four months

431
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,360
of irritating high-pressure advertising

432
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,100
rather like being hit

433
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,620
with a fire hose full of crap

434
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,460
Xday

435
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,500
well, this is just one part

436
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,580
of our year-round irritating

437
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,280
low-pressure

438
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,580
sort of Chinese water torture style

439
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,100
advertising

440
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,860
Xmas

441
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,460
Santa awards all the good little boys

442
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,060
and girls

443
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,520
Xday

444
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,940
Bob rewards all those who send in their

445
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,760
$30

446
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,680
Xmas

447
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,420
It's a Z-grade soulless, overproduced, commercialized

448
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,020
parody of a religious festival

449
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,740
Xday

450
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,800
is a Z-grade Edward-produced low-budget parody of a religion

451
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,820
period

452
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,000
Xmas

453
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,480
coincides with the winter solstice

454
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,360
or summer if you're here in the Antipodes

455
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,800
Xday

456
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,020
coincides with the anniversary of the United States founding

457
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,940
Xmas

458
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,300
Santa punishes all the bad boys and girls by putting coal in their stockings

459
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,260
or if you're a certain North European

460
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,360
slavery in Spain

461
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,900
Xmas

462
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:58,680
is a Z-grade

463
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,880
Xmas

464
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Santa wonders if you've been bad or good

465
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,320
Xday

466
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,980
Bob doesn't care unless you've been real innovative about it

467
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,280
and Bob wants to buy the copyright software so he can market it

468
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,900
Xmas

469
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,900


470
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,900


471
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,040
North Pole Workshop

472
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,020
Xday

473
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,640
Dobbs Town, Malaysia

474
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,180
Xmas

475
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,100
A miniature sleigh with a tiny reindeer

476
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,020
Xday

477
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,460
The much larger X's space fleet

478
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,640
Xmas

479
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Mrs. Claus

480
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
Xday

481
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,460
Connie

482
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,580
Xmas

483
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,880
Leaves you in the same horrible world as you are now

484
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,880


485
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,880


486
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,880


487
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,880


488
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,880


489
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,820
Just with new stuff

490
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,220
Xday

491
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,920
Planet X

492
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,260
Xmas

493
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,660
Santa is the closest thing to God walking the Earth

494
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,500
I believe Lonesome Cowboy Dave actually mentioned that

495
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,520
Xday

496
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,100
Well as the song goes

497
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,660
He ain't no man

498
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,400
He ain't no God

499
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,300
Xmas

500
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,540
And finally with Xmas

501
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,120
You grow out of belief in Santa

502
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,120
Xday

503
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,860
As JRB knew it was early in his life, he grew out of belief in Santa

504
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,040
Bob Dobbs said himself,

505
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,540
Believe me out of it.

506
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Well, that didn't take so long, did it?

507
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,160
There's probably more comparisons and so forth that I could have done.

508
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,460
But what the hell?

509
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,500
I basically covered everything right there and then.

510
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,440
I think it's about time to combat all this

511
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,200
focusing on the conspiracy-styled,

512
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,360
pink, over-advertised, over-hyped and over-bearing

513
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,360
religious festival that is currently barreling down on me

514
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,380
with the appearance of a three-ton concrete enema bag.

515
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,600
Oh, that's enough of that.

516
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,480
My backup band for this evening is

517
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,760
Trash, playing White Christmas off their 1992 album Kimikaze.

518
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,620
Thank you.

519
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,420
Gentlemen, you have all worked very hard.

520
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,540
And among the lucky, you are the chosen ones.

521
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,860
You have been sprinkled with lucky stardust.

522
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,420
Yes, you have.

523
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,420
For today, you have been chosen to reside in the court of the Great One.

524
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,920
Gentlemen, I give you

525
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,800
the boy

526
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,340
who has been chosen to be the king of the world.

527
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,340


528
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,320
You actually saw a woman's breasts!

529
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,600
Scott, you made your choice.

530
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,000
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

531
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,620
And to your eternal soul,

532
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,060
you have found that only could you afford

533
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,940
to give to God that which was his.

534
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,980
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

535
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,100
The Senate's...

536
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,160
still stands.

537
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,460
The promise is no man.

538
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,760
Into outer darkness,

539
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,600
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

540
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,900
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir!

541
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,120
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

542
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,460
Sir, no!

543
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,400
Thank God I don't want to go to hell!

544
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,900
No!

545
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,060
No!

546
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:37,760


547
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,800
No!

548
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,000


549
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,160


550
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,040
No!

551
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,140


552
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,140


553
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,140


554
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,140


555
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,180


556
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,180


557
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,180


558
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,220


559
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,220


560
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,300
No!

561
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


562
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


563
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


564
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


565
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


566
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


567
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


568
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


569
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


570
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


571
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


572
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


573
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


574
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


575
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


576
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


577
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


578
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,300


579
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,020
Noon!

580
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,760
No!

581
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,120
No!

582
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,120


583
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,120


584
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,760
We only've one right before us,

585
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,420
tonight is Mission ahead.

586
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,860
Never shift!

587
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,140
Get rid of that我觉得

588
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,240
of this loosen grip of valleys!

589
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,740
abytes change too fast.

590
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,740
We downtrodden that's when cleaned out

591
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,200
is an absolute virtue.

592
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,980
The point is that we...

593
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:06,980


594
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,100
It's an unfathomable project for which we need...

595
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:10,660
aüm!

596
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,820
aüm...

597
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,680
so Mark lined up and put it on a pole 15 feet in the air.

598
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,980
Miss Fang didn't much care for that either,

599
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,520
but was relieved that she didn't have to see Bob home with a huge festering bee heart

600
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,200
every time she went in the backyard.

601
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,460
Yes, you can keep bees in the family if you'll just think of others a little more often.

602
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,140
Otherwise, you're just two yards of beef.

603
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,860
But let's leave things of this world behind

604
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:41,940
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

605
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,680
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang

606
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,320
with another reading from the sacred pre-scriptures of the Church of the Subgenius.

607
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:57,160
And yea, he climbeth down chimneys and delivereth us the gifts of the flesh and of slack.

608
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,740
He commandeth horned demons with cloven hoofs to take to the air and pull him in his chariot in glory.

609
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:09,140
For he knoweth when thou hast been sleeping, and he knoweth when thou art awake.

610
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:16,700
He judgeth if thou art damned or worthy, so heedeth this for thine own sake.

611
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,480
For his eyes are everywhere, like unto Big Brother.

612
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,980
He puffeth on his pipe and laugheth at our follies like a bowl full of Vaseline.

613
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,720
But yea, in his mercy he giveth us days off, and he bringeth us goods yet billows.

614
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,300
But yea, in his mercy he giveth us days off, and he bringeth us goods yet billows.

615
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,140
So imagine, friends, somewhere in the snowy north,

616
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,180
the Santa Bob trudges mindlessly on,

617
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,260
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errands.

618
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,600
And he may show up at your house.

619
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,660
If you've been a good subgenius,

620
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,140
let there be slack.

621
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,960
See the video at subgenius.com

622
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,700
What the hell was all that?

623
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,060
Okay, I better get some credits going then, because we've had about seven items in that last chunk.

624
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,200
What were we listening to?

625
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,860
Well, we started off that particular chunk of show with

626
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,660
Purpose Cecilia and Trickster Shaman.

627
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,400
Track eight of The Hairs and Bob's Ears.

628
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,980
An album that is available, I think.

629
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,680
And recently, as mp3s on oldbinaries.slack.

630
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,140
Singing Tidings of Trembling and Fear.

631
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,400
Trembling and Fear.

632
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,940
Oh, Tidings of Trembling and Fear.

633
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,920
And speaking of Trembling and Fear,

634
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,980
no doubt the elves in that Elf Slave Revolt thing,

635
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,620
posted by New Monet however many moons ago,

636
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,640
were feeling Trembling and Fear.

637
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,140
And they said Tidings.

638
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,920
But they didn't have Tidings, they had blimmin'

639
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,160
Machine Gunnings of Trembling and Fear.

640
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,060
And thereafter, if there was any Trembling to be done,

641
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,720
it was probably Trembling of the Earth at the Footsteps of the Iron Santa,

642
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,380
as sung by the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet.

643
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,920
It is in this mp3 here.

644
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,740
Very strange piece of track.

645
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,640
It makes me think of that terrible Hulk Hogan vehicle.

646
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,700
Vehicle.

647
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,180
I believe it could be called Santa with muscles.

648
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,360
Frankly, the only muscles I want to think about Terry Hogan eating would be

649
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,360
the ones you get in a little punnett at the supermarket.

650
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,480
Thereafter, me!

651
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,480
Yes, me!

652
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,960
Me!

653
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,680
Over trash's white Christmas off their Kemikaze album of 1992.

654
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,920
Going on and on and on.

655
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,400
Ad Nauseam.

656
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,520
Ad Nauseating.

657
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,900
Ad Pontificating.

658
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,960
About the differences and similarities of Xmas and X-Day.

659
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,320
Although I think you know where my sediments lie.

660
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,060
Thereafter, we had a piece out of the B-movie American Astronaut,

661
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,160
which was produced and released recently.

662
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,480
It's on the internet somewhere.

663
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,080
You can Google it, I suppose.

664
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,240
Introducing, in what I thought was a pretty clever segue,

665
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,500
The Judgment Frosty.

666
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
I have no idea who produced that.

667
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,880
There's no information in the MP3.

668
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,580
It's just The Judgment Frosty.

669
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,760
But whoever it is, and hears it, will know who it is.

670
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,520
And other people who know who it is, will know who it is.

671
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,800
And no doubt, once they find out that I've released this, will let me know who it is.

672
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,440
And then I can tell other people who it is.

673
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,040
Or they can tell other people who it is.

674
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,280
Or the person in beta can tell everybody else who they are.

675
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,220
And that does not include Help Hope Huey at B.

676
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,340
Beat Factory, that's beat-factory.net, if I remember correctly,

677
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,240
who explained to us the story of The Yard of Beef.

678
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,440
Truly, one of those presents you should only get your enemy for Christmas.

679
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,060
And then finally, the Reverend Ivan Stang explaining in a minute of slack about the Santa Bob.

680
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,200
Well, I've just got one question before I launch into the next item.

681
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:34,860
It's a repetition of a question that, um, was couched by Professor Chaz Smith of Einstein's Secret Lecture ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB, I think.

682
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,100
Was there ever a Christmas before malls?

683
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,740
That was satisfying, wasn't it?

684
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,500
I was so glad when that pleasure saucer landed, but the pilot was drunk or something.

685
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,580
And I made out pretty good balancing on one knee and all.

686
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,700
But it was kind of awkward to hump while I had to play the cut off my foot with a pleasure saucer blues.

687
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,780
But it was real nice of Bob to grow me a new foot.

688
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,160
But it's a dinosaur thing and has claws.

689
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,560
So now I can't wear a shoe on that foot and people sure stare a lot.

690
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,920
And I tend to walk in circles like this.

691
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,200
Kadunk, kadunk, kadunk.

692
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,160
Crazy damn old Bob. I sure love him, but, well, he's nuts.

693
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:36,100
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house.

694
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,220
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

695
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,440
The stockings were hung by the tree.

696
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,780
Merry fucking Christmas.

697
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,440
Merry fucking Christmas.

698
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,240
Merry fucking Christmas.

699
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,960
Merry fucking Christmas.

700
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,600
SHOW YOU!

701
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,640

Now I have a doubt.

764
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,420

performances with the længua

766
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,000
and better value for money and Scientology.

767
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,700

768
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,140

and slay

777
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,040
Dashing through the snow

778
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,400
On a one-horse open sleigh

779
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,420
All the fields we go

780
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,100
Laughing all the way

781
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,220
Rounds on bobtails

782
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,400
Making spirits bright

Oh, what fun it is

784
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,880

A shame, hopes of joy

796
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,780
But a drunken home would try

797
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,960
Our automotive toy

798
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,460
Won't leave us alive

799
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,440
Distant sirens will

800
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,360
Harmonize our plight

801
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,040
Oh, what fun it would have been

802
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,900
