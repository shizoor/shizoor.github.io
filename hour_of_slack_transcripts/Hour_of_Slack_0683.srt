1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
How he said that King Solomon in all his glory was not as beautiful as the lilies of the field.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,040
And I know you won't forget, judge not lest she be judged, because I explained that to you.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,280
And then the good Lord went on to say,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,100
Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing,

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,580
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,440
Ye shall know them by their fruits.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,640
Amen.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,580
Sure, they tortured us.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,260
Sure, they bugged us about selling out to the conspiracy.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,980
And look at them now.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,360
Yeah, let's give them a big hand, friends.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,300
Yes, that's what happens when you sell out with the...

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,320
The Genius.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,000
Our own.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,760
Oh, fuck.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,620
How much have you heard? Just what I told you over the phone?

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,700
Just what you told me over the phone.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,200
Um, Ken, and tipped him off.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,100
There's something weird about these guys. You have to check them out.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,160
You have to find out what's about it.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,700
The next day is the NPR call.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,240
And he sends out, he has people check all the websites.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,660
They go through and they pull out all the hate quotes.

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,120
They make them into a report.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,220
They send it to the chief of the police and the manager of public works.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,860
The city manager.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
The city manager.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,300
This is great. We have been, we have been restrained.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,620
We have received prior restraint for the content of our speech.

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,060
And we weren't even going to make that statement.

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,140
Now, nobody believes it. Nobody believes it.

32
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,920
I tried to explain it to my sister last night.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,580
Nobody believes it. There's actually laws against that.

34
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,280
Right.

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,080
There's actually laws against, like, prior restraint based on content of speech.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
If they said we were noisier than other bands, which we're noisy,

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,820
but I don't think we're noisier than the headbangers they have there every week.

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,380
But, uh...

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,320
The king of Iraq is here.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,240
Well, as the, uh, the fellow that came to our high school

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
and spoke to our military school from Russia said,

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,260
we too have freedom of speech in Russia.

43
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,280
It's just freedom after speech we don't have.

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
Welcome to...

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
Welcome to...

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,920
Welcome to...

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,520
Welcome to...

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,560
Welcome to...

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,080
Welcome to...

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,740
Welcome to the live.

51
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,500
It's beautiful!

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,100
First, I'd like to thank you all for coming here. My name is Friday Jones. I am the person who set up this event.

53
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,540
And I'm Ronnie Friday!

54
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,020
And I'm sorry that I brought you all out here on a cold night for nothing.

55
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:52,980
As you probably have heard, on Tuesday, somebody made a little call in to National Public Radio

56
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,020
and made a little joke about the Church of the Subgenius being connected with the Trenchcoat Mafia,

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,980
even though we're a bit too old for that. At least most of us are.

58
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,780
And the owner of the Middle East heard it, was told about it. He started getting calls from across the country.

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,500
He felt that there was really bad vibes about it.

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Basically, it came down to, we must censor you in the name of free speech.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,420
Is what it came down to, and that we could not have a performance there.

62
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,960
The ACLU is the only one that can do that.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,600
The ACLU kindly provided us with this location.

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,240
It's a gorgeous location, really.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,840
At the last minute. We set it up, we did everything.

66
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,160
It seems though, that a certain political figure,

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,880
on the day before the call to National Public Radio,

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,420
got a tip that the Church of the Subgenius is an evil hate cult,

69
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,900
and that he should investigate us.

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,820
He, you know, is like, well, reads the website,

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,960
well, I don't know, the next thing you know,

72
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,040
the next day is the call to National Public Radio.

73
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,520
He says, there must be something to this.

74
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,860
He writes, he goes through all of sub-site,

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,220
and he picks out all the hate quotes.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,200
He cuts out all the comedy stuff, but he picks out every bit of hate.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
The hate stuff isn't comedy.

78
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,140
What would happen if he went through the Bible, and only showed the hate stuff?

79
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,580
How old would he have been at the time?

80
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,400
That's interesting.

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,660
But where do people come from back then?

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:42,260
This is Amartya Palani today.

83
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,200
She's my cousin, my family.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,380
And she's my granddaughter.

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,960
KELI RAHMAN'S carnevi can't be heard anymore.

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,700
having a meeting at the Middle East in Kangaroo.

87
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,060
So I said, oh my goodness.

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,640
I said, well, better tell Joseph and Nabil,

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,380
you know, they should check into it.

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,380
So I called him up.

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,480
I didn't get Joseph or Nabil,

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,620
I got their answering machine.

93
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,960
And I said, got a call that somebody's brother in Florida

94
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,380
saw this stuff on the internet

95
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,440
about some group you were having on Friday.

96
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,700
Okay, I did not tell them to cancel anything.

97
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,620
I told them to look into it.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,300
I said, look into it.

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,060
Okay, so the next thing I heard about it,

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,180
this, if I recall this correctly,

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,500
I got the information.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,380
There are people listening to this right now

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
who are working on new divivals

104
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,380
on the West Coast.

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,480
And there'll be times when you'll think,

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,780
oh gosh, I'm going to have to make three trips

107
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,160
to the airport to pick everybody up.

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,580
Or you'll say, gosh, the roof in the club is leaking.

109
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,780
Darn it.

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,680
Well, it couldn't be worse than what happened to me.

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Now could it?

112
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
What are the odds that the club will throw you out

113
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,020
and censor you?

114
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,220
And if you found another place,

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,640
what are the odds that the people there

116
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,740
would start getting weird harassing phone calls

117
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,520
and throw you out as well?

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,360
And what are the odds that the cops will show up

119
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,120
and be perfectly nice

120
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,080
and illuminate your divival with their spotlights?

121
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,620
And what will be the odds of a paddy wagon showing up,

122
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,300
idling outside on the curb,

123
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,620
and then driving away?

124
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,000
And what are the odds that the cops will show up

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000


126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,160
and then start to attack you?

127
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,220
What are the odds of it being worse for you

128
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,580
than it was for me?

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,520
Friday Jones, official church martyr

130
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,060
of the Subgenius Foundation.

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,300
And I hope that that diversity includes diversity of ideas.

132
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,620
Now, I only have three minutes,

133
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,860
so I have to go through this quickly.

134
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,540
A local promoter in the area invited the Subgenius Foundation

135
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,660
to hold an event at a public Cambridge venue this past Friday.

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Now, for those of you who don't know,

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,840
the Subgenius Foundation is sometimes called

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,180
the Church of the Subgenius.

139
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,960
Mr. Dreyfus, what item on the agenda are you speaking to?

140
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm speaking to the mission statement of the city council.

141
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,180
This is...

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,580
It's not an item on the agenda, Mr. Dreyfus,

143
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,440
I regret to say.

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,440
Um...

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,040
What?

146
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Uh...

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,380
It's not an item on the agenda, boys and girls and ghouls.

148
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,180
Ah, ha, ha.

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, of course, we had a wonderful Boston revival.

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,460
As you can tell from this, um...

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Uh...

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,960
The Boston Globe article,

153
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,440
the Church of the Subgenius won't be meeting tonight.

154
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,840
It's not because the music and performance collaborative

155
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,360
doesn't have religion about making a Boston appearance.

156
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,020
Rather, it's feeling the impact of a stupid joke.

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,220
One of the members of the National Subgenius Foundation

158
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,500
made a crack during an appearance on NPR

159
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,720
about being aligned with the Trenchcoat Mafia,

160
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,420
the group associated with the Colorado school shootings.

161
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,980
The church felt immediate fallout.

162
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,440
The reference included a pitch for tonight's scheduled show

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,040
at the Middle East in Cambridge.

164
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,760
And about a dozen people called the club to protest,

165
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,160
obviously not getting the joke.

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,120
One of the owners of the Middle East canceled the show,

167
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,540
but couldn't be reached for comment.

168
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,600
That leaves local subgenius promoter and artist Friday Jones

169
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,380
without a venue and a lot of expenses.

170
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,760
The event could be called weird, but not dangerous.

171
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,480
The show is a combination of humorous preaching,

172
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,440
rant-off, and music.

173
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,380
If those two boys had been part of the subgenius,

174
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,920
they wouldn't have done what they did.

175
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Dear friends, and what they did.

176
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,100
Oh, what they did.

177
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,220
Friends, them, well, all we can say is them asses,

178
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,280
as Dr. Legume said, them asses have spoken.

179
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,380
The masses have spoken,

180
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,860
and the masses have spoken.

181
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,660
And we have seen Falwellian and PC fascism and stupidity

182
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,180
combine in a failed attempt to silence Bob.

183
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,540
And their excuse was that they were protecting free speech.

184
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,580
What catch did you say that was, friends?

185
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,040
Oh, friends, we saw people in city councils deliberately making us,

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,100
making the fellow city council folks think we're some kind of Nazi kooks

187
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,000
without giving us an opportunity to correct these things.

188
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,800
Oh, friends, but it's a wonderful,

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,560
and yet somehow, somehow, friends, we won.

190
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,940
As Dr. Legume said, we snatched a brown nugget,

191
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:38,180
a dingleberry of victory from the diseased, desiccated hole of defeat.

192
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,900
The very butt of defeat, friends, and, ah, ah, yes.

193
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,080
Thank you, Einstein Secret Orchestra.

194
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,900
Now back to the documentary in progress.

195
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,380
The subgenius is best described as an artistic movement

196
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,420
with its own particular philosophy and style of expression.

197
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,160
Someone in the city or someone outside of the city

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,700
didn't like the content or that style of expression,

199
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,400
and two days before the event, our venue was canceled,

200
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,880
citing phone calls, local pressure, and political pressure.

201
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,440
As best we can tell,

202
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,460
smears, rumors, and even callers from out of state were disappointed in this,

203
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,740
and it may have only been two or three people behind all of this.

204
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,560
We have no idea.

205
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
Hey! Hey!

206
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,340
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.

207
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,420
Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

208
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,280
Wherefore, by their fruits, ye shall know them.

209
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,380
Well, now, what's it to be, Lord?

210
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,960
Another widow?

211
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,900
How many's it been? Six?

212
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,940
Twelve?

213
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I just remembered.

214
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,820
You say the word, Lord.

215
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm on my way.

216
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,460
You always send me money to go forth and preach your word.

217
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,880
A widow with a little wad of bills hid away in a sugar bowl.

218
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,960
Lord, I am tired.

219
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,420
Sometimes I wonder if you really understand me.

220
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,420


221
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,900
Not that you mind the killings.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,580
Your book is full of killings.

223
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,300
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

224
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,440
Perfume-smelling things, lacy things, things with curly hair.

225
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,140


226
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,140


227
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,260
Oh, it's right in front of me.

228
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,080
Oh, it's right in front of me.

229
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,000
I know that you're trying to get me out of this.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,380
You're trying to get me out of this.

231
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,460
Oh, that's right.

232
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,640
You're trying to get me out of this.

233
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:16,640


234
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:16,640


235
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:16,700


236
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:16,700


237
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:16,700


238
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,020
We're videotaping the debacle for the record.

239
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,960
Well, this is him.

240
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,820
Yes, right there.

241
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,220
We got to get these freedom of speech advocates reined in.

242
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,600
They want to do things like, well, for the children.

243
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,900
For the children.

244
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,600
We must...

245
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,860
I mean, what good is freedom of speech...

246
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,380
You know, for the children.

247
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,960
...if children are going to die?

248
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,380
If we would just eliminate the free speech, less children would die.

249
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,100
And if we didn't have to listen to the children either,

250
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,000
I'd let them have a chance to say a word.

251
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,340
We're thinking of putting together a protest here,

252
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,800
maybe getting the whole group to chant,

253
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,020
Stop Freedom of Speech.

254
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,280
Stop the chants.

255
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,060
Stop Freedom of Speech.

256
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,060
Stop this chant.

257
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,600
Stop this protest.

258
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,440
Stop the chants.

259
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,440


260
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,540
We had the paddy wagon.

261
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,100
You can't say paddy wagon in Cambridge.

262
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,120
No, you can't say paddy wagon.

263
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,840
It's a multiple offender transport vehicle.

264
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,060
Okay, that's Irish bashing, not paddy wagon.

265
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,480
Non-Irish American felon transportation device.

266
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:31,880
That's right.

267
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,240
It's suspected felon transportation, multiple felon.

268
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,220
Multiple suspected felon transportation.

269
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,840
Okay.

270
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,060
Now, I came down here because I heard there was going to be a protest

271
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:49,460
about this internet hate group, the Sub-G, Sub-Dinia, something like that.

272
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,640
And I'd always really wanted to meet a hate group in person

273
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,140
because I've heard so much about them.

274
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,600
Well, the only hate group is the city.

275
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,940
Not the Sub-Gs or anything, but just hate groups in general.

276
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,120
And I'm here, and I hear they're around, but I mean, everybody seems to be totally lost.

277
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,280
Well, the city council only lives a few blocks from here.

278
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:05,700
Oh.

279
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,220
Maybe they're the hate group.

280
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,580
What's happening?

281
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,640
I don't know.

282
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:09,640


283
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,520
It's a genius.

284
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,320
It all started way back when, when some busy little person down in Florida,

285
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,060
no, not that person down in Florida, somebody else,

286
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,540
didn't like some things they saw on a Sub-Genius website.

287
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,320
So they called up the friend of a friend who happened to be the ex-mayor of Cambridge

288
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,580
and said he should check it out.

289
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,380
And the very next day, somebody else in Florida,

290
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,400
called into National Public Radio and made a few little analogies

291
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:52,820
between the Trenchcoat Mafia and the Holocaustal movement of the Church of the Sub-Genius.

292
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,920
Thanks a lot for your call.

293
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,580
Thank you, Ray.

294
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,400
Erin joining us from Seattle.

295
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,120
Joe's next in Tallahassee.

296
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,600
Hi, Joe.

297
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,900
Hey, Ray.

298
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Clearly the parents were involved in this, in that they aided and abated their children

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,640
into getting the information that got them on this website.

300
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:08,740
It's called the Trenchcoat Mafia.

301
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,240
It's a wayward path.

302
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,880
They bought them the computer.

303
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,080
The kids didn't buy the computer.

304
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,400
The kids went through the Internet unsupervised.

305
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,860
They got hooked up with this, what's called a Holocaustal SAC.

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,360
It was on their links page before that was taken down.

307
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,940
But the Holocaustal page is still up there on the Internet.

308
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,580
And it all talks about exterminating the normals and killing the pinks.

309
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,920
And it's a big thing about pipes and pipe bombs and trisexuals and this sort of stuff.

310
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,980
Any parent would see it and know that it's bad news.

311
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,640
And yet, you know, with bartenders,

312
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,380
if they see someone that's drinking a lot, they can go ahead and be liable for that.

313
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,540
It seems to me that parents clearly should have a responsibility

314
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,800
when they get hooked up with these far-flung cults.

315
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
Like, I mean, even the name, the Holocaustals.

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,820
I mean, doesn't that tell you something?

317
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,420
And this is all part of that Church of the Subgenius thing,

318
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,900
which is a big deal about, you know, superior mutants and supporting deviant behavior.

319
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,140
And now we see the ultimate tuition of that, don't we?

320
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,940
When people behave this way.

321
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,880
That the extreme behavior that can come out of it.

322
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,000
And people are responsible.

323
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,120
It seems to me that the parents have a clear responsibility in this regard.

324
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,860
But I guess, Joe, the question is, where does it go?

325
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,800
Where do we cross boundaries from simply feeling that they're responsible,

326
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,860
deciding that morally they're responsible, to where they can land up in court?

327
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,460
Well, society-wise, I think we need to kind of ask ourselves,

328
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,360
is entertainment and freedom of speech worth, you know,

329
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
basically getting people killed?

330
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,420
This whole Holocaustal thing, they're still going full force.

331
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,160
They still have their web pages up.

332
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
They're having a divival this weekend in Boston.

333
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,600
Right this weekend, the bodies aren't even cold in the graves.

334
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,460
And they're having some big, what they call a divival.

335
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,680
Friday, I think it is, at some restaurant, the Middle East or whatnot.

336
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,060
And they celebrate this type of stuff.

337
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,780
To them, it's funny.

338
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,340
And people just stand by and, oh, well, we can't do anything about that.

339
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,340
Well, if we can shut down, you know, the whole thing, we can do it.

340
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,780
We can stop, you know, KKK people from wearing hoods.

341
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,360
Why can't we stop people who are advocating the same type of behavior,

342
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,100
which is lynching and killing people, from plying their craft?

343
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
Who wants to talk to Joe?

344
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,940
Well, I'll respond in one way.

345
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,760
Joe, you obviously know a lot about this cult

346
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,180
and some of these things you've been talking about than I do.

347
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,540
I haven't heard of these things.

348
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,040
And it sounds horrifying by your description.

349
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,060
I'm not sure I know enough to sort of concur in all of your characterizations.

350
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,300
But I do want to say I agree with you about this.

351
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
I don't believe the First Amendment, the right to freedom of speech,

352
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,040
which is a very important foundation of liberty in this country.

353
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,740
But I don't believe it means that people bear no responsibility for the things that they say.

354
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,620
The things that they post on a website, the films and videos that they produce.

355
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,420
And the things that those productions might prompt someone else to do.

356
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,680
I don't think it's right morally.

357
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
I don't think it's right morally to say they have no responsibility.

358
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,800
And I don't even think it's right legally to say they have no responsibility.

359
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,320
There's a very interesting case that's working its way toward the United States Supreme Court

360
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,180
about the liability of a Boulder-based publication that published a hitman manual

361
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,880
that was used by an assassin to kill a woman and her son.

362
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
And I think that's going to put before the court this very important question.

363
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,700
The First Amendment means not only that you have a right to speak,

364
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,660
but a right to be altogether free.

365
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,660
And whether free from the consequences of speaking, I don't think you do.

366
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,360
And I don't think the court will say that you do.

367
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,860
And Joe brought up a lot of different things.

368
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,700
Some of which I've heard of and some of which I haven't heard of.

369
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,300
But the Church of the Subgenius, there's not a lot of harm in them.

370
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,860
It's more a joke than anything it calls itself.

371
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,320
The world's only admittedly for-profit, non-tax-deductible religion.

372
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
And it's more a spoof than anything else.

373
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,220
Joe, thanks a lot for your call.

374
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,860
You call 19 dead high school students a joke?

375
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,200
That's funny to you?

376
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,420
Why, you, we ought to...

377
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,040
The fools, the blind fools.

378
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,880
It's all just propaganda.

379
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,960
Popaganda.

380
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Popaganda.

381
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,940
Well, I mean, he comes right on.

382
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,360
Attacks our religion.

383
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,520
We should sue him.

384
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,200
We will sue everyone.

385
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,740
We will bury you.

386
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,980
Our agent provocateur routine certainly got them bashing the Church of the Subgenius.

387
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,020
They came right out and called it false.

388
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,340
Parody.

389
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,280
Of spoof.

390
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,720
Of spoof.

391
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,420
Harmless.

392
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,900
Why, the lawyer in New York, in Jesus' custody trial.

393
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,540
Harmless, oh.

394
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,740
He called it a silly joke.

395
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,680
We'll show them how harmless we are.

396
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
He called it buffoonery.

397
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,980
Perhaps when we show up with our special pipe bomb.

398
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,080
The fool.

399
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,200
It'll show them just how funny we are when we smoke our frap right up their ass.

400
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,700
And it may have only been two or three people behind all of this.

401
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,500
We have no idea.

402
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,760
Unfortunately, and I'm here because even a city councilor was unfortunately involved

403
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,120
and used and possibly misled.

404
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,740
Now, the rubric of public safety was used, and I don't need to remind all of you how

405
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,260
often that's been used to shut down ideas that people don't want to hear at public gatherings,

406
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,000
lunch counters, and all sorts of things, and that we have to be careful in invoking

407
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,200
public safety when dealing with matters of prior restraint or speech.

408
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,080
Cambridge needs to continue as a vigorous home of free speech, and I want to ask the

409
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,840
city council to look into this matter and to go on record in favor of freedom of speech.

410
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,560
If two or three people or a couple of anonymous phone calls can shut down this event, two

411
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,920
or three phone calls can shut down any event in the city.

412
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,240
Thank you for the chance to defend us.

413
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,860
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

414
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,100
Thank you.

415
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,100


416
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,100
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

417
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,560
Thank you.

418
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,860
I'll be in on the first.

419
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:18,860


420
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:18,860


421
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:18,860


422
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,160
Now is the announcement, a printout of a website in which they said such terrible things

423
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,980
as, we're going to build nitrous oxide gas chambers, where people laugh themselves to

424
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,180
death.

425
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,800
and that in honor of the tragedy of Littleton,

426
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,900
we will offer extra salvation to anyone who comes wearing a black trench coat.

427
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,420
These are terrible things to say.

428
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,720
These are the sort of things that give free speech a bad name.

429
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,900
And that's why the Middle East had to kick us out on our tight little bob the hides.

430
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,580
And then I got provided two copies of what was on the internet,

431
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:10,400
something called a holocaustal homepage that had to do with the extermination of normals with extreme prisons.

432
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,920
And then it went on to talk about a jihad that had to be, and must be fulfilled,

433
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,080
and that the penalty for defying this covenant is to put all peoples to death.

434
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,880
It's a holy covenant.

435
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:35,820
It's a holy mission, a sacred jihad to be fulfilled only by completely vanquishing the dark stain of lack of sacrilege

436
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,420
that we cleanse ourselves for allowing the sin to happen in the first place.

437
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,180
In other words, killing the pinks and normals hurts us more than it hurts them,

438
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,220
but we'll kill them anyway out of penance.

439
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,300
And then it says, that being said, we don't cause pain.

440
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:04,080
We're the mass euthanasia mental institute for population control.

441
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,520
Then it talks about nitrous oxide gas chambers and the blood ball.

442
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:17,500
And then it says, another good place to bathe in hate is the Aryan Resistance homepage.

443
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,080
Click here to go there.

444
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,240
They seem more concerned about Jews and Negroes than pinks and normals.

445
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
But hey, in the middle of this, we're the people of the world.

446
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:25,880


447
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:25,880


448
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,740
The only help we receive in reducing the population by X day is always appreciated.

449
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,820
I don't know where they came up with this notion of a hate group.

450
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,180
I just don't understand. We're misunderstood.

451
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,220
We're trying to make a better world.

452
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,260
We link the Aryan hate resistance as a comedy routine.

453
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,620
Just to make sure that they know we're only a joke.

454
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,880
You want to be a joke?

455
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:55,880


456
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,220
But hate will give you hate.

457
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,900
Hate like you've never seen before.

458
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,200
Hate like you've never felt before.

459
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,620
Hate that you dare to even contemplate.

460
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,180
Contemplate hate.

461
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
I like the sound of that.

462
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,160
Yes.

463
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,960
Make a note of that Friday.

464
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,880
We'll use that in the upcoming Devival.

465
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,180
Our special Bob Artelli insignia.

466
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,760
Yes, Bob emanates from his gold chain.

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,720
Even as his emerald eyes stare out amongst the legions of adoring fans,

468
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,640
his hate is burning within my brain.

469
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,460
I can feel it drilling a hole within the inner cerebral cortex.

470
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,200
I can't take it anymore.

471
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I must kill, kill, kill.

472
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,540
Even a mere dime of bullets, five billion units, can cost a lot of money.

473
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,240
Then it says, unfortunately, we're too greedy to cancel our tour.

474
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,880
We still want to jump on a sympathy band with you.

475
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,480
Someone pump us into a

476
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,160
thats full of violent Bares qui

477
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,900
mofo.

478
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,620
before X-Day is like taking a short nap during a foot race.

479
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,260
It's cheating.

480
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,680
I wasn't saying to make the call to appear, was I?

481
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,060
Mr. Reese took this report, put it all together, all the hate of the church,

482
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,880
and he sent it to the chief of police and to the city manager.

483
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,260
The people here have been getting weird, harassing phone calls

484
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,780
saying that there would be a disturbance if we had this event here.

485
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,640
And because of this, because there are only a few people running this nice building,

486
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,600
they decided to cancel on it at the last minute.

487
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,620
Because we offered to get a security detail, but they're just really nervous and upset,

488
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,540
and I don't blame them.

489
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,240
But we persevered.

490
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,680
We stood upon their steps, and we preached, and we sang,

491
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,000
and we apologized, and we passed the hat.

492
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,360
And there was a revival.

493
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,820
There was only revival. Everything else disappeared.

494
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,620
They have also said that

495
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,040
they would like us to reschedule and perhaps be here in the future.

496
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,740
I would love to reschedule it for two weeks.

497
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,740
However, I opened up my wallet to fly in these creatures,

498
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,180
and it's going to take a while to fill that wallet back up enough.

499
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,360
But if at all possible, I will be rescheduling it, obviously before XX Day,

500
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,780
when we will all be leaving Cambridge.

501
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,980
Straight up!

502
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,980
Praise Bob!

503
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,720
Ah!

504
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,260
Ah!

505
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,840
Ah, yes dear friends,

506
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,040
a little bit of reportage on the Boston debacle,

507
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,060
on the steps of the old Baptist, the old Cambridge Baptist Church,

508
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,280
produced by the Reverend Friday Jones,

509
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,540
and one of the unsung heroes of all this is Jesus Christ.

510
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,500
Yes, hatred drove the subgeniuses out of the Middle East.

511
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,300
They were saved by the Baptists after Jesus called the ACLU.

512
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,160
It's true.

513
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,600
The Lord took interest in the plight of his people, the subgeni,

514
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:40,780
and got on the horn and called all over the various venues and cops and promoters and so forth

515
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,520
in the greater Boston and Cambridge area, as did Friday Jones and the...

516
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,260
Oh, friends, it was a...

517
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, it was kind of a mess, but it's...

518
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,860
We got a lot of press out of it, and who knows, friends, it may just...

519
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,080
It may pay off. You never know.

520
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,860
You just never know.

521
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,500
But it certainly stirs up a little bag of worms,

522
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,380
and it makes us all remember why we joined this old church.

523
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,520
You know, it's not just books and an obnoxious radio show

524
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,060
and obnoxious bobbies that pester you on college campuses.

525
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,500
Nay.

526
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,080
But it occasionally becomes a real serious nettle

527
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,940
in the otherwise never-tickled barefoot,

528
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,220
of some uppity, hoity-toity, Mr. Thinks-He's-Mr-Something-Type-Mister,

529
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,040
you know, conspiracy establishment figurehead.

530
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,680
Friends, we were the ones that they called the behavior problems in school,

531
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,880
and I guess they still call us that.

532
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,460
Friends, I...

533
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,000
Okay, okay, all right.

534
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,880
It's beautiful.

535
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,300
Yeah.

536
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,100
Yes.

537
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,200
But, uhrahaha.

538
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,800
Listen, I think they're over the top...

539
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,120
It's amazing.

540
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,480
But the thing is that it's really Polarани about their history,

541
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,480


542
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,480


543
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,740
Hey, eat some chicken with weekend dinner,

544
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,860
isn't that perfect?

545
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,120
The most controversial comedy group in the history of mankind.

546
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,660
Banned in...

547
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,180
Oh, wait.

548
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,040
Banned in Boston.

549
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,940
That doesn't mean anything.

550
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,900
We're not into the tourney of the cheek.

551
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,960
No, certainly not.

552
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,400
What does Globe say?

553
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,180
The Globe says the show was canceled at the Middle East

554
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,580
and never mentions the new location.

555
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,060
Okay.

556
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,680
So if people are pissed...

557
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
So it's nothing about that.

558
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,180
Right.

559
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,380
No one read anything in the Globe that inspired them to call this church.

560
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,240
No, but they might have read it in the Herald.

561
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,580
Right.

562
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,200
They read it in the Herald.

563
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,340
The Herald article's very positive.

564
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,740
No, no, no.

565
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,080
But there are people who are after the church.

566
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,620
Right.

567
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,920
There are too many of them.

568
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,380
Can't kill a world.

569
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,080
We have two points to make.

570
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,060
One is that in medieval Europe and relatively up until the 1800s,

571
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,560
perhaps mid-1800s,

572
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,620
if you could just reach a church door and the law is in hot pursuit,

573
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,760
if you could just touch the knocker on the church door,

574
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,600
you would achieve sanctuary.

575
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They could not touch you.

576
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,980
But here, you look at the church door and it says,

577
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,600
some genius is not allowed.

578
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
What did those knockers do?

579
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,420
What if you had a knocker?

580
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,760
If anyone would like a demonstration,

581
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,540
I'll be glad you can touch their knocker.

582
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,720
I blame.

583
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,820
Bob.

584
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,200
This is all Bob's fault.

585
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,680
It is Bob that made the call.

586
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,680
There is no Joe in Tallahassee.

587
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:18,620
It is Bob who destroyed the Boston revival from under my feet,

588
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,200
not once but twice in a row.

589
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,560
It is Bob who breaks apart my head.

590
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,600
It is Bob who shatters my hand.

591
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,100
It is Bob who scourges my feet.

592
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,060
Thanks, Bob.

593
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm not the anti-Bob.

594
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
I feel the wrath of the anti-Bob.

595
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,800
Praise Bob!

596
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,000
Praise Bob!

597
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,500
Bob is not the answer.

598
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,880
And neither is anything else.

599
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,400
Screw Bob!

600
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,960
And Tony.

601
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,140
Blasphemy!

602
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,940
He's been possessed by the anti-Bob.

603
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,740
Help me, anti-Bob, please!

604
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,480
Help me!

605
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,680
Bob!

606
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,360
These aren't the words.

607
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,760
Bob!

608
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,080
Oh, no!

609
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,120
There's only one thing left to do!

610
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,380
Kill Bob!

611
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,860
Kill Bob!

612
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,320
Kill Bob!

613
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,740
Kill Bob!

614
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,000


615
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,680
Kill Bob!

616
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:19,680


617
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:19,860
Kill Bob!

618
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,780
Bob ripped me off for all my slack.

619
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
He gets all the women.

620
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,920
He gets all the froth.

621
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,540
And he gets all the slack.

622
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,500
Bob!

623
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,380
Kill Bob!

624
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,380


625
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,380


626
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,380


627
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,380


628
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,380


629
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,380


630
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,300
Kill Bob!

631
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:55,420
So the order was-

632
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,380
Kill Bob!

633
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


634
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


635
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


636
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


637
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


638
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


639
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


640
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,380


641
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,520
Goodness!

642
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,000
Look at that.

643
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,800
I was possessed by the evil Ant-Man, Bob.

644
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,120
There's only one thing left to do.

645
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,860
Praise Bob!

646
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,600
Praise Bob!

647
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
Praise Bob, everybody!

648
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,420
Praise Bob!

649
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,940
Praise Bob!

650
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,120
With that $10,000, I could build a tabernacle,

651
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,640
make that Wheeling Island tabernacle

652
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,820
look like a chicken house.

653
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,520
Will you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?

654
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,740
Think of it, Ben. With that cursed,

655
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,880
bloodied gold.

656
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,600
How come you got that stick knife hit up in your

657
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,480
bed blankets, Preacher?

658
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,340
The Lord blinded mine enemies when they brought me

659
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,880
in this evil place. I smuggled it in

660
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,640
right under the noses of them guards.

661
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,640
I come not with peace,

662
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,740
but with a sword.

663
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,260
You, Preacher?

664
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,880
This sword has served me through many an evil time,

665
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Ben Harper.

666
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,600
I have been a great man since I was a child.

667
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:00,600


668
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,320
What religion you profess, Preacher?

669
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,220
The religion the Almighty in me worked out

670
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,940
betwixt us.

671
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,500
I'll bet.

672
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,380
Salvation is a last minute business, boy.

673
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,280
Keep talking, Preacher.

674
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,520
If you was to let that money

675
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,600
serve the Lord's purpose,

676
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,340
he might feel kindly turned towards you.

677
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Keep talking, Preacher.

678
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,140
Now don't you think the Lord might change

679
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,420
his mind if you was to...

680
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,620
...

681
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:36,720
...

682
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,920
...

683
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,540
...

684
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,140
...

685
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,420
...

686
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,760
...

687
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
...

688
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,780
...

689
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:56,800
...

690
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,340
...

691
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:02,440
...

692
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,460
...

693
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,600
...

694
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,040
It's 1999 and the saucers aren't here.

695
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:24,160
It's 1999 and it's time to kill every adult in America

696
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,560
to keep the children safe from child molesters.

697
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,940
It's 1999 and there is no Bob in Boston.

698
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:39,160
They cut Bob out of Boston and then they looked at the hole that was left

699
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,300
and they realized it was in the shape of Bob.

700
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,240
So they cut out that hole, but that hole only became a bigger hole of Bob.

701
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,820
And the hole just kept getting wider and wider until we all fell in.

702
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,240
And we fell and we fell and we fell and we fell.

703
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,400
We fell into Bob and we fell through Bob and when we landed it was on Bob.

704
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,840
And we jumped up and down on his ribs because he sure deserved it.

705
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,880
Thanks for making the Boston Undeviled the most controversial revival

706
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,580
ever performed on this planet.

707
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,800
THEkehr God must

708
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:46,800


709
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:46,800


710
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,320
You know, before any of us get too angry at our higher ups and our government officials

711
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,540
who have basically used the bureaucracy that we fund with our tax money

712
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,840
in order to make life difficult for us,

713
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,240
we should remember that they are after all just doing their job,

714
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,360
because let's face it,

715
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,320
If you go to the web pages, you see this hate group specifically say they want to hurt everybody.

716
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,620
They want to kill everybody on July 5th, 1998.

717
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
And that day's coming real soon.

718
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,560
So can you blame them for taking it seriously?

719
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,380
I mean, I would.

720
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,720
So, you know, we'll give the devil her due.

721
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:30,740
Now, for the subgeniuses out there who might be a little wise to this and think, wait a minute, that day's already come and gone.

722
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,480
Don't be so fast to jump to these conclusions.

723
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,860
Because remember, how do you know July 5th, 1998 has come and gone?

724
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,540
I mean, they tell me I was born in the 60s, but how do I know that, you know?

725
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,660
I believe in a conspiracy calendar, that's why.

726
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,900
Now, there's Bob Dobbs and there's a conspiracy.

727
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,340
And it really boils down to this simple question.

728
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,600
Who do you trust?

729
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,240
Okay, now, has Bob?

730
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,160
Was he lying when he said, you know, that the conspiracy is comprised of pinks and normals that basically want to make your life miserable?

731
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:07,600
No.

732
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,180
No, he was pretty on the mark there.

733
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:21,000
Now, let's compare that to the conspiracy who, in, oh, let's say, in the early 20th century, promised us that income tax would be temporary only to fund World War I.

734
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,840
And it would be over as soon as the war was over.

735
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,680
That sounded kind of like a lie.

736
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,300
And only the rich would be taxed.

737
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,860
That's right.

738
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,540
Only the rich would be taxed.

739
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,480
And Vietnam came along.

740
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,540
They didn't lie to us all during that war, did they?

741
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,980
We weren't in Laos.

742
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,440
We were going to have the troops home before Christmas.

743
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,800
Well, they kind of lied about that, too.

744
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,040
They kind of lied about Watergate.

745
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:47,720
They kind of lied about Richard Nixon, Monica, this stuff with Social Security, this stuff with Kosovo.

746
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
I mean, they're all lies.

747
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,500
It's always lies.

748
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,900
But Bob Dobbs, he never lies.

749
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,040
So, you have to ask yourself, if he says,

750
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,920
that on July 5th, 1998, flying saucers are going to come down here and rescue us,

751
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,820
that you have but one conclusion to come to,

752
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,380
and that is that it's not July 5th, 1998 yet.

753
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,020
Now, I'm willing to set my watch.

754
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm telling you, when those flying saucers land,

755
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,840
and those exoshock troops come out here,

756
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,440
and cleansing the planet of the problem people,

757
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,940
and freeing it up for the rest of us to get a little bit of slack,

758
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,700
then, and only then, you can come to the very real conclusion

759
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,520
that the time is 7 a.m.

760
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,080
The date is July 5th, and the year is 1998.

761
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,800
I also suggest, if you've got one of these computer watches,

762
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,280
that you set it, as it's happening, off your wristwatch,

763
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,320
for a very simple reason.

764
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,740
Because I won't be surprised, in the least,

765
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,980
if a dagger comes flying through the air,

766
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,500
and smashes through that same watch at that very time,

767
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,680
because Bob Dobbs does not approve of this little dog's collar that we wear.

768
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:58,340
And he has this idea about time control, thought control, control control.

769
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,500
He's against it.

770
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,520
Another reason to say,

771
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,340
well, I'm going to side with Bob instead of the conspiracy.

772
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,740
So if you're a control freak,

773
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,900
you just keep on siding with those people who are trying to control the hate group

774
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,300
that wants to destroy the world on July 5th, 1988,

775
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,540
which they say has already come and gone.

776
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,680
So, now, that raises another question.

777
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,180
If they know this is going to happen on July 5th, 1998,

778
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,360
and yet they believe that it's 1999,

779
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,100
there's inconsistency here, isn't it?

780
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,300
Either they don't believe it's really 1999,

781
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
or they don't believe us that it's going to happen

782
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,380
on July 5th, 1998.

783
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,580
There's a lie, an inconsistency, a paradox.

784
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,760
It's all based on lies.

785
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,960
It's a single thread that goes through the entire conspiracy sweater.

786
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,260
It's a quip work.

787
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,040
You just can't get away from it,

788
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,980
unless you're with Bob.

789
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,220
So, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters,

790
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,580
or should I say ladies and genocides,

791
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,280
let us stay together in our mutual love for the hate

792
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,680
that binds us in this wonderful church of the subgenius.

793
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,100
And thank you for coming tonight.

794
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,100
Thank you.

795
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,600
You're welcome.

796
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
This is Ken Rees.

797
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,880
This is the story.

798
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,500
You get the Boston police to drop this .

799
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,180
I'll bet you, yeah.

800
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,040
It has to be him.

801
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,640
Who else has that?

802
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,960
That's all they have to do to have eternal happiness.

803
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,500
They haven't only been getting hooked up

804
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,540
in the ass by the choir director.

805
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,260
Yeah.

806
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,480
It's Bob.

807
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,700
That's right, Bob Hurst.

808
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,740
So, it's Bob .

809
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,860
Great publicity for you.

810
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,720
that's all you care you'll probably have a bunch of gods we're gonna give you all the

811
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,580
half the money that we sue them for or it depends on how much we're soon

812
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:39,000
lord you sure know what you was doing when you put me in this very cell at this very time

813
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,780
a man with ten thousand dollars he was saying and the widow

814
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,720
so

815
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:12,560
there's only so many more days till x x day etc and i'm thinking well you know i i'm not in the

816
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,300
business of decoding this right this ain't funny in the context of now well that's that's what we're

817
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:25,060
concerned about is that someone took this stuff way out of context what we do is like mad magazine

818
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,280
or national anthem or saturday night

819
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,040
yeah

820
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:55,380
i don't feel like i don't have the stuff to give you but but you the stuff that i have is in my

821
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,300
opinion enough to raise

822
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,200
concern about

823
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,100
who might be coming i guess okay so i think it was logical

824
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:27,120
wow i think this would be worthy of investigation by not only police but also

825
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:38,340
rylic Just to be sure in the context of A nation like ours where we are in terms of public safety

826
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,500
it would be worthy of looking into it.

827
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:49,040
so, i know well that there is something called free speech and i know well there is something called via public safety

828
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,800
and i know well that there must be Boe Збор spring in Wenn Legale and the reason that we have

829
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,760
i would say

830
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,760
say, a manager, a mayor, and a police commissioner

831
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,060
is to be able to make determinations.

832
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,940
Now, as I understand, I do not know why

833
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,780
the show was canceled, but someone made that judgment.

834
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,120
And whether it was right or not, I guess,

835
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,180
the law or what even will, but I do know that all,

836
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,640
I am telling you, they will tell you in

837
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,060
in the late fi challenges they had,

838
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,380
witnesses. They're doing better than ever.

839
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,580
Is the Church of the Subgenius going to let

840
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,360
the Jehovah's Witnesses out-coot

841
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,160
us? I think not!

842
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,540
I think not! I think we're not going to

843
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,400
let Heaven's Gate happen. No, we're not going to

844
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,280
let Heaven's Gate happen.

845
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,660
We're not going to let Jonestown out-coot

846
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,380
us unless we can do over a thousand

847
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,300
people. So,

848
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,460
you know, don't worry about it. You can

849
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,920
come next day and be ready to enjoy

850
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,680
fine-flavored Kool-Aid,

851
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,540
fine-flavored slack.

852
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,240
You can, you know, join in or

853
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,160
just be a videotaping

854
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,120
voyeur. We don't care as long as you give me

855
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,920
the videotaped copies afterwards

856
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,020
so I can see what happened.

857
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,260
It looked like a lot of fun.

858
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,400
So, aren't we

859
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,960
doing just a...

860
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,580
Is this going to be another one of those Subgenius

861
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,860
revivals that just sort of...

862
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,600
Like life itself

863
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,880
just kind of ends with

864
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,460
a whimper. Hell no!

865
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,280
Instead of a bang,

866
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,680
or we could,

867
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,200
who's got a lighter?

868
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,360
Well,

869
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,800
we wouldn't want to do it in here

870
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,500
because it would waste the trajectory.

871
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,140
So, thanks.

872
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,060
We're shooting for specific goals.

873
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,400
If the Exos don't arrive in 1999,

874
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,260
then our next goal...

875
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,940
is 200 pounds,

876
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,380
20 miles,

877
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,740
in the year 2000.

878
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,800
200 pounds of

879
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,200
solid fuel rocket booster

880
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,780
juice.

881
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,300
200 miles.

882
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,660
200 miles.

883
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,080
200 miles!

884
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,380
And a big parachute on the end.

885
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,540
But I have friends.

886
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,760
We won't have to worry

887
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,340
another...

888
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,180
We won't have to party in Brushwood

889
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,120
every year and put on those...

890
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,960
those events where Jesus and I make a few thousand dollars.

891
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,380
We won't have to do that!

892
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,340
Because we'll be lifted up.

893
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:01,960
We'll be ruptured.

894
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,780
We've got faith.

895
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,720
We've got faith in a...

896
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,120
Not in some invisible monster up in the sky,

897
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,600
but a monster you can see.

898
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,280
How many of my other relatives have a picture of their God?

899
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,440
How many...

900
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,200
Can a Christian show you a photograph of Jesus?

901
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,900
I can produce photographs of Jesus and Bob.

902
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,320
I can even produce Jesus in person.

903
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,100
I can even produce Jesus in person.

904
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,100


905
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,100


906
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,100


907
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,040
And I'm sure Bob will be here later on.

908
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,840
I've seen folks in the convoy day.

909
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,680
Most likely.

910
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,860
That's probably what happened to Dave's car.

911
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,120
Dave's alternator broke down.

912
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,980
Both of them.

913
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,600
The one in his head and the one in his car.

914
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,440
And that's what happens when you get too close to Bob Dobbs.

915
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,260
Friends, you corset subgeniuses out there are saying,

916
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,840
but I love Bob Roberts.

917
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,660
I'd do anything.

918
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,640
Devoted, totally, heart, mind, and soul to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

919
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,660
I'm queer for Bob.

920
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,000
That's what you know what I mean.

921
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,600
I mean to him, man.

922
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,440
I mean, I'd do anything.

923
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,660
And, uh...

924
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,840
Well, that's great.

925
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,240
But where do you think Bob gets his infinite slack?

926
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,540
Just out of a beautiful air?

927
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,860
He gets it from you, my friend.

928
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,620
The closer you get to Bob,

929
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,020
the more of your divine slack he will take into himself.

930
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,060
And that's why he seeks soap.

931
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,660
And that's why he smiles.

932
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,260
And why he seems so slack.

933
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,680
Because he has it.

934
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,140
And you don't.

935
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,480
And that's why Bob is the saint of sales.

936
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,800
And that's why he got into the religion business.

937
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,340
On that note, I'd like to remind you all that

938
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,000
the sacred sales table of the Church of the Subgenius is just outside this door.

939
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,160
We take plastic and cash and checks.

940
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,660
And Chad will be selling Einstein's...

941
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,220
Secret Orchestra tapes.

942
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,140
I won't be selling many Subgenius tapes because of that.

943
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,260
But he doesn't have Einstein's Secret Orchestra T-shirts.

944
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,780
And I've got Bob's T-shirts.

945
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,080
And I've got one last X-Day 98 souvenir video.

946
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,520
You got married again?

947
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,600
And that's it.

948
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,380
And that's it.

949
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,260
Praise God.

950
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,840
And to the end of the...

951
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,980
Praise God!

952
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:20,600
Praise God!

953
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,260
Hail, Connie!

954
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,580
Hail, Connie!

955
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,620
Hail, Connie!

956
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:27,540
Hail, Connie.

957
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,140
.

958
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,860
What a good boy!

959
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,200
He's very good.

960
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,260
Mary!

961
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:31,920
Mary!

962
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,140
Mary!

963
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,160
Thank you.

964
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,300
Is there a

965
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,080
Merry Christmas to everybody?

966
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,080
Mary!

967
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:35,600


968
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:35,620
Mary!

969
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:35,620


970
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,520
and put your hands on your knees.

971
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:02,160
Now you must consummate this marriage with each and every other person in this room

972
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,940
or else you make a sick mockery of the divine Institutional Marriage.

973
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,820
I love you, I love you, I love you.

974
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:09,040
This twilight seems like an eternity

975
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,080
The changes I go through are hurting me

976
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,260
Do we become what we deserve to be?

977
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,560
Open up your eyes

978
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,200
You're sleeping through this masquerade

979
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,400
You're shining up just fine

980
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,300
Sublime inside a brand new life

981
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,320
Open up your eyes

982
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,900
You're sleeping through this masquerade

983
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,180
You're shining up just fine

984
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,640
Sublime inside a brand new life

985
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,660
Open up your eyes

986
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,820
You're sleeping through this masquerade

987
00:53:59,820 --> 00:53:59,820


988
00:53:59,820 --> 00:53:59,820


989
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:06,000
You'll watch as she seduces the newcomers into one of the most perverse underground societies of our time.

990
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:17,300
Perhaps an orgasm would go on and on and on with many variations, with peaks, valleys, rocky tops, and plateaus.

991
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,060
This type would look like the high Sierras.

992
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,220
Like an entire mountain range.

993
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:32,800
I call this type of orgasm the Megagasm, which I'm demonstrating for you now.

994
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,620
We are all at the right time and place in learning about our orgasms.

995
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,940
And one kind of orgasm is no better or worse than another.

996
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,500
But still, we can all learn a lot, lot more.

997
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,640
But still, we can all learn a lot, lot more.

998
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,220
But still, we can all learn a lot, lot more.

999
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,160
Remember the ACLU deserves a gentle, great here tonight.

1000
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,320
Ladies and gentlemen, Father Patel and the Guild!

1001
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,160
Thank you.

1002
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,040
And, first of all, also known as Cast for Love.

1003
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,900
Cast for Love!

1004
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,920
We don't want to leave here tonight without remembering how important the ACLU was in helping us out.

1005
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,680
Because, you know, if you believe in Bob Dobbs, who are you going to turn to to defend you?

1006
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,640
Ghostbusters!

1007
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,220
Exactly.

1008
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:26,800
Or, you know, if you happen to want to exterminate 99.8% of the rest of the planet, the ACLU is going to be your only friend.

1009
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,400
That's right.

1010
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,780
They don't care whether it's good taste or bad taste.

1011
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,020
We're only looking for pinks that taste good!

1012
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,060
Now, we were, you know, we knew that if they helped the Nazis go through Skokie, they'd love Bob Dobbs.

1013
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,780
Oh, hi!

1014
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,260
Hi.

1015
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,280
But, uh...

1016
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,260
Shh, shh, shh.

1017
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,180
Quieter, can we please?

1018
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,040
Yeah, keep it down.

1019
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,700
That's what I was about to suggest. If you'd ask us to keep it down.

1020
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,060
Okay.

1021
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,940
You know, screaming out curse words, you know, isn't really going to help our case any more.

1022
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,240
You know, we saw the protest.

1023
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,580
We don't know the words either, so we're going to have to fake it.

1024
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,740
What are these words? Bob is love?

1025
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,080
Uh-oh.

1026
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,240
And then Bob is love. And then...

1027
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,140
Bob is love.

1028
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,460
And then love...

1029
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,900
It gets tricky.

1030
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,560
All together now. Love is Bob.

1031
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,400
Okay.

1032
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,720
That's tricky, we know.

1033
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,000
It's a sing-along, we need your help.

1034
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,440
Can you hear the beats going in the background?

1035
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,040
You ready?

1036
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,280
Three, four.

1037
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,940
Bob is love.

1038
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,760
Bob is love.

1039
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,600
Come on, everybody.

1040
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,060
All you motherfuckers.

1041
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,360
Bob is love.

1042
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,380
Here we go.

1043
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,380
Here's the tricky one.

1044
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,300
Love is Bob.

1045
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,320
Oh, you guys are geniuses.

1046
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,200
Bob is love.

1047
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,420
Divine love.

1048
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1049
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1050
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1051
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1052
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1053
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1054
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1055
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1056
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1057
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,460
A supreme love.

1058
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,760
Bob is love.

1059
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,920
An icky, sticky love.

1060
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,920
Bob is love.

1061
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,280
Bob is love.

1062
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,140
The kind of love your mammy baruind you about.

1063
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,520
Bob is love.

1064
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,700
The kind of love that gets your squid-squirting baby.

1065
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,600
Bob is love.

1066
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,740
Love is Bob.

1067
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,560
Bob is love.

1068
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,120
I'm wingsome.

1069
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:14,460
Stop it!

1070
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,460
It's Bobbyоды!

1071
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:16,520
What has happened to remote control?

1072
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,520


1073
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,520


1074
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,520


1075
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,060
Bob is hate!

1076
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,580
Isn't that all you ever want, more hate?

1077
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,720
Bob is hate!

1078
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,020
Hate the conspiracy!

1079
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,780
Hate the rebels that stole your slack!

1080
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,360
Bob is hate!

1081
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,880
Hate, that's for my age!

1082
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,800
Bob is hate!

1083
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,600
Hate is Bob!

1084
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,620
Bob is hate!

1085
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,180
Bob doesn't love you!

1086
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,340
Bob despises you!

1087
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,620
Bob is light!

1088
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,660
Kill Bob!

1089
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,940
Bob is late!

1090
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,060
He can't win your job!

1091
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,740
Suck off!

1092
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,820
You have been driven to the brink of insanity by the conspiracy!

1093
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,580
Bob is hate!

1094
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,720
Bob is your only hope!

1095
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,300
Bob is...

1096
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,820
You are a lot closer than you even think!

1097
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,400
Bob is the way!

1098
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,200
Bob is the path!

1099
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,560
Believe or die!

1100
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,100
And things were really, really screwed.

1101
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,040
And I felt like I was caught up in a flood.

1102
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,860
And I was washing down, I was washing down.

1103
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:38,660
And then, you know, I was just at that point where I said, this just isn't worth it anymore.

1104
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,120
And, uh, right about that time,

1105
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,920
I found out about the Church of the Sub-Jews.

1106
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:52,620
And it was like a message that changed my life.

1107
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,020
It turned everything around.

1108
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:02,960
I realized that, you know, all this mopey whining and worrying about, you know, what's going to happen to me caught in the flood,

1109
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,440
you know, all this stuff isn't going to mean anything because I know that the exits are going to be cut off.

1110
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,100
So I was caught, like I said, my whole life's been like that.

1111
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,840
I was caught in the flood.

1112
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,680
And I was washing down that river.

1113
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,260
And that girl, she was the first branch.

1114
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,380
And I grabbed onto her.

1115
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,420
And that branch broke.

1116
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,120
And I went to my friends.

1117
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,140
They were that second branch.

1118
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:29,840
They were rotten.

1119
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,540
Broke off in my hand.

1120
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:37,360
And finally, I got washed down, and I grabbed onto that one cracked branch.

1121
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,040
The Church of the Sub-Jews.

1122
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,080
The Church of the Sub-Jews is that cracked branch.

1123
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,960
That's the branch that I cling to.

1124
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:53,160
And brothers and sisters, I know full well that as I cling to that branch, that someday soon, my salvation is going to come down from the sky, too.

1125
00:59:54,020 --> 01:00:02,740
And brothers and sisters, just know that that flood, no matter how it has affected any of you, no matter what flood you are all caught in,

1126
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:11,320
just remember that since you have your $30 membership in the Church of the Sub-Jews, that big ol' sky hook's going to come down for you, too.

1127
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,300
Thanks, brothers and sisters.

1128
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,860
And thank you, Dr. Legume.

1129
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,520
A fine preaching job.

1130
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:35,380
Fine preaching jobs there by Dr. Katahdin Legume, by Papa Joe Mama, who did a lot on that revival.

1131
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,780
Also, Dr. Dry-Foo.

1132
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,740
Praise Reverend Dry-Foo.

1133
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:47,020
And Reverend Jihad Frenzy videotaped that show, which is where we get the sound from.

1134
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:55,500
And dear friends, of course, the Reverend Friday Jones, who produced the whole debacle and has yet to...

1135
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,700
You know, you should donate your love offerings to her in the name of Bob.

1136
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:06,040
And we'll be giving that post office address in a second here.

1137
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,980
But friends, and Bill T. Miller and Brother Cleve, you heard there.

1138
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,200
And with Dr. Dry-Foo, it's chanting and singing.

1139
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:18,660
And we must thank Ken Reeves of the Boston City Council.

1140
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:26,040
And the Old Cambridge Baptist Church has sincerely actually helped a lot.

1141
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:36,360
And friends, you can write for free information from Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1142
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,980
That's Box 140306.

1143
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,820
Box140306.
