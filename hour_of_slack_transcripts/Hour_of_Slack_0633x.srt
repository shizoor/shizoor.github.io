1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
Boys and girls, you've just heard a scientific demonstration which proves that the pitch of a sound is changed by changing the vibration.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,040
Vibration, vibration, vibration is what causes sound.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Vibration, vibration, vibration causes sound.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,760
Vibration, vibration, vibration is what causes sound.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,600
Vibration, vibration, vibration causes sound.

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,240
Four hours of slack.

7
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:05,360
Yes, my friends, because hour of slack number 638 will fall on July 1st.

8
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,460
Only four more days before X-Day.

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,460
I guess it'll have to be reruns after that, dear friends.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:22,500
I guess I'll just leave a big stack of reruns at the stations that may be left behind after July 5th.

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,540
And I guess we'll start all over again with hour of slack.

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
Number one, that'll be kind of ironic.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,700
They're all so crude and silly back in those days.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
And that'll be all that's left.

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,720
The poor survivors will have to learn it all all over again.

16
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,960
But how fruitless it will be, won't it, friends?

17
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,740
Because there really is only one July 5th, 1998.

18
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,220
And do you have what it takes to go the distance on that day?

19
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,060
Do you have what Bob asked of you, my friend?

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,280
Do you have that much slack?

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,020
Are you going to take the slack that is rightfully yours is the question.

22
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,360
You have that slack.

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,680
You have it and it's yours.

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,840
But you've been letting the conspiracy waste it for you.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,540
No, no, you shan't let that happen anymore, my friend.

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,580
Because in only five more hours of slack, the world as you know it will be destroyed.

27
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,700
And you, yes, you, my dues-paying friend, my fellow minister.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,840
In this church, you and I both together shall be ruptured up in glory and nakedness

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,000
into the arms, the veritable bosom of the sex goddesses from Planet X

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,460
in the escape vessels which will then become our battle planets

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,100
on which we shall haul butt forward out and into space

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,700
after, of course, wreaking vengeance on those who ever irritated us

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,620
in any way down there on Mother Earth below.

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,260
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,040
I can feel it.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
I can feel X-Day coming.

37
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,420
I can feel the blood rising.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,840
As Dr. Legume says, the river is rising, my friend.

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,820
Bob Dobbs has that life preserver.

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,840
Are you going to take it?

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,500
He's ready to throw it to you.

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
Ah, yes.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,980
Praise Bob.

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,420
Hail Connie.

45
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,860
Let there be slack.

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
Ah, ah, ah.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,180
There's something for everyone here in small town.

49
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,780
That's why it's such a swell place to live.

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,580
I was told that I had a power demon

51
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:50,200
where I thought I had control over, um, you know, the over God.

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
Ah, he got me!

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,760
Ah!

54
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:54,920
Ah!

55
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:55,660


56
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,720


57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,720


58
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,720


59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,720


60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,720


61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,720


62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:55,740
Ah!

63
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


64
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


65
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


66
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


67
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


69
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


70
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


71
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


73
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


74
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


75
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


76
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


77
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:55,740


78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,420
Ah!

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,620
Set the dwarves to cranking the machinery.

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,840
How long do I have to do this for?

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,280
So that the great corkscrew razor dildo, uh, and the ceremony may begin.

82
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,680
Oh, good bro, friend.

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Okay, you guys, there it is.

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,940
Only four and a half inches.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,980
You want to start laughing now or what?

86
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,020
I wish I wouldn't be thinking about sex.

87
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,840
I wish I wouldn't be thinking about sex.

88
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,340
Uh, you know, I've got to quit thinking about sex.

89
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,060
Right.

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,700
If, you know, if you...

91
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,220
Is it going to think about it more then?

92
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,760
Yeah.

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,740
It's just going to...

94
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,860
It's going to make you all that much more compulsive.

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,480
Right.

96
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Uh, the power of sin is in the law.

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,620
Instead, I want you, as soon as you have a sexual thought, to look at...

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,080
Bob.

99
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh, my God, he's here.

100
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,260
Honey, I feel much better now.

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,580
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

102
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,420
which reaches from the inner mind to...

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,220
The subgenius power of sweat.

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Y'all brothers from out of the states

105
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,720
are coming with advanced knowledge

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,220
to help

107
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,500
human race.

108
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,760
Bob will save all true believers, though, in 1998, right?

109
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,340
Actually, Bob...

110
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,160
You better hope that Bob does some wheelin' and dealin'

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,580
for your soul come 1998.

112
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,120
He is the salesman of the universe,

113
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,740
here to make sure that the Earth and your soul

114
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,580
does not get sold to, uh, to the robot mutilators.

115
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,900
At least...

116
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,500
At least for not too low a price.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,580
So you better read that book with all three eyes,

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,300
or however many you have left,

119
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,720
and, uh, leave the driving to Bob.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,620
That's right.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,820
You do the walkin', let Bob do the talkin'.

122
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,300
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

123
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,580
What is waiting there?

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,560
What is waiting there?

125
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,120
For me!

126
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,400
Bob.

127
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,820
Can't wait to strap on your groovy old man.

128
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,840
Ah!

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,780
Not ready with my beautiful body.

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880
You got a lot of nerve buster tellin' me you're not ready.

131
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,040
All those muscles, except the one that really counts.

132
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,040
War of the academic community against everything that this country has ever stood for,

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,100
all of its basic beliefs.

134
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,560
It's a war against religion.

135
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,080
And for just one second, your eyes snap open,

136
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,480
and you remember that life is beautiful,

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
the world is wonderful,

138
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,820
and everything is just as psychedelic as that old T-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

139
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,600
Now, hold that thought!

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,440
Hard to do, ain't it, dear friends?

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,260
You wanna know why?

142
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,560
It's cause of the conspiracy!

143
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Oh, ho, ho!

144
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,840
Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

145
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,080
Oh, there it must be.

146
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,560
There it is, there it is, there it is.

147
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,740
Crash saucer.

148
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,260
Air Force CIA.

149
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,280
Roswell.

150
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,360
Area 51.

151
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,880
Ace of Louse.

152
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,900
Conspiracy.

153
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,840
John Kennedy.

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
The Nazi shoes.

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
It's all, it's all.

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,260
The apocalypse starts now.

157
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,080
The apocalypse is going on right now, all around you, everywhere you look, everywhere you see.

158
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:38,100
It's the constant, slow, steady degradation of mankind, of human society, as we see it.

159
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,000
The breakdown of the family, the breakdown of the psyche,

160
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,060
the breakdown of individual responsibility is going on all around you,

161
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,640
and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

162
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,420
And that, my friends, is, in fact,

163
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,620
the constant and present apocalypse.

164
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm not part of it.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm not even necessarily promoting it or endorsing it.

166
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm just here to entertain throughout.

167
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,380
I certainly don't want to.

168
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,120
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Andrew the Appellate of the Zurich and Spockalypse Sideshow.

169
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,820
I thank you for your pleasance.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,540
I thank you for your patience.

171
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,560
And you're all sick bastards!

172
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,140
In the meantime, we have a special alien update.

173
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,800
From some subgenius that traveled a long way to give you this alien update.

174
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,880
Here they are.

175
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,660
Attention.

176
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,740
We have an update on the alien status.

177
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,640
Good morning.

178
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,540
I'm the sixth avatar of the alien status.

179
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm a member of the alien revenants.

180
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,660
Me and Tahooti are members of a heretofore secret organization,

181
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,740
a secret arm of Bob's Secret Service.

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,260
We have just received special orders that were signed by Bob prior to his extermination,

183
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
authorizing us to inform you of our existence

184
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,000
and to also give you information that will help you survive the upcoming X-Day.

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,840
We have found through much experimentation that the alien mindset works in a collective consciousness.

186
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:28,620
We have also found, as we all know, the subgenius has individuality and works with rational self-interest.

187
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:36,600
Therefore, we have to be able to determine what the difference between the collective consciousness and individuality is.

188
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,980
It's a war against the mind.

189
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:37,980


190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,420
It's a war against religion.

191
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:48,540
Kids, we're going to need an awful lot of brains on drugs if we're going to make the great omelet of Bob

192
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,580
and defeat the conspiracy of the normal people.

193
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,980
Yes, yes, yes.

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,240
Wonderful marinated Dave.

195
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,400
Just smell that brain cookie.

196
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,080
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

197
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,780
He's so famous and so delicious.

198
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,640
Here, have a fork and a knife, Princess Wee.

199
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,080
Oh, poked head, pretend.

200
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,080
Look, if you poke the front part of this sizzling brain, he remembers his childhood.

201
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,160
And if you poke the back part of this sizzling brain, his leg jerks.

202
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes.

203
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,520
This is really delicious and fun, too.

204
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,020
And he's full of vitamins. Mom will like that.

205
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm a sandwich.

206
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,500
Do they ever forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh, strict words of command?

207
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,960
I wonder.

208
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,880
I wonder.

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,780
How can you forget or forgive those over and above you?

210
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,920
Those tall, silly dictators?

211
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,900
Those parents?

212
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,900
There are a number of workshops, one of them on sadomasochism,

213
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,120
that was billed as safe, sane, and consensual sadomasochism,

214
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,500
an alternative way of loving.

215
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,180
Mommy, Daddy, where are you?

216
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Peek-a-boo.

217
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,380
You know, we live in a time when we're gonna be faced with making some hard choices.

218
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,500
We live in a time when the conspiracy will do its best to limit the choices that we have.

219
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,720
But today I'm here to tell you that I'm glad to be affiliated with Bob and Slack.

220
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,960
If you have no Slack, you have no life.

221
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,780
If you have no Slack, you have no reality.

222
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,880
As the aliens approach our planet, we're gonna be the first ones to know that we're not alone.

223
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:14,580
As the planetoid hell-bop approaches our planet, we're going to face some choices.

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
And I will leave you with that.

225
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,360
It's been a pleasure being around those who espouse Slack.

226
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,900
We out.

227
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah!

228
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,340
Yeah!

229
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,280
Yeah!

230
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,600
No, when I talked to Bob, you know, he just grinned.

231
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,660
He said, there ain't no use fighting it, because he always wins.

232
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah!

233
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,500
There ain't nothing that he can't do.

234
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,920
If you won't do it yourself, he won't do it for you.

235
00:12:51,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Now, psychologists tell us, or at least they theorize, that the reason most people loathe even the discussion of death

236
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,900
is that they are afraid of the pain.

237
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
That is associated with death.

238
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,720
That is to say, they're not really afraid of death per se.

239
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,500
They are afraid of the pain that they will experience while dying.

240
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,420
Well, friends, I'm here to tell you that that is a load of horse hockey.

241
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:31,400
The pain that you will experience dying will be nothing compared to the pain that most of us will experience after death.

242
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,320
We're going to discuss that pain right here, right now, in great detail.

243
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,320
Because the title of tonight's sermon is, Paying Your Dues to Dops.

244
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Now, I'd like to ask you, how many of you out there right now know that when you die, you're not going straight to hell?

245
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,840
Let's have a show of hands.

246
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,080
Now, if you feel that way, why so?

247
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,100
Is it because you sent in your $30 love offering?

248
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,740
Yeah!

249
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,700
Is it because you read all the subgenius books?

250
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,180
Yeah!

251
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,340
Is it because you're good buddies with one of Bob's sacred preachers?

252
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:11,800
Yeah!

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,780
Well, all these reasons don't mean nothing come judgment day.

254
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,520
Because Bob does not measure your importance in how much money you spend on his merchandise,

255
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,920
or how much you read his books,

256
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,720
or how much suck you have with his special buddies.

257
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,180
No, sir! No, sir!

258
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,940
Bob measures your worth in one way, and one way only.

259
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,740
How much he ate?

260
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,280
He asks, have you held his ministry?

261
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,660
In other words, have you paid your dues?

262
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:53,080
Now, you see, the majority of people, pinks, normals, pseudo subgenies, are all destined to hell.

263
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,960
That's just a plain, simple fact Bob foretold in his scriptures.

264
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,500
There's only so much space on those pleasure saucers come X-Day.

265
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,460
And the rest are all going to be left screaming.

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,340
Bob could have bought more pleasure saucers, but what's the point?

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,680
He already knows the exact number of true subgenies,

268
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,320
and quite frankly, he doesn't want to waste the air or fuel on them.

269
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,620
The deadbeat bobbies and pseudo subgenies are wannabe warriors for Wotan.

270
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,940
If you're trying to establish a relationship with Bob,

271
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,440
or establish a utopian society,

272
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,400
the last thing you want to do is import problem people to the promised world.

273
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,940
Solution?

274
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,640
Leave them to fry in hell.

275
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,120
Now, some folks might think that's a little severe, but look at the big picture.

276
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,220
Bob is a pioneer.

277
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,200
He's establishing a new frontier.

278
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,620
He can't afford the luxury of pity.

279
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,920
All excess baggage must be jettisoned.

280
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,160
It's as simple as that.

281
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,000
A simple fact.

282
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,500
You either gotta live with it or die.

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,260
So now I ask you again.

284
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,340
How many of you feel secure that you're not gonna go straight to hell when you die?

285
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,220
Is it fair, you might rightly ask, that Bob saves only those who benefit his ministry?

286
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,080
I, for one, say yes.

287
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,280
Bob is up there in the heavens right now preparing us a utopian world.

288
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,920
While most of us sit around and do nothing, but pray.

289
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,300
Let the little pimples on our butts grow and act sanctimonious.

290
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,260
So many subgenies expect to be pampered.

291
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,680
They want Bob to entertain them.

292
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,740
They want Bob to validate them.

293
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,500
They want Bob to save them.

294
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,040
But when Bob says save someone else, they say,

295
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,760
leave it to the preachers.

296
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,840
No, sir!

297
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,540
Bob wants you to save your neighbor!

298
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,200
Bob wants you to save your neighborhood!

299
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,240
Bob wants you to save your state!

300
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,360
Bob wants you to save your country!

301
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,260
Bob wants you to save the whole damn world!

302
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,000
It's not like he's asking you to try something he didn't!

303
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,640
Yes! Yes it is hard!

304
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,100
But Bob isn't exactly on vacation either, friends.

305
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,020
I think, you want rest?

306
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,780
You can rest July 5th, 1998.

307
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,840
You want reward?

308
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,180
He'll give you eternal life on a utopian world.

309
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,020
You, what's that?

310
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,380
You want more?

311
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,620
More! More!

312
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,100
Well, how about a waiver from the fires of hell?

313
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,820
Yeah!

314
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,100
50 years ago, friends,

315
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,280
atom bombs incinerated over 100,000 people in less than a millisecond.

316
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,480
Most of their remains were nothing more than shadows burned into stone.

317
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,360
The unlucky living suffered unimaginable pain.

318
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,700
They refused food.

319
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,280
They refused water.

320
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
They wanted nothing but pain.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,700
They wanted to put scissors to cut the hanging flaps off their raw, blistered bodies.

322
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,380
We've seen the pictures.

323
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,960
We've heard the testimony.

324
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,380
We know such pain as possible.

325
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,900
And yet, that pain is nothing.

326
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,700
Nothing compared to the horrors of hell.

327
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:21,420
Because those Japanese, my friends, had something that hell's inhabitants never had.

328
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,220
And that is called hope.

329
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,940
The hope of death.

330
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,300
An end to their suffering.

331
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,220
There ain't none of that in hell, my friends.

332
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,520
The pain just keeps going on and on, day after day, year after year, century after century, millennium after millennium, with no relief in sight.

333
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,900
Sounds like a person called Choo-choo-choo.

334
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,680
Kind of funny, ain't it?

335
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,520
You get eternal life either way.

336
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,500
You get eternal bliss or eternal torment.

337
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,420
Either way, it'll last forever.

338
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,140
But you alone must choose.

339
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,760
Not just with your words, my friends, but with your deeds.

340
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,980
Will you serve Bob?

341
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,580
Or will you sit around and wait for Bob to serve you?

342
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,580
No one said it would be easy, my friends.

343
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,520
I didn't say it would be easy.

344
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,500
Stang didn't say it would be easy.

345
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
Bob Dodds didn't say it would be easy.

346
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,120
What we said is that it would be worth it.

347
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,720
If you doubt us, go over there and start one of those little fires.

348
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,000
Get yourself a little skillet.

349
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,220
Put a little butter in there, maybe a little bit of salt.

350
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,160
Stir it up, get nice and hot.

351
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,000
Take your hand, roll it up your sleeve, don't want to burn those sleeves.

352
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,760
Send it in the skillet and burn it to the bone.

353
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Then imagine that pain all over your body for millions and millions of years.

354
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,140
That is the alternative to Bob!

355
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,860
On my own, pretending Bob's beside me.

356
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,960
In the dark, his darts and pipe, they guide me.

357
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,680
Without Bob, I smell his scruff around me.

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,540
And when I have no slack, I judge my clown and Bob has found me.

359
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,840
On my job, the normals act like dumb shits.

360
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:43,040
Without slack, the sweat runs down my armpits.

361
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,720
The next day, I'll see the saucers coming.

362
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,080
And all I need is Bob and me forever and forever.

363
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,840
But until I spend my thirty bucks,

364
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,420
I'm just running to myself and not to Bob.

365
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,020
And although I know that I'm not alone,

366
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,960
I am screwed.

367
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:22,560
Still I say, there's a day of pain.

368
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,800
I love Bob, but when the rapture's over,

369
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,100
he'll be gone, the earth will be in ruins.

370
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,260
Without him, the world will run me.

371
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,900
And the world will be in changes.

372
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,640
The conspiracy is everywhere.

373
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,320
The malls are full of pink boys.

374
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:59,080
I love Bob, but every day I don't spend that thirty bucks.

375
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,260
I'm only just pretending.

376
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,340
Without me, Bob's world will go on burning.

377
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,440
And the next day, Bob will have to slack.

378
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,040
And all you'll never know.

379
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,820
I love Bob.

380
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,900
I love Bob.

381
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,360
I love Bob.

382
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,180
But only on my own.

383
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,860
Bob's World

384
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,940
Oh, how nice, how touching, so sweet,

385
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,260
and so poignant.

386
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,520
Oh-ho.

387
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,580
That was, uh, my, actually my own, uh... daughter.

388
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,800
Sivit Stang singing that song,

389
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,260
I'm Bob's Own.

390
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,060
Uh, of course, we're focusing on X Day

391
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,160
with only five more hours of slacking.

392
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:11,080
left to do on earth before I'm Bob's own we heard father Joe mama's superb rant

393
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:20,800
paying your dues to Dobbs from recorded at the X Day Drill 1996 in Brushwood New

394
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:30,080
York we also heard the Luciferian Liberation Front yeah to Hootie and

395
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,140
Avatar making some statements a little bit of dr. dinosaur and of course lots

396
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:42,960
of Einstein secret orchestra from the swamp night 1998 mixed in and of course

397
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,080
we're gonna you know friends you could join us in the final X Day celebration

398
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,400
we're going to open it up for a few non-members it'll be a lot cheaper if

399
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,000
you join the church at the same time but it's in the Brushwood campground

400
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,800
outside of Sherman New York if you want the information you can always send the

401
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,040
self-addressed stamped envelope to the p.o box that we give every show and I'm

402
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,080
gonna give it right now p.o box one four oh three oh six this is of course dear

403
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:22,040
friends the address of the office of jr. Bob Dobbs himself just address that to

404
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,500
Bob actually address it to X day p.o box one four oh three oh six

405
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:40,660
Texas seven five two one four check out www.subgenius.com which they tried to kill

406
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:46,580
last week because friends as X as the time gets closer and closer 38 days while

407
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm recording this by the time you hear it it won't probably won't be 25 but as

408
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,180
it seems like as we get closer and closer to the end the pinks get dumber

409
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,900
and dumber and dumber

410
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,180
and so do we but that's besides the point but like Bob Larson himself said if

411
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,360
you're being shot at then you know you're on the front lines you know

412
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,180
you're right in the middle of the fight

413
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,900
you definitely ain't sitting on the sidelines watchin and whinin and when

414
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:23,820
you have three radio jocks all making fun of your accent and going ooh you'r real stupid

415
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,200
because you were running anti-religion logical conundrum

416
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,780
rings

417
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,600
around there, every vulgar dumbass insult, you know that you're fighting Bob's good fight.

418
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:43,280
And not only that, you know that Bob wasn't kidding. That in fact, Bob is right. As Pope

419
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,040
David N. Meyer, one of his new ringing pronouncements that we played on the show a couple of times

420
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:59,260
back, he said, back in the 1980s, children, we were funny. Now, in the 1990s, we're only

421
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,520
right. And we're still doing drive time, rock jock, quickie radio interviews. I don't know

422
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,540
what they're telling each other about us. But the last three have started out hostile,

423
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,240
friends. And the last one I did, it literally ended with these three jock boys making fun

424
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,940
of my accent.

425
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,060
And it ain't a great way to start the day, but today is a great day anyway, friends.

426
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:33,200
The air conditioning is fixed. My tooth is crowned. My jaw stopped hurting and my brain

427
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,200
stopped hurting and I have a new transmitter in my mouth. And it rained like gangbusters

428
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,040
here in Dallas and washed away the filth and the toxic clouds from the southern hemisphere

429
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,020
econocataclysm from our air. And all that happened to me, and I'm not going to lie to

430
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,360
you, I got paid for it. I'm going to put on the music to the show, It's called The Pink

431
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,360


432
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,660
I had a show with a band called The Pink Talk Show Drive Time, and I am raping the benefits.

433
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:58,920
I feel great! So bring on those pink talk show drive time jock chucks. Let me at them,

434
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:06,520
friends. And we ain't giving up. Jesus has been calling Howard Sterns' office every day.

435
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,120
Seriously, every day. Him and lots of other showbiz characters. And other doctors are

436
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,740
working on, like Jerry Springer, for instance. Friends, the pinks, as they fry eternally,

437
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,980
will not be able to say that we didn't try to tell them.

438
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,480
We have managed to be on the pink drive time top stations

439
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,500
in every big city in America just about in the last month or so.

440
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,420
And we tell them about X Day and how 30 bucks can save them

441
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,920
and they call us stupid and laugh at us.

442
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,160
And we sent out press releases to all media worldwide

443
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,020
and 90% of them threw it in the trash.

444
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:53,380
So they can't whine from within their cages of ever-burning fire

445
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,960
that we didn't try.

446
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,960
No, sir, ma'am.

447
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Now, we are getting through to a few more of that tiny smattering

448
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
of unsaved subgeni among the population.

449
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,060
And even if each talk show thing, humiliating appearance,

450
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,440
only gets the message in the P.O. box to one lone subgenius

451
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,820
driving to work in rush hour, it's worth it.

452
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,000
Because one subgenius...

453
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,960
Subgenius, friends, is worth eight billion pinks.

454
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,420
Do the simple math.

455
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,380
Every subgenius is different.

456
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,440
Every pink is the same, the same being,

457
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,960
all sharing what might as well be one huge, fat, pink soul.

458
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,660
Well, if they can't not take a joke,

459
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,660
then let them mount up upon it, my friends.

460
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,960
All those rock jocks have bosses

461
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,160
and have to get up early and kiss butt.

462
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,640
And Jesus and me, our boss man is that man J.R. Bob Dobbs.

463
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,000
He lets us do whatever we want.

464
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,220
Whatever the Bob we want to do.

465
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,740
And when we Bob and Will want to do it, we do it.

466
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,040
And that's exactly what I think I'm going to do right now.

467
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,840
Praise Bob.

468
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,940
If you want it, it's easy, my friends.

469
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,180
Just keep on going the way you are now.

470
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,420
It's so simple.

471
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,700
But don't say, whatever you do,

472
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,240
don't say you weren't warned.

473
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,780
Because I warned you.

474
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,100
And I warned you.

475
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,000
And I warned you and you and you too.

476
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,300
I warned you all because I devoted my life to singing and screaming.

477
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,480
And warned in the word of Bob.

478
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,180
Because I know where I want to go.

479
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,800
And if you want to join me,

480
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,460
you better get on out there in that street corner

481
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,560
and start praising Bob like your fairy left a pencil on it.

482
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,260
Because guess what?

483
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,540
It does.

484
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,920
Some folks, they'll mock us.

485
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,980
And they'll laugh.

486
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,780
But don't you worry.

487
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,520
Come July 5th, 1998,

488
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,980
they'll no longer be laughing.

489
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,820
They'll be begging.

490
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,360
Screaming for another chance.

491
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,740
A chance they were given.

492
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,980
But chose to ignore.

493
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,420
Here into the world of all praise.

494
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,800
Amen.

495
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,840
Oh, Bobby, Bobby, there is pinkness all around.

496
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,780
Dobbs, bring forth all of the mighty in these last days.

497
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,420
Draw towards your church those last few worthy.

498
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,860
The covenant people, the children of the Yeti.

499
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,820
That the saucers may be full and that there may be enough for us.

500
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,620
The reap of the harvest.

501
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,140
And bring forth the holocaustal Dobbs to kill for you.

502
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,720
Bring forth the evangelicals Dobbs to screw for you.

503
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,720
And bring forth the connytites to bear the seed

504
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
and order the rest of us around.

505
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,780
Let X-Day come a-running.

506
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,200
The world will come.

507
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,880
Yes.

508
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,240
Last thing we're worried.

509
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,860
I know what's gonna happen on X-Day, friends.

510
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,140
I know exactly what's gonna happen on X-Day.

511
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,020
The men from Planet X are gonna show up at 7 o'clock in the morning

512
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,880
over the Pacific Dateline.

513
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,460
And let the Earth rotate underneath their armada of presences.

514
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,700
Rutshrowing up those $30 subgenius ministers starting in Pago Pagos.

515
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,560
Crossing the globe.

516
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,760
To Australia, Japan, across Russia, Europe.

517
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,280
Finally to these shores, friends.

518
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,380
7 o'clock in the morning, July 5th, 1990.

519
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,160
You got Brian B. and Sherman, New York, and Brushwood campground.

520
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,940
With my fellow subgeniuses.

521
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,840
Ready to be lifted up in power and glory.

522
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,540
The naked, the naked glory of X-Day.

523
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,380
Classic 1990.

524
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,100
The judgment on the dead.

525
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,300
I heard it hard away.

526
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,340
Come on, Bob.

527
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,400
Bring on X-Day.

528
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,040
Ruts me up.

529
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,180
Beam me up.

530
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,520
Scotty, there's no intelligence I have here.

531
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,080
If there was some, I'd want to get away from it anyway.

532
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,800
Please, Bob.

533
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,300
Please.

534
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,920
You won't get through when we're running out.

535
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,460
We want the world and we want it now.

536
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,580
We want the world and we want it now.

537
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,200
We want the world and we want it now.

538
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,820
Bob can give you the world.

539
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,160
Bob can give you a whole planet.

540
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,980
We want it.

541
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,700
We want it now.

542
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,360
When did you say you want it now?

543
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,940
You want the whole planet now or you just got to get it on?

544
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,920
When did you say you want it now?

545
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:50,740
When did you say you want it now?

546
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,620
You can have it in 80 days for $30.

547
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,580
$2 a day investment.

548
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,500
That's not bad.

549
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,020
It's not good.

550
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,800
Be part of the in-their-world.

551
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,140
And the beginning of your own new world.

552
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,100
And the best thing is, it's up to doing yourself.

553
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,580
New world.

554
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,280
That's right.

555
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,480
We're not giving you instructions.

556
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:28,420
We're just giving you all the parts you need for a whole new universe of your very own.

557
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,260
You want your Venus and we want it now.

558
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,560
We want Saturn and we want it now.

559
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,960
We want Mercury and we want it now.

560
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,020
We want the silence as we want it now.

561
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:57,700
Yes, dear friends, boy, I sure would love to get into the studio and do that up.

562
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:05,940
That's actually just off of videotape pointed at some speakers in a rehearsal room.

563
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,820
Einstein Secret Orchestra rehearsing.

564
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,680
For the big show.

565
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,060
Big show in Cleveland.

566
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,660
Actually, for the big show on X Day and any subsequent shows.

567
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,580
Friends, I'm about to go into the tapes, yes?

568
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:28,940
The tapes of some of the fun little moments and happenings from the 1996 X Day drill.

569
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,420
Which is, and the 97 X Day drill.

570
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,400
These events were held in the same place where we're going to hold our big farewell party.

571
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,120
Goodbye Earth.

572
00:34:42,660 --> 00:35:01,760
And these are just some glimpses back behind the scenes as we try to prepare the audience and ourselves for such things as the breasts of drum and the exposures of the prairie squids.

573
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,640
The uses of the prairie squids right there in public.

574
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,980
It's really pretty perverted.

575
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,380
I've never been in a place like this.

576
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,500
I've been to an X Day drill before.

577
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,660
We've got some pretty scary stuff going on in the woods.

578
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,340
I know we promised free prairie squid to everybody.

579
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,540
As it turned out, we can't offer it free, but it's only 50 cents.

580
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,560
There will be a prairie squid tent.

581
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,580
We'll set it up tomorrow.

582
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,200
I didn't want to set it up today because they get kind of rank after a second day.

583
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,160
Somewhere right in an inappropriate place in the middle of the field, there will be a tent.

584
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,140
There will be a sign up.

585
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,400
The squid will be in there.

586
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,080
There will probably be a long line.

587
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,900
There's a de-beaking tool.

588
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,720
There is a slight charge rental for the de-beaking tool.

589
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,280
That's $100.

590
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,080
No, nothing like that.

591
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,760
It's $900.

592
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,640
Two-hour minimum on the tool.

593
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,160
Put the squid back in the cooler when you're finished with your business.

594
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,760
Have any cases of AIDS come from prairie squids?

595
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,300
Prairie squid, well, you take your risk.

596
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,380
Keep in mind that it's not a problem.

597
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,900
It's a safe sex.

598
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,820
There's a safe sex.

599
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,100
If you all saw that thing, that's a sign of hope, isn't it?

600
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,580
When you drive up to a place and there's a little booth up there, safe sex and something else.

601
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,240
It's condoms, dental bands, gloves, big red straps.

602
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,200
And with naked people behind the booth.

603
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,700
Yeah.

604
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,400
Yeah.

605
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,360
For those of you who have never seen these de-beaking tools,

606
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,660
or seen these before, these are called breasts.

607
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,200
What?

608
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,840
Duh!

609
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,960
Any of you old sub-genius members out there have never seen breasts before today,

610
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,980
except in, of course, pictures and on cable TV.

611
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,080
But these are not one-dimensional.

612
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,100
These are genuine, real breasts.

613
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:56,900
Oh!

614
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,900
Most of you will never see these again after tomorrow.

615
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,560
And your dreams.

616
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,960
So, don't feel shy about staring.

617
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,540
They're like $1, $25 an hour.

618
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,200
Yeah, don't feel so bad about staring at them.

619
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,660
Oh, he loves to be naked.

620
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,480
Now, one thing that I can say about this woman,

621
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,460
that it would set her apart from most sub-geniuses,

622
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,420
is that there's a real good chance that she's going to get to bed down a woman tonight.

623
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,720
Very good.

624
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,540
And how much makes her?

625
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,960
Better than the rest of you.

626
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,020
Keep going!

627
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,180
Keep going!

628
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,600
Keep going!

629
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,880
Yeah!

630
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
You're not getting a raised breast!

631
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,380
Raised breast!

632
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,160
Raised breast!

633
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:58,640


634
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,200
Come on, baby, take a leave.

635
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

636
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,760
I wonder if we ought to...

637
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,160
If we put the squid out today, he's going to be pretty used by tomorrow.

638
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,280
I don't want to have to throw him out before tomorrow

639
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,100
because I think we may unveil the squid on Saturday morning

640
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,980
because the squid is not going to live forever.

641
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,940
Yeah, I've got to figure out what to wear.

642
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,280
I really do have the squid, by the way.

643
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,600
I prefer the mountain squid.

644
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,940
Well, this is a Mississippi Delta squid, which is not the...

645
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,560
They actually smell funny, unlike a mountain squid or a straight prairie squid.

646
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,620
Well, the smell is an aphrodisiac all in itself.

647
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,880
Well, for some people.

648
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,340
No, the smell of a good rotting squid,

649
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,080
inflamed squid, and a good little squid.

650
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,160
It just rams your pheromones all the way down.

651
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,020
It would twist up your DNA helix like an old mangled twist tie

652
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,520
if you're not careful, but the trip's an E-ticket.

653
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,180
Yeah.

654
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,700
So which night should I get naked, Doug?

655
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,160
Huh?

656
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,720
Which night should I get naked?

657
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,080
Saturday.

658
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,800
Saturday.

659
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,940
Saturday night.

660
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,360
Okay, so I don't get the squid on my bustier.

661
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,120
We're going to rape Bob.

662
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,260
Jesus is going to nail him to the cross.

663
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,840
The devil girl for Sunday morning.

664
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,000
There may be violence.

665
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,060
Some of y'all might have got it.

666
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,640
A little bit of blood splashed on you,

667
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,400
but not as much as you're going to have then.

668
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,900
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

669
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,620
We're living in an age where you will see the corpse of the old world

670
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,740
and the broken bones of time.

671
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,500
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

672
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,880
Oh, yeah.

673
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,960
You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

674
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,560
All you got to do is follow the smoke.

675
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,040
Oh, yeah, because that smoke's going to lead you right back

676
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,080
to JRBob.com.

677
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,200
Oh, yeah.

678
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,620
Oh, yeah.

679
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,660
The conspiracy's against you, brothers.

680
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,780
The conspiracy's against you, sisters.

681
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,200
Oh, yeah.

682
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,560
They want you to play the game.

683
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,320
They want you to cut your hair.

684
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,840
They want you to get a job.

685
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,020
They want you to behave.

686
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,680
They want you to obey.

687
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,160
They want you to die.

688
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,080
Oh, yeah.

689
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,900
Oh, yeah, brothers and sisters.

690
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,140
Oh, yeah.

691
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,120
The Earth's going 90 miles an hour down a dead end street,

692
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,180
brothers and sisters.

693
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,100
90 miles an hour down a dead end street.

694
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,580
And Bob is just ahead.

695
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, that's one way to put it.

696
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,180
You thought you had a little fun with that Bob thing, didn't you?

697
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,400
Oh, I'll just get some extra slack.

698
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,180
Oh, why, hell, it's just a joke.

699
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,080
Oh, yeah.

700
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,080


701
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,180
I'll just get some extra slack.

702
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,760
Oh, yeah.

703
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,100
Oh, just a funny joke, boys and girls.

704
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,860
.

705
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,800
.

706
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:08,800


707
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,000
More, more, more.

708
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:10,520


709
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,000
.

710
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,000


711
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,480
And I will never escape the eye.

712
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:14,980
.

713
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,500
.

714
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:16,740
.

715
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,140
.

716
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,380
.

717
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,980
.

718
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,000
.

719
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,100
.

720
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,180
.

721
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,860
And so there is an agent here.

722
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,680
We know it.

723
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,080
We don't know which federal agency.

724
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,860
It might even be bigger than federal.

725
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,420
.

726
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,640
.

727
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,480
a circle of ten should be...

728
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,480


729
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,960
I flew a black helicopter once.

730
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,740
Does that make me an elephant?

731
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,740
No, hell no.

732
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,660
Oh, sorry.

733
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,180
See, he could be the one

734
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,260
just trying to act like he's joking about it,

735
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,060
which would be...

736
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,720
That would be a good way to be a spy, you know?

737
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,220
So there's...

738
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,020
We just...

739
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,480
Well, we don't want to panic people

740
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,020
or, you know, get everybody worried

741
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,100
or anything like that.

742
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,900
But just keep your eyes open.

743
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,340
If you see anything that somebody doing something

744
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,100
that you think is suspicious,

745
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,660
tell me or Dr. Legume or the Lord.

746
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,440
You all know that at some point during the weekend,

747
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,100
ten people in here are going to die.

748
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,840
Cool.

749
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,320
Pray.

750
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,240
Me, me, me, me.

751
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,140
So you are one of them.

752
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,140
Legume now points out Jesus.

753
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,060
You stand accused, brother.

754
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,240
You stand accused of being Jesus.

755
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,040
And there's only one way I know of

756
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,920
that I could possibly...

757
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,660
could possibly deal with a man such as yourself.

758
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,080
Crucify him!

759
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,920
Crucify him!

760
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,320
Crucify him!

761
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,560
Crucify him!

762
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,340
Crucify him!

763
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,180
Crucify him!

764
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,320
Crucify him!

765
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
Crucify him!

766
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:38,440
Crucify him!

767
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,220
Jesus is now giving the cross piece of the cross.

768
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,360
Grab that board!

769
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,100
Pope Fred!

770
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,340
You, your cross piece, brother,

771
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,020
you're getting dragged to the Golgotha!

772
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,940
Crucify!

773
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,180
Crucify!

774
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,300
Crucify!

775
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,380
Crucify!

776
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,380
Pray to Jesus, everybody.

777
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:58,880
Amen!

778
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,300
Amen!

779
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:00,440
Amen!

780
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:00,660
Amen!

781
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,080
Amen!

782
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,240
Amen!

783
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,640
Oh yeah, it's all just a drill.

784
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,640
But next time, it could be real.

785
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,420
They don't know their doom.

786
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,100
They're all trying to put up some token resistance.

787
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,940
But what if before July 5th, 1998,

788
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,500
the ATF were to swoop down and snatch up the poor public faith to the church?

789
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:33,160
How many of you out there will be burning your subgenius membership cards

790
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,340
when you see Reverend Stang or myself or Jesus hanging on the cross?

791
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,260
Hell no!

792
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,560
Will you be buying your time?

793
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,140
Not me!

794
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,340
Will you be taking up your shotguns to evade us?

795
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:46,980
Yes!

796
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,960
Or will you merely commit suicide and join us in subgenius hell?

797
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:56,480
Yes!

798
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,160
Yes, brothers and sisters!

799
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,980
Mankind does not know it yet,

800
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,560
but time is a horny cellmate waiting for us to fall asleep.

801
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,660
Oh yes, and brothers and sisters,

802
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,580
your subgenius membership card is like a homemade knife

803
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,680
to smuggle out from under your mattress.

804
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,020
Oh yes, oh yes, and when time comes around,

805
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,480
looking for a little love at your expense,

806
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,200
you will be able to defend yourself against it.

807
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,240
You will be able to wield your subgenius membership card

808
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,720
like a flaming sword, like a smuggled knife,

809
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,560
like a gun made of soap at the very least.

810
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,840
Oh yes, brothers and sisters, time.

811
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,920
They say that time flies by.

812
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,960
Boy, the weekend flew by.

813
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,320
Time just flies by.

814
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,520
Shoot it out of the air!

815
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:55,980
You'll be okay.

816
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,660
Time does not fly by.

817
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,160
Time flies away.

818
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,940
Yes, brothers and sisters, and time is running out for them.

819
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,580
Today, we meet on this campground,

820
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,660
and we'll have a little fun.

821
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
A little fun.

822
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,040
But two years from now,

823
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,220
you better have the stomach for the sight of blood.

824
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,160
What is it?

825
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,560
What is it?

826
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,140
What is it?

827
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,700
What is it?

828
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,300
What is it?

829
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,580
What is it?

830
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:25,960
What is it?

831
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:25,960


832
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:25,960


833
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,000
What is it?

834
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,000


835
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,000


836
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,180
Oh, yes, give me that primetime religion, friends.

837
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,300
Oh, seekers, yes.

838
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,940
It's good enough for me.

839
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,840
Praise Bob!

840
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,420
Yeah!

841
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:44,480
Well, welcome to the A.B. Semplevix Slack Four Square Tempeltown Bible and Cat Amputation Center.

842
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,740
And Bob's jack shack back on Highway 69 on the way into town as our big sponsor.

843
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,300
So we'll try to stop there on the way back, okay?

844
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,760
Oh yeah, welcome.

845
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:55,940
Come on.

846
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,140
from Seekers to the X-Day drill.

847
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,680
We're just tingling Oregon energy.

848
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,060
We can feel the Xs coming up over the horizon.

849
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,460
And it's a good feeling because Bob's in the mood

850
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,100
for a second coming and a third coming

851
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,180
and a fourth coming because X-Day is on the way.

852
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,820
Oh yeah, you can laugh about it right now,

853
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,700
but it's just too short, you're Seekers,

854
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,280
and what are you gonna do then?

855
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,880
What are you gonna do when the Krypton lasers

856
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,880
are slashing the skies overhead?

857
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,460
Where are you gonna plug your laptops in then?

858
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,580
Ha ha ha!

859
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,560
What?

860
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,280
I've done a little bit of thinking about it.

861
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,680
Oh, and I figure the best way to do it

862
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,940
is to take that despair, take that despair and fold it.

863
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,900
Double it back upon itself, fold it like origami

864
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,860
into a googolplex of slack.

865
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,140
Slack-sense tree.

866
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a break

867
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,760
from JR Bob dogs.

868
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,200
Yes, yes.

869
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,460
Oh, they may have burned his body,

870
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,800
but they didn't burn his baby, I mean.

871
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,420
I mean, they can't burn his dream.

872
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,340
And as wet as that dream is,

873
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,860
we've gotta follow it, Seekers.

874
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,820
We've gotta follow it every step of the way.

875
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,500
And that's, basically it.

876
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,860
We're gonna follow it every step of the way.

877
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,360
We're not selfish, like a forest scent.

878
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,360


879
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,220
What is that?

880
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,360
You know there's something common

881
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,460
I remember when I went to town I used to say,

882
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:35,460


883
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:35,540
and everything is connected with numbers.

884
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,180


885
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:45,120
I had toено- Nacho was also.

886
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:45,880
Achoo!

887
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:47,360
Gotcha.

888
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,360


889
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,360


890
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,440
Oh boy.

891
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,180
Dude.

892
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,740
from anarchy.

893
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,780
We're here to make sure

894
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,440
that those two hot meals

895
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
are just the cooling remains

896
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,380
of their neighbors.

897
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,280
Can I get an amen?

898
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,060
Amen!

899
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,080
Can I get a hallelujah?

900
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,740
Can I get a praise bomb?

901
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,620
Brothers and sisters,

902
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,620
let's hear some noise!

903
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,460
Amen!

904
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,440
Amen!

905
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,520
Brothers and sisters!

906
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,100
You feel better

907
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,480
if you've got anything else

908
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,060
but your leave.

909
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,520
How are you going to know

910
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,440
that you're saved,

911
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,480
brothers and sisters?

912
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,240
I'm sure.

913
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,420
Sure you're saved,

914
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,060
but you've got two years

915
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,180
to work up your hate

916
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,220
for the normals.

917
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,400
This place here,

918
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:52,960
you can feel

919
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,580
the love in it.

920
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,120
We will cleanse

921
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,860
this place of that love.

922
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,940
Oh, sure.

923
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,060
Oh, sure.

924
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,360
The normals,

925
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,280
the pinks,

926
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,060
they have their petty hatreds.

927
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,880
I don't like the man

928
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,440
in that store

929
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,820
because he's Jewish.

930
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,880
I don't like

931
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,620
the people

932
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,500
that just moved in

933
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,520
because they're black

934
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,020
and they'll run

935
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,420
the property values down.

936
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,920
I don't like those people.

937
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,840
They just look funny.

938
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,660
I don't like those people

939
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,260
because they park

940
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:22,920
in my space.

941
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,620
I hate them.

942
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,580
I hate them.

943
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,160
Oh, I'd like to kill that guy

944
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,660
coming into my neighborhood.

945
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,640
Oh, yeah, the conspiracy

946
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,560
will try to hide it.

947
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,740
I'm sure pretty soon

948
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,380
Walt Disney,

949
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:33,960
with their incredible

950
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,680
knack for changing history,

951
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,440
will be making that movie soon,

952
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,360
you know, the one about

953
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,500
the poor people in Africa,

954
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,640
the fact they achieved

955
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,520
the lifelong dream

956
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,300
of coming on over

957
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,760
to America,

958
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,220
they've got.

959
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,260
Yeah, and Disney will be

960
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,140
selling the action figures.

961
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:49,500
You can get them

962
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,060
at Burger King

963
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,640
and all that stuff.

964
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,840
They'll be out there

965
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,580
singing and dancing.

966
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:52,940
I don't like that.

967
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:52,940


968
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:52,940


969
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,180
And somebody, of course,

970
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,980
Don't real life

971
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,980
somebody who could hate

972
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,200
somebody, OK,

973
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,120
then somebody should hate

974
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,480

975
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,640

977
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,320
Too, because you're

978
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,060

00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:04,820
Gonna ufz got

980
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,420
a funny haircut.

981
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,180
Oh, yeah.

982
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,220
That would be

983
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,140
worth hate you want

984
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,540
to make all those

985
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,100
movie that kind of

986
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,320
井

987
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,840
Hey, I say I.

988
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,380
Oh yeah.

989
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,580
We sends the paper

990
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,640
that legislates pocket

991
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,020
great.

992
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,220
Huh?

993
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:22,940
Who would be

994
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,820
You're the man who signs that paper to legislate hate.

995
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,080
President Biden!

996
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,560
Piss off! Piss off, little haters.

997
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,160
But what can we expect from them brothers and sisters?

998
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,680
I hate you!

999
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,620
They're only human.

1000
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,640
Amen!

1001
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,460
Rainbow! Rainbow!

1002
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,560
Now it's time to pour the structure

1003
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,180
We can't be mad

1004
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,120
Mama, may I lower?

1005
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,420
This is Major Bob's in ground control

1006
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,680
I don't think so

1007
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,820
Ah, I will read from the minutes of the last meeting.

1008
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,000
And these are very soggy minutes, so stick with me.

1009
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,740
Because I'm here in the name of sin to tell you to get right with Bob!

1010
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,540
Now some of you may be thinking,

1011
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,880
Who is this Bob guy anyway?

1012
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,140
I'm here to tell you that he is the super salesman of your slack.

1013
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,240
The conspiracy has bought and sold you and distributed you in little styrofoam cartons

1014
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,760
And Bob is here to help you break through that lack.

1015
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,140
And get the hell out.

1016
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,540
Oh yes, when this mighty Yeti overman came along with eyes as bright as blaze

1017
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,420
To kick ass across the cosmos on the supersonic Nazi hell creatures,

1018
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,440
He came for us.

1019
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,960
And he came again.

1020
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,240
And again.

1021
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:50,860
And again.

1022
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,020
And again.

1023
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,700
And again.

1024
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,520
And again.

1025
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,160
And again.

1026
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,280
Oh Bob.

1027
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,200
And I kind of lost count at that point because I blacked out.

1028
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,140
Oh, I'm sure you remember that night.

1029
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,340
Woke up in a puddle of slack.

1030
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,820
And you knew that Bob had been there.

1031
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,780
You know, you've got a choice here.

1032
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,680
You can either accept Bob as the savior of your slack.

1033
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,060
Or don't come crying to me when the saucers are so close that the heat rays are welding

1034
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,220
your damn butt cheeks shut.

1035
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,780
Because it's not my damn problem.

1036
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,580
It's nothing to me if you have slack.

1037
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,180
Or you.

1038
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,540
You make your own slack.

1039
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,560
But we are all here to give you something to slack off to.

1040
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,660
We're here to provide that divine inspiration for power.

1041
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,920
Perspiration for your justpiration.

1042
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,340
Ah.

1043
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,700
Bob is there.

1044
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,040
He's got a nice warm leg to hump.

1045
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,260
Oh.

1046
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,220
Make good friends with Bob today.

1047
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,440
We were inside the sun.

1048
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,340
The sun will be ours.

1049
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,080
We will be with you for life.

1050
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,500
Earth will be made like a mill

1051
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,140
For we shall own the sun

1052
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,540
We want Saturn and we want it now

1053
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,940
We want Saturn and we want it now

1054
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,920
We want Mars and we want it now

1055
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,380
We want Venus and we want it now

1056
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,520
We want Saturn and we want it now

1057
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,820
Hydrogen reactions cheap

1058
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,940
Get your hydrogen atoms here

1059
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,880
Ten billion year old carbon

1060
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,440
Dinosaur shit

1061
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,180
You're made of dinosaur shit

1062
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,820
But the men of the future will be made from your shit

1063
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,600
Hey, how does Bob

1064
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,340
You're made of the old ashes

1065
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:21,580
From stars that long ago went dead

1066
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,040
If everything was God

1067
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,800
Everything comes apart one way or another

1068
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,860
Bob said

1069
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,120
You better be glad of that

1070
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,320
He used to take those words and smoke it

1071
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,420
He used to say

1072
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,480
What happens when the ashes rise

1073
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,960
Like a mighty phoenix

1074
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,040
Friends, join the church

1075
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,140
Build yourself a noose

1076
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,900
Build your own spaceship

1077
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,540
Build your own spaceship

1078
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,960
Stick it in your pipe

1079
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,020
Smoke it

1080
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,060
Blast off

1081
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,220
Don't be scared

1082
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,820
You can find out

1083
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,120
Go on, man

1084
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,060
Everyone's gonna die

1085
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,300
You're gonna die

1086
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,960
We want the cosmos and we want it now

1087
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,380
We want the universe as we want it now

1088
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,720
We want the cosmos and we want it now

1089
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,820
We want the cosmos and we want it now

1090
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,860
What is the law?

1091
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,600
The subgenius must have slack

1092
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,060
That is the law

1093
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,720
We are not men

1094
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,360
We are not men

1095
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,800
We want to cause more life

1096
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,040
To claw the bark of trees

1097
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,240
That is the law

1098
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,060
We are not men

1099
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,380
To snuffle up our drink from the street

1100
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,220
That is the law

1101
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,700
To hold on

1102
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,020
To hold on four legs and run

1103
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,900
Run free

1104
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,000
Four legs and run

1105
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,860
Run free

1106
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,960
Four legs and run

1107
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,280
Run free

1108
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,900
Four legs and run

1109
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
We are not men!

1110
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,920
We are not men!

1111
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,540
We are not men!

1112
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,340
We are not men!

1113
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,340
To spill blood!

1114
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,000
That is the law!

1115
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,180
We are not men!

1116
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,460
Praise Bob!

1117
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:22,860
Bob!

1118
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,840
83D Square!

1119
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,360
Let's jam a Yeti dance.

1120
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,460
Are we going to do the wedding here?

1121
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,360
Let's do the wedding.

1122
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,440
Well, actually,

1123
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,240
we can do the wedding in a very fast way.

1124
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,760
In a very high speed.

1125
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,340
Anybody want to get married?

1126
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,700
By the authority invested in me

1127
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,080
by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1128
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,600
uh, by Brandon Stimpy,

1129
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,540
the Three Stooges,

1130
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,380
and all the dead great rock stars,

1131
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,700
comedians, strippers,

1132
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,160
you're all now married to each other

1133
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,280
and to these

1134
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,160
same squid,

1135
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,560
which,

1136
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,120
and these bats,

1137
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,420
and these goldfish bats,

1138
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,820
and back home, your goldfish, your little dog.

1139
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,100
I have married my

1140
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,360
faithful prairie squid.

1141
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,300
Friends, you know

1142
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,840
subgeniuses, like,

1143
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,880
we take our cue from Bob,

1144
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,620
and love all animals,

1145
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,800
physically love all

1146
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,860
the animals of the globe.

1147
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,940
We love nature. We would

1148
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,280
love, physically love a cactus,

1149
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,380
a prickly pear,

1150
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,560
were it, did it not hurt so much.

1151
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,620
And there are probably some subgeniuses

1152
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,300
who do anyway.

1153
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,120
I did make love to a cactus when I lived in

1154
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,960
Phoenix, Arizona.

1155
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,200
Some of you

1156
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,060
may have taken

1157
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,360
too much and actually

1158
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,220
had knowledge,

1159
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,080
biblical knowledge of

1160
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,060
a large cactus.

1161
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,860
And, but who

1162
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,480
among ye has not

1163
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,720
lain with that

1164
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,940
friendly

1165
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,100
beacon of the lost,

1166
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,380
that cephalopod that crawls

1167
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,940
across our nation's prairies?

1168
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,640
The prairie squid.

1169
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,000
And friends, there is a vision,

1170
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,080
Bob had a vision of a

1171
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,740
a little rain

1172
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,700
of prairie squids.

1173
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,940
Billions of prairie squids.

1174
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,000
And friends, we weren't able to provide

1175
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,060
billions, but who did

1176
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,960
provide, Bob provided

1177
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,080
one prairie squid for each day

1178
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,660
and until next day.

1179
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,060
One prairie squid per day

1180
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,880
for you to de-meet

1181
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,540
and use as you see fit.

1182
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,320
And the song is in our

1183
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,100
official, official

1184
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,720
Bob's Prairie Squids.

1185
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,140
One,

1186
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:40,820
two,

1187
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,260
one, two, one, two,

1188
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:44,920
three, four,

1189
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,780
83-D squid.

1190
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,960
Yes, dear friends, and as the hard to hear

1191
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,920
lyrics of 83-D

1192
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,660
squids

1193
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,680
melts away in the background,

1194
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,560
friends, I'm going to give that post office box

1195

one last time. This is your last

1196
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,080
chance probably to

00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,200


1226
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,180
best

1227
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,300
And the queen is here!

1228
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,040
Got a testicle!

1229
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,440
Oh, a testicle!

1230
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,640
Oh, a testicle!

1231
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:03,820


1232
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,580
Oh, look at this!

1233
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,660
I ate it!

1234
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,520
Oh, a tanker!

1235
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:06,840
Oh, a tanker!

1236
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,880
Oh, a tanker!

1237
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,640
Oh, a tanker, a tanker!

1238
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,280
Oh, that's a...

1239
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,740
Oh, look at it!

1240
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,020
Oh, look at it!

1241
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,320
It's such a hot stuff!

1242
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,620
Oh, the birds!

1243
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,220
They give them a little warmth!

1244
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,480
Everywhere, testicles!

1245
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,160
Oh, there's nothing.

1246
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,100
Oh, never see anything good.

1247
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,160
Oh, it's clean, baby!

1248
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,040
Oh, oh!

1249
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,640
It's going to make me fast!

1250
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,260
Bob will be angry!

1251
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,580
I'm the great, the identical cloak.

1252
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,880
The witty god versus the greedy god.

1253
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,540
So if you're ever out in your own,

1254
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,560
things look good right now.

1255
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,640
When you see some hairy pink snow,

1256
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,180
you may pull it down on us.

1257
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,320
Sure, it's kind of a stretch.

1258
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,920
Coming down from the sky,

1259
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,940
just pull your little drum inside.

1260
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,160
Far-fetched squid is the best, best, best.

1261
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,020
And you so dearly enjoy the ride of life.

1262
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,680
Here we go.

1263
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,200
Pretty, pretty squid falling from the sky.

1264
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,940
Pretty, pretty squid.

1265
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,020
Look at the edges.

1266
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,960
Pretty, pretty squid.

1267
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,500
You'll have it coming around.

1268
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,160
Pretty, pretty squid.

1269
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,240
Now, let's fly.

1270
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:16,740
Get low.

1271
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,800
Pretty, pretty squid falling from the sky.

1272
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,780
Pretty, pretty squid.

1273
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,900
We can't just wait.
