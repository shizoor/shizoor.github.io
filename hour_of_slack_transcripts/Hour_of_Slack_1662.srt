1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
Bob?

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,980
Ah, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,120
It's rerun time again.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,040
Suzy the Floozies.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,840
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number 51 from 1994.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,380
Praise Suzy the Floozy and W-R-E-K in Atlanta.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,240
Praise Bob.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:28,160
B-O-B-O-B

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Let the joy jump in the good times roll.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,360
Let the pleasure pop.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,600
Now let's take a stroll.

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,520
Light up.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,300
Let's all get mellow.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,020
Light up.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,580
Get smoke in your eyes.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,460
Light up.

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,040
Get hip, I say, fellas.

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,920
Light up.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,540
Hey, what is this joy?

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,380
Light up.

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,900
Let's all get ready.

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,820
Light up.

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,440
I know how you feel.

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,280
Light up.

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,660
Now don't be afraid.

26
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,320
You'll find what I mean in any old field.

27
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,040
Pop.

28
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,540
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,300
Eight, nine, ten, and then eleven.

30
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,040
Light up.

31
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,720
Now get your dig going.

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,540
Lame up.

33
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm saying that's the thing.

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,940
Light up.

35
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,620
Don't let that man get you.

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,980
Just pop on your cig and blow the smoke, man.

37
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,920
Light up.

38
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,720
I may not change my underwear,

39
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,060
but I'm changing.

40
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm changing my ways.

41
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,780
Oh, there hasn't been a whole lot of Bob

42
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,800
in the slack time funhouse lately.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,800
But now it's battle stations

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,140
and full speed ahead slack.

45
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,700
Ooh, with the size tension in the air.

46
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,200
Whew.

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,520
God, it's the reek of future death

48
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,340
zooming down on us.

49
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,680
This isn't the time to be lulled into warm complacency.

50
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,440
Oh, the end times have checked in

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,480
and they've left an early wake-up call.

52
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,080
What is it?

53
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,080
What will it take to convince you

54
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
of the signs of the end times anyway?

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:03,580
Oh.

56
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,220
The Republican Party

57
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,380
and the zombie Jesus slaves

58
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,300
of the Christian radical right

59
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,140
of seize power in a bloody coup,

60
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,640
which you did little or nothing to prevent.

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,860
Oh, think you'll be able to hang on

62
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,360
to your precious slack now?

63
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,360
You don't have enough slack to go around now.

64
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,020
And they're going to take

65
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,700
even that little bit away.

66
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,020
Good luck.

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,320
Name me one friend you've got left, he said.

68
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,360
Bob, I said.

69
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,400
This was the only lifer in the prison,

70
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,440
the only American to have been convicted of treason

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,240
during the Korean War.

72
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,000
He was the chief clerk in the supply room

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
where I would soon be given my civilian clothes.

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
He was a science fiction writer of some note,

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,640
publishing many stories a year under various pseudonyms,

76
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,800
including Frank X. Barlow and Kilgore Trout.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,880
Somebody said, oh, Mr. 666 is way off in the future.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,940
No, my dear friend, he's been around a while.

79
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,140
And he's here tonight.

80
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,260
He's here tonight on the face of this earth.

81
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,040
And all the world is wondering after him.

82
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,140
And that's why this subject is so important.

83
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,840
The deceptions are all around us.

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,780
Deceptions are saying it's off in the future.

85
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,420
It's off in the future.

86
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,320
Don't worry about it.

87
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,020
Friends, we better start worrying about it.

88
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,260
And friends, there are some things taking place around us

89
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,000
that's going to come down very, very soon.

90
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Are you ready for it?

91
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Are you ready for it?

92
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,740
I tell you, we're living in serious time.

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,260
Look at the sign.

94
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,180
Before, basic food groups had been replaced with a pyramid.

95
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,480
Isn't that enough to tip you off?

96
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
Look at the signs.

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,260
The new Blue Star Ointment commercial no longer mentions Tether.

98
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,340
I don't even know what Tether is.

99
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,260
And they took it away from me.

100
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,740
Look at the signs.

101
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,520
We think we're okay in our little shells, minding our own business,

102
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,380
standing on the corner of walk and don't walk.

103
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,760
But, Seekers, it's time to run.

104
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,780
Quick.

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
It's not too late.

106
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,480
We got to get some Bob into us.

107
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,460
We got to get some Bob into us.

108
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,160
Bad.

109
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,880
Oh, even if it hurts.

110
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,520
Oh, it will.

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,060
It will.

112
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,960
Oh, it's time to read some beads until it bleeds.

113
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,160
The only sensitivity I care about is nerve endings.

114
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,760
Are you yeti enough to test yours?

115
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,880
So welcome, friends, to Reverend Commandant Susie Der Flusie's Boot Camp for Bob.

116
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,900
Today is the first day of your last hurrah.

117
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,640
Hey, you, pink boy.

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,220
Drop and give me 20, mister.

119
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,300
The rest of you, you'll have to suffer through these Bob songs.

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,660
And don't think you're getting off easy.

121
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,000
The hell is just beginning.

122
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,660
She says things I would not dare to articulate.

123
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,700
But I'll simply say this.

124
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,980
If that is true, why so many of them get injured in the very act?

125
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,340
Why are some of them killed in the act?

126
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,340
And why do so many of them have to have colostomies?

127
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,020
Good times.

128
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,420
You! You're one of us!

129
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,260
Maybe you're one.

130
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,760
Something to be outright laughed at.

131
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,020
I heard someone over here say who's been the most effective evangelist the last 20 years.

132
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,700
His name is Bob.

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,040
And while... Listen, listen, wait. Listen, look at me.

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,580
Listen, wait, wait, wait.

135
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,320
While he entertains you, he indoctrinates you.

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
While he entertains you, he gets through to you.

137
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,960
While you laugh, you begin to laugh.

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,800
You lose automatically.

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,140
I met Bob when he came in the door, when I came in the door to service today.

140
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,000
And Bob was formerly bound by the powers of darkness to a terrible degree.

141
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,860
Oh, whatever.

142
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,320
He says he gets a funny feeling down inside when he sees the Boy Scouts and the YMCA.

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,180
Thank you. Thank you very much.

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,160
And they were doing these crazy things.

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,040
Of course, that's just the start.

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880
Thank goodness that, you know, nobody I knew was there because I thought,

147
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm never going to another one of these as long as I live.

148
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,900
I mean, you know, and he was a little nervous too when they grabbed his hand.

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,920
You know, it was like, this is not what we're used to.

150
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,680
What we learned a long time ago is that you become what the people you associate with.

151
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,200
And so he started associating with people in this business.

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
And I began to see the changes.

153
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,320
You know, Bobby was a good person and a good guy, but I started seeing the change of staying away from the people that he was hanging around with

154
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,700
and looking forward to the future.

155
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,460
And so I started getting a glimpse of what this business had to offer.

156
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,720
So will all you goonie birds answering this description please stand up?

157
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,280
You misfits in this brave new age.

158
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,280
You dismally disorganized, improperly apologetic ghosts of the past.

159
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,940
Stand up. Stand up and stand up.

160
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,420
And be counted.

161
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,720
Stand up. Stand up.

162
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,720
Stand up. Stand up.

163
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,960
And now it's time to bring up the headliner of the evening.

164
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,200
A very special gentleman.

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,940
Please welcome to the stage Bobby.

166
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,200
Bob!

167
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:42,600
Last night my baby wanted to talk to me about art.

168
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,860
But I said no.

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,820
No.

170
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,940
Let's just close our eyes and watch.

171
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,720
Bob!

172
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,480
Hi Bob!

173
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,800
I like to get mail of course, but for some reason I get the strangest kind of mail.

174
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,360
And these are all real letters I'm reading you.

175
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,780
Every one I assure you has come in in the mail from someone I don't know.

176
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,320
To give you an idea of what the people think of the show and what they like to say in their communications.

177
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
Dear Bob, before I tuned in your program I could never get my husband out of bed in the morning.

178
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,200
Now he can't get out of the house fast enough.

179
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,780
Why don't you give up?

180
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,340
Why can't you act like normal people?

181
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,480
Why don't you stop whistling?

182
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,380
Why don't you stop acting like a moron?

183
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Or maybe you aren't acting.

184
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,420
Yes!

185
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
That's all I'm taking from you.

186
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
Get back here you jackal!

187
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,300
He's gone!

188
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:32,940
He's gone!

189
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,600
He's gone!

190
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,700
Find him!

191
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,460
Find him!

192
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,040
Find him!

193
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,080
Find him!

194
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,380
Find him!

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,360
Oh yeah.

196
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,780
That old slack magic has me in its spell.

197
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,080
Oh yeah.

198
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,320
That old slack magic has me in its spell.

199
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,320


200
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,320


201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,320


202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,400
Oh it's hard sometimes.

203
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,640
Howling and bumping and grinding in the radio wilderness.

204
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,720
Trying to sew my little seeds of slack with hundreds of sweaty strangers in the dark.

205
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,860
Oh while the city sleeps around I'm lighting up your dials with the power of Bob.

206
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,680
When I tell people I have a show called Bob's Slacktime Funhouse they often say,

207
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,360
Who's Bob?

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,960
Well that certainly separates a wheat from the chaff now, doesn't it?

209
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,340
Oh I like to think that you all know Bob.

210
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,640
At least those of you who matter.

211
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,700
But don't fool yourself into thinking that that puts you any higher up in the food web

212
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,560
because of it.

213
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,740
Oh yeah.

214
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,880
Here at the Funhouse it seems like we've lost our grip on Bob.

215
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,960
We gotta latch onto his pipe and pull him down off the ceiling and bump his stomach

216
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,340
and get him out of the house.

217
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,080
And get him into fight and trim because he's our only hope.

218
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,340
Oh.

219
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,660
I want you to get to know Bob personally.

220
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,940
If you don't already.

221
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,080
Those of you who don't know Bob,

222
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,000
my heart sings like the prairie squid in rutting season for you at the joy you're about to experience.

223
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,620
Oh and those of you who have forgotten Bob,

224
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,280
Fie!

225
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,140
Fie upon thee!

226
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,080
Wake up!

227
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,380
It's time to cover your ass, kids.

228
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,040
Don't be a pink boy.

229
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,760
Pinks are like sponges that don't work.

230
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,680
You.

231
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,560
You subgenius tods.

232
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:29,820
Yeah.

233
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,560
You, on the other hand,

234
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,440
soak in this.

235
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,800
I want to give you a close encounter with Bob and his amazing life.

236
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,860
His precocious youth.

237
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,800
His early careers in sports and salesmanship.

238
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,220
And his hot, hot linkage with Connie, his first and primary wife.

239
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,640
And all through the wonders of our patented sub-g-liminal hypnognostic brain ventilating system.

240
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,820
I want you to take the fronts off of your speaker seekers.

241
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,340
There.

242
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,940
Yeah, now put your head in the speaker cone.

243
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,940
No, no, no, not that one.

244
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,660
The big one.

245
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,300
Yeah.

246
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,900
Okay, reach over.

247
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,720
Yeah, you can still barely reach.

248
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,440
Now turn that dial up to 11.

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,480
Or lethal, if you have it.

250
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,640
And I want you to feel the slack pouring over you like drug tapping.

251
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,660
Saturating you with pure Bob land.

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,680
Meanwhile, I'll just notch up your pain meters a little bit.

253
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,140
Once upon a time, there was Bobby.

254
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
Bobby was a boy who drank milk.

255
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,240
He drank milk in the morning.

256
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,260
He drank milk at noon.

257
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,760
He drank milk before he went to bed.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,100
And where do you think all that milk came from?

259
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,160
Well, that milk had a long journey.

260
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,040
For once upon a time, there was Bobby.

261
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
And once upon a time, there also was...

262
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,960
Do you hear them?

263
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,580
Yes.

264
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,800
Yes, there also were five cows.

265
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,120
Five cows.

266
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
Five cows.

267
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,820
They didn't like to wait, but came and moved at the farmer's gate.

268
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,680
Five big cows.

269
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,540
The farmer came when he heard them call and led each one into her stall.

270
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,200
Now I must milk them one and all to get the milk for Bobby.

271
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,380
The five cows were Daisy and Squirrel and Queen and Lady and Buttercup.

272
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,420
When they were in the barn, the farmer took his stool and big pail and sat down to milk.

273
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,880
Squirt, squirt, the milk poured into the pail.

274
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,720
And when the five cows had given all their milk, the farmer let the cows wander out of the barn and into the pasture again.

275
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,120
There they ate the green grass and forgot all about the milk.

276
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,580
But the milk had only just begun its journey.

277
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,580
For once upon a time, there was Bobby.

278
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,040
And once upon a time, there also was...

279
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,820
Do you hear it?

280
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,380
Yes, there also was a wagon.

281
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,700
A wagon with a horse and rubber shoes.

282
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,140
It clapped each time he started, each time he stopped.

283
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,920
A milk wagon!

284
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,820
And the milkman said,

285
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,720
My work is done before most other work's begun.

286
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,400
From house to house I hurry on to bring the milk to Bobby.

287
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,580
The milk wagon came down the street until it stopped at Bobby's house.

288
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,380
The driver jumped out and put down the bottles Bobby's mother had ordered.

289
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,620
Then he drove away and forgot all about the milk.

290
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,600
But the milk still went on with its journey.

291
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,420
For after the milkman went away, Johnny's mother ran downstairs and opened the door.

292
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,720
There stood the milk bottles.

293
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,660
The milk from the cows who couldn't wait, but said moo moo at the farmer's gate.

294
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,220
The milk in the truck that couldn't stand still, but went a-hawking down the hill.

295
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,760
The milk on the train that carried the freight, and clickety-clackety couldn't be late.

296
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,340
The milk where the factory whistle blew, and said, now there is work to do.

297
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,120
The milk that went where the horse clipped flop, each time he started, each time he stopped.

298
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,140
The milk from a bottle that opened up, and mother poured into Bobby's cup.

299
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,220
Don't call me Bobby.

300
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,680
The milk slipped and fell.

301
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,020
The milk slid down Bobby's throat.

302
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,400
And so, turned into Bobby.

303
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,400
And so at last, the milk ended its long, long journey.

304
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,060
Your commentator was privileged to visit Space Platform 7 last week.

305
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,040
And before Cadet Bobby and Cadet Betty went into pre-lunar medical quarantine, I interviewed them.

306
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,680
These telememory tapes will introduce you to the new technology.

307
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,900
And I will tell you what they do to these two exceptional youngsters.

308
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,580
Cadet Bobby.

309
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,040
Don't call me Bobby.

310
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,940
Bob, are you and Betty worried at all about your lunar adventure?

311
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,820
Not really, Doctor.

312
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,060
We've been thoroughly checked out on our space shuttle craft.

313
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,360
And of course, adults have made thousands of such trips.

314
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,660
After all these years of training, I suppose it's really a great thrill.

315
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,120
It certainly is.

316
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,660
But, I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do it.

317
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


318
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


319
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


320
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


321
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


322
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


323
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


324
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


325
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


326
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


327
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


328
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


329
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


330
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,660


331
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,600
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.

332
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,300
Bob, where have you trained?

333
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,840
Well, I had calculus and logarithms in elementary school in Washington, USA.

334
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,180
Then I spent one year in the Space Flight Center at Houston, USA.

335
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,400
Another year in Moscow on advanced power and propulsion systems.

336
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,300
Six months in England at the Academy of Celestial Navigation.

337
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,760
And then back to Houston for advanced computer technology.

338
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,780
I had just about the same program.

339
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,660
Except for one thing.

340
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,820
I was not prepared for the fuels and propulsion.

341
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,540
The girls just don't seem to take to the engineering courses.

342
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:52,580
Well, you kids have spent six months here, 50,000 miles from Earth, on Space Station

343
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,240
Number 7.

344
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,400
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

345
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,420
Goodbye.

346
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,540
And thanks to all of you.

347
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,580
Goodbye.

348
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,480
And thanks to all of you.

349
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,140
I think it was just a matter of time.

350
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,120
After all, when we were growing up, Bob had a huge supply of Playboys underneath his bed.

351
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,340
His dad had a subscription.

352
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,460
Bob dearly loved those Playboys, as I recall.

353
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,420
B...O...B...

354
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,640
He said, do you know the story of the Playboy?

355
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:39,640


356
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:39,640


357
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,960
And I said, well, Coach, the only thing I can tell you, he looks like Mr. Clean.

358
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,440
I mean, he's the largest thing I've ever seen since a Big Mac truck.

359
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,980
He is about 225, 230 pounds.

360
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,460
Packs arms the size of my thighs.

361
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,300
A huge, huge man.

362
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,260
This is my friend and colleague, Texan.

363
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,260
Howdy there.

364
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,860
I didn't catch your name, mister.

365
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,620
God, I'm old.

366
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,180
So, God, you're about as big as a mountain.

367
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,620
90 feet high and 9 feet tall.

368
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:09,620


369
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:09,880
Wow.

370
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,020
Like you might have played some football.

371
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,280
We're going to kill some elephants today, are we?

372
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,660
Why did Bob do that?

373
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,560
Bob knew what he wanted.

374
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,860
He made a plan.

375
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,300
And he stayed enthusiastic over several years.

376
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,700
I mean, I've read his interviews and his letters.

377
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,940
No, he's, you know, not retarded.

378
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,200
I mean, I've talked to the man, and he's pretty quick.

379
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,900
But from some reason, you kind of get that impression sometimes.

380
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,040
I don't know, maybe he just like, you know, when he goes into create,

381
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,740
it's like somebody playing a musical instrument or driving a car.

382
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,320
They kind of go into that zen state of retardedness where if they were

383
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:07,920
neurotically trying to, you know, do something, specifically, you can't drive a car

384
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,600
if you're totally conscious.

385
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,020
You're concentrating on it.

386
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,720
You'll go nuts.

387
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,500
It's like being a, you know, that's the way you are when you're learning to drive.

388
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,400
At the same time, he's kind of nuts.

389
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,200
I mean, he's kind of a nutty guy and eccentric.

390
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,920
I mean, he's not Hugh Beaumont.

391
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,320
He's definitely not Mr. Normal.

392
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,620
Then neither am I.

393
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:56,100
I mean, he's just practise.

394
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,600
I know, unfortunately.

395
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,660
I know.

396
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,640
But he's kind of nuts.

397
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,300
Electric staff, no one's there but the face in the window.

398
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,960
And when you think he's gone, leave your curtains drawn.

399
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,640
His radar's on the face in the window.

400
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,700
He's the perfect commander.

401
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,740
He never steps out of line.

402
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
He keeps his distance.

403
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,220
He won't run out of time.

404
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,160
Ever, forever, a true friend through thick and thin.

405
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,160
You can't keep him out, but you won't let him in.

406
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
The eyes are everywhere.

407
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,000
It's the electric staff.

408
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,680
No one's there but the face in the window.

409
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,400
And when you think he's gone, leave your curtains drawn.

410
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,000
His radar's on the face in the window.

411
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,020
The End

412
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,120
We've been throwing out some real good hotels in America.

413
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,120
Drive those three wheelers down the lobby of Hyatt in Maui.

414
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,660
Roar!

415
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:37,820
Roar!

416
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,240
Roar!

417
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,460
I gotta tell ya, ya know, some things change about, well let's just take Bobby for instance.

418
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,240
Don't call me Bobby.

419
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,240
Bobby!

420
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,800
A lot, he's changed a lot.

421
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,640
In a lot of ways he's become very refined, but there are things about him that will never

422
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,500
change.

423
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,060
Ha ha!

424
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,880
Is that clear to you?

425
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,200
The brain is not a container to be filled.

426
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,460
It is something to be activated.

427
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
To be excited.

428
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,660
To be excited.

429
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,760
I'm trying to find a young man.

430
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,120
Here's one.

431
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,620
I'll bet he's less than 26.

432
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,940
How old are you?

433
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,860
26.

434
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,540
26!

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,680
I got him!

436
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,960
What's your first name?

437
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,400
Bob.

438
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:17,920
Bob!

439
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,940
It appears to me that you don't need much motivation, but I'm gonna use it anyway.

440
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,300
I think probably this is true.

441
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,300
Bob, isn't it true that unless you have found your field in life, the thing that you want

442
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,020
to do, isn't it true that you frequently think of what you are best suited for?

443
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,660
And if you could only find your field in life, what would you do?

444
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,820
Find out what he's best suited for?

445
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,400
He would work 18 hours a day, I assure you.

446
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,340
He would study.

447
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,520
He would self-discipline himself.

448
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,860
He'd stop fooling around.

449
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,160
I'm not saying that you are.

450
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm just using that as an example.

451
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,640
I'll tell you what you're best fitted for.

452
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,100
How do you like that?

453
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,180
Now, Bob, if you could ever believe this, you'd just jump out of your skin.

454
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,340
I guess you're jumping now, aren't you?

455
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,560
Bob, you are best fitted for anything you want to do.

456
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,560
Anything.

457
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,680
I don't care about your past education.

458
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,280
I don't care a thing of your past.

459
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,640
Your best fit is to be a good student.

460
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,640


461
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,640


462
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,640


463
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,640


464
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,640


465
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,500
You're best fitted for anything.

466
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,900
You know this theory that's been known since the beginning of time.

467
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,540
That we are what we think.

468
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm Bob, and this here is my place.

469
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,020
Excellent.

470
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,180
Christ.

471
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,460
Welcome to The

472
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:57,100
Genet만 Show withёл Paul

473
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,080
and Kate

474
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,080
Uh-oh, you know who that is?

475
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,960
That's right, it's your pal, Bobo the Clown! Yay!

476
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,820
Hey, Bobo, want to play a game?

477
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,420
Okay, look up, look down, now look at Mr. Frying Pan.

478
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,660
Uh-oh, Bobo, fall down, go boom.

479
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,900
Wake up!

480
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,880
Oh, Bob!

481
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,260
Wake up!

482
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,580
Beep, beep, beep.

483
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,580
Beep, beep, beep.

484
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,320
Beep, beep, beep.

485
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,800
Beep, beep, beep.

486
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,140
Beep, beep, beep.

487
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,380
Beep, beep, beep.

488
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,020
It's on every station.

489
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,460
Get a trace on that signal, now!

490
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,320
Make him proud!

491
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,660
The other officers quickly take up the slack.

492
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,120
That's how big it was.

493
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,360
It could be seen for miles and miles around.

494
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,060
Now, here's the king's command.

495
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm going to command all these musicians to start playing their musical instruments, and as soon as they start playing,

496
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:37,640


497
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,340
you are to fall down and bow down in front of that great image 90 feet high and pray to it.

498
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,400
It's a bad joke.

499
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:57,280
I'm not giving in to a smile or a grin on a face I might never see again.

500
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:07,600
I'm not gonna fly in some big, phony sky on a line.

501
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,640
I'm not gonna fly in some big, phony sky on a line.

502
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm gonna fly that I know just can't win.

503
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,460
Beep, beep, beep.

504
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,260
Yes, Bob.

505
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,760
You rang?

506
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,300
Am I a lousy picker?

507
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,280
Er, whatever.

508
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,560
I analyze it and assess it thoroughly, and then I make my prediction on the air and I

509
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,420
pick the opposite.

510
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:26,980
Me too.

511
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,720
I stand on my record.

512
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,900
But one thing I shared with you this afternoon is that Bobby didn't listen to me, and I'm

513
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,620
thankful now that I'm here.

514
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm thankful that he didn't, and hopefully if you've got a negative spouse, you're not

515
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,180
listening to them either, because he didn't listen to me, and he went about and built

516
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,300
the business, because he saw something in it.

517
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,180
A friend of his or an acquaintance of his had shown him the plan, and I won't bust his

518
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,440
bubble.

519
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,420
That's his part of the story.

520
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,100
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

521
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:02,120
But let us look to the next paragraph of prophecy, which says, Dateline for Dominance, 1991,

522
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,560
first paragraph.

523
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,560
And I quote,

524
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,380
World War III.

525
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,060
Church of the subgenius shifts into Operation Removal.

526
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,640
End quote.

527
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,040
Now, admittedly, dear friends, that leaves open some room for interpretation.

528
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,780
And just what is Operation Removal designated to remove?

529
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,620
And knowing Bob, he'd want to remove the very concept.

530
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
Of removal.

531
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,540
I suppose Bob told you that his plan has been approved, and recruiting is about to

532
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:40,760
open.

533
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,400
You once offered to help us find the right sort of recruits.

534
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,380
How many men do you need?

535
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,380
I thought you'd say that.

536
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,540
We'll need 1,100 men to begin with.

537
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm in this thing any way you can use me.

538
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,600
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stang.

539
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,540
Hi, I'm Bob.

540
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,100
Hi.

541
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,820
Are you famous?

542
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,420
Yeah.

543
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,600
Oh, I'm Bob.

544
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


545
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


546
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


547
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


548
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


549
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


550
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


551
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


552
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


553
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


554
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


555
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


556
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


557
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


558
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,600


559
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm Bob.

560
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:04,860


561
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,800
See, I saw this program that I'm talking about tonight some seven years ago.

562
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,080
Seven years ago when I saw this program, I folded my arms across my chest, I crossed

563
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,800
my legs, and then I looked at that guy that was talking about this program, and I said,

564
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,560
no way.

565
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,480
Whoever this joker is, whoever's up there, he's always grinning.

566
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,520
I thought, why was he always grinning and never dawned on me?

567
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,240
Because he is so doggone rich.

568
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,580
Being a joker is a good thing.

569
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:34,580


570
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,160
Being broke is not a good deal, but he looked at me and he says, Al, whatever you do, you're

571
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,180
going to like Area 3.

572
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,420
He says, as a matter of fact, judging from the first two areas, you'll probably want

573
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,500
to be involved in Area 3.

574
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,100
And I was committed and convinced that Area 3 looked good.

575
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,440
And then he spelled it out to me.

576
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,120
D-E-A-D, dead.

577
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,360
Fantastic.

578
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
I'll talk like this.

579
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,600
Bob's your uncle, mate.

580
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,200
That really doesn't help, Bob.

581
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,560
I'm Bob.

582
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,460
I'm Bob.

583
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,480
You get the slack in the off, you get the back slim.

584
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,540
Well, that would have to have been last Fourth of July.

585
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,400
It was very hot out.

586
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,040
Oh, so hot.

587
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,280
It was just blazing.

588
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,760
And I was at the youth group picnic.

589
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,860
Minister Bob was there in his Bermuda pants.

590
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,420
They cover more legs than his Bermuda shorts, you see.

591
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,540
And I was at the youth group picnic.

592
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,840
And they're just a little bit tighter in the back.

593
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,860
They just hug his buns in the cutest way.

594
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,240
But anyway, I was slicing some Rice Krispie squares I had made.

595
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,240
And Minister Bob was filling cups of the punch bowl with his ladle.

596
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,540
It was the biggest ladle I'd ever seen.

597
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,620
I wanted to touch it, but I was afraid to, because it was so abnormally large.

598
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,740
And as I watched him with that ladle, he kept dipping it into the bowl and pouring punch.

599
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,520
He said, I'm going to do it.

600
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


601
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


602
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


603
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


604
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


605
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


606
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,520


607
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,940
And dipping and pouring and dipping and pouring and dipping until all the cups were filled.

608
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,540
And it didn't take long, because that was some big ladle.

609
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,560
And then suddenly, violently, there was a shudder.

610
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,440
My buttocks were tingling.

611
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
I was alone, lost in space.

612
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,580
I saw him toss that ladle aside, his arm exhausted.

613
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,240
I must have passed out, because that's all I remember.

614
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,420
You may call me Connie.

615
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,920
You did what was doing the storm, remember?

616
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,060
You said, all right, Connie, we might as well go down together.

617
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,500
I like that.

618
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


619
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


620
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


621
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


622
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


623
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


624
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


625
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


626
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,500


627
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,300
I like the way you said, Connie.

628
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,560
It was like a punch in the door.

629
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,120
Now, what's going to happen?

630
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,640
Do you know that's breaking the second commandment?

631
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,260
Because Babylon was the head of witchcraft, sorcery, fortune-tellers.

632
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Notice that.

633
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,680
When the music starts playing, you're to bow down and worship the great image.

634
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,380
Night and day, you are the one.

635
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,980
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun.

636
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,420
Whether near to me or far.

637
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,480
You are the one.

638
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,480


639
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,040
It's no matter where you are

640
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,720
I think of you

641
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,760
Night and day

642
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,320
And I won't tell you I jumped in with both feet

643
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,880
and started listening to tapes and reading books because I didn't.

644
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,380
I had to read lots of books, lots and lots of books.

645
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,200
And sometimes you're going to pick up a book in the beginning

646
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,380
and you're going to read it and you're going to think,

647
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,520
I can't finish this, this book is too heavy.

648
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,480
And you're going to put it down and a couple of years later,

649
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,200
a couple of months later, you're going to pick up that book

650
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
and all of a sudden it's going to slap you in the face.

651
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,020
Hello, Connie.

652
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,840
Bob!

653
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,420
I'm so glad.

654
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,460
You're glad? How do you think I feel?

655
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,920
And you're just as good as new again.

656
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,500
Stop kidding.

657
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,400
Why are you kidding?

658
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,700
In high society, I just ain't the type.

659
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,140
Folks all look so surprised when I light my pipe.

660
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,120
Oh, yeah.

661
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,820
Do you, uh,

662
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,040
smoke a pipe too?

663
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,800
Oh, don't be coy. I like it too.

664
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,600
What's it going to get you, Connie?

665
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,260
All this business of filling my pipe,

666
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,740
pouring my drinks, corned beef and cabbage?

667
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,960
I suppose I should pretend that I don't know what you mean by that.

668
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,060
But I won't.

669
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,040
Connie, look, for the past few days, all you've done is...

670
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,900
All I've done is what?

671
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,940
Well, is to tell a man in a thousand little ways.

672
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,740
To tell what man in a thousand little ways?

673
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,200
Well, not with words, maybe, but with looks, actions,

674
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,620
and...

675
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,520
Aren't you ashamed?

676
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,800
All right, maybe you say I'm wrong.

677
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,920
A partner in sin?

678
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,820
There was an influence there.

679
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,460
Sometimes there is a mood that just...

680
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,980
We don't know why.

681
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,340
You wouldn't get a pal, would you, Connie?

682
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,080
Or yourself, maybe?

683
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,540
I don't know yet, Bob.

684
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,360
Oh!

685
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,560
Hello, children.

686
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,420
Well, here we are, Doc.

687
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
The two longbirds.

688
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,840
All ready for the wedding.

689
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,660
Sit down.

690
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
Are we healthy enough to get married?

691
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,360
Yeah, both as solid as a new dollar.

692
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,080
That first baby didn't hurt you a bit.

693
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,120
You can have a dozen more if you want to.

694
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,560
And, Bob, you'll be pleased to know

695
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,600
that there's no trace of your old V.D.

696
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,600
One hundred percent sure.

697
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,600
What did you say about a first baby?

698
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,140
You've been married before?

699
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,220
Doctor, what did you call it?

700
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,480
V.D.?

701
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,440
You mean to say that Bob is actually...

702
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,940
had one of those horrible diseases?

703
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,860
That isn't true, Doctor.

704
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
Is that true, Bob?

705
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,280
All right, if you must know, I did have it.

706
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,780
But it's no worse than having an illegitimate child.

707
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,060
I think it is.

708
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,180
Why, I'd...

709
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,840
I'd sooner marry a leper.

710
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,580
Thank you for letting me know about this in time, Dr. West.

711
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,180
And now I'm going out into the clean, fresh air.

712
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,360
Well, there went my happy wedding right out the door.

713
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,040
I'm terribly sorry, Bob.

714
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,500
Probably the whole house fell asleep because of me!

715
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,900
But it felt like a party because of you.

716
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,640
He was giving it his all, and then I Anderson.

717
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,040
And obviously I paid you.

718
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,920
But mistake over lift!

719
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,300
Tell me why you never saw me again.

720
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,340
Tell me why.

721
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:29,900
Away!

722
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:30,540


723
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:30,920
Away!

724
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:31,740


725
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:31,740


726
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:31,740


727
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:31,740


728
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,020
ought to stand up against it, say amen, evil soul.

729
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:43,320
The pipes, we need a jolly life, jolly life, we're free from every garrenstripe, garrenstripe,

730
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:49,820
we drink the best, we drink the best, no, no, no, I'm glad that this gay life is mine.

731
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,240
Fear the name of fingers, waters, dirty birdie, Holland, no sterling beef or chemist, drink

732
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,240
beef, eat beef, fear the name of mist, mystic, Myron, Tucker, Dolan, Battis, Soaring Inn,

733
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:08,040
oh, George E3, oh, smiling, no, Nick, Bob, Cobra Bar, Nick, Nolte, oh, Golden Throat,

734
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,060
it's John A.D.

735
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,380
If you understand that we have all had a partner in sin, you really didn't do it by yourself.

736
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,960
There was an influence there.

737
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,780
Now we shop at Neiman Marcus instead of K. Martin Sears.

738
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,160
We go on Neiman Marcus, and as soon as they spotted us, and I was there,

739
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,840
last year, they said, hi, Bob and Bonnie, how are you?

740
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,620
They remembered us.

741
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,060
And so on the back, they take you in the back, and they have drinks for you, whatever it

742
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,620
is, scotch, whiskey, whatever you want, and I asked for the usual.

743
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,260
If you drink five gallons of Gatorade, you're going to expend five gallons of Gatorade somewhere

744
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,420
in one of these restaurants.

745
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,320
You buy that, right?

746
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Frankly, either way, it's good.

747
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,540
Just put the phone out.

748
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,420
We went 15% and did some crazy things, and we went direct, and I can remember going direct,

749
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,120
and I can remember standing up on stage and putting the microphone up to my mouth, and

750
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
nothing came out.

751
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,100
And I went, oh, my God.

752
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,160
No, Connie, no.

753
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,460
I blew five-step flame out of my butt.

754
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,060
It really isn't all that bad.

755
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:25,880
Hope you understand.

756
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,620
That there's nothing more liberating than being able to pee and poop your own diaper.

757
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,560
For the love of Bob.

758
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:32,820
Yeah!

759
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,660
Yeah!

760
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,680
Come on.

761
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,620
Yeah, what's the matter with that?

762
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,360
It's disgusting.

763
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,040
Don't ever ask me to do that again.

764
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,180
You just have to be careful.

765
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,640
You always think about, you know, getting poop on the finger, you know?

766
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,400
And I remember the first time it happened.

767
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,840
I couldn't believe it.

768
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,560
I mean, it's like, oh, my God.

769
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,140
I've got poop on my finger.

770
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,480
And then I started thinking to myself, it could be worse.

771
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,240
I could have a job.

772
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,460
I don't think I can.

773
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:12,920
I can't.

774
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,720
I just can't do it.

775
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,540
And I said to Bobby, please don't ever make me do that again.

776
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,980
Don't call me Bobby.

777
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,080
No, Connie, no.

778
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,640
Connie, Connie, please.

779
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,640
Don't ever.

780
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,120
Don't ever.

781
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,140


782
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,720
You're my guiding light.

783
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,940
Oh, my God.

784
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,060
No, Connie, no.

785
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,860
Night and day under the height of me.

786
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,340
There's such a hungry yearning burning inside of me.

787
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,180
And the storm that won't be through.

788
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,860
Do you let me spread my lightning?

789
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,580
Making love to you night and day.

790
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,100
Oh, day and night.

791
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,720
Night and day.

792
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,820
They won't believe that.

793
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,560
They will when they hear the things you and Bob said to each other the other night in Irene's apartment.

794
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,580
You were there.

795
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,220
And there were probably a thousand people there, but I thought there were 7,000 people there

796
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,500
because there was so much excitement.

797
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,500
And for once in my life, I found a place where I could be accepted for being me.

798
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,060
And that people loved you unconditionally, no matter who you were, no matter what you looked like.

799
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,100
And everybody was going towards a common goal.

800
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,140
Everybody was excited for everybody else.

801
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,100
And all of a sudden, I felt like I was a big loving.

802
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,040
I just, I all of a sudden found a place that I felt like maybe I could grow into.

803
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,860
And of course, you know, that wasn't, you know, the beginning either.

804
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,480
It's a long stretch. It's a journey.

805
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
It's something you do every day.

806
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,400
It helps you get closer to your dream.

807
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,540
Well, Bill, I'm an admirer of Bob.

808
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,840
Does it worry you, Bob?

809
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,580
You can't let this thing taste.

810
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,560
I think they could take it a step beyond to the bizarre, the grotesque,

811
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,560
to intentionally mean-spirited injury of other innocent people.

812
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,140
It was, it had Bob's fingerprints all over it.

813
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,680
And he and I both would agree that Bob's not a nice person.

814
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,040
I saw him shoot Bob.

815
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,020
Joe's what you get with a liberal agenda.

816
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,860
You pump people full of drugs and pipe dreams of what happens.

817
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,440
They come gunning for people like Bob.

818
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,100
But those folks don't realize something.

819
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,680
You can't kill the truth.

820
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,300
Bob is not going to be stopped by any bullet.

821
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,060
He'll be back.

822
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,360
And man, you better watch out because he's headed straight for Washington.

823
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,100
And that's all I've got to say.

824
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,380
Excuse me.

825
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,800
I have to go pray.

826
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,720
Yeah, right.

827
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,240
His new album entitled,

828
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,060
Bob on Bob is released

829
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,080
and debuts with a bullet at number two on the charts.

830
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,520
Was never heard, no seen again.

831
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,420
Officially presumed is dead.

832
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,140
But the words he left behind

833
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,940
still echo through my mind.

834
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,520
I'm the only man who'll ever get to

835
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,700
and come back alive.

836
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,540
He's the only man.

837
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,600
I'm the only man who'll ever get to

838
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
and come back alive.

839
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:29,880
So?

840
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,620
This is no joke now.

841
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,900
Not building up to a joke.

842
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,240
It was hot.

843
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,540
And I knew it was going to stay hot.

844
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,580
Terribly hot.

845
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,840
Exactly as I had predicted.

846
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,560
This is beautiful, ain't it?

847
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,460
Yeah, but it's hot.

848
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,520
Oh, we'll have a swell time here.

849
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,500
Yeah, a hot time.

850
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,920
Just like the movies.

851
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah, just like the movies.

852
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,040
Soon me and Natasha will be right under them palm trees.

853
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,080
Soon you and Natasha will be knocking down them palm trees.

854
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,180
He's gone!

855
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,320
He's gone!

856
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,400
Find him!

857
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,240
Find him!

858
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,760
Find him!

859
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,780
Sam Beasley loaded with crocodile.

860
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,940
I believe we have some friends of yours on board, sir.

861
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,780
Hello, Bob.

862
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Connie, what in the world are you doing here?

863
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,160
Oh, I can't believe it.

864
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,220
It's like a little paradise.

865
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:21,500


866
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,220
Are you comfortable here, Bob?

867
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,120
You'll find out tonight.

868
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,880
I will.

869
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,000
We've rented a porcupine to chaperone.

870
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
So, um...

871
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,420
There are a couple of little canvas chairs there,

872
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,520
and they're cooking somebody's skull, you know, or something.

873
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,480
The scene is an American and a Britisher,

874
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,940
and they've been discussing all afternoon a little juice and a little vodka.

875
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,900
And, um...

876
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,420
The Britisher says,

877
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,480
I know you've hunted in many, many sections of the world,

878
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,160
and I know that you've killed an innumerous amount of animals of all types.

879
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,680
Birds, reptiles, things of that nature.

880
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,000
But you have never hunted Bob,

881
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,840
in that he's the great white hunter,

882
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,420
and I think, as far as I'm concerned,

883
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,700
the greatest white hunter of all times.

884
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,560
Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting him.

885
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,520
He better be pretty damn good, I'll clue you.

886
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,480
Because I've spent $100,000 coming over this godforsaken town.

887
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,920
Territory.

888
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,920
True, I've made some foolish investments.

889
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,280
I've married three or four times.

890
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,700
One was a teenager.

891
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,560
I was really drunk down in Big D one night.

892
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,400
Married a child. Married a child.

893
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,740
God, she was having no heaven to have you down there.

894
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,840
I'm looking forward to this guy.

895
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,840
I hope to God you say he's as good as he is.

896
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,360
Believe me, he is.

897
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,820
In fact, he's coming up right now.

898
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,440
Striking blue eyes and carrying a .22 short rifle.

899
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,460
What the hell's he doing?

900
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,060
I expect to kill with that.

901
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,640
I've only known him to be always a crack shot.

902
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,820
Strange, I must say.

903
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,860
Going out after elephant today.

904
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,500
He'll have to be good all right, won't he?

905
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,940
We have a friend

907
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,480
That we don't talk about

908
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,020
Wears a black leather jacket

909
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,720
Sort of I'm the brando type

910
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,380
Oh, what a friend

911
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,440
That we don't like to talk about

912
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,440


913
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,440


914
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,440


915
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,440


916
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,400
Has black hair

917
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,160
And a set of teeth to match

918
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,520
We're just having cocktails

919
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,700
Right out here in the sun

920
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,820
Jungle

921
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,480
Listening to a little hi-fi

922
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,940
Pictures of home

923
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,560
Waiting for you

924
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,580
Texan

925
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,880
This is my friend and colleague

926
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Howdy there

927
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,440
I'm a friend and colleague

928
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,340
God almighty

929
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,260
Oh, what a friend

930
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,440
That we don't like to talk about

931
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,060
I guess this doesn't seem strange to you

932
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,280
But you should see what our friend can do

933
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,380
He let Satan tempt you

934
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,420
He just said,

935
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,320
Let Satan wet up his knives

936
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,480
He lets him get the filthiest, rottenest, degradating rot of hell

937
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,820
And hit you right smack with it

938
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,920
And then he says,

939
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,560
Use my word

940
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,000
Use my name

941
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,420
Use my power

942
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:36,820
Yes

943
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,080
Look, you get yourself a couple of pints

944
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,500
And a chicken tikka masala takeaway

945
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,660
Pops your uncle in f***ing the rude word

946
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,820
I haven't heard it from your mouth

947
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,120
Yours and Bob's

948
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,080
Yeah, you heard it from him

949
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,140
I did not hear it

950
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,080
He slept with you

951
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,480
On July 4th, the weekend

952
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,540
I'll give you a flick

953
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,420
I'll give you a flick

954
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,860
Look at him get pipe and smoke at home

955
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
I feel bad

956
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,040
I know, I feel bad

957
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,240
About the way things happen

958
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,760
But I don't regret it

959
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,520
Because I love Bob and I'm happy

960
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,560
I think it was just a matter of time

961
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,000
Before Bob came up with a song

962
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,180
I wanna be Bob

963
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,460
Sit and smile all the time

964
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,240
I wanna be Bob

965
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,460
I wanna be Bob

966
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,760
I think everything is just fine

967
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,060
Don't wanna be Jesus

968
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,140
I always look so sad

969
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,500
Don't wanna be Jesus

970
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,160
Ha ha, he must have had an awful dad

971
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,700
I wanna be Bob

972
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,860
Tell everyone about slack

973
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,960
I wanna be Bob

974
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,560
Let the pigs kiss my crack

975
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,860
Don't wanna be Jesus

976
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,940
Don't wanna be no slave

977
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,380
Don't wanna be Jesus

978
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,040
He should have stayed in his grave

979
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,460
Don't wanna be Jesus

980
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,500
I wanna be Bob

981
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,100
Never have to work a day

982
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,300
I wanna be Bob

983
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,460
All eternity's a play

984
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,860
Don't wanna be Jesus

985
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,020
Don't wanna carry no cross

986
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,420
Don't wanna be Jesus

987
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,980
Don't wanna speak for no ha ha boss

988
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,660
I wanna be Bob

989
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,000
See everything all so clear

990
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,160
I wanna be Bob

991
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,600
Finish everything right here to here

992
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,940
Don't wanna be Jesus

993
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,180
Always trying to figure things out

994
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,560
Don't wanna be Jesus

995
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,600
Who needs all the money

996
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,780
Pass the doubts

997
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,860
Don't wanna be Bob

998
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,320
Yeah, I wanna be Bob

999
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,220
I wanna be Bob

1000
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,940
I'd even like a new jersey

1001
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,920
Yahoo!

1002
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,660
I wanted you to know

1003
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,580
what radio announcers are up against.

1004
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,780
Feel sorry for them.

1005
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,700
Send in a little something,

1006
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,460
whatever you can afford.

1007
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,360
And now, friends,

1008
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,720
we have a time check.

1009
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,360
Ding!

1010
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,880
And would you just...

1011
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,100
Fill in your own time, please.

1012
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,740
Well, my freedom was so precious.

1013
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,900
I took my noxious alarm clock,

1014
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,540
I took my sludge hammer,

1015
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,760
and I painted it red, white, and blue.

1016
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,920
Because in America,

1017
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,840
if you can afford it, you can do it.

1018
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,340
And I smashed it.

1019
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,200
And it was so fun.

1020
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,500
What an experience.

1021
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,120
It is really fun.

1022
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,220
I like that.

1023
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,120
You know what time

1024
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,020
we're gonna wake up Monday?

1025
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,280
See, we don't either.

1026
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,200
Thank you, Bob!

1027
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,340
Thank you, Bob!

1028
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,640
Give thanks to Bob

1029
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,220
our eternal hope

1030
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,060
and praise me to

1031
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,680
Irwin, New Jersey's Pope.

1032
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,000
We're fickle and free

1033
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,440
and we don't make no fuss

1034
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,920
at the Church of the Subgenius.

1035
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,220
Bob, hear our plea.

1036
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,740
We beseech thee.

1037
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,080
Help us be free

1038
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,380
from normalcy.

1039
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,560
We're done devoted

1040
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,620
and done talking.

1041
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:47,940
Hope's aوں back.

1042
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,680
Please give us an hour of slack.

1043
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,820
JR Bob Dobbs never fails.

1044
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,480
He's the Living Slackmaster of Mystic Sales.

1045
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,620
All you conspiracy doofs, just you wait

1046
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,180
til July the 5th,

1047
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,320
1998

1048
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,080
Invaders will come from Planet X

1049
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,360
bringing gifts,

1050
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,560
Of money, time control and great sex

1051
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,280
And a new age will dawn and we'll never look back

1052
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,240
We'll be busy enjoying our slacks

1053
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,600
But here I believe, we be seized free

1054
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,200
Help us be free from normalcy

1055
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,940
We're dumb, devoted and dumb, talk back

1056
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,580
Please give us an hour of slack

1057
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,140
He's the bridge between heaven and earth and hell

1058
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,560
He's the patron saint of sales, yeah he's doing well

1059
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,260
Media, cretins and novels and things beware

1060
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,780
The slack master sells everywhere

1061
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,260
Give thanks to Bob, give thanks to Bob

And we don't make no fuss

1080
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,860
At the Church of the Subgenius

1081
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:06,740
Dear Bob, I must give you credit for playing some good music, but why spoil it with your

1082
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,200
stupid asinine whistling?

1083
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:08,900
Why?

1084
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,940
Lock yourself in a broom closet while the music is on.

1085
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,120
I'm disgusted.

1086
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,120
And from now on, I'll do my own whistling in the morning.

1087
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,940
This is from Springfield.

1088
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,880
Is there any lower form of life?

1089
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,960
Let the record show that the witness made a drinky, drinky motion.

1090
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,860
A bottle. Who has it?

1091
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,500
Stupid mailman, squirreling me.

1092
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,840
I still enjoy your program, even though you've been back two or three weeks now.

1093
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,180
Isn't that nice?

1094
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,020
Here's one.

1095
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,780
It says, Dear Bob, please don't pick any more winners.

1096
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,760
I'm going broke.

1097
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,900
And, uh, you bull thrower, how are you going to crawl out of this?

1098
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,540
That's a nice one.

1099
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,400
I like the short one.

1100
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,480
At least you get them over with in a hurry.

1101
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,020
Dear Bob, I had heard so much about you, I was prepared to like you immediately.

1102
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,800
I tuned in your show, and you talked me out of it.

1103
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,080
Here's another one from Springfield.

1104
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,720
Could you please give me the exact address in Washington, D.C., of the Bureau of Indian Affairs?

1105
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,000
I've always wanted to have an affair with an Indian.

1106
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,020
It's only because you're a true man.

1107
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,360
This is from Springfield also.

1108
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,260
Dear Bob, this morning you advertised boys' suits for youngsters aged three to seven.

1109
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,580
You said they were trimmed with piping.

1110
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,080
Piping in a boy's suit?

1111
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,300
Wouldn't you think they'd be housebroken at that age?

1112
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,380
Hang in there, Robert.

1113
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,000
Yours truly.

1114
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,360
This letter from New Britain says,

1115
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,640
Dear Bob, I was standing in the kitchen in front of my radio this morning pulling my two-way stretch over my hips when you said,

1116
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,260
Are you a little on the fat side?

1117
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,400
What I want to know is, can you see out here?

1118
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,340
If so, I must dress somewhere else.

1119
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
It's a joke, Dobbsy.

1120
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,480
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

1121
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,940
In on it?

1122
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,640
Sure I will.

1123
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,600
Sure.

1124
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,020
This is a joke, Bob.

1125
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1126
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1127
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1128
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1129
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1130
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1131
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1132
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1133
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1134
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1135
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1136
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1137
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,020


1138
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,260
Ahh.

1139
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,640
Isn't it great swimming in a sea of slack?

1140
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:58,220
Let's just immerse ourselves in the luck plane's surfy, surfy waves, and waft along.

1141
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,900
Dr. Philo Drummond once said,

1142
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,280
If slack was water, Bob would be surfing, and you'd be drowning.

1143
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,940
Hey, I'm willing to settle for death by drowning in slack.

1144
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,060
Well, I'm going to tell you something, Bob.

1145
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,060


1146
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,060


1147
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,060


1148
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,060


1149
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,060


1150
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,060
any day, Doctor.

1151
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,120
Ah, this is the soundtrack to Mr. Lucky,

1152
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,340
which is one of Bob's nine billion middle names.

1153
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,420
And you know, he's taught me

1154
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,980
that it's better to be lucky than good any day,

1155
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,620
and what an example he sets.

1156
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,560
I rejoice in the failings of Bob.

1157
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,580
I exult in the slip-ups of Bob.

1158
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,400
Hey, Bob, show us how you make a mistake

1159
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,080
and make a million dollars.

1160
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,140
Yes, make me a failure too, Bob.

1161
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,480
Show me the witching ways of surfing the luck plane.

1162
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,960
Look, Bob, I can hang too.

1163
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,840
Oh, and when Bob forgets to screw up.

1164
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,700
Oh, when he screws up by not screwing up.

1165
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,480
It's like breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.

1166
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,700
It's such blinding, radiant luck that you can't believe it.

1167
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,120
You appreciate the good things in life

1168
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,480
if you don't waste your time

1169
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,060
counting on the good things in life.

1170
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,800
You don't want to rely on them to happen.

1171
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,180
But if you expect the bad things,

1172
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,460
every day can be like Christmas.

1173
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,660
Just forget yourself

1174
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,180
and go with a path of least resistance.

1175
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,660
Sharpen your abnormality focus.

1176
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,380
You might do only one weird thing exceptionally well.

1177
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,440
Well, take that weird thing

1178
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,640
and turn it around and milk it dry.

1179
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,660
Milk it for Bobby.

1180
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,700
Tap it.

1181
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,980
Strip mine it.

1182
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,300
There's strip mining your slack away.

1183
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,200
Leaving toxic poisons to leach into your psychic water table.

1184
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,100
Fight the conspiracy.

1185
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,180
Give up for Bob.

1186
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,140
On and off the road to Bob.

1187
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,120
We are marching forward blind.

1188
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,440
He has gouged out both our eyes.

1189
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,060
And he's laughing.

1190
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,020
Laughing close behind.

1191
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:19,440
He will sell us back our eyes

1192
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,320
when we join his noble plan.

1193
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,900
For just $19.95

1194
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,580
and a taste of our woodland.

1195
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,480
On and off the road with Bob.

1196
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,620
He has handed us the wheel.

1197
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,400
And he cuddles up with love.

1198
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,680
As he counts himself a field.

1199
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,280
Our eyes are on the road.

1200
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,280


1201
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,940
But Bob forgot to say.

1202
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:23,260
The steering wheel went bust.

1203
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,840
The road carries us away.

1204
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,080
On and off the road for Bob.

1205
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,260
We've cut butter.

1206
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,260


1207
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,140
Forgot why we came here.

1208
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,240
We have quit all of our jobs.

1209
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:56,120
Like a headlight frightened deer.

1210
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,980
He has lit the sacred pipe.

1211
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,340
And he's smiling at us now.

1212
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,160
On and on, on and on.

1213
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,000
He's Bob.

1214
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,100
He's our book.

1215
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:22,780
We are his town.

1216
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,360
That hurt, Bob.

1217
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,620
Bob, where are you?

1218
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,680
Who are you?

1219
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,420
A friend of Bob's.

1220
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,780
They found my fingerprints on my ashtray and not yours.

1221
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,380
It had Bob's fingerprints all over it.

1222
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,140
And he and I both would agree that Bob's not a nice person.

1223
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,440
That was enough for them.

1224
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,120
It's funny because it's true.

1225
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,040
And hey, admit the truth to yourself now.

1226
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,420
You know you'll be clawing your way to the head of the line to buy a membership

1227
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,260
when the atomic heat rays are so close they're welding your butt cheeks together.

1228
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,020
Oh, but don't come crying to me.

1229
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,620
I can't wait for X-Day.

1230
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,320
I love the taste of human flesh.

1231
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,860
I just haven't had it cooked yet.

1232
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,420
We get down and dirty in this church because religion happens to be a dirty, dirty business.

1233
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,060
This church is a lot like an old car sometimes,

1234
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,320
in that it's the dirt that's the only thing that's holding it all together.

1235
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,780
And Bob, Bob is the bondo that keeps our sagging bumpers up.

1236
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,560
Isn't that the one thing that we're here for after all, sneakers?

1237
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,920
The dirt.

1238
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,260


1239
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,060
Oh, so let's dig in and dish it up.

1240
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,880
It's crammed packed with minerals, too.

1241
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,240
So don't settle for the poop du jour.

1242
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:58,540
Excremeditate your troubles away with the armor-piercing slack of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1243
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,300
I am mighty, I am full of it, but I'm going to let it go.

1244
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,900
And you've got to let it go, dear.

1245
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,720
A friend, just as sure as you can bet it,

1246
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,820
one of those two greatest guys up there is going to let go just as you is letting go.

1247
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,400
Bob, what's Ms. Preskey's heap so far?

1248
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,220
Right, Jack?

1249
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,360
Yes.

1250
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,500
Well, how do you feel, Ms. Preskey?

1251
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,320
Sick.

1252
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,440
Ah, well, you can afford it now, love.

1253
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,800
But like the good book says, there are bigger deals.

1254
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,700
Dickוב.

1255
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,020
Oh, Christ.

1256
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,600
I hope things worked out the way you want them to.

1257
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,300
Thanks, Bob.

1258
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm hoping, too.

1259
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,200
Oh, crap! It's on fire!

1260
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,040
Texas.

1261
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,440
Slag.

1262
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,320
From the Church of the Subgenius.

1263
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,000
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius,

1264
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:12,340
write for free information from P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1265
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:20,740
Or you can send tapes and things, CDs, whatever, to me, stang, at subgenius.com,

1266
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,080
by email, or...

1267
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,920
Uh, to, uh...

1268
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1269
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,460
And, friends, this music in the background is the amino acid.

1270
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,060
It's, uh...

1271
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,460
Ugh!

1272
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,180
Uh-oh!

1273
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,860
Bob will fall down, go boom!

1274
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,420
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

1275
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,940
Uh, friends?

1276
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,840
Are you a subgenius minister yet?

1277
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,620
Have you joined the Church of the Subgenius?

1278
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:25,640
And by that, I mean, actually sent in your 35 bucks, payable by PayPal or credit card,

1279
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:33,560
uh, on subgenius.com, where it says, become an ordained minister, or where it says, stores.

1280
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:40,820
And even if you have, do you have your well-made Bob t-shirt from anticonformity.com?

1281
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,820
Do you have your Arise DVD?

1282
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,480
Sure, you can watch it on the internet, but...

1283
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,520
It's not the same.

1284
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,980
And it isn't the same.

1285
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,920
It hasn't been kissed by the...

1286
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,040
lips of Princess Wee, who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.

1287
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,700
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.

1288
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,700
How about that?

1289
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,460
You can still get those from us.

1290
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,580
But yes, the 35 bucks for the minister's pack, you really ought to think about it, folks.

1291
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:20,200
You don't have to meet any subgeniuses ever, but you will have that option.

1292
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,660
You can't come to X Day unless you're a member.

1293
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,880
You can't go to the...

1294
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:31,340
the members only kind of smarty pants internet forum called Scrub Genius.

1295
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,780
I do a lot more there than on Facebook.

1296
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,880
Because Facebook's just a bunch of gimme bobs, people who can't even spell Bob's name right.

1297
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,060
Do you know that, Princess Wee?

1298
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,960
They can't even spell Bob's name right, half of them.

1299
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,840
They leave off the quotes.

1300
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,380
Oh yeah, gimme bobs.

1301
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:49,940
You can tell.

1302
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,920
It's so easy to tell.

1303
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,920
Anyway, friends.

1304
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:55,860
We'll be back.

1305
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:55,860


1306
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,820
We'll be back next week with more X Day recordings, and hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.

1307
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,820
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

1308
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,860
Well thank you, goodnight, and praise Bob.

1309
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,300
Yai yai yai yai yai yai.
