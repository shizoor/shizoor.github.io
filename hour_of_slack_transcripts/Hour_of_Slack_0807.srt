1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,980
that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,780
No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,960
as some of the microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,020
Few men even consider the possibility of life on other planets.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,280
And yet, across the gulf of space,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,540
minds immeasurably superior to ours

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,320
regard this earth with envious eyes.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,440
And slowly and surely,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,380
they drew their plans against us.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:54,260
Quickly, one after the other,

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,280
four of the fighting machines appeared.

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,440
Monstrous.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,760
Monstrous tripods higher than the tallest steeple,

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,340
striding over the pine trees and smashing them.

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,640
Walking engines of glittering metal,

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,560
each carried a huge funnel.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,920
And I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,080
Transformers!

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,580
Transformers!

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,660
Transformers!

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,640
Transformers!

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,280
Transformers!

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,560


31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,880
Transformers

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,640
Robots in disguise

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,180
Long enough to break the brain of power

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
So we have to pull together

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,000
Though we can't stay worlds apart

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,420
To stand united we will storyboard

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,300
Until darkness comes

38
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,460
When the light will say us all

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,540
Transformers

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,200
More than beasts in the eye

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,040
Transformers

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,120
Robots in disguise

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,380
Transformers

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,960
All of us wage their battle to destroy the evil forces of

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,980
The deception

46
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,280
The deception

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,280


48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
Transformers

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,660
Transformers

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,960
Transformers

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,220
Transformers

52
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,560
It's gone for a day and now we've made our stand

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,520
And for now the powers of darkness

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,560
Have been driven from our land

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,200
The battle's over, but the war has just begun

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,320
And this wave will remain

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,580
Till the day we're not a war

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,040
Transformers

59
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,340
Transformers

60
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,320
Transformers

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,400
Transformers

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,320
Transformers

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,660
More than meets the eye

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,560
Transformers

65
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,260
Then the fighting machine came across the field

66
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,660
Spraying jets and steam that turned the smoke into thick black dust

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,820
Those machines are just demons in another form

68
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,540
I shall burn them with my holy cross

69
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,020
They're just the stupidest living

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,380
Transformers

71
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,520
Transformers

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,520
It would be something worth trying for

73
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,380
Transformers

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,880
Even something that's dying to grow

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,300
Transformers

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,120
Who is the man who's standing tall?

77
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,240
Transformers

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,560
It would be a close fight, sir

79
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,300
Transformers

80
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,560
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

81
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,500
We took Shaftler in a cottage

82
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,840
To back smoke, spread hemorrhaging

83
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,320
It's a sign

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,280
I've been given a sign

85
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,760
But now it's too late

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,100
Too late!

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh, say can you see

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,360
During next day's long day

89
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,200
The face above doves

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,740
If you stare at the sunlight

91
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,540
Whose bright eyes and broad grin

92
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,380
Train mark pipe at his chin

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,680
Gives subgenie slack

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,300
As we fight off the North

95
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,360
Transformers

96
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


97
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


98
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,360


104
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,960
And the ray guns red glare

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,420
Melted skin, bone, and hair

106
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,580
When fired from high

107
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,840
Saucers floating in air

108
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh, say does the pipe blow

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,440
From smoke this direction

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,260
So long

111
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,360
So long

112
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,460
So that we live free as birds

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,500
Not like peak human terms

114
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,500
Praise the Lord!

115
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,180
The problem is of course the humans

116
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,020
All's well then goeth away

117
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,780
BeBreaker

118
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:39,820
I don't cause harm

119
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,680
The plain sign shall this next petition be

120
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,900
It messenger dance

121
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,380
Not anyone's a favela

122
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,980
Mars is incapable of sustaining life.

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,680
Our efforts to maintain the biosphere are exhausted.

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,520
The water tables and temperature decrease accurately, as does our population.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,260
The only consequential cause of action is the conquest and occupation of Earth.

126
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,120
Our young sovereign neighbors.

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,580
The means and methods for this attack are already being realized.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,160
A large-scale hydrogen accelerator will be constructed.

129
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,380
This will launch suspension pods carrying the assault forces.

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,700
The

131
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,440
war of the worlds.

132
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,980
Remix collection.

133
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:19,240
From which we also heard a Max Mondo mix.

134
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,240


135
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,240


136
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,240


137
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,240


138
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:28,820
All taken from Jeff Wayne's old rock opera based on my hero H.G. Wells' original 1898 novel,

139
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,420
The War of the Worlds.

140
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,660
And more of that to come.

141
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,820
Things to come.

142
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:42,700
The subgenius star-spangled banner was, of course, our own Papa Joe Mama.

143
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,100
Live at the September 2001 Tampa, Florida, D. Vival.

144
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,240
And more of that will be released.

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,040
We'll be coming to.

146
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,840
But now, friends, turn off your radio unless you can take it.

147
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,140
Because I got a copy of Suzy the Floozy's war show.

148
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:10,100
The edition of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse by Reverend Suzy the Floozy in Atlanta on WREK.

149
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:17,180
And if you, friends, her collage editing is excellent.

150
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,220
And she's a great actress.

151
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,220


152
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,380
She's a very sensitive person.

153
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,240
And she's a sick weirdo.

154
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,160
And that combination makes some of this to come a bit hard to take.

155
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,180
Consider yourself warned.

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,120
And hail Connie.

157
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,760
.

158
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
.

159
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:37,760


160
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:37,760


161
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:37,760


162
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,020
.

163
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,020


164
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,020


165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,020


166
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,020


167
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,040
.

168
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,060
.

169
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,100
.

170
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:53,680
. . . . . . . . . . . .

171
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,940
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

172
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,160
. . . . . . . . .

173
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,680
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

174
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,240
Paranoia's like cheese

175
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,360
Into your life you can freeze

176
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,460
It's not when you're always afraid

177
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,720
That a life may come and take you away

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,000
We better stop, hey, what's that sound?

179
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,080
Everybody look what's going down

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,520
Stop, hey, what's that sound?

181
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,660
Everybody look what's going down

182
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,460
Sounds like the doomsday whistle

183
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,220
It's been blown from nigh on to three years

184
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,480
Trouble abruin

185
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,760
Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities

186
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,120
How are we supposed to do our big musical number

187
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,960
With so many problems in the world?

188
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,540
But we will not allow this enemy

189
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,820
To win the war by changing our way of life

190
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,360
Or restricting our freedoms

191
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,960
Yeah, maybe so, Mr. President

192
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,820
But, oh, this past week has been such a brutal kick

193
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,380
In the psychological head

194
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,800
That I feel compelled to warn some of our

195
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,760
More sensitive viewers

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
That maybe tonight isn't the show for them

197
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,040
Because, Seekers, oh, we got a whole lot to work out

198
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
It looks like they're trying to

199
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,180
Imminentize the Eschaton

200
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,700
As far as I know

201
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,420
Who knows?

202
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,800
This could be the last episode ever

203
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,640
Of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse

204
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,580
So let's just blow all this crap out of our pipes

205
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,380
Shall we?

206
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,100
And from going around making wild allegations

207
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,320
Obviously trying to exploit the situation

208
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,880
She's working for someone

209
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,180
And I don't think it's us

210
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,720
I'll deactivate her

211
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,740
The future is coming

212
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,880
Coming after you

213
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,280
Neutrously

214
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,500
Relentlessly

215
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,480
Engulfing you

216
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
Overwhelming you

217
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,420
Until it ultimately

218
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,280
Terminates you

219
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,120
And only one thing can save you

220
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,460
Let me bring Bob in on this

221
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,180
Then it's time to take a stand

222
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
To break out

223
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,900
Of your dog

224
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,280
Of your own life

225
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,180
And into

226
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,380
Brazil

227
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,700
So pleased

228
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,080
You could make it

229
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,860
Like this well

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,860
It's about whites of fantasy

231
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,380
And the nightmare of reality

232
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,620
We're all in this together

233
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,280
Terrorist bombing

234
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,740
I don't think it involves anything on safety

235
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,840
Trust me, Jack

236
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,120
That's the beauty of it

237
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,860
Our job is to trace the connections

238
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,080
And reveal them

239
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,540
This whole bunch of total confusion

240
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,920
Is obviously planned from the inside

241
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,900
Where is he headed, Professor Prescott?

242
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,540
There's one place in Manhattan

243
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,400
That looks exactly like a certain part of his native habitat

244
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,500
Let him through to it

245
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,380
And you can trap him there

246
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,500
Let him climb to the top of the World Trade Center

247
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm a cock in a wheel

248
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,540
In a lubricated world

249
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,260
And I want to marry an office girl

250
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,520
I've got my tie on

251
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,000
I've set my watch on

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,020
I've set my goal in bed

253
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,640
I ain't on

254
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,600
I want to be bad

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,080
I've got my tie on

256
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,700
It's a string around my finger

257
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,460
It's a piece around my neck

258
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,380
Although the rest is a proof

259
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm not there yet

260
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,380
I've got my tie on

261
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,280
I'll be sure to hold my head high

262
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,420
I can't forget why I got out of bed

263
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,200
Even when the morning paper's red

264
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,380
I've got my tie on

265
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,380
I'm lying across the tile floor

266
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,240
I've got my name on the office door

267
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,800
I've got my tie on

268
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,260
It's a string around my finger

269
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,980
It's a piece around my neck

270
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,820
Although the rest is a proof

271
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,060
I'm not there yet

272
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,820
I've got my tie on

273
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,200
It's a piece around my neck

274
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
I've got my tie on

275
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,400
I've got my tie on

276
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:37,840
I've got my tie on

277
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,400
It's a costume around my neck

278
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,400


279
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,400


280
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,180
I've got my tie on

281
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,140
I've got my tie on

282
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,040
Let'slate

283
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
Let'slate

284
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,360
Not playing

285
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,700
The sound of a car

286
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,600
It's the best

287
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,360
It's the sound of a car

288
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,460
The filled up car

289
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,120
planes in the world? Okay, our main force will be split into two groups. One will circle around

290
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,660
this way to cut off the enemy's retreat. The other will drive in this way, closing the trap.

291
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,940
It's a classic pincer's movement. It can't fail against a 10-year-old. Happy flying and

292
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,080
congratulations once again on the loudest, the fastest, and the farthest flying air pressure

293
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,280
plane in the world. Now, I'll see a wild blue yonder. I would not be surprised if in about a

294
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,020
year from now, we didn't see some serious civil disruption. Whether there'll be bombings,

295
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,080
whether there'll be attacks of biological weapons, whether there'll be something about,

296
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,540
I don't know if anybody's going to carry a suitcase nuclear weapon over here, but it could

297
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,360
happen. But we will see America become the target. And we are so open and we are so vulnerable

298
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,200
to this kind of activity. And this could, as it keeps going on, it could be just a

299
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,860
little momentary thing that we could get under control, which is possible. I hope it is. Or

300
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,440
it could get seriously out of hand and a lot of people get killed. And something much worse

301
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,020
than this happened, if it's due, that America is now weak, that other nations would start

302
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,140
piling on because they would identify us with Israel. Now, that could easily be kicked off

303
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,100
in the year 2002. Well, it's the event that ends it all.

304
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,920
Exactly.

305
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,660
I know I've got a job to do.

306
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,820
I've got my tie on.

307
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,040
I've picked my side. I've made my choice. I've got to have a gamble for you. I've got my tie on.

308
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,020
This is a black eye on the part of Lowry, and I don't care how you gave what you went into records.

309
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,240
Infirmation retrieval is an executive branch. We are proud of our reputation and we protect it.

310
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,560
Damn it, Lowry! That convoy of personnel carriers is still not accounted for. I thought I told you

311
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,260
to deal with it. What the hell is this mess? An empty desk is an efficient desk.

312
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,460
Good God! Queries from security. Searches from central banking about a check. Clarification

313
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,800
notices from accounting concerning unreturned receipts.

314
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,340
Mr. Warren, I have to find out.

315
00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,880
Shut up!

316
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,400
I don't know what's going on.

317
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,260
Air Hogs is now ready to fly the length of a football field. But remember, you must fly

318
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,160
it in a wide open space with lots of grass for soft landing.

319
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,760
Air Hogs!

320
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,460
My God, that maniac is heading straight for us!

321
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,260
I've got three of my big red tattoos throughout my head. I'll go as fast as I can. We're going

322
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,460
to do this.

323
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,260
I'm not an irrelant. I've got my title on this shirt and I'll strip like number five!

324
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,620
Luckily, the rat are in there. That man is not the one walking. Boom, man, there's a

325
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,100
fire in there. And it don't... that gun... that... everywhere, man. I don't know if so

326
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,260
many men run out of there. I don't know if he... they... they... they... they... they...

327
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,260


328
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,480
Check, man, you're only gonna be... coming down here...

329
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,560
Sir, you are going to have to speak more slowly. I cannot understand you.

330
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,740
Dang. Oh. Meg. Lo. Mark. And. Talk. Left. Down. Walk. That. Is. Boo!

331
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,240
Okay, folks. Show's over. Nothing to see here. Show's... Oh, my God! A horrible plane crash!

332
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,120
Hey, everybody! Get a load of this flaming wreckage! Come on, crowd around!

333
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,660
Crowd around. Don't be shy. Crowd around.

334
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,240
Well, Dad, now I'm going to get up and go to the airport. I'm going to go to my new home.

335
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,660
We have a new home.

336
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:20,660


337
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh, I'm right.

338
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,540
Oh, now I'm right.

339
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,200
If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.

340
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,520
Yes, gentlemen. They are on their way in and no one can bring them back. For the sake

341
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,240
of our country and our way of life, I suggest you get the rest of SAC in after them, otherwise

342
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,360
we will be totally destroyed by red retaliation. Uh, my boys will give you the best kind of

343
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,300
start. Fourteen hundred megatons worth, and you sure as hell won't stop them now.

344
00:19:50,560 --> 00:20:06,400
So let's get going. There's no other choice. God willing, we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health through the purity and essence of our natural fluids.

345
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,680
Hasta la vista, baby.

346
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,040
No, I don't know.

347
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,860
I know you're afraid.

348
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,660
I don't know.

349
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
I don't know.

350
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,840
What's happening?

351
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,140
We'll come out of this in the United States of America.

352
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,100
It's going to come much quicker than I did believe.

353
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,180
What plan will you follow now?

354
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,460
Plan nine.

355
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,700
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures.

356
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,800
Their soul is to control.

357
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,960
Our vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza.

358
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,820
Oh.

359
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,660
Oh.

360
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,760
Operator, give me the number for 911.

361
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,280
No.

362
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,380
What is it?

363
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,560
You have the right to remain silent.

364
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,440
Anything you say.

365
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,240
Blah, blah, blah.

366
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,380
Ladies and gentlemen of our TV satellite audience, I'm Dr. Michael Kiyosumi.

367
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,600
You are seeing this live around the world.

368
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,640
It's a remote.

369
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,080
Live is what is happening across the East River from New York City.

370
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,980
You are even better seats than these lucky Petrox King Kong contest winners invited here tonight.

371
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
And I got a special people.

372
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,260
They think you can be a hero.

373
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,300
Hey, when you're done with that, I got something up here.

374
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,680
You can.

375
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,260
Bye, Doc.

376
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,620
And why don't you beat me like a stinking puss bag?

377
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,580
Well, you got to call that number on a boot.

378
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,300
Sorry about that, guy.

379
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,500
They stick all that dirt in town alone.

380
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,060
That's it.

381
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,220
I'm coming over there.

382
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,540
Yeah.

383
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,560
You got to come over.

384
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,680
I got something for you.

385
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,320
I got something for you.

386
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,300
I got something for you.

387
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,300


388
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,920
Oh.

389
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh.

390
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,180
Oh.

391
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,720
Oh.

392
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,200


393
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,520
Oh.

394
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,700
Oh.

395
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:16,820


396
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,220
Only in New York.

397
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,280
And some of that out.

398
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,540
Bob, no fireworks.

399
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,240
Put that back.

400
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,580
You're the boss.

401
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Sorry, Sparrow.

402
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,640
Get out this time.

403
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,960
What in the hell was that?

404
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,700
Man has always loved his buildings.

405
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,080
But what happens when the buildings say no more?

406
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:32,860
The best part was when the buildings fell down.

407
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,540
Yeah.

408
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,360
Maybe people got hurt.

409
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,540
Hey, yeah.

410
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,360
And now, a Channel 6 editorial reply.

411
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,020
Boring.

412
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,080
Oh, shoot.

413
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,560
Oh, my God.

414
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,540
Maybe it just collapsed on its own.

415
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,940
We can't take that chance.

416
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,360
You always say that.

417
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,900
I want to take a chance.

418
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Collapsed on its own.

419
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,680
You...

420
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,780
This is all like a bad dream.

421
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,860
Citizens of Springfield,

422
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200
I officially declare this...

423
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,780
What the hell is that?

424
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,680
Are you all right?

425
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,180
Well, you don't deserve to be.

426
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,740
You were a...

427
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,060
You bloody stupid things.

428
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,260
How could you look at these people?

429
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
My God.

430
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,600
It was a bomb.

431
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,660
It was a bomb.

432
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,000
I should have opened it.

433
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,300
It was a tragic strike.

434
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,260
Something that we knew was going to happen.

435
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,020
It comes strictly out of that struggle in the Middle East

436
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,300
that we have been warning about.

437
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,320
As we've shown you the nexus, if you will,

438
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,520
between the terrorism, the Hezbollah, the Hamas,

439
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,600
the Islamic Jihad, and the other.

440
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,620
Self-inflicted.

441
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,040
Self-inflicted agony.

442
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,960
We call the Cassandra complex.

443
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,640
Cassandra, a Greek legend, recalls him down to know the future,

444
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,980
but to be disbelieved when she controlled it.

445
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,380
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge combined with the impotence to do anything about it.

446
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,820
You know something about these terrorists.

447
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,520
This is my lunch house.

448
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,960
Science is more like a clubhouse.

449
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,260
Tony knows the bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night.

450
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,180
He's ready for it.

451
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,720
Duck and cover.

452
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,440
I ducked your head.

453
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,600
I ducked your head.

454
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,720
Under your hands.

455
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,580
Because that way, naturally, if there's a nuclear holocaust and the ceiling caves in,

456
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,400
if you have your hands here, you'll be all right.

457
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,020
You know, I guess hands ricochet concrete.

458
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,200
Duck and cover.

459
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,200
Okay, let's see you duck and cover.

460
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,420
ласт

461
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,560
spectacular

462
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,440
But we're not d��고

463
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,140
because dando

464
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,700
?

465
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,880
The

466
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,560
Steward was a nickname which for some reason the pros applied to rocket bombs.

467
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,100
Winston promptly flung himself on his face.

468
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,480
The pros were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.

469
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,420
They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming,

470
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,120
although the rocket supposedly traveled faster than sound.

471
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,860
Winston clasped his forearms about his head.

472
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,760
There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave.

473
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,380
A shower of light objects pattered onto his back.

474
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,420
When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.

475
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,040
He walked on.

476
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,500
The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 meters up the street.

477
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:54,740
A black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins.

478
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,200
There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak.

479
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,580
When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist.

480
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,360
Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely covered in blood

481
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,820
that it was completely whitened as to resemble a plastered cat.

482
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,340
Can we have some more music please? I don't want to hear this stuff.

483
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,820
Can we hear more music?

484
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,840
Everything is beautiful in its own way.

485
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,820
That's good.

486
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,740
We will not allow this enemy to win the war by changing our way of life or restricting our freedoms.

487
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,060
Oh right, George, yeah.

488
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,000
Oh, like I can affect that.

489
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:45,280
Oh, jeez Louise, I can't believe how everything I touch is so unnaturally freighted with import.

490
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,300
Oh, it's a curse to be living in surreal time-seeker's land.

491
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,880
I am so glad we are all in this together, but...

492
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,480
Oh, it's unbelievable how I could be totally uninvolved in what's going on out there.

493
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
My material can be totally uninvolved.

494
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,140
The Simpsons are totally uninvolved.

495
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,940
WREK Atlanta.

496
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,260
We're all innocent bystanders in this drive-by shooting.

497
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,160
Oh my goodness, a curse it is to live in interesting times.

498
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,200
Oh, friends, to live in interesting times.

499
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,860
Yes, that was part one of Suzy the Floozy's First War Show.

500
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,540
Part two will come up next week.

501
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:46,100
All of it first broadcast on beautiful WREK, just as, back during the war, ESO Swamp Radio was broadcast on WCSB Cleveland.

502
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,420
See, he remembers the good war of the past.

503
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,760
When we fought, fought for freedom.

504
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,820
The freedom to pull down your pants and run through the streets screaming.

505
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,380
The freedom to criticize Mom's Thanksgiving turn.

506
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,960
And that lousy head wound that keeps festering.

507
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,800
Yeah, it's time to...

508
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,240
Yeah, it's time to get off.

509
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,820
Another girl, another planet.

510
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,980
It's time to leave this one behind.

511
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,360
See you around.

512
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,360
Yeah.

513
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,620
We are going to be having fun.

514
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,160
Do we really have to wait till July 5th?

515
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,240
I mean, will there be a... Brushwood might get hit. Yeah.

516
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,740
Oh, actually, we don't know when the end of the world might come.

517
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,600
It could come as Batman in the night.

518
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,920
Well...

519
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,340
It could come like the Joker or Batman, either one.

520
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,380
Riddler too?

521
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,800
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank.

522
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,200
It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air,

523
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,280
and the ghostly, terrible heat ray struck the town.

524
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,320
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted,

525
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,060
emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder.

526
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,120
Hula!

527
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,220
Hula!

528
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,460
Hula!

529
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,740
Hula!

530
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,140
Hula!

531
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,600
Hula!

532
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,000
The voice of the devil is heard in our land.

533
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,540
Somewhere, somewhere in spirit.

534
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,360
Listen, do you hear them drawing near in their search for the sinners?

535
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,640
Hula!

536
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm beating on the power of our fear and the evil within us.

537
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,600
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread.

538
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,100
When the demons arrive, oh, so long, we'll be better off dead.

539
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,240
There must be something worth living for.

540
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,460
Oh...

541
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,620
There must be something worth trying for

542
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,720
Even something worth dying for

543
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,460
And if one man could stand tall

544
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,680
There must be some hope for a soul

545
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,000
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

546
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

547
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,920
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit

548
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,240
Once there was a time when I believed without hesitation

549
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,220
That the power of love and truth could conquer all

550
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,200
In the name of salvation

551
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,880
Tell me what kind of work is love when it comes to the fight

552
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:20,860
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might

553
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,300
There must be something worth living for

554
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,920
No, there is nothing

555
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,720
There must be something worth trying for

556
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,420
I don't believe it's so

557
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,880
Even something worth dying for

558
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,600
And if one man could stand tall

559
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,800
There must be some hope for a soul

560
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,080
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

561
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,300
Didn't I warn that this would happen?

562
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,740
Be on your guard, I said

563
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

564
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,100
There must be something worth living for

565
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:17,320
There must be something worth living for

566
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,840
Now darkness has descended on our land

567
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,200
And all your prayers cannot save us

568
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,920
Like fools we've let the devil take command

569
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,720
Of the souls that God gave us

570
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,580
To the altar of evil like lambs

571
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,380
To the slaughter of a lamb

572
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,240
When the demons arrive

573
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,280
The silver elbows will empty the dead

574
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,540
There must be something worth living for

575
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,120
There is a curse on mankind

576
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,920
There must be something worth trying for

577
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,920
We may as well be resigned

578
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,100
Even something worth dying for

579
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,840
And if one man could stand tall

580
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,060
There must be some hope for a soul

581
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,600
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of

582
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,260
Bob?

583
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,460

Thank you.

617

Thank you.

618
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,180
Thank you.

619
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,820
Thank you.

620
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,300
Thank you.

621
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,240
Thank you.

622
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,840
Thank you.

623
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,540
Thank you.

624
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,920
Pakistan.

625
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,060
Pakistan.

626
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,320
Don't you give in

627
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,600
to the Taliban.

628
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,480
You have

629
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,500
really got to understand.

630
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,360
And who can forget this reworked chestnut.

631
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,360
Germ

632
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,140
warfare.

633
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,180
It's a

634
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,580
bad idea.

635
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,820
I hope

636
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,440
it don't come here.

637
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:52,600
No.

638
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,540
Plus, you'll hear

639
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,460
I've been nodding all night, my butt's wet

640
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,180
on the hump.

641
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,220
I'm a faithful

642
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,920
one, I can't blame gum.

643
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,500
And if you order now, we'll throw in this

644
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,740
once again relevant classic.

645
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,320
And I wonder, still I

646
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,460
wonder, who will

647
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,840
stop me saying.

648
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,400

Offshore

653
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,300
Trawler at C.

654
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,540
Do it today.

655
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,500
Nostril

656
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,340
Dingus, whose name really means

657
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,300
Our Lady Man. I don't know if you thought of that

658
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,260
because it's a silly name anyway,

659
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,980
but she predicted all this.

660
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,620
Does slag

661
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,080
have any relation to slack?

662
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,240
Yeah, that's kind of

663
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,920
important to know right now in these toxic times.

664
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,160
Everything.

665
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,700
Everything has relation to slack,

666
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,540
depending on whether there's too much

667
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,820
or not enough of it.

668
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,040
Do you have your radio up?

669
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,140
Not me.

670
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,320
Where we are struggling

671
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,000
to fight a war against

672
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
things we cannot see.

673
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,460
Invisible birds.

674
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,180
Large, invisible parrots

675
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,760
that whisper strange commands

676
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,160
into our ears. It is time

677
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,820
for all Americans to stand

678
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,560
erect as monkeys can

679
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,060
and hold one genuflecting

680
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,800
fist into their own eye.

681
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,440
And scream at the top of its

682
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,920
lungs as well as it can.

683
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,460
I made a picture of a

684
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,640
red, white, and blue bob doing just that.

685
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,120
Oh, praise Bob.

686
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,200
Just tearing himself

687
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,260
up in a rage of war

688
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,960
lust. Praise Bob.

689
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,820
Killing himself in

690
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,200
an intense

691
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,300
fury of patriotic

692
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,060
fervor. So, Stang,

693
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
when I fly

694
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,180
my rocket

695
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,840
into

696
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:47,840


697
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,380
into

698
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:49,920
the hot

699
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,540
triple A,

700
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,100
and when I'm flying my rocket into the hot tub,

701
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,980
and if I scream out

702
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,740
praise Bob at the last minute,

703
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,980
do I get 70 virgins?

704
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,000
There are no virgins

705
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,860
in the church of the subgenius.

706
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,120
You can imagine they're virgins.

707
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,740
Yeah, you know.

708
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,820
There are even 75 seconds.

709
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,740
Oh, I forgot. There's not 70 virgins in the church.

710
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,620
No. There's not 70 females.

711
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,820
You could have

712
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,980
70 large eunuchs, I think.

713
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,020
And we're creating,

714
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,880
virgins all the time.

715
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,760
Oh, well, then why can't I have 70 of them?

716
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,180
Well, you can. You just may have to wait a while.

717
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,380
This process takes a while.

718
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,400
You have to totally

719
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,380
re-reconvert and totally retrofit

720
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,800
each individual virgin.

721
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,160
They've all got a past that has to be

722
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,740
forgotten, let's just say.

723
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:38,740
Retrofit.

724
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,080
I don't know why the Taliban

725
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,480
takes it out on the U.S. anyway.

726
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,620
They should be taking it out on the sun.

727
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,980
The sun makes life on Earth. If they hate life so much,

728
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,840
go fly a plane into the sun.

729
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,860
Go piss in the sun.

730
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,080
Well, they distinguish between life

731
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,120
and holy or approved life,

732
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,760
which they know is right,

733
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,260
according to, well,

734
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,100
that guy that said he read it in that book.

735
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,220
And they think they've got

736
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,400
fanaticism tied up.

737
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,720
We've got people who cut their nuts off

738
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,980
and killed themselves

739
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,500
trying to get on the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet.

740
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,520
That is true.

741
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,220
I mean, come on now.

742
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,940
Let's very seriously think

743
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,720
Americans got that Taliban stuff

744
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,300
beat out big time, man.

745
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,260
We cut our nuts off.

746
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,880
You can go chasing after UFOs.

747
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,580
Speak for yourself.

748
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,940
Chaz, I think that's the side America is showing to them

749
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,560
today and the rest of the world

750
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,780
as we sit here on our own onion paper

751
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,440
waiting for the squids to fly.

752
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,080
It's going to be a long and harduous journey

753
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,760
from here to wherever we're going.

754
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
It could take a matter of years or even minutes.

755
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:37,880
Yeah.

756
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,980
Are you prepared as an American?

757
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,980
Are you prepared as a Belgian Frenchman?

758
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,200
They're basically saying

759
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,880
you're going to have to put up with having your phone tapped

760
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,360
Yeah.

761
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,620
red for two years.

762
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,160
Yeah.

763
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,500
I got that.

764
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,340
I did get that.

765
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,240
Well, they are patrolling Lake Erie.

766
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,800
The orange boats are out on the lake.

767
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,920
Yeah, yeah.

768
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,100
They are looking for very good swimmers.

769
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,460
It is kind of cold this time of year,

770
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,020
but we keep on huffing and puffing away.

771
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,440
Well, you know, that's no joke.

772
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,360
There's terror on.

773
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,480
Well, Chaz and I used to run...

774
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,900
I was watching the news tonight

775
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,180
and you know what form terror takes?

776
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,760
Tiny animated light spots on a map on TV.

777
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Yes.

778
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,560
You see this map of a country

779
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,760
and there's these little animated cartoon airplanes

780
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,280
and little bright spots that go,

781
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,820
oh, here's a munitions dump.

782
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,040
I don't know what else they could show

783
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,460
besides talking heads.

784
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,100
Then Major Slapwell sleeps well the rest of the night.

785
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,480
After dropping all his effusisms

786
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,520
and thinking hardly on his wife and doggie,

787
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,500
he passes into a deep slumber,

788
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,380
never remembering.

789
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,280
Never remembering or forgetting

790
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,540
those flashing green lights below him.

791
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,140
Well, you know, there's some brave soldiers

792
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,840
going over there

793
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,800
and there's some brave protesters over here.

794
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,460
Think about the brave hairdressers.

795
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,320
And I totally, totally support those brave soldiers

796
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,260
and those brave people who dare to question

797
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,980
the government and the media.

798
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,420
Can you believe somebody would question

799
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,140
our American media and our American government

800
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,800
Can you imagine?

801
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,220
Can you imagine?

802
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,900
I'm like this.

803
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,340
Well, I think that the part of what those soldiers

804
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,400
are so bravely fighting to defend

805
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,080
is the right of those protesters

806
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,380
to question authority.

807
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,140
Exactly.

808
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,340
And the only ones that I really want to kill

809
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,940
besides the terrorists who killed my countrymen

810
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,980
are the chicken shits that sit there

811
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,660
saying we're going to go kick some ass.

812
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
And what they mean is a bunch of young people

813
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,180
that they don't even know

814
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,180
are going to be forced to go risk

815
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,600
getting their asses kicked.

816
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,480
Yeah.

817
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,240
And it just makes me so mad

818
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,740
to hear these fat cats use the word we.

819
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
Yeah, they always do.

820
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,260
When they're the kind of people, you know them.

821
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,140
You know, they're the kind that wouldn't have been allowed

822
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,900
in the military even if they had wanted to join.

823
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,700
They're taking their Viagra shots

824
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,920
and passing more bills to kill more people.

825
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,820
Well, so am I, but...

826
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,180
Well, of course you, you know.

827
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,440
Yeah.

828
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,440
Well, I'm not called upon to have great cojones right now

829
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,260
because I'm a 4F civilian.

830
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,100
So, you know, you and me and Chaz were too old to be in that.

831
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,420
That picture.

832
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,400
And we aren't talking about how we're going to kick some ass.

833
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,320
The adventures of Trent Lott.

834
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:25,500
No.

835
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,660
In the foxhole.

836
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,700
There's some hard-working soldiers

837
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,260
that are going to have to do any ass kicking.

838
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,580
Right.

839
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,860
A lot of top gun boys.

840
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
And I hope that they don't have to do very much.

841
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:36,660
Trent!

842
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,020
I hope they don't have to hardly...

843
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,080
I hope they have to kick only a specific...

844
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,780
I'm over here.

845
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,840
I'm over here.

846
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,240
I heard they're whipping out the 5,000-pound bunker busters.

847
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,360
Two and a half tons of pure shot lead.

848
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:48,700
Yeah.

849
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,380
The much-vaunted...

850
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,060
Glory for...

851
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,380
Starbusters.

852
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,580
Jehovah.

853
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,500
I can't even imagine all of that stuff.

854
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,940
They drill down like 200 feet into the mountain

855
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,760
and blow up anything that's inside the mountain.

856
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,160
Tonight in the arena, it's Jehovah versus Allah.

857
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:02,680
What?

858
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,420
Two different names for the same great guy

859
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,160
beating the piss out of himself in front of us.

860
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,720
It's good.

861
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,720
Well, now we've got something to...

862
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,500
The towel.

863
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,900
...to stage at 5X Day, although...

864
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,140
Yeah.

865
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,800
Hopefully, that'll be old history by then.

866
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,980
Well, you know,

867
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,440
you might have got your wish.

868
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,240
Everything might be old history by then

869
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,340
if these fellows continue confabulating their arguments

870
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,540
with teeth and hair.

871
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,720
Because human beings should give each other a smooch,

872
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,480
maybe drop on the floor and pass out for a couple minutes,

873
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,700
wake up into, like, a world of flowers and dingles.

874
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,480
Well, Dave, I think that's unrealistic idealism,

875
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,220
and I'm not a pacifist,

876
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,540
but I will kill anyone who hassles my pacifist war protester buddies.

877
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,660
Those are the rules.

878
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,520
Those are the rules against the lightning.

879
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,800
They haven't seen the heat wave yet.

880
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,560
For my part, I would like to touch on the recent current events

881
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,580
to help explain how they fit in the grand scheme of things.

882
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,300
The recent tragedy in New York, of course,

883
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,520
is for long-time listeners,

884
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,860
no big surprise.

885
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,800
We predicted for years some sort of terrorist attack

886
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,700
that the conspiracy would muster, or allow to happen,

887
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,540
in order to clamp down and snatch away

888
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,300
those few remaining liberties at large.

889
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,920
Look how the lemmings beg for greater control,

890
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,600
greater security.

891
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,880
Oh, polls indicate that the average American

892
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,900
is willing to give up his privacy,

893
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,920
the civil rights, and the Bill of Rights,

894
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,580
if it will make them feel safer.

895
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,260
Even the infamous security cameras,

896
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,980
with face-recognizing technology,

897
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,220
surrounding us here in Ybor City.

898
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,500
They're no longer controversial.

899
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,720
Ho ho ho ho!

900
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,700
Their placement is a fait accompli!

901
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,780
These cameras will start appearing in every public place,

902
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,460
throughout the U.S.,

903
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,920
from the public library to the public bathroom.

904
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,880
Just you watch and see.

905
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:18,880


906
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,300
They'll be watching and seeing you a lot more from here on out.

907
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,780
The passwords to all the encryption technology

908
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,580
that the governments wanted for years

909
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,800
so that they could spy on your email.

910
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,060
Ha ha ha ha ha!

911
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,660
Oh, they couldn't get it before,

912
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,540
but now just you try to stop them!

913
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,200
And, of course, racial profiling.

914
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,700
It was political suicide in August,

915
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,560
but now in September, ha ha ha,

916
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,180
it's suddenly, oh, a sensible precaution.

917
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,940
A few more attacks, my friends,

918
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,300
and the pink public won't be satisfied

919
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,900
until we've recreated the motion picture of Brazil!

920
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,980
All this is necessary, my friends,

921
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,920
because the conspiracy knows that the end times are near.

922
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,160
They sense their time of terror is up,

923
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,980
and Bob's liberation forces,

924
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,940
to free a planet Earth, are fast approaching.

925
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,760
No corporation, no government,

926
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,440
and no Islamic fundamentalist can prevent it!

927
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,760
Give me an amen!

928
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,800
Amen!

929
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,020
If we didn't let the Christian fundamentalists,

930
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,500
with their TV networks,

931
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,960
their countless billions,

932
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,080
and their moral majority, stop Bob,

933
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,900
you think we're gonna allow some,

934
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,720
some glorified Persian rug dealer to stop him?

935
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,100
Hell no!

936
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,420
The only jihad that's going to conquer this planet

937
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,800
is the one led by Ayatollah Bob Dogg!

938
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,100
And that's going to occur, as planned,

939
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,360
on July 5th, 1998!

940
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,080
Do I hear a praise Bob?

941
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,100
Praise Bob!

942
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,040
Praise Bob!

943
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,140
Now I know there are some infidels in the audience

944
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,980
who still don't believe...

945
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,100
Bobby!

946
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,460
Watch Bob!

947
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,580
We're too small, they say.

948
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,340
The conspiracy's too strong, they say.

949
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,900
1998 has come and gone, they say.

950
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,080
To them, I say this.

951
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,100
Have you ever heard of

952
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,240
Exis allies from outer space?

953
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:42,540
Or,

954
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,720
a certain subgenius phenomenon we call

955
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,340
time control?

956
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,420
You see,

957
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,220
size doesn't matter.

958
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,240
And dates don't matter.

959
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,980
Only Dobbs matters!

960
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,900
The more impossible his mission,

961
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,880
the more certain he will carry it out!

962
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,340
So let the conspiracy fortify itself

963
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,820
and prepare for war.

964
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,320
Let the West nuke the East,

965
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,480
and let the East retaliate in kind.

966
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,180
Go ahead!

967
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,460
Destroy our planet!

968
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,340
We don't care!

969
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,720
You, me, and the other subgeniuses,

970
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,920
we won't even be here!

971
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,480
We'll be watching the fireworks

972
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,520
from sub-space orbit,

973
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,720
while flapping our frap,

974
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,520
biffing our babes,

975
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,740
and praising Bob!

976
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:29,420
Amen!

977
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,200
Woo!

978
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,360
Woo!

979
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,120
Woo!

980
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,380
Woo!

981
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:34,960
Woo!

982
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,400
Woo!

983
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:35,700
Woo!

984
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:35,920
Woo!

985
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,180
Woo!

986
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,180


987
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,520
Woo!

988
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,280
As I hasten through Cotton Garden,

989
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,920
Blackfriars, and Billingsgate,

990
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,080
more and more people join the painful exodus.

991
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,160
Sad, weary women,

992
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,980
their children stumbling and streeped with tears,

993
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,100
their men bitter and angry,

994
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,680
the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts.

995
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,180
Dogs snarled and whined,

996
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,880
the horses' bits were covered with foam,

997
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,160
and here and there were wounded soldiers,

998
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,480
as helpless as the rest.

999
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,360
The

1000
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,820
We saw tripods wading up the Thames,

1001
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,540
cutting through bridges as though they were paper.

1002
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,720
Waterloo Bridge, Westminster Bridge.

1003
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,640
One appeared above Big Ben.

1004
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,620
Oh, the last!

1005
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,460
Oh, no, no!

1006
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,840
Never before in the history of the world

1007
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,100
had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together.

1008
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,440
This was no disciplined march,

1009
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,980
it was a stampede.

1010
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,920
without order and without a goal,

1011
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,960
six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong.

1012
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,520
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,

1013
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,960
of the massacre of mankind.

1014
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,560
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,

1015
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,040
the massacre of mankind.

1016
00:53:34,000 --> 00:54:01,940
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,

1017
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:31,940
the massacre of mankind.

1018
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,660
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,

1019
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:35,660


1020
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,080
It was the beginning of the rout of civilization,

1021
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,560
the massacre of mankind.

1022
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,180
And I think that they should just give all that money to me.

1023
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,480
I'll give it to Bob, and Bob will know what to do with it.

1024
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,780
He'll make it grow.

1025
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,900
He'll plant that seed.

1026
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,800
It's a financial prosperity.

1027
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,880
Let's keep things in perspective here, kids.

1028
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,680
Let's keep things in perspective.

1029
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,780
Bob's got that shovel.

1030
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,720
He's got his entrenching tool and his helmet on,

1031
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,800
and he's digging his way through that berm.

1032
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,620
He's going to get.

1033
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,920
Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler, Osama Bin Laden,

1034
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,880
and Joe Stalin, and A.N.,

1035
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,180
General George Armstrong, Custer,

1036
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,300
all line up against the wall and blow their heads off.

1037
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,400
Praise Bob.

1038
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,240
Bob will.

1039
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,800
And here come the monsters.

1040
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,320
Human mutations growing from out of the earth

1041
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,160
with concrete-like heads capable of smashing in your door

1042
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,180
and having sex with your mom and dad.

1043
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,240
These evil creatures.

1044
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,240
They're not at all costs.

1045
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,920
And speaking of costs, send me one dollar, please.

1046
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,120
All you kids out there under the age of 45,

1047
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,540
reach down deep into your pool cue

1048
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,680
and snap up a turtle and land it right on my doorstep.

1049
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,200
No.

1050
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,060
What?

1051
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,640
Well, I just had to let go of that.

1052
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,360
I wish I could let go like you, Dave.

1053
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,820
I wish I could be so uninhabited and just.

1054
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,340
Well, Dave.

1055
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,340
Dave's kind of like Mr. Ed.

1056
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,280
Yeah, I'm like.

1057
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,880
I just let one go.

1058
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,980
He's a cross between Mr. Ed and Forrest Gump.

1059
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
And Pan.

1060
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,100
Pan, Forrest Gump, and Mr. Ed.

1061
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,760
And also, and also your mean algebra teacher

1062
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,140
who was always chewing on something

1063
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,520
you could never figure out what it was

1064
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,700
and he'd jump up and he'd slap you.

1065
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,180
Think of it that way if you'd like.

1066
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,720
I may have to teach you a valuable lesson

1067
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,720
about your own brain, Stang.

1068
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:27,960
Yes, sir.

1069
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,220
A valuable lesson.

1070
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,300
Yes, sir, I'm listening.

1071
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,140
Your brain.

1072
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,580
Your brain as an actual organ does not exist.

1073
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,320
Oh.

1074
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,140
Inside the vast columns of your head

1075
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,920
is merely air, nitrogen,

1076
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,120
and other subterfugeous gases.

1077
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,240
Are you sure?

1078
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,680
Shown here on the left,

1079
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,400
lovely Miss Marjorie Turks

1080
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,960
is taking her crew on a tour through your head.

1081
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,420
She's got big knifes.

1082
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,400
Oh, yes.

1083
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,720
Now it's time for the Ferris wheel.

1084
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,540
First, all the ferrets are being lined up

1085
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,280
and their teeth are razor sharpened.

1086
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,480
Yes.

1087
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,420
I did it.

1088
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,600
They're going to be ripping your flesh in a real...

1089
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,180
Oh, and now it's time to watch the alligators roll by.

1090
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,680
Yes, they've got toxic fluids on their fangs.

1091
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,700
Look, they're evolving.

1092
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,180
Yes, yes.

1093
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,460
They're turning into dinosaurs.

1094
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,880
Yes, yes.

1095
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,420
I like this parade.

1096
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,720
This is better than that war.

1097
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,620
Yes, and now they're turning into

1098
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,360
huge, huge instruments of destruction.

1099
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,080
So just sit back and...

1100
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,760
Oh, shoot.

1101
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,820
It turned into one of those metaphorical sci-fi things.

1102
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:31,320
Yeah.

1103
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,860
We've got to be cutting out of here, kids.

1104
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,640
We've got to be cutting out of here.

1105
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm going to go to the zoo.

1106
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,800
We're going to uncut this tree.

1107
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,640
Until next week,

1108
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,040
that old wheel's going to roll around again.

1109
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:40,520
That's right.

1110
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,580
It's going to roll around once more.

1111
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,540
Hey, keep your hat on tight.

1112
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,280
You're back to the winning.

1113
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
You're sacking the saddle.

1114
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,520
Reverend Einstein.

1115
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,000
Lonesome.

1116
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,820
What are you going to say?

1117
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,540
I'm going to go to the world tonight.

1118
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,640
I'm just kidding.

1119
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,520
Guido just kind of sitting there watching it all.

1120
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,800
And Maria just sitting back there looking good.

1121
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,900
When love is gone.

1122
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,520
Wishing we were spracking deutsch.

1123
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,900
We'll see y'all, kids.

1124
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,340
Take care.

1125
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,120
You're left alone to pay the price is high.

1126
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,220
But somehow you'll survive.

1127
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,720
Don't give in.

1128
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,940
That old wheel will roll around again.

1129
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,760
That old wheel is going to roll around once more.

1130
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,060
When it does, it will even up the score.

1131
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,440
Don't be weak.

1132
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,720
As they sow, they will reap.

1133
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,800
Burn the other cheek.

1134
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,040
And don't give in.

1135
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,220
That old wheel will roll around again.

1136
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,840
Roll on.

1137
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,920
Don't give in.

1138
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,560
Don't give in.

1139
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:31,080
Around the world is going to near me down.

1140
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:31,120
I've shoot you in all the ways.

1141
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120


1142
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120


1143
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120


1144
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120


1145
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120


1146
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,120


1147
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,920
Help me workout.

1148
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,900
And when it does

1149
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,200
It's gonna even up the score

1150
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,380
Don't be weak

1151
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,660
As they sow they will reap

1152
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,060
Turn the other cheek and don't give in

1153
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,220
That old wheel will roll around again

1154
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,740
That old wheel

1155
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,620
Yeah, that old wheel

1156
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,960
Is gonna roll around much more

1157
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,100
When it does

1158
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,220
When it does

1159
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,240
It will even up the score

1160
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,640
Don't be weak

1161
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,600
Don't be weak

1162
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,860
As they sow they will reap

1163
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,100
Turn the other cheek and don't give in

1164
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,420
Don't give in

1165
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,440
That old wheel will roll around again

1166
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,780
Roll around and around again

1167
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,820
Again
