You find out about Bob.
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.
Have I mentioned I'm immense and immortal?
Station Bremen and station DXB on the 31 meter band.
You are about to hear our news in English.
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.
All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up.
You're a loony.
You're not going crazy.
You're going sane in a crazy world.
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.
This man is no ordinary man.
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.
There can be only one.
Ooh, spooky.
Yeah, whatever.
And now, here with an unlimited supply of misinformation is Bob.
Okay, man, start it up.
You haven't heard it?
You mean to tell me that you haven't heard it?
No, I haven't heard it.
Here, play it.
It's really true.
Terrific.
When you hear it.
Excuse me, ladies.
I have a special request.
Perversion for profit.
A flood tide of filth is engulfing our country in the form of newsstand obscenity.
It is threatening to pervert an entire generation of our American children.
Do you want your son enticed into the world of homosexuals?
Or your daughter lured into lesbianism?
Do you want either of them to discover how to get sexual gratification by inflicting pain on themselves or by torturing other people?
Perversion for profit.
Perversion for profit.
Do you want your children stimulated?
Do you want your children stimulated?
What is fetishism?
The costuming and the significance of the extreme spiked heel and the tight boot.
The burning cigarettes.
The lace leather garments.

Abnormal sex practices of every kind,

the burning cigarette.
The worship of the whip.
The riding trough. Rubber and leather garment.
Her version of trough.
There were shepherds in the same country, wrapped in strips of cloth,
and keeping watch by night over their feeding trough.
Behold, two young pigeons stood by them.
The pigeons said to them,
When is a dobshead not a dobshead?
Not a dobshead.
Not a dobshead, friends.
When it's be dobs hide.

The background music for this show is from the new album
album by our friends
the Flyin' Ryan
Brothers. An album called
Legacy, and their address
will be coming up too. And this is
the Hour of
Slackulator.
This particular one is the
Love episode.
Love is not that odd
of a subject matter for some
genii, due to its similarity
on the luck plane to
Slack.
Yes,
love and Slack often
go hand in hand.
Since time
immemorial,
love has been one of the golden
carrots of the
subgenius. For instance,
what
do you think is playing
at the Roxy?
What's playing
at the Roxy? I'll tell you what's
playing at the Roxy. A picture about
a Minnesota man so in love with a Mississippi
girl that he sacrifices
everything and moves all the way to
Biloxi. That's
what's playing at the Roxy.
What's in the daily news?
I'll tell you what's in the daily news.
Story about a guy who bought his
wife a small ruby with what
otherwise would have been his union dues.
That's what's in the daily
news. What's happening
all over? I'll tell you what's
happening all over. Guy sitting at
home by a television set who used to be
something of a rover.
That's what's happening all over.
Love
is a thing that has licked him
and it looks like Nathan's
just another victim.
Yes sir, when you see
a guy reach for stars
in the sky, you can
bet that he's doing it for
some doll.
When you spot a John
waiting out in the rain,
chances are he's insane
as only a John can be for a
Jane. When you meet
a gent paying
all kinds of rent
for a flat that could flatten
a Taj Mahal.
Call it sad, call
it funny, but it's better than
even money that the guy's
only doing it for some
doll.
When you see a Joe
saving half of his dough,
you can bet they'll be
making it for some doll.
When a bum
buys wine like a bum
can't afford,
it's a cinch that the bum is under
the thumb of some little bra.
When you meet a mug
lately out of the
jug, and he's still
lifting platinum,
fa'al diral.
Call it hell, call it heaven,
it's a probable twelve to seven
that the guy's only
doing it for some doll.
When you see
a sport, and his
cash has run short, you
can bet that he's banking
it with some doll.
When a guy wears
tails with the front gleaming white,
who the hell do you
think he's tickling pink on
Saturday night?
When a lazy slob
takes a good steady job,
and he smells from
Vitalis and Barbasol.
Call it dumb,
call it clever,
but you can get odds forever
that the guy's only doing it
for some doll, some doll,
some doll, the guy's only
doing it for some doll.
For some doll!
Stubby K, dear friends,
guys and dolls from the
1951 musical
of the same name.
Ah, love, love,
love, part of love
is, of course,
sex.
And the bonobo
yeti buried within each subgenie,
it must have come
sproinging out as displayed
by Lemur as he
manipulates the god
Shatner into sexing
his crew.
Human flesh against human
flesh and blood. No, not on me.
On you, lieutenant.
That's where our duty lies.
How can I? Man or woman, it makes
no difference. You know so much
of love.
And the only thing that's truly you
is.
It's the wonderful bathing suit.
Enterprise to Kirk, Captain.
Enterprise, Enterprise.
Come in, Kirk, Captain.
Kirk, Captain.
Not all of us are satisfied with having them feel too hard.
Captain, we've got to do something.
We were doing something.
Got any more good ideas, Jim?
How can I? Increase my breast size
and not gain weight anywhere else.
We can fire our phaser banks.
That's how you do it, lieutenant. What's happened to her?
We better get used to it. Go.
It's smaller bus.
You think that mysterious organ could have something to do with the
transmission of energy?
What's happened to her?
Well?
He wants us to just love it when a man
comes up and flirts with you.
He'll give us increasing bus sizes
too. Then I'd better handle it.
Perhaps if I assist it.
Captain. Yes?
I would recommend a discreet
distance. What?
You alright?
Oh, yes, I'm alright.
I have an all-natural hormone stimulant for you.
And you will supply the clothes.
Captain. Captain.
Captain.
Yes, I know. I know, Scotty.
I know. I know.
Nothing abnormal at all.
I don't believe it.
Well, the dogs and cats
were living together.
Raps and raccoons, birds of a feather.
Excessuous beasts,
provocating freaks.
Sitting with their hooves and their horns and their beaks.
It's morally wrong.
It's morally wrong.
It's deplorably wrong.
Abnormally wrong.
It's morally wrong.
It's a morally wrong.
Philosophically at the clip.
Morally wrong.
Well, betting on a horse that you know is gonna win.
Eating chocolate cake when you're trying to stay thin.
Shooting the bird at the holly pole.
And smoking that loco.
I go dope.
Well, it's morally wrong.
It's morally wrong.
It's traditionally wrong.
Unconditionally wrong.
It's morally wrong.
It's a morally wrong.
It's philosophically wrong.

And now, a message from
Amy Leamer.
Hello, everybody.
My name is Amy,
and I have an important message for you.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...

Uh...
This has been another fine message from the Anti-Sex League.
Thank you for listening.
And, oh yeah, my name is Amy.
To.
Mark Mothersbaugh.
And now, The Rainmakers.
Who am I? I don't know. I have no idea.
When my friends look at me, I wonder who they think they're seeing.
Search me, layer by layer.
But inside, I'm afraid you'll find thin air.
Hey, yes, guess again.
We might be underneath this skin.
What makes me...
How should I know?
I've been trained like a monkey.
The bell rings and I start to jones like a junkie.
What turns me on?
I wish I knew.
Wish I could tell the real thing.
My honest desire from my conditioning.
Touch me now, now touch me again.
I want to feel something real coming through this skin.
I've been boxing with my friends.





My shadow ended and tagged.
I can't punch my way out of a paper bag.
It's as thick as you think.
Thin as the reasoning you bought.
I'm a mummy wrapped in a gauze of my own thoughts.
And I want to know who I'd be if I never had bathed in the static, the snow, and the radio wave.
The flickering image.
The pandering thought that's been passed off and on to be the blueprint of God.
Hey, yes, yes, again.
We might be if we could shed this skin.
There.
I really am all right.
You're Mildred the Almore Woman.
You gotta understand that I really am all right.
You can understand how a girl, even if she is nice, can get into a lot of trouble.
I am nice, aren't I?
Sure.
I'd like to play dolls with you.
Hello, honey.
Hello, honey.

Get up.
Aren't you gonna speak to me, honey?
Get up.
Oh, don't look so surprised.
That wasn't you, the felon.
The light that was just...
He doesn't like you anymore, Mildred.
We don't like tin horns around here.
Oh, yes, he does, don't you, honey?
Get up.
You...
He's gonna kill you, Mildred.
Please, please, please get me out of here.
Take me with you.
We don't like tin horns.
Who?
Every time you look at a man, he falls over, doesn't he?
Get up.
I got into trouble, but I really didn't.

I really am a nice girl.
You can understand how a girl, even if she is nice, can get into a lot of trouble.
Sure.
I'd like to play it with you.
Carlos, you losers can help yourself to what's on the table.
Cut it out, will you?
He'll get me.
Shut up.
Get up.
Get up.
Those things happen sometimes.
So please, don't let Bob keep you from having nothing.
But it's wonderful.
Shut up.
He'll get me.
Shut up.
Bob is what you have been waiting for.
He'll get me.
Shut up.
Bob is what you have been waiting for.
He'll get me.



He'll get me.
Shut up.
He'll get me.
Shut up.
The giant beaver was no different.
Are you like the giant beaver, my friend?
Well, Fernanda Dan Delimere cut that up, but now Sain Alio or Stalio has a message just
for you, the listener.
Take your clothes off.
Take your clothes off.
Take your clothes off.
We don't have to take off
We have a good time

Put your panties back on I look to the seven put your panties back on I look to the seven
Put your panties back on you two
Can't even take a shower
with a beautiful woman
Without wearing your jeans
He refused to take his clothes off
Let's go to Bob right now hi Bob. Hi well I I have a
past of
homosexuality
however, I don't deal in that anymore and
I have anxiety
And I suffer from depression hmm however I
Love Bob and I live for him
Amen, I wish I was attracted to ladies Bob, but I'm most I can do is be a friend to them
Well, you know
It's never too late Bob
It's never too late never too late
I tell you what you know you pick up the newspapers all the time you had to read about these guys getting married in 80s and 90s
So it's never too late. You know Bob. I want to testify so bad. I believe in this stuff
It's not exactly easy to listen to with all the screaming, but it's no condemnation towards that because it's necessary
It made me feel uneasy
in
my body
But you know what I mean yeah, oh yeah, well, I mean you're you're watching a
Supernatural battle devils and angels going at it. I mean it's intense. I know it's intense
But isn't it wonderful when these folks get free and they're jumping up and down. Yeah
Smile on their face Benny and Bob
You can watch his boat one o'clock central two o'clock Eastern Bob appreciate you Bob bless you. Thank you so very much

Okay, let's rap, man. Remember in the 70s you used to say, let's rap and stuff like that?
I didn't actually say that.
Did you just ever?
I didn't say that until it was sort of camp to say that in the 90s, then I oversaid it.
Did you ever get one of those rubber mallets and just bang on your wagon until you cried
and then maybe take pictures of it and stuff?
Were you ever in a rap session?
I've never seen experiments with hitting themselves like that.

You come on in with a body stick
And a finger in your nose
You pick a bug around
And wipe it on your nose
You don't know how you feel
One way or another
You need to make sure
You're happy and white
Without your brother
You're driving in your car
And you're looking at the light
And I heard it's from a star
So I can save her in the day
She's pulling, she's tugging
She's shaking on the sleigh
It's a long time of dreams
But you make her do the brain

If you relax the rubber band quickly
While it's between your lips
It's distinctly cool
I was praying last night
When an angel broke the light
He said, I'm gonna have to put you on hold
For a time
I said, hold like hell
Let me talk to the boss
He said, sorry, slow consider
It's the boss's day off
And I realized then
That the wages of sin was too high
Two bucks an hour
And working weekends
I was ignoring the fee
He was latched to the cross and cried
Help me get this son of a bitch off
I said I would if I could
I can't so I won't
Well, I wouldn't want you messing your hair up
So don't
And I realized then
That the wages of sin
Was all the lumber you can carry
All the nails you can bend
The wages of sin
The reward of fear
It's worrying and threatening
Every second of the year
And heaven is guilt
No sex and no show
And I'm not sure
If I really wanna go
Oh
Five times if you believe me
Could I ever imagine
A day where you WOMAN
Ae in between


The wages of sin
Sh mening theée
For a sue
Every brawl
And a mental pull
Like free stuff

The grandesande
And has comebacked
You're God and country kind
One gets your body
The other gets your mind
Mary, Mary Magdalene
How about a date?
You've been wasting your time
Staying up so late
Your boyfriend's dead
The word is you're a whore
Just about then I heard a knock on the door
And I realized then that the wages of sin
Was a bad reputation and too many friends
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
The wages of sin
