1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,480
Okay, let's get this show opened up and started up somehow.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,140
There we go.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,660
Oh, wait a minute.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,540
Oh, no.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,340
No, no, no, no, do that now.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,940
Introducing.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Oh, thank you.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,540
Hey, Arthur.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
Yes, thank you, dear friends.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,980
It is I, he, who is, uh...

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,440
No, no.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,240
What?

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,120
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,880
This show is all...

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,120
I didn't mean...

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,660
Okay.

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,740
Okay.

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,140
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

22
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,920
which reaches from the inner mind to...

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,860
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,600
Dear Mr. Bob,

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,320
this is my first time to ride any radio station

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,300
and you are my favorite announcer.

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,940
I feel like I've known you.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,440
I've listened to you for years.

29
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,960
Now, you don't know me.

30
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,660
I ain't nobody.

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,420
Just a plain, ordinary working man.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
As I got off work today

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,260
from the plant where I've been for pretty near 22 years,

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,380
I joined the boys to have a couple of beers

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,780
and...

36
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,100
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,400
I kind of shoot the bull around.

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,960
Talking about this and that

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,300
and about the government, the nation,

42
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
how the country's falling apart.

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,740
As I was driving home, I was a-thinking

44
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,240
and it laid heavy on my mind

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,020
and it's burdened my heart.

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
So I'm writing you to express my point of view.

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,340
Just a view from a nobody.

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,280
A common, old, hard-working man.

49
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,840
And I have been all my life.

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,020
Well,

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
I got something though.

52
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,420
I got me a Jim Walters home on a half acre.

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,680
And it got me a beautiful, God-fearing wife.

54
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,960
I had me a daddy.

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,080
He fought in World War I.

56
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
We lost him there.

57
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,380
I did my part in World War II.

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,100
And Bob, we're proud of the son.

59
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,700
He's in Vietnam.

60
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,380
Wounded twice.

61
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,420
He's still there.

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,440
God bless him.

63
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,140
Well, like I said, Bob,

64
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,480
our country's been torn apart.

65
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,980
I've listened to the records you've played,

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,900
the newscasts, your editorials.

67
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,240
I've listened carefully to the message on that record

68
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
by the fellas from Company C.

69
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,160
I've listened to the yippies, the kippies,

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,820
the black men, the red men,

71
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,760
the preachers, the rabbis, the priests.

72
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,860
Now, Bob, don't you think it's time for a working man to speak?

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,060
Well, what I'm trying to say is,

74
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm not a man.

75
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,120


76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,120


77
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,120


78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,120


79
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,060
I know it ain't an Eddinsburg address,

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,460
but it's just as sincere.

81
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,320
In fact, I hear that

82
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,120
President Lincoln is a common man,

83
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,340
so I guess I don't have too much to fear.

84
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,920
I burn my own house down

85
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,200
Cause it ain't my house

86
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,240
It's your house

87
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,800
It's your house

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,580
Your house

89
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,520
Your house

90
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,100
Burn it down

91
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,300
Burn it down

92
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,340
Burn it down

93
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,240
Burn it down

94
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,140
Burn it down

95
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,140
Burn it down

96
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,420
The kindling's there

97
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,640
The fuel for the fire

98
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,620
Ain't no burning beautiful orange

99
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,680
Licking flames

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,500
For paper

101
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,160
Paper, paper

102
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,300
It's all just fuel for the fire

103
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,660
The big bonfire

104
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,640
Violence against buildings

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,240
Violence against property

106
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,160
The ultimate act of rebellion

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,420
And I'm gonna build me a guillotine

108
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,220
And I'm gonna build me a guillotine

109
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,600
Grab these suits by the hair

110
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,900
Drag them by their power nooses

111
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,920
And chop their lovely heads off

112
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,140
It's French Revolution time

113
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,840
Burn it down

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,180
And they will read

115
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,200
As each famous painting

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,520
Fight the message of leading the people

117
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,320
Yeah

118
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,340
43 years she's changed

119
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,680
43 years she's changed her desk

120
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,200
43 years she pushed around

121
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,780
Paper clips and rubber bands

122
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,080
And still writes memos

123
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,040
43 years and she hated every damn minute

124
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,460
of it

125
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,160
Now she takes what she has

126
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,020
Now she waits for her landlord to sell her building

127
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,640
So he can toss her on the street

128
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,000
43 years of all that paper

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
Paper pushing

130
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,780
Pushing papers

131
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,240
Of being an appliance

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,400
Part of the hardware

133
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,780
The interior decorating

134
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,000
43 years of feeding no one for a paycheck

135
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,700
But you know what I say

136
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,920
All these buildings

137
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,960
All them skyscrapers

138
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,480
All that chrome and glass

139
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,840
Filled with all that paper

140
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,520
Well we could have ourselves

141
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,980
One hella Molotov cocktail

142
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,340
All we need is a little gasoline

143
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,220
And just one match

144
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,240
Right to match

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,860
All these people

146
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,900
In their starched white shirts

147
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,660
Who act like they own the streets

148
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,440
And the sidewalk and the world

149
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
Because they do

150
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
Burn it down

151
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,680
Burn it down

152
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,120
Burn it down

153
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,640
Burn it down

154
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,660
Burn it down

155
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,820
All these damn heads

156
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,360
These damn clubs

157
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,080
These damn turn-rides

158
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,860
And ants on these drones

159
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,040
In my way I am lost

160
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,940
In the forgotten guts of dead

161
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,560
Obvious and witness souls

162
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,060
Jesus came to Marketplace

163
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,360
Jesus came to Market Street

164
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,780
He said burn it down

165
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,620
All you buyers and sellers

166
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,140
He said burn it down

167
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,220
You profane my world

168
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,180
I am riding my bicycle

169
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,520
Through the den of lepers

170
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,560
And I am trying to remain unscathed

171
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,680
But we

172
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,540
We're just a white slime man

173
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,320
I was fed television and Twinkies

174
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,100
And the scroungy ethics

175
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,500
Of children of the compression

176
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,760
One who can't throw away

177
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,160
A piece of Wilton lettuce

178
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
And one who buys

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
Cricks of the finest

180
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340
Just to watch it rot

181
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,040
We are the refuse

182
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,760
Of the feeling sister

183
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,600
We are fire

184
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,620
Of the world

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
But oh

186
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,620
The break

187
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,060
Of twisted feelings

188
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,320
The rollick who wants

189
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,220
To be danced

190
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,800
Oh come on

191
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,740
Come on

192
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,680
Like a match

193
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,220
Oh yes yes yes dear friends

194
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,320
oh yes yes yes dear

195
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,320


196
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,380
And what better way to start off a show than to burn it down?

197
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,960
That was Huge Voodoo, dear friends.

198
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Our dear friends, Huge Voodoo, Reverend D.K. Jones and D.B. Grant,

199
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:48,740
and their friend Dominique Lowell, I guess, the poet with whom they were working that particular recording.

200
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,380
And so, well, that's the way to start a show.

201
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:02,000
We just form the ball and start it rolling, then sit back and watch what happens.

202
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:10,940
Much as, we must surmise, God did himself, or itself, sometime before the Big Bang.

203
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,760
At this time, friends, we hope to get better results.

204
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:25,060
And towards that particular end, here, we'll just throw these cassettes one willy-nilly,

205
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:35,680
one to the other, side to side, and I'll fill you in on just what has been happening.

206
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,860
I've been gone for three weeks. That means I've got to do three shows tonight.

207
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,220
That's fine. No, thanks to Reverend Susie the Floozy and the Swingin' Love Corpses

208
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,720
and Radio Short.

209
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,680
And Dr. Howell and what, Nenslow.

210
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,260
We've got plenty of tape.

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,620
And Owen R. Stevie Moore, you name it.

212
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,420
Might as well call these Nenslow shows.

213
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,400
He sends so much wonderful background music and terrible, bad songs.

214
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,180
And friends, well, I was working last week.

215
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,580
I went to Chicago to act in a video game called Dueling.

216
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,720
And I was playing with my co-star, Rudy Ray Moore.

217
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Yes, Dolomite, the famous comedian.

218
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,040
You probably don't even know who he is, do you?

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,680
Well, he's...

220
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,060
You'll just have to buy that game in five years when it finally gets developed.

221
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,060
Boy, everything's computerized, my friend.

222
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,920
Are you caught in the net web?

223
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,940
If so, the spider has come.

224
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,900
And that's the last time I see you,

225
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,340
because we've been swimming through the digital sewer there on the Internet.

226
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,180
The information catheter, as they call it.

227
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,560
And you know, for this church, my friends, it's like a whole new world to plunder.

228
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:15,180
And you know, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, the Internet is a real plane

229
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,780
of existence.

230
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,600
Just like the before life.

231
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,720
And hell, I'm not.

232
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:18,720


233
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
And the happy, frappy ground.

234
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,240
Some people even go there when they die.

235
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:33,740
You may not know that the Internet was invented over two decades ago just to host subgenius

236
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,180
gossip.

237
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,440
That's the only...

238
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
You get onto...

239
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,180
There is a subgenius land in the Internet.

240
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,980
It's called alt.slack, or alt.slack.

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,520
You go there.

242
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,700
And it's just like a subgenius.

243
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:48,980
It's like a subgenius convention.

244
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,100
It really is.

245
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,300
You'll get some pathetic, unfunny, unoriginal, unforgivable human nerds.

246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
And on the other hand, you'll get some of the best yetinsiny you'll ever be lucky enough

247
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,260
to know.

248
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,940
And then of course, there's those out there who say nothing but only watch the vampires,

249
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,000
the lurkers.

250
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,780
But we have found that there are people out there, thousands of them on the Internet,

251
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,680
who think that the Church of the Sun is the only one that can do that.

252
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:18,760
And that's right.

253
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,220
And that's because the subgenius is an invention of some net geeks years ago.

254
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,180
They have no idea that, uh, about the books, the videos, the radio shows, the tapes, the

255
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,780
comics, the clothing, the pranks, the stage divivals, the poisonings, the mental institutions.

256
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,440
They don't know nothing about none of it.

257
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,740
And it leads to some gross misunderstandings, my friends.

258
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,760
Now, uh, speaking of books, it's out.

259
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,180
Revelation X.

260
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,960
The Bob Apocryphon by the Subgenius Foundation, uh, is out.

261
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,780
It's in stores.

262
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,580
Any store that tells you they cannot order that Simon and Schuster fireside book is flat

263
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,240
out lying.

264
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,360
It takes about two minutes to order them, uh, or any of our books.

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
I do it every week.

266
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,580
And so can any bookstore.

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,600
Though they will lie to you.

268
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,960
But, uh, but I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

269
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,400
Let's see.

270
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,400
What else was there?

271
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
I wanted to make sure that you all knew.

272
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,160
Uh, I don't know.

273
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,180


274
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,760
Um, uh, we're just so, so busy.

275
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,620
I'm getting ready to leave town and do the revival.

276
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
Got to preach some revivals in Cleveland.

277
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,880
Yes.

278
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,860
And Akron.

279
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,060
And, uh, Philadelphia.

280
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,240
And, uh, but the word of Bob cannot be staunched.

281
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,320
And the stench from those staunching would be enough to make you want to unwrap the dressings

282
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,880
anyway and clean out that pussy wound as we're trying to, uh, to do.

283
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,160
So, uh, uh.

284
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,200
Somehow, right now, if I can just figure out what comes next!

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,520
Eeeeeeeeeeee

286
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,280
I'm gonna run like the wind

287
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,680
Dah dah dah dah

288
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,740
I'm gonna run like the wind

289
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Run like my mom, run like my dog

290
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,560
Run into the bathroom and drop a log

291
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm gonna run like the wind

292
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,780
Into my bathroom

293
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,320
To be free again

294
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,100
I'm gonna run with fingers in my hands

295
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,840
And I'm gonna run into the night

296
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,300
And I'm gonna run into

297
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,340
Running my fingers through

298
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,920
Running into the night

299
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
Radio Shorts presents

300
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,800
The Misplaced Tapes of Tim Morrison

301
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,960
When the moon hits your eye

302
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,300
Like a big pizza pie

303
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,160
That's amore

304
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,840
When the stars seem to shine

305
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,260
Like you've had too much wine

306
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,840
You're in love

307
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,340
When you walk in a dream

308
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,600
But you know you're not dreaming

309
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,100
Signore

310
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,280
Scusa me

311
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,100
But you see

312
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,900
Back in old Napoli

313
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,820
That's amore

314
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,280
That's amore

315
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,360
That's amore

316
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,500
When an eel swims on by

317
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,900
And munches on your eye

318
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,320
That's amore

319
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,880
Go in

320
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,980
cheat

321
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,700
Is the

322
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:36,860
New Зehm

323
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:36,860


324
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:36,860


325
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,560
Gets as张

326
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,960
Drives my head

327
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,960


328
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,100
And we canBC

329
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,260
greatest music ever created because it also has those sound effects.

330
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:59,440
And before that, of course, the rare Jim Morrison outtakes from Radio Shorts out in San Francisco,

331
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,980
what's also called Brain Rot West.

332
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,480
We'll have some Brain Rot East coming up.

333
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:17,180
And before that, that lovely song, Run Like the Wind to Be Free, was from the album Hemoroidal Oink.

334
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,380
Yes, that's called Hemoroidal Oink by Hemeroy Rogers.

335
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,600
In this case, this band changes their names constantly.

336
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,160
Hour of Slack folks would recognize them also as Big Poo Generator.

337
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,300
And I don't know, I can't even keep track of them.

338
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:48,000
But yes, Hemeroy Rogers from their album variously called Hemeroid Oink or The Roid Way.

339
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,740
And here's their address. I want you to have their address.

340
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,740
And you can send off for tapes, I suppose.

341
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,360
Maybe you can get more information out of them than I can.

342
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,460
Try addressing this to Big Poo at a post office bar.

343
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,340
Box 376, Yorba Linda, California.

344
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,420
That's box 376, Yorba Linda, California.

345
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,480
92686.

346
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,580
Once again, 92686.

347
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,840
That band scolded me for not giving their address as often as I should.

348
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,780
They also go by the name Forearmed Mildew Bandits.

349
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,260
And Department...

350
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,840
Department of Food Conservation.

351
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,960
So, well, you never know what you're getting either on this show or any other...

352
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,240
Anything else that has to do with the Church of the Subgenius.

353
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,220
Although you will...

354
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,300
Those of you who are dues-paying members, even before the price went up,

355
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,720
you're probably owed a stark fist of removal magazine.

356
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,140
And we're working on it, man.

357
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,500
Sir, ma'am.

358
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,560
We're...

359
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,320
We're working on it.

360
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,260
We're working on it.

361
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,680
We're working on it.

362
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,680


363
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,680


364
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,680


365
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,580
As a matter of fact, you can get previews of the stark fist.

366
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,480
Why, anybody can for free on alt.slack

367
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,800
under the alternative heading on the internet, dear friends.

368
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,080
But of course, that is the naked stark fist.

369
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,460
It's got no art to clothe it.

370
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,940
It has no italics nor boldface.

371
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,420
And thus, we consider it the nude fist.

372
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,460
One-month-old.

373
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,220
But I probably shouldn't go too deep into that.

374
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,540
Because, friends, I have a little sermon here.

375
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,460
It's kind of a homey sermon.

376
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,400
But it's downright touching.

377
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,420
From the great Orton Nenslow, now of Portland.

378
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,220
And, well, he calls this one Nenslow Babylon.

379
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,240
Let's just look into it, shall we?

380
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,600
One thing I never get tired of pointing out, and that never seems to do any good, but I do it anyway,

381
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,080
is...

382
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,680
this conspiracy technique of the disconnection.

383
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,520
It's very common in advertising, where you get a picture of something and then the name of a product.

384
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,660
And there's no connection between those two things.

385
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,540
But you're supposed to associate the two in your mind.

386
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,880
And then next time you want to experience whatever it is in the picture, like peace of mind or something,

387
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,360
then, oh, boy, I'll just buy that brand of cigarettes or whatever, or liquor, or whatever the thing is.

388
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,460
And...

389
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,460
it causes a reaction.

390
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,980
It causes a disconnected connection.

391
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,400
And it's kind of...

392
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:56,460
it's associated with, and yet not exactly associated with, the principle that if you can provoke an emotional reaction in somebody,

393
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,300
then you can sell them anything.

394
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,140
As long as you hit the right button.

395
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
It's very...

396
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,640
it's...

397
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,380
since this is a political election year around Master Control Programming World Headquarters,

398
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,800
I'm seeing quite a lot of that.

399
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,700
They're...

400
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,460
trying to bypass reason by using emotional reactions.

401
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,040
Uh...

402
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,520
you know, the reasoning part of the brain, at least in humans, was the very last part to develop.

403
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:32,180
Certain other species, it came along a little bit earlier, but in humans, it was the very, very last part to develop.

404
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,400
And so it's really easy to bypass it.

405
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,100
It's easy to...

406
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,920
to hit some of the other...

407
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,960
the survival trait buttons, the emotional reactions.

408
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,620
And...

409
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,220
and...

410
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,140
sidestep any kind of rational thought.

411
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,140
And...

412
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,940
and plug in whatever concept you want to do.

413
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,380
That's how con...

414
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,120
genuine con games work.

415
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:55,940
It...

416
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,560
Keep your victim from thinking.

417
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,640
And you get them excited,

418
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,520
give them an emotional reaction, and bam, sell them whatever you want.

419
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,080
and they just go for it.

420
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,880
One of the great creative minds of the last few decades,

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,140
I don't know about right now, but up until recently,

422
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,580
John Waters, the writer and filmmaker, has pointed out to many of us

423
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,840
that the best place to pick somebody up is at an accident,

424
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,960
because they've just had a severe mental, psychological shock,

425
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,880
and it just turns the brain right off.

426
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,300
And then you say, oh, well, let's go get some coffee,

427
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,600
and, oh, well, come on over to my place.

428
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
And they say, oh, okay.

429
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,460
They'll just follow you right along like a little lamb,

430
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,500
and they don't know, they're just not thinking at all.

431
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,000
You can do anything you want with them.

432
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,380
I'm not saying you should do that. That's not a good thing.

433
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,120
I mean, you should always get informed consent on everything.

434
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,300
But I'm seeing how you can just bypass reason with any kind of slogan.

435
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,940
You just plug a slogan in, and it's just a good thing.

436
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,660
You can plug a slogan into your argument and follow it with any kind of concept you want.

437
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,020
One of the real popular things around here now is oriented toward children.

438
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,120
Protect our children. Stop child pornography.

439
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,640
And then, boy, everybody's in favor of that.

440
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,040
I know I want to protect people's children.

441
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,100
I don't have any myself.

442
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,720
I don't think child pornography is good at all.

443
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,580
But that's not going to keep me from thinking about

444
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,740
what kind of weird setup we're going to have

445
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,600
if we pass some of these strange restrictions

446
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,200
that people want to plug into our great U.S. Constitution

447
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,880
that guarantees all our freedoms.

448
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,720
I mean, subgenius in particular, it seems to me,

449
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,140
has really got to be active in speaking out for the rights of abnormal people.

450
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,400
I mean, people who are not...

451
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,840
plugged into the conspiracy,

452
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,280
pure, straight robot, food tube,

453
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,400
watch TV and work till you die kind of track.

454
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,820
People who are definitely out there doing something weird,

455
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,980
strange, even something that we ourselves may feel utterly abhorrent.

456
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,840
It's still our privilege, our duty, to support

457
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,920
our weird,

458
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,120
weird,

459
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,440
inhuman,

460
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,140
even obscene acts.

461
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,020
I know even if I myself think it's completely stupid

462
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,820
for people to do some kind of art,

463
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,820
make an art performance out of necrophilia or something,

464
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,500
I'm not opposed to it.

465
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,800
I mean, somebody's going to do it

466
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,980
eventually whether they make an art show out of it or not.

467
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,260
I mean, people are...

468
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,080
Oh, people do all kinds of unbelievable things to each other

469
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,780
and to themselves all day long.

470
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
Boy, I'm all for it.

471
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,640
I think we should all be all for it.

472
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,060
One of the great saints of our church

473
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,080
who I think had better remain nameless,

474
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,700
it's not who you're thinking,

475
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,760
is currently undergoing a gender exchange,

476
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,900
and, you know, I was really shocked when I heard that

477
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,120
certain people who claim they're subgeniuses

478
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,840
are really offended by this and have refused to communicate with this person.

479
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,820
I mean, it's not the sort of thing I'm going to ever do

480
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,160
because, God, I have enough trouble just being a man.

481
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,320
But, you've got to...

482
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,440
I really have to take my hat off to this totally insane individual

483
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,640
because it's certainly going beyond anything that I could ever conceive of.

484
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,500
And if that's not what this church is all about,

485
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,080
then, boy, what's it for?

486
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
To be normal?

487
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,020
No.

488
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,020
No, sir, it's the normals that we're supposed to be intolerant of,

489
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,860
not the people who are weirder than we are.

490
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,780
I mean, you've got to go some before you're weirder than old Nenslow,

491
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,300
and, man, you've just got to hand it to anybody you can freak me out.

492
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,640
And I'll tell you, it's not easy, but I'm trying to be...

493
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,880
You know what I'm saying?

494
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:45,720
It's the normal, mindless, robotically obedient, intolerant, insensitive boobs

495
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,120
that we should all hate.

496
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,040
Not...

497
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,580
Boy, not these weirdos like us.

498
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,820
I always say I'd rather live next door to a man

499
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,300
with a closet full of dresses than a man with a closet full of guns.

500
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,000
I've lived around all kinds of weirdos, and I'll tell you,

501
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,460
I never had a Vietnamese transvestite treat me like a weirdo,

502
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,980
and I felt grateful for it.

503
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,100
If you're like me, you get sick of being treated like some kind of a freak,

504
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,500
and the best thing I can say about some of the people

505
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,660
who are being treated like monsters these days

506
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,160
is they're tolerant of other people.

507
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,780
Unless those people are actively engaged in abusing and beating them,

508
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,440
well, they are nice to you.

509
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,920
They don't cuss at you or yell at you on the street

510
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,760
because you're not as weird or as normal as they are,

511
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,780
because they're just concerned about who they are,

512
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,340
trying to figure out where their head's at.

513
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,600
Maybe it's in a really weird place compared to yours, but I'd rather...

514
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,940
Boy.

515
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,720
Weirdos are better than normal people when it comes to just trying to get along,

516
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,440
I'll tell you that, except for a few of them who just can't get along with anybody.

517
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,780
I know I have a real hard time.

518
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,920
I always say killing people is easy,

519
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,860
but getting along with them is...

520
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,900
That's the rough part.

521
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,900
You're a conniving, clinging, blood-sucking bitch.

522
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:26,320
. . .

523
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm giving up everything for you!

524
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,820
. . .

525
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:08,540


526
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:08,960
Help me!

527
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,380
Help me!

528
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,640
Help me!

529
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,980
Help me!

530
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,820
. . .

531
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,060
Paranoia from high...

532
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,980
For the bad stings

533
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,660
rotting in the midst

534
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,420
Disease

535
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,980
handed down, one wretched man before

536
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,740
Flesh-eating virus

537
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,800
stay away from me

538
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,200
Another way is well- retrained

539
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
the life force of unity

540
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,840
Pretense

541
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,140
and humor

542
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,180
Work well and hide the truth

543
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,120
Conscious of great parts

544
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,740
And death that lies within

545
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,300
Help me!

546
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,660
Coming to take you home

547
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,480
Help me!

548
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,080
Searing through your bones

549
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,840
Help me!

550
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,380
Coming to take you home

551
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,180
Help me!

552
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,620
Yes, dear friends,

553
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,760
Indian Rope Burn.

554
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,460
We'll continue with that song a little bit

555
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,200
on side two of show.

556
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,940
That's Indian Rope Burn

557
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,340
from Akron, Ohio.

558
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,580
Yes, and before that,

559
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,760
the good Orton Nenslow

560
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,500
with an inspiring speech.

561
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,020
And now, well, it is just about up

562
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,540
to side two of show.

563
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,080
But I should give you the address

564
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,060
of Indian Rope Burn.

565
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,400
Well, hell,

566
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,600
just to give you the address

567
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:53,600


568
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,080
Just call them.

569
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,880
216-673-6196

570
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,580
Yeah, just call Indian Rope Burn.

571
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,380
Go ahead, do it.

572
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,960
216-673-6196

573
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,500
See you on side two of show.

574
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,040
Self-deprecation

575
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,060
Is about this

576
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,900
I just

577
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,880
Help me!

578
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,420
Coming to take you home

579
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,220
Help me!

580
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,760
Searing through your bones

581
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,520
Help me!

582
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Coming to take you home

583
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,900
To you, come back to me

584
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,100
Help me!

585
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,700
To whom

586
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,100
To you, who you make a First in Love

587
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,420
Paranoid

588
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah

589
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,600
Paranoid

590
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,960

592
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,480


593
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,160
Cl件

594
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,160


595
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,160


596
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,160


597
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,160


598
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,160


599
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,160

Baron LAHei

604
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,700
Who Got it?

605
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:53,580
ltz

606
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,360
Uh, yes, dear friends.

607
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,780
But before we go too much further, what is it that I needed to give you?

608
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,160
Oh, yes, I want to give you the address of the evil Orton Nenslow.

609
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,880
Because if you were to send that guy some kind of eye in the pyramid piece of flesh,

610
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:47,040
one would indeed find in return the new realization pamphlets,

611
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,360
as well as master control and other instructions.

612
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,000
For those who follow no master.

613
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:04,460
And that address to write to is Nenslow at Post Office Box 86582.

614
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:17,080
Yeah, once again, that's Nenslow at P.O. Box 86582, Portland, Oregon, 97286.

615
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,560
That's it, once again, 97286.

616
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:27,200
And for those of you who were just a little slow on the uptake and didn't have your pencils ready,

617
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:37,700
the phone number for Indian Rope Burn is 216-673-6196

618
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,460
to inquire about their tapes and CD.

619
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,800
And ask for Reverend Clay and tell him Reverend Stang sent you.

620
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Uh, yes, and, uh...

621
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,380
Oh!

622
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,540
Oh!

623
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,360
Oh, and I should mention to the three subgenius diehards out there

624
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,640
that there's a girly magazine on the stands

625
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,860
that you boys and girls might want to see.

626
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,080
Yeah, the special holiday issue of New Rave Magazine.

627
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,620
Yes, it's a slick convenience store magazine

628
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,540
called New Rave Magazine.

629
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,340
New Rave.

630
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,340
The current issue, holiday issue, it says,

631
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,600
got two naked girls on the cover.

632
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,300
Looks like twins.

633
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,680
Uh, it has in it a wonderful six-page article

634
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,660
about the church, like, just imagine,

635
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,640
the church of the subgenius.

636
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,420
And for once, I mean, we've been,

637
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,100
we've been written up by all the great hustler publication,

638
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,240
girly mags, chic, high society,

639
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,740
a hustler itself.

640
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,380
And not to mention Penthouse and Playboy,

641
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,160
but this is one of the new ones,

642
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,880
and despite the title, Rave, or New Rave,

643
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,640
it, you won't find it next to, uh,

644
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,100
uh, Mondo 2000 or any of those other things

645
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,460
in the health food store, nay.

646
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,340
But you will indeed find it probably next to a sandwich

647
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,560
between Jugs and Buff and, uh, Hustler

648
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,280
and maybe Leg Show, maybe Bear At,

649
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,980
it might be next, between Bear Assets

650
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,880
and Big Butts, Volume 3, Number 7.

651
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,940
It's my favorite issue, man.

652
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,440
Um, and, uh, and I, I think in the next show,

653
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,800
I might actually read some from this article,

654
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,720
because in this case, the, uh, expose

655
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,920
on the evil church of the subgenius

656
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,680
was written by a certain Dave DeLuca.

657
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,200
Hmm, now who could that be?

658
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,860
Coincidence?

659
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,260
Coincidence?

660
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,220
Could that possibly be any relation

661
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,960
to Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

662
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,560
the itinerant, uh, semi-retarded

663
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,220
country-western singer and substance abuser

664
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,640
and, uh, uh, a struggling writer

665
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,860
known to and beloved by all of us listeners

666
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,320
of WCSB in Cleveland?

667
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,200
Hmm? Hmm?

668
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,660
Well, uh, and, uh, and he got just the right quotes

669
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,080
and they used just the right pictures,

670
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,740
although they didn't credit them,

671
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,520
and, boys, there's a picture of Reverend Susie the Floozy

672
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,740
in this magazine that, by the time you finish

673
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,080
listening to this show, you're gonna be wanting

674
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,560
to rush out and buy the thing just to see

675
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,840
what she looks like.

676
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,700
And just between you and me, um, even in clothing,

677
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,360
Sister Susie will, uh, get the, uh, splatteration

678
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,340
going quicker than all those Barbies and Heathers

679
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,660
in the rest of this magazine.

680
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,360
Not to put those plasticine, uh, retouched,

681
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,500
shaved, anti-Prairie Squids down or anything like that.

682
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,760
You know, we don't want to be sexist on this show.

683
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,760
We always want to be very politically correct.

684
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,620
But, uh, yes, New Rave magazine has some, uh,

685
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,140
inside news about the evil church of the subgenius,

686
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,780
including a, uh, a lexicon.

687
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,920
It even has, um, you know, to define terms like

688
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,240
excremeditation.

689
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,700
and patriopsychotic 00

690
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:22,780
00

691
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:50,240
00 00 00 00 when he's dealing with human profession.

692
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,320
who is modeling a subgenius t-shirt.

693
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,520
And another picture of her modeling the subgenius boxer shorts,

694
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,640
but that's all she's modeling.

695
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,180
I tell you, man, in this modern day and age,

696
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,420
they'll just print pictures of anything.

697
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,120
Well, there's Pope David Meyer preaching to the lost.

698
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,700
And, well, there's even pictures of me back when I had short hair.

699
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,000
And, okay, yeah.

700
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,320
What?

701
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,120
But I gotta, you know, one has to ask oneself,

702
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,580
in this world,

703
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,840
why is it that something so noble and uplifting

704
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,100
and so dedicated to traditional fashion

705
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,820
and family values, as the church of the subgenius,

706
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,020
why must something like that be featured,

707
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,280
not nay, in one's local newspaper,

708
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
but rather in a girly magazine,

709
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,480
or as they say, skin rag,

710
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,400
available at your local sub and schlub,

711
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,740
or stop and shop, or whatever.

712
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,760
I just don't know what it's coming to, my friend.

713
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,900
Bye-bye.

714
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,320
Where things are going, it might be too much to ask.

715
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,780
Bob, I pray that I live to see the day

716
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,060
when the young and the old,

717
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,700
all those that now so disagree,

718
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,480
will walk together through our streets.

719
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,080
Yes, sir, Mr. Bob, walk through our streets

720
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,560
with banners in their hands that read,

721
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,540
God bless America.

722
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,800
God bless the working man.

723
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,740
Ah, the place, WREK Atlanta.

724
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,980
The time, late, too damn late.

725
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,460
Good night.

726
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,400
I was working the show.

727
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,840
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

728
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,960
It was episode number 39,

729
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,560
and it looked like it wasn't going to be a pleasant one.

730
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm the Reverend Susie the Floozy.

731
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,760
I'd wear a badge,

732
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,480
but there's nowhere to pin it.

733
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,340
The street is my beat,

734
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,720
and every city has them.

735
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,860
Mean, ugly, slackless streets.

736
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,520
Some streets, some streets

737
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,580
even have less slack than the bad ones.

738
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,640
Some places are so incredibly slackless

739
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,740
that they create a lot of noise.

740
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,840
They create in you a negative slack flux

741
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,000
to where you're having to pay off the man for years

742
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,980
before you even begin to feel one iota

743
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,320
of that blessed slack that you deserve.

744
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,160
Oh, there's one of those places just north of us here.

745
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,440
For lately, Cobb County, Georgia

746
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,900
has truly been the most slackless place

747
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,720
in this benighted country.

748
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,220
Oh, I don't need to go on about the reasons for it.

749
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,560
Their lack of slack track record speaks for itself.

750
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,180
Besides, the details bore me,

751
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,260
and the fact that politics is involved

752
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,100
is tasteless to me in the extreme.

753
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,900
But my church, the holy disorder of fast living

754
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,920
and no consequences,

755
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,460
happens to be located right in the middle of the hive.

756
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,300
Oh, the local branch of the conspiracy

757
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,900
and its frightening political agenda

758
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,680
to issue resolutions condemning anything

759
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,160
but the most abject, po-bucker standards of normalcy.

760
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,120
Oh!

761
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,780
It's so offended even me

762
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,680
that I have found myself standing smack dab in there right away

763
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,260
to block their slack-scraping bulldozers.

764
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,140
In fact, dear listeners,

765
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,460
I am so entrenched in the cause

766
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,640
to preserve our precious weirdness

767
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,940
that I will be at the Square of Marietta tomorrow afternoon

768
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,700
for a rally with thousands of other like-minded mutants.

769
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,300
Why?

770
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,740
Hey, this is so out of character for me.

771
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Is it because I think I can change things?

772
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,080
Ha!

773
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,240
Hey, I'm not about to change the world.

774
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,740
I didn't crap in its diaper.

775
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,180
And I'm certainly not fooling myself

776
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,020
about reprogramming the Yahoo-centric pink boys up there.

777
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,820
Oh, their jeans are tied behind their backs.

778
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,600
Oh, look at them down there.

779
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,800
They can't evolve above the level of bottom feeders.

780
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,060
And I am not going to the Square tomorrow

781
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,220
with a starry-eyed belief

782
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,620
that my participation will affect generations

783
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,720
of inbreeders.

784
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,880
Oh, yeah, little yellow water in the gene pool

785
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,620
sure goes a long way.

786
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,720
Hey, I am simply going there

787
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,340
because it will piss them off.

788
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,700
Yes, I am going to give myself the gift of hate,

789
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,520
the one emotion left that has any impact.

790
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,340
Oh, the others have been chipped away

791
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,880
and stripped down to the raw wood.

792
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,840
Love, sex, even fear itself

793
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,720
are incapable of penetrating the gene pool.

794
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:42,720


795
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,100
The numbing turtle wax coating left on your psyche

796
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,700
by years of insidious input and video overload.

797
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,460
Oh, yeah, it's locking you up

798
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,760
like mega doses of sugar in your cerebral gas tanks.

799
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,400
But hate, hate is the one armor-piercing emotional bullet

800
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,000
left to kickstart your vapor-locked biogram.

801
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,400
And so, with that in mind,

802
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,300
let's dive into tonight's episode

803
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,760
of Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

804
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,380
And hey, baby,

805
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,440
lest you and me get a real hate-on.

806
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,700
I got those refreshed

807
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,420
Hostility blues

808
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,700
Here in the heartless city

809
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm elbowed and muscled and hustled

810
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,420
around by a queer turn of sight

811
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,980
I'm bound to be pleasant to those I dislike

812
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,520
I got those refreshed

813
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,240
Hostility blues

814
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,200
Lost in the cruel,

815
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,780
cruel city

816
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,300
I'm jostled, maltreated, and cheated

817
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,240
In turn by an odd twist of fate

818
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,880
I yearn to be gracious to people I hate

819
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,340
I'm a boy,

820
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,360
Some emotional lackey

821
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,100
Who craves someone to attack

822
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:26,060
I need a wafer, a waitress, or a hacky

823
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,320
Oh, promise not to fight back

824
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
I got those repressed

825
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,640
Hostility blues

826
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,920
Here in the no good city

827
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,540
The anger I'm feeling is all in my mind

828
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,760
Oh, if only I knew

829
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,240
Some kind of a someone to transfer it to

830
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:13,880
Oh, there must be a chump

831
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:13,880


832
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:13,880


833
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,920
I got those repressed

834
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,340
Hostility blues

835
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,720
Here in the no good city

836
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,360
The anger I'm feeling is all in my mind

837
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,620
Oh, if only I knew

838
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,160
Some kind of a someone to transfer it to

839
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,160
Oh, there must be a chump

840
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,440
On whom I can dump

841
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,420
My repressed

842
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,440
Hostility blues

843
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,480
We have a new type of rule now.

844
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,000
Not one-man rule,

845
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,520
a rule of aristocracy or plutocracy,

846
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,840
but a small group,

847
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,040
elevated to positions of absolute power

848
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,780
by random pressures

849
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,720
and subject to political and economic factors

850
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,000
that leave little room for decisions.

851
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,580
They are representatives of abstract forces

852
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,440
who have reached power through surrender itself.

853
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,200
The iron-willed dictator is a thing of the past.

854
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,120
There will be no more stallions, no more Hitlers.

855
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,460
The rulers of this most insecure of all worlds are rulers by accident.

856
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,460
In it, frightened pilots with controls of vast machine they cannot understand,

857
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,200
calling in experts to tell them which buttons to push.

858
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,860
We're going on a witch hunt.

859
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,140
We're going on a witch hunt.

860
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,140


861
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,140


862
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,140


863
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,980
Let our blimmin' burns

864
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,120
Stand in firm example

865
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,720
So the rest will learn

866
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,980
We'll cast out those

867
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,280
Who live in sin

868
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,840
This is a bad, bad world

869
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,160
We need discipline

870
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,600
A water will brew your life in stone

871
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,320
I want absolute control

872
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,880
I'm a big, big brother and I'm everywhere

873
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm a big, big brother and I'm everywhere

874
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,020
I'll hold you down, I'll keep you there

875
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,740
I'll hold you down, I'll keep you there

876
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,800
We're gonna be the jury

877
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,980
We're gonna be the jury

878
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,140
Yeah, we're gonna be the judge

879
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,480
We're the powers that be

880
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,220
And we don't budge

881
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,340
The toxic laws

882
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,260
The trade

883
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,660
Get out of line

884
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,280
We'll dig your grave

885
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,840
We'll dig your grave

886
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,860
I wanna rule your life of souls

887
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,440
I wanna rule your life of souls

888
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,140
I want absolute control

889
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,300
I want absolute control

890
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,020
I'm a big, big brother and I'm everywhere

891
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,980
I wanna rule your life of souls

892
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:10,980


893
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,200
I wanna keep you there

894
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,440
Run this town

895
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,960
Everybody

896
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,000
Run this town

897
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:24,980
Everybody

898
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,080
Run this town

899
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,880
Everybody

900
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,180
We're going on a witch hunt

901
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,520
We're gonna blame it first

902
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,600
Stand up for the devil

903
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,680
Start a revolution

904
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,560
I wanna rule your life with a stone

905
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,300
I want absolute control

906
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,740
Big, big brother, I'm your nightmare

907
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,720
I'm gonna hold you down, I'm gonna keep you there

908
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,500
They have slain them by the sword

909
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,280
They have hung them by rod

910
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,240
They have chopped their heads off by guillotines

911
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,200
They have burned them at the stake

912
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,140
They have drowned them in rivers

913
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,780
They have hated them

914
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,160
Now, ladies and gentlemen, here's what they hate

915
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,200
They don't hate the fact that a man gets saved

916
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,560
And he quits cussing

917
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,360
Anybody that's in his right mind

918
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,480
I'd rather hear a person carry on a conversation

919
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,460
Without slang and cursing

920
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,880
Anybody has

921
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,900
And there's nothing wrong with the old alcoholic

922
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,840
Getting saved and getting dried out

923
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,280
Nothing wrong with that

924
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,180
Whatsoever

925
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,780
I mean, anybody in the world is for that

926
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,700
I mean, that's wonderful, that's good

927
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,220
And they do not hate the fact

928
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,620
That here is a street-walking woman

929
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,760
That's lived in the scarlet sin of life

930
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,500
And her face has been popped with the sin of her diseased body

931
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,720
That gets right with God

932
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,680
And she becomes a well-dressed, fine lady

933
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,360
Everybody enjoys that

934
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,740
That's wonderful, that's reformed

935
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,580
That's wonderful

936
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,260
And nobody in this world is like that

937
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,260


938
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,800
Nobody in this world is against a teenage rebellious son

939
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,720
Who's been feeding in the big pens of sin

940
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,680
Getting his heart right with God

941
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,540
And becoming an honest, honest, obedient, kind, sweet, loving son

942
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,120
I mean, everybody likes that

943
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,360
Doesn't matter who it is

944
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,720
From the mayor to the policeman on the street

945
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,700
Everybody likes it

946
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,020
That's wonderful, that's good

947
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,000
I'll tell you where the venom gets up

948
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,460
I'll tell you where the hatred comes

949
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,240
When you start telling somebody else about Jesus

950
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,860
It's all right to have your religion and keep it to yourself

951
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,960
There's no hatred of Christ as long as you just keep it

952
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,140
I'll tell you what you do

953
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,940
You start knocking on somebody's door

954
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,580
And telling them that Jesus Christ died for their sins

955
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,960
And if they're not saved, they're going to hell

956
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,700
And you watch the last bit of that

957
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,060
Oh, yes

958
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,860
Oh, that was a little pink champagne for dancing

959
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,220
And here's a little more

960
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,340
Oh

961
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,400
You know, it used to be easy to be entertained

962
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,040
By the idiotic antics of the normals

963
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,220
They were such ineffectual losers

964
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,540
Living out there in their little evolutionary cul-de-sacs

965
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,720
And bad, cheap-ass subdivisions

966
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,220
Where the only trees or rustic trees

967
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,720
Were the only trees or rustic trees

968
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,360
And acting little domestic dramas

969
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,840
To fuel the America's most inbred media furnace

970
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,300
Oh, if only they were John Waters cute

971
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,880
But how is it they're as ugly on the inside

972
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,680
As they are on the outside?

973
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:15,740
These unenlightened dweebs just can't get the picture

974
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh, the redneck is not the state bird

975
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,440
And the state tree is no longer the flaming cross

976
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:23,920
The future

977
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,120
What's left of it, at least

978
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,800
Is no longer in the hands of the white-landed male aristocracy

979
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,260
Hey, we're taking the place to the next level

980
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,060
Whether they want it or not

981
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:40,280
We're taking it just like their forebearers took it from the Indians

982
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,460
And, hey, turnabout is foreplay

983
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,540
Oh, but the pink conspiracy dupes

984
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,100
They're just too scared to change

985
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,720
They've latched onto the last vestiges

986
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,140
Of their homogenized world

987
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,800
Like a pit bull on a mailman

988
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,060
And they ain't a-wettin' up

989
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,860
Oh, but their grip had better slip and slip soon

990
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,260
Because the X's are going to take it away from everybody

991
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,080
Except, of course, the card-carrying subgenie

992
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,300
And that's in just a few short years

993
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,440
The cosmic stopwatch is ticking away

994
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,100
And we'd like our chance to screw the world up our way

995
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,900
Hey, there's still a few experiments I want to carry out

996
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,940
While I'm still in this particular gravity

997
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,280
And most of those would be impossible

998
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,120
Under existing state, federal, and international laws

999
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,840
But hate...

1000
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,220
Now, hate is something that if you're going to do it

1001
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,440
Then for Bob's sake, do it right

1002
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:47,880
Oh, the average po-bucker hates gays, Jews, blacks

1003
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,080
Even subgenie, especially the subgenius strain

1004
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,140
But not from any basis of understanding

1005
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,200
Not from any true knowledge

1006
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,380
They've never spent any real time with anyone other than their own type

1007
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,760
The workplace doesn't count

1008
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,920
Because they have to be semi-socialized in that situation

1009
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,460
And the masks are on

1010
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,880
But when the gloves are off

1011
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,160
Their hatred is based on conjecture and hysteria

1012
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,800
The further removed from reality, the better

1013
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,840
Oh, it's a bitter, bitter hatred, mind you

1014
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,280
But it's hardly sincere

1015
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,100
Now, take me for example

1016
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,720
I hate normals not because I've heard or read bad things about them

1017
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,380
But, unfortunately, I've experienced the banal agony

1018
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,580
Of the southern redneck neo-existence firsthand

1019
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,300
Oh, I've learned to hate them by excruciating daily contact

1020
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,900
With them in a jerkwater po-bucker Georgia town

1021
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,780
And I know personally the manure content and the common clay

1022
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,220
So let them go back to hate school

1023
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,600
And bone up a little

1024
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,500
Because they can't hold a candle to subgenius hate squared

1025
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,720
I hate it so deep because

1026
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,420
I swear they get the piece

1027
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,040
One egg might as well

1028
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,760
And everything tastes like

1029
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,280
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1030
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,720
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1031
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,640
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1032
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,540
I hate those rapists that their hits expand to such a waste

1033
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,900
Everything about them even cheer me from my face

1034
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,420
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1035
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1036
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,500
I hate working around the house

1037
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,880
I hate going in the line

1038
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,600
I hate to leave my home

1039
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,520
I hate to write this song

1040
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,840
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1041
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,320
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1042
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,900
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1043
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,320
Oh, hey, will I hate everything?

1044
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,100
One week of every year is designated National Brotherhood Week.

1045
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,460
This is just one of many such weeks

1046
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,000
Honoring various worthy causes

1047
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,840
One of my favorites is National Make Fun of the Handicapped Week

1048
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,020
Which, uh

1049
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,980
Which Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis are in charge of, as you know

1050
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,640
During National Brotherhood Week, various special events are arranged

1051
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,680
To drive home the message of brotherhood

1052
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,980
This year, for example, on the first day of the week

1053
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,580
Malcolm X was killed

1054
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,720
Which gives you an idea of how effective the whole thing is

1055
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,140
And how much of a big deal it is

1056
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,060
I'm sure we all agree that we ought to love one another

1057
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,940
And I know there are people in the world who do not love their fellow human beings

1058
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,800
And I hate people like that

1059
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,040
Here's a song about National Brotherhood Week

1060
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,000
Oh, the white folks hate the black folks

1061
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,320
And the black folks hate the white folks

1062
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,420
To hate all but the right folks

1063
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,320
Is an old established rule

1064
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,200
But during National Brotherhood Week

1065
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,580
National Brotherhood Week

1066
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,960
Lena Horne and Sheriff Clark are dancing cheek to cheek

1067
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,560
It's fun to eulogize the people you despise

1068
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,340
As long as you don't let them in your school

1069
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,180
Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks

1070
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,460
And the rich folks hate the poor folks

1071
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,660
All of my folks hate all of your folks

1072
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,400
It's American as apple pie

1073
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,420
But during National Brotherhood Week

1074
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,660
National Brotherhood Week

1075
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,720
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans

1076
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,000
Cause it's very chic

1077
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,740
Step up and shake the hand of

1078
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,700
Someone you can't stand

1079
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,420
You can tolerate him if you try

1080
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,120
Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics

1081
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,480
And the Catholics hate the Protestants

1082
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,360
And the Hindus hate the Muslims

1083
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,420
And everybody hates the Jews

1084
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,340
But during National Brotherhood Week

1085
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,580
National Brotherhood Week

1086
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,220
It's national, everyone smile at

1087
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,140
One anotherhood week

1088
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,560
Be nice to people who are

1089
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,460
Inferior to you

1090
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,100
It's only for a week

1091
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,380
So have no fear

1092
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,740
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year

1093
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,460
Oh

1094
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:53,260
There's a stool behind your 12-smith

1095
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,260


1096
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,540
Remember it's�를

1097
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:55,540


1098
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,000
ethnography

1099
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,000


1100
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,360
Never worked as a guitarist

1101
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,340
Un criminal

1102
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:58,340


1103
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,900
Who 짜증ed the church

1104
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,400
With the appoulding Ugh!

1105
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:10,480
I hate you!

1106
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,640
and, oh, we heard Susie's wonderful, touching hate rant.

1107
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,840
Oh, it moved me.

1108
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,960
It moved parts that normally don't move on their own.

1109
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,780
Deep, deep inside.

1110
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,280
Oh, what else did Susie play along in there?

1111
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:38,940
Well, Bill Burrows, you heard, way back in there doing,

1112
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,660
no more Stalins.

1113
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,860
And Susie's brothers band, the Pink Lincolns,

1114
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,800
doing Cotton Mather.

1115
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,500
Yes, the Pink Lincolns.

1116
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,160
They actually have an LP out that's probably pretty hard to find.

1117
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,920
It's on EFA Records.

1118
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,600
They have a couple of LPs out.

1119
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:06,220
Yes, that was Chris Burrows with Cotton Mather.

1120
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,040
And, of course, Susie mixed Pink Champagne

1121
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,380
with the Christian.

1122
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:20,160
And, oh, that brings us back to our own special brand of hate

1123
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,080
here at the Church of the Subgenius Headquarters,

1124
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,260
which is the place you should write to.

1125
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,600
Get that pencil ready, man.

1126
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,780
For free information.

1127
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,220
In-formation.

1128
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,480
Well, it's catalogs and all kinds of stuff,

1129
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,220
but, you know, this is probably a non-profit radio station.

1130
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,600
We're non-profits.

1131
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,680
So, the place to write.

1132
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,960
Just whoop it out to Bob.

1133
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,080
Just good old, if you want to do it right, put Bob in quotes

1134
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:09,640
at a post office box 140306.

1135
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,740
That's box 140306.

1136
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:12,720
That's box 140306.

1137
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:12,720


1138
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,460
Here in lovely Dallas, Texas.

1139
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,360
Home of the Dallas Police.

1140
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,180
And, well, you know, it's as we used to say

1141
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:31,080
before the Secret Service tried to shut us down that one time.

1142
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,080
Made in Dallas.

1143
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,760
Where we teach them to shoot at presidents

1144
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,460
and at people who shoot at presidents.

1145
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,700
Oh, just...

1146
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,180
Just kidding, folks.

1147
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,420
Only Democratic dead ex-presidents.

1148
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,800
And that zip code is 75214.

1149
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,000
That's 75214.

1150
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,680
Thank y'all.
