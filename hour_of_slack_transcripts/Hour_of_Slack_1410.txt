J.R. Bob Dobbs, known among salesmen as the Saint of Sales, it's actually a mystic sales
ability. Bob was given powers and has been given messages all along by alien entities,
intelligences in outer space or maybe all around us that are literally fingers of the
stark fist of Jehovah One, alien space god from some sin galaxy.
J.R. Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.
J.R. Get to the stage now to soothe the crowd.
J.R. The authorities fight for control here in this chaotic situation.
J.R. Bob Dobbs came to town to set you free. He came to Dallas to set you free. You got
no business here.
J.R. You got no business being sick. You got no business being embodied. You got no
business living out of sin. You got no business living without sight.
J.R. Fortunately, this is the one true church.
J.R. Bob protects me from demons, and I got a lot of them, so I-
J.R. Bob will protect you.

Pick a booger out and wipe it on your clothes
I don't know how you feel one way or the other
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your brother
Pick a booger, pick a booger
Pick a booger, pick a booger
So you're driving in your car and you're looking at your neighbor
Minding nuggets from his nostril like he's savoring the labor
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on a string
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain
Pick a booger, pick a booger
Pick a booger, pick a booger
Pumpin' out of Livia from deep inside his sinus
Slave to the master, his royal highness
The kids all wanna have a hing crustaceans
Cause the pick a booger boogie is the new
San Francisco
He holds it, he rolls it, he's checking it for hairs
He flicks it away, but he's looking debonair
A green one on his finger, he's been flicking it for days
Pick a booger boogie, it's the new dance craze
Pick a booger, pick a booger
Pick a booger, pick a booger
Pick a booger, pick a booger
Pick a booger, pick a booger

Hello
Hello
Hello
Who's this?
I just told you, Bob
Oh, um, good
We, um, no fear
We're just here to tell you about some things
What kind of things?
About Dick
If you need me, I'll be out back
I'll be the one with the gun in my mouth
Oh, Hal's on the phone
He says it's important
What?
Hello?
What a horrible thing
It must be insane
I'm afraid I'm going to die






Why?
Who are you?
Who are you?
He said he was going to kill me
Before the month is out
You've got one of the less romantic ones
Not that revenge is often emotive in these cases, of course
It's usually just the impulse of a man whose sex re-offered track
Oh, no, no
No need to be alarmed
They invariably get their satisfaction at the other end of the telephone
By shocking you, making you gasp
The intake of your breath is like a kiss
Huh?
Come on, now
You haven't been able to fool your Aunt Bea since you were two
Well, it's just some stupid thing that's been happening, really
Strange man's been calling me on the telephone
Yeah, another thing
Just like with the subgenius minister
You know, Gordon?
You know about, you know
You know about how the conspiracy is like a sinister fiendish entity?
That is what they are
Even though they're like compulsive individuals
They are like one organism
And they're all over
Like the size of a tentacle that's growing
That represents the Khan
That's what they are, even though they're individuals
It's like, they're like one big sinister organism
And if you're not one of them, they're out to get you
And they're targeting me
And they're trying to take a piece out of me like that
Then this doctor, Colton Rain
Who drilled my tooth unnecessarily down to a nerve
Because after he failed to keep the fillings in my teeth

It's time to put yourself first
You can call the number on your screen
We're waiting to hear from you
I won't call again, I promise
What the hell are you?
What the hell are you?
Hello? Increase the output
Yeah, if you can just slap yourself awake
That's the main thing we're trying to do
If we can reach just 10 unsaved individuals out there
And get them to notice the schematics
To surf the line

That they're not just a block plane
As Bob refers to it
If you can just find a way to recognize the two conspiracy theories
Listen, you're on the right track
The answer is, you have the answer
Take the slack
It's yours
You didn't recognize it because
The conspiracy had you looking for something
More expensive and more complicated
I'd like to read some words
That many satisfied
Church members with
We've got piles of mail every day
This reader said
Suddenly it's girls, girls, girls
Boy, your book, Things to See, Say and Do
Is great
We have gospel missions all over the country
This is true
People don't understand quite how large
And dangerous an organization
The Church of the Subgenius is
It's, you've heard of the Moonies
The Scientologists, the Christians
This is a very important book

Better than each of those individually
But worse than all of them put together
There really are subgeniuses everywhere
Our mailing list is doubling
Every couple of weeks
And the power
The power of abnormality
I think
Will eventually be felt
In the guts of all those
Complacent people out there
Those who are
Who are afraid of change
Listen to that young Noah
Who is afraid of change?
Yes, he seems to think
He's got the world by the oysters
Try to
You can tell he hasn't had that
Deviated septum operated on yet
And he obviously doesn't have that
Hap, hap, happy day feeling
Don't worry folks, he's really
What? Yeah, I know, he's really
We're gonna run an ID check to see
Which is the real Stang?
The happy-go-lucky
Mature Stang
Who's not all bit embittered by
Life, oddly enough
Well, you know some
Some people really like
The mature Stang
I mean, there's a lot
Yeah, really
I mean, do I have to draw you a picture?
I mean, it's kind of
I fill out every flyaway card there is in that thing
Yeah, it's off-putting, frankly
I saw a magazine on the stands
It was like 50 plus Stang
Yes, exactly
Like for people who like mature
And the Stang films
They're not, of course
Actual films, nothing is anymore
But they're called Stang films
And they, uh
They're shown, yeah
Now that I'm verified
See, these are shown at
Bachelor parties and
Secret to
Access granted
The amount of Stang
Associated with each one of them
Is debatable, but
That's the tradition
Now we're going to take you back
To a time when life was
Longer, shorter, and some would say
Sweeter, hot and merry
When the devil took the hindmost
Yes, who needed
Doctors and dentists
Look at that devil's hindmost
She's gorgeous
And most people would say
Great day in the morning
Great day in the morning
Now I feel alive
Ready to challenge
The world as a
Newly ordained overman
Ah, yes
Dear friends
The smoke of that pipe goes up
Against the morning sky
Higher than the zenith
The smoke of that burning
Goes up forever
Puff, puff, puff, puff
This is no mere puffery, friends
The pipe of thoughtfulness
This is the real thing
The pipe of planning
The pipe of piquance
And pusillanimity
The pipe of thoughtfulness

This is the pipe of destiny
Um, hold on while I look up those words
I always get those
Confused
Piquant and pusillanimous
And pusillaginous
Is it true that you guys have the
Pipe that bears Christ's side

Oh, someone's at the door
Just a moment
I love these dob stores
Whenever I get depressed at work
I just walk into a dob store
They're so big and confusing
And I can't find a sales person
You know this kind of is against
The whole thing that Bob was originally about
What, what? He was a salesman
Yeah, but he was an individual salesman
It just fixes you
This is no good
This isn't subgenius
This is on the site of the original
X-Day
Oh, look at the flying saucer
Hey, do you have two quarters?
I want to try that one
The Bob and Connie mom and pop stores
You know kids
I'm gonna see you over by Connie's World
About 4 o'clock
I'm gonna go try this out
See, who knows?
It's not worth it
You'll wait for like an hour and a half
And then it's like five minutes up Connie and out Connie
Oh, that's not very slackful
So you sail up Connie
And kind of swirl around
And then you sail out
How about the Midway?
Is that worth visiting?
That's the cool part
Because the people watching
The arcades and stuff are pretty
Like most amusement parks
But watching the subgeniuses
You can just sit there
And people watch
Or rather
People, yeah people
Subgenius watch
You don't mean very special people
Yeah
We like to
That's the polite way of putting it
Now boys
In the Bible it says
He who looketh upon the two-headed geek
Becomes himself
A horrible freak
Where is Hal doing?
I have come to declare
The story that manipulate
Our sins

Any way
Let us master
Your god
So Jehovah
You're a complete

to have our God who made our minds impacted
by the Jesus whom we know as your people.
Be it now.
Oh, come on.
Oh, that Bible video game.
I like that boss monster that you have to fight at the very end.
Jehovah.
For Am I Not Jehovah-thon.
Now, in the subgenius video game, Jehovah One is the first boss monster
that you fight after you have befriended Bob.
Once you have befriended Bob, you have to first beat
and then befriend a whole series of minor boss monsters.
There's like puzzling evidence.
And that's part of your war on God thing.
The overman.
Yeah.
And each one has weaknesses and powers.
Like Doc Frop's power, of course, is Frop,
and his weakness is Pussycats.
You know what I don't like is in this subgenius movie, though,
is how they talk about slack, but they just beat you over the head with it
for the whole three hours.
And it's not really very slackful.
Yeah.
Preaching.
And it's...
And it's...
Well, if they had slack, they wouldn't want to watch the movie, would they?
I mean, we can't give them slack.
They gotta watch the movie.
Well, that's why we switched it to a video game.
Because everybody already knows the plot.
Okay.
X-Day.
That's the plot.
So...
You go out...
Talk about having to jump into this lake of fire.
Oh.
That's gross.
Hot enough for you?
You can tell the fire's superimposed, but that guy's really burning up.
That's not makeup.
No.
And there's no way to make this up.
How do you make up with Satan, anyway?
Well, some would say we never split from Satan,
who has gotten a bad rap all the way,
as have all who have trod the left-hand path.
The question is, are we agents of the left-hand or the right-hand path?
We're the ambidextrous path.
We're the path of least resistance.
That's right.
That's right.
I've heard...
Princess Wee's been reading her prescriptures.
The path of least...
When was the last time we dwelled morbidly on the path of least resistance?
Perhaps when the shining path of least resistance was visiting or calling you in the middle of a packing crisis at X-Day.
Woo-hoo!
No, but the...
That used to be synonymous with the luck plane.
Yes.
So many have forgotten the original, true teachings of Bob.
And they follow all this apocalypse.
Superful garbage, basically.
This crappy computer-generated fake Bob stuff that wouldn't fool a three-year-old.
Dada.
Oh, except that one.
We don't want to disabuse.
You know, he who mocks the infant's faith shall be mocked in age and death.
Praise God.
Wow.
And one that's not funny.
People tend to forget the role of Bob in toilet training.
All right, now I'm not going to go much further.
Burn in the background.
Yeah.
After all, this isn't a juvenile daycare center.
Exactly.
It's not.
I mean, I kind of thought it was.
I thought it was the...
In a way.
Well, no, this is the subgenius elder daycare center.
Yeah.
And when they get old, we push them out into the cold wind.
Hey, what you doing?
Who are you pushing?
Sorry, Hal.
Thanks for your help.
What are you doing?
Just slam the door down.
This ice floor is cold.
And they slowly...
They don't feel a thing.
I remember Flo.
She was cold as ice.
I feel like a...
Just tell them, look, out there in the white, that's X-Day.
Those are my bunions.
I got chill blades and...
I complained because it was hot and mysterious.
And then they moved it to the North Pole.
And then I met a man who had no shoes and he took mine.
Look, there he is now.
I forget.
Do I live here?
Just a pile of flies.
These aren't ordinary flies.
These are the porbo flies of the Congo Basin.
They swarm in the hundreds of thousands in the tropical heat and moisture,
creating almost unbearable conditions.
They lay their eggs in the exit wounds of U.S. presidents.
From their...
They hatch and fly around carrying the little footballs,
those carrying cases for nuclear weapon initiation.
The red button is in that briefcase.
They watch those red-headed comedians from the past.
Handcuffs each of those African flies.
In Hatari, also starring Red Button.
Oh, here they are now.
A giant swarm...
...covering the sun.
Stinging, biting, leaving nothing alive.
Driving animals, birds, hippopotamuses, crocs, all to madness.
In insanity and agony, they dash themselves to pieces on the rocks.
But those flies make a pretty good soup, if you can catch enough of them.
Yes, you...
Waiter, there aren't enough flies in my soup.
Right.
Yes, I've heard...
Flies.
...soup.
African fly soup.
Ah, you're a lousy idiot.
You know, today, folks...
Fly flan, I've heard, is very...
Fly flan?
Fly flan.
Those flans have flown.
A flea and a fly in a flue.
Maggot Jam.
They're imprisoned, so what could they do?
Said the flea, let us fly.
Said the fly, let us flee.
A little too much show there.
So they flew through a flaw in the flue.
What's he doing?
Oh, nothing.
I thought you said this wasn't the daycare center for the so-called...
I was just...
Just wool gathering, all right?
I can't be as sharp as I was when I was a young sprat.
All oafishly full of bounce and bobance.
Vim vigor and vitality.
Youthful zest.
That is...
Oh, look at that.
Well, that settles that controversy.
As friends, UFOs are real.
This photograph...
Landing in the desert.
This is the clearest UFO photo ever.
Say goodbye to those blurry...
UFO photo.
Well, we just...
It just came in on the inter-roster.
Look.
Look.
See?
The radio listeners can't see the laptop.
See?
That settles that controversy.
Now we know.
We know for sure.
They are landing.
They are landing in the desert.
I, Princess Biardo, have just seen...
That is a very fabulous photograph of a...
And she's the queen of all UFOs.
And they went to meet you, Burning Man.
Burning Man?
Well, I...
A spaceship.
Yeah.
A UFO.
I don't like Burning Man ever since they moved it to that desert.
A spaceship from another world.
They don't have any toilets.
There's giant interstellar...
Wiener-eating spiders that take all your beanie-weenies.
One of my many subjects.
You'll just have to cozy up to them.
To them, you're the monster.
We're standing over Burning Man's little body.
Yeah, it's like the Colossus of toads.
I mean, roads.
All roads lead here.
Where the blackened, bleached bones of toads erode in the desert.
There's a UFO.
There's a UFO again, yeah.
That one's not as convincing somehow.
Little Burning Man.
Well...
I see, yes, but...
Oh, I thought that was the surface of Mars.
Like the village of the Potawatomi Indians.
Oh, Burning the Burning...
It's a little Burning Man.
A giant bagel in the foreground distracts from credibility, but...
But...
I should have another festival called Drowning Woman.
By Yostar.
And some say they will again.
But it really is a shame that all these festivals coincide with about the same time, so...
Oh my gosh, what a conflagration.
Look at it burn.
It burns me up.
It's relaxing, though.
I happen to go from X-Day to Starwood to Burning Man.
That is hot.
And back again.
And they burn a man at every one of them.
It bangs.
It bangs.
The only one where they hide the man is Starwood.
The man is deep inside the big bonfire.
Really?
So you can't see him.
Well, it's that basket...
You know, meditational and stuff?
Basket man.
No, he's the dude with the plan to stick it to the man.
Oh, I see.
It's not an art.
It's a religion.
He's a tough cop.
Your dude is here.
Oh, who?
Oh.
Basket case man.
What was that?
The Nicolas Cage.
Yeah, right.
Nicolas Cage is splatting it.
That's based on Starwood, of course.
The freakout?
The George Lucas?
Well, they always pick...
Yeah, George Lucas is Starwood 4.
What is it that you think that you're talking about?
Because there is no such thing in the Starwood bonfire.
Starwood, beautiful Starwood, beautiful Starwood, flying through space.
Yeah, exactly.
That's exactly what it's like, folks.
And the drugs and the LSD.
Yeah.
Freakouts.
Starwood.
And the body painting and the nose rings.
And Darth Vader.
And the patchouli.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Where Reverend Stang speaks.
And everyone listens, unlike X-Day.
Don't kid.
That's all too accurate.
Those subgeniuses, they come there and they just socialize.
They don't listen to our sermons.
No, we sit there talking for ten hours.
At that picnic table.
And the microphones with PAs and everything.
But then he goes to Starwood and these pagans listen intently with thoughtful expressions.
Oh, they take notes.
They laugh whenever we hold up the laugh sign.
They laugh at all the jokes.
You really don't need to coach.
And they buy stuff afterwards.
Yeah, they buy the swag.
Subgeniuses are utterly worthless bums.
I need to save my money for beer.
Yeah, I know.
That's what they're like.
You know, these bobbies.
Can you buy me some beer?
I've got the money for it.
Not now, kid.
I'm busy.
Can't you see I'm broadcasting here?
In fact, I was just talking about how unreliable this generation of dweebs is that's come up.
They just don't have the pizzazz that subgeniuses did back in the day when we were so wild and wiggy.
Does somebody have a sentence?
Let's go to the D5.
Yeah, I'm going.
Are you going?
Back in them days, you had to sneak around to smoke your froth.
They didn't just shove it in your face and make you smoke.
Well, I missed count stock, and then I was there for froth stock, too.
But I missed froth stock one.
I was the laughing stock.
Froth stock one.
Yeah.
Froth stock.
I told myself I had to stop.
Then and then.
So I stopped.
That was the, was that one?
No, two, in effect.
Froth stock four.
It's 81 debiable as, in my mind, as a dock stock.
It isn't really, but it is.
Well, in these films we're watching, it looks harmless and innocent, but it doesn't show what it is.
It does. It really does.
Because it's the first time the conclave, it's the first time I see everybody in one place.
It was the world, yeah, it was the first world subgenius convention.
And then the second one in my mind is that sternos lair, where we just took a whole evening to destroy his piano.
Wow.
And I have on video.
The moment where he comes in and says, hey, my piano.
Now, see, back in them days, we said demons destroyed real pianos.
They didn't do it with a video game or a computer-generated piano.
But they just, right, of course, it looks and sounds better on the computer version.
Yep.
And it wasn't virtual.
It's not girl's name.
Yep.
And you could go to Conway and get tea, which I would do a lot.
Conway Twitty?
Conway Arkansas.
Conway.
Reverend Conway Twitty.
But.
Yeah.
Yeah.






The earliest.
Like Reverend Roy Orbison.
I recognize him from the sunglasses right away.
And Reverend Buddy Holly.
All those guys are still alive, friends, but living under false identities in pure slack, thanks to Bob.
Meanwhile, here's another track from Full Frontal Klugman by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

I could use a husky man like you out at my motor farm.

Oh my God, Herschel.
I just can't believe you're here like this.
Do you think the effect of that turkey meat will wear off?
Because...
God damn, Herschel, you sure are ugly.
But it's not so bad if I don't look at you.

You know, I've got a guilty feeling that this is all my fault.
What will our children think of their dad?
What will our children look like?
I guess the pretty girl is stuck with the monster she created.
We live in a world in which there is a constant change.
Every second, every minute, every hour, changes take place.
These changes are perhaps invisible to us because our level of awareness is limited.
Take for example...
How the things we do and say to the people we meet.
All these things affect our lives.
It kills our destiny.
We never know how or when we will meet a person who will become a catalyst.
What is a catalyst?
Well, in this case, a catalyst is a person that will bring about change.
They could be good or bad.
But there will be changes.
They could be bad or good.
Every second, every minute, every hour, changes take place.
Hoist the junkies from a tree.
Slit their throats to catch their spark-laced blood.
A child is raised to feed the mute and the sick.
I could use a husky baby like you and hold her far away...
And hold her far away...
ön smelling perk tee.
Bj Herzor.
I could use a husky man like you

Um.
And, of course, you can call 848-455-510-8505.
For those of you on drugs.
Yeah, you can.
And see where that gets you.
Hey, you said that phone number the way people do on my answer machine.
Yo.
You know, when you call my machine, it says, please leave your number twice, slowly and
clearly, on account of I'm kind of deaf and phones don't work very well anymore.
These modern day phones.
And why just this morning, I checked my answer machine back in Cleveland and there was a
guy saying, and this is all he said in the first message.
Five, one, two, three, six, eight.
No, no, no.
And he hung up.
And he called back.
He called back and said, five, one, two, three, six, eight.
No, no, no.
And that was it.
But he did leave the same message.
Twice.
Now, my crazy, my crazy caller, Bernard, who used to, he used to fill my machine up and
I had to block him because he was making it impossible.
He must have gotten a new phone because he started leaving messages again.
And the latest one, he said, this is Bernard M. Braithwaite.
It's incredible what I'm seeing on the television.
The mysterious things.
Falling out of the sky and attacking people and killing people all over the world.
It is the end times.
This is the day of judgment.
I know 1998 was a long time ago.
But a queen of UFOs.
And then he repeated the exact same message.
He's reporting truth right now.
It's like tongues.
No, no.
That's a word for verbatim.
No, he's just reporting what happened.
Yeah.
What?
And it's easy to remember.
This is what actually happened.
Didn't you hear about it?
Bernard always leaves messages at least twice.
This time he seemed to be surprised.
The same message?
My message, yeah.
Yes.
My machine now.
Just in case, man.
Just in case he didn't.
Message received.
My machine used to shut off at 30 seconds.
And he would try to get his whole thing into 30 seconds.
And if he didn't, he would call back.
And he never got it perfect.
So he would usually fill up my entire machine before he was, and never be satisfied.
Well, this latest time, he was surprised that it didn't cut him off at 30 seconds.
And he was kind of at a loss for words.
So he repeated the message on the same message rather than making a separate call.
Yeah.
Because I think he maybe got the impression after he'd been blocked twice that maybe we were having trouble with the way he was doing.
Oh, well.
He does not seem to know about the Internet or the...
The hour of slack was still in production.
Yeah.
And he probably won't hear this.
But Bernard, if you do hear this, you know, you never have left a phone number.
Hello, this is me.
To add on to what I was saying, I know the time is short.
Like, I'm trying to speak with this throwing tooth, you know, of a crown that, you know, the dentist made for me.
You know, you're not one of them.
They're out to get you.
And they're protecting their own.
The police is a sham.
They are hypocritical, lying jerks.
Instead of, you know, you know, targeting, you know, you know, you know, concentrating on the people who are bothering you, the pinks and normals,
they target me and try to berate me and dehumanize me and telling and asking me questions that have nothing to do with what's going on.
Showing that they're only protecting their own beast element of humanity.

Did you know about the ender?
No. The last time I saw him, he put a banana in my anus.
I was bleeding and it made him angry.
It would be unfortunate if I had put the banana in my ender.
And then the enders should start bleeding.
Yes. Children should be healed and the general world should follow the malaise.
Yes.
That's why it would be better if you didn't put the banana in my anus at this moment.
I'll be back when I put this banana in my life.
Have a nice day.
You make my anus very happy.
My God!
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Speaking of which, now the news.
Daylight saving time is expected early this week in Nome, Alaska.
Now it's pushing north and east toward Colorado and other parts of the Great Lakes.
Safety officials suggest as you change your clocks, change the batteries in your PR detectors.
This is PR.
Britain made the claim yesterday, saying they'd recently seen British warplanes flying near them.
Cyclists are rolling from Newtown, Connecticut to West Africa to send a message.
They were not on a hostage extraction mission.
The cyclists are riding in support of what they describe as common sense solutions to prevent Congress.
I'm hoping for measures that will help this ride.
The riders are expected to arrive at PR News on Tuesday.
The Associated Press and other news outlets cite PR News in Washington.
For the archaeologists.
Every day is a hair day.
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name.
I got just what I wanted from.
Everybody here today.
And everybody said, name me a.
Name me a.
Now I reason because here is inflicted unbelief.
Name me a.
Unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister.
Right now, man.
Sarcastic.
Satisfaction.
Secure my weapon, corporal.
Again?
Again.
Big day.
Did you get my present?
Placed a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer.
Hmm.
I saw those.
I see pictures.
Yeah.
Do you dare see that?
You transfer all the pictures that I just put on there into your brain.
The thing is.
I'll just put them right into my USB port.
Yes.
And then I'll look at them.
And then all of them.
Take them away and put them into the.
Okay.
I'll see how it looks.
Port.
Port.
That's not USB.
Starberry home.
This is USB 3.
Ooh.
I'm only.
My port only holds USB 2.
Oh, I guess that kind of took us all by surprise.
That's an exit, not an entrance.
Okay.
Here we go.
Oh.
Our port.
Now this movie has Robert Vaughn as a man searching for Hitler.
And then he meets him.
Oh, it's not Teenage Caveman.
No.
No.
It's much later.
And Keenan Wynn is in it.
Who looks to be 83.
And they have.
I love this poor guy running through these awful sets.
And he can barely move.
It's.
And.
And when he finds Hitler, he's kind of a reedy voice.
Thin little guy that is produced by a hologram.
He's the wimpy Hitler.
And this is.
This is actually the music and sound effects from that movie whose name I can never remember.
But I caught it on a 3 a.m.
You know.
Have you guys done the.
They shaved Hitler's mustache.
The post-World War II Hitler movie festival yet.
You would have to include that.
Why?
I mean, it's.
It's the Twilight Zone with Dennis.
Where Dennis Hopper meets Hitler.
It's called He's Alive.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And it's the Fuhrer.
He teaches Dennis Hopper how to make those zippy Nazi speeches.
Yeah.
I haven't watched that one in a while.
I have.
I watched it in a while.
I know.
It probably.
Princess, we and I watched all of them in the right hour and.
All of them in the right hour and.
Some of them weren't good, weren't they?
I.
I watched all of them at once.
Yeah.
We did.
Yeah.
We did two.
300.
300.





352.
No, I mean, I watched all of them at once.
We had 352 shows in one half hour.
We put a day in between every two or three shows.
That's super speedy.
And then I had to keep watching because they're all those awful hour-long ones.
And in the.
What about Simon Oakland and the submarine?
Oh, God.
Endless.
Yeah.
In the thing I have.
They gave me a thing and I looked at the thing and the thing says.
The thing.
Can you take it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The show right behind Twilight Zone had been killed two minutes before airtime.
So they.
And it's ghost then appeared on Twilight Zone.
Yeah, exactly.
But it didn't know it was a ghost.
He didn't find out it was a ghost until the end.
Yeah.
A ghost.
It's like at the beginning of the Twilight Zone.
Oh, my God.
It doesn't know it's a radio show.
And then everybody else is a radio show.
But finally, the horrible twist arrives.
I too was a radio show.
That whole time.
Oh, my ghost brother.
I'm not one of those mannequins or ghosts or robots.
Time to face the challenge of the ghost bots.
Okay.
So we get out the radio robot.
This radio water will feel great.
The ghost in the shell.
The spirit in the machine.
If you like caveman robot, you'll love ghost robot.
It turned out to be there all the time.
Robots did have souls.
As we found out when they started showing up as ghosts in vast numbers.
What if like Tom Cruise were the robots and the robots from Mars were nice?
Oh, sorry.
Well, that disproves that.
And you can see the way they act.
I still go back to the classics.
First thing I ever typed in on YouTube.
Hitler versus Jesus.
Who won?
What was horrifying was four different projects came out.
Of what?
What was the title?
Hitler versus Jesus.
Which has always been live here.
So you got Hitler and Jesus on the moon and Hitler has nine lugers and Jesus has the power
to forgive.
Oh, great.
Way to go, Jesus.
Why don't you forgive the hell out of Hitler now?
Just start forgiving.
Okay.
I forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you,
forgive you, forgive you.
Of course, all the other rules of physics are in process.
Six and a half million times.
More than that.
You could jump really high and then leave the moon.
You can jump really high and jump up in the sky.
You can float in space.
Oh, at this point, I'm not sure.






Is that my tinnitus or is that the show?
Jack hammering on the run.
Wouldn't it be cool if I could just do this?
Okay.
Oh, it stopped.
It hurts, but it stopped.
The silence sent the jungle away.
I sent the music to my heart.
Now, this next day at Dr. Dark's drive-in, he'll be showing Iron Sky, which does have
Hitler on the moon.
It also has Kurt Kursteiner in the movie.
Have you seen it yet?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, you've seen Kurt.
It has their Fuhrer, who is not Hitler.
He's the Fuhrer that followed Hitler and made the movie.
You did not see that in your mind as you watched it?
I certainly didn't.
The studly Nazi who ends up going working for Sarah President Palin.
Yeah.
It's not Dougie.
He really reminds one of Kurt.
And some of the shots, the way he's lit, unbelievably funny to me.
Oh, yeah.
It's that guy I met on a submarine with Hitler and how he was the cook and it was
a horrible dream.
It was no dream.
Princess, what was that movie we saw that ...
It really did have Papa Joe Mama in it.
God.
The history of life?
Did she hear you on the UFO?
No.
I can't hear him.
Van Helsing.
Van Helsing.
Yeah.
The horrible movie about monsters.
Van Helsing.
K-Rob, like us.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
A side character who's a monk, who's kind of like the cue to James Bond, is the cue
to Van Helsing.
And he makes weapons and stuff.
And that guy kind of talks like Papa Joe Mama.
Yes, yes.
And he looks like Papa Joe Mama.
He does.
Coincidence or conspiracy?
Seriously, look at Van Helsing again and think about not that Queersteiner guy, but Papa
Joe Mama.
Gotcha.
Kurt Queersteiner was the guy who did the Expose Bob website that has angered so many
earnest and all-knowing subgeniuses.
So many.
Why would anybody do something like that?
About once a year, some newbie discovers exposebob.com and gets so upset that this idiot
would say such terrible things about the nice, innocent, funny church of the subgenius.
Yeah, I mean, where do these people come from?
Where do they get off?
All this talk of brainwashing and testicles and vice grips in Dobstown and so forth.
Those are rumors.
A few little incidents.
And they make like, that's what we're all about.
You know, once a rumor gets out, why, it might as well be true.
Well, since they're saying it's true, I guess we might as well pull out those vice grips
and clamp them on.
Yeah, I mean, we're already blamed for it.
We might as well.
Yeah, sure.
If they're blaming, if they're saying we're kidnapping teenagers and brainwashing them,
well, we might as well go ahead.
We'll go ahead and kidnap some.
Like them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like those listeners there.
Forever, they'll be forced to listen to this show.

Friends,
we're glad you listened to this show,
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
And not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.
But if you truly love Bob,
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to Subgenius.com front page,
or especially the radio page,
or the catalog store pages,
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own subgeniuses.
We want to make situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference,
even if it's only once a month,
from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that
glow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs,
if you don't pay dogs.
We also take checks and money orders to
Subgenius Foundation.
P.O. Box.

Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
