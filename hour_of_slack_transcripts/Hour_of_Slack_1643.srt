1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,080
Oh

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,140
From the church

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:28,740
Dot-com and net and or a save dot-com

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,960
the air rays

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,020
Because it worked it's about the night we saved the universe

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
I

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,700
When we were born into this life

8
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,180
We were destined to make it right

9
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,020
And it's pretty determined

10
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,780
And this is our fate

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
We're singing this song

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
So you can read me

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,980
We are gone

14
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,240
The universe

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,140
We are full grown

16
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,800
We are grown up men

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,980
We are law passed

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,020
We pay to reason it

19
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,440
It is our mission

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,240
It is our task

21
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,460
It's obvious

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,800
Yet you still ask

23
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,520
We are gone

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,640
The universe

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,380
We are gone

26
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,460
The universe

27
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,980
We are gone

28
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,020
The universe

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,320
It is time

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The universe

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,760
guitar solo

34
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,840
guitar solo

35
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,100
guitar solo

36
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,860
guitar solo

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,320
guitar solo

38
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,740
Well, maybe next time.

39
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,460
One, two, three.

40
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,200
guitar solo

41
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,620
We learn the hard way

42
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,420
All I need is one more day

43
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,320
To get it right again

44
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,860
If I didn't know better

45
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,980
I'd know better than given

46
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,000
Give me time, I'll get it

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,360
Let me go around, let me go around

48
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,380
Let me go around again

49
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,980
Give me time, I'll get it

50
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,200
Let me go around, let me go around

51
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,240
Let me go around again

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,800
We need to get back

53
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,540
To the old religion

54
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
Back on track

55
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,680
Worship fire and air

56
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,940
And earth and water

57
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,420
And no despair

58
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,080
Give me time, I'll get it

59
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,340
Let me go around, let me go around

60
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,480
Let me go around again

61
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,140
Give me time, I'll get it

62
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,320
Let me go around, let me go around

63
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,540
Let me go around again

64
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,960
Days are seconds

65
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,020
Months are minutes

66
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,280
Step right up to the wheel and spin it

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
Hear the sound of a marching band

68
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,040
Mind the music and the steps

69
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,420
Let's dance

70
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,360
Let's dance

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,460
Watch me clean

72
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,280
In the blood

73
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,100
Of a rock and roll band

74
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,400
Before the flood

75
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,340
I will be

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,220
Your friend

77
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,100
Nothing less, nothing more

78
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,020
Nothing better than

79
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,500
Give me time, I'll get it

80
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,780
Let me go around, let me go around

81
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,860
Let me go around again

82
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,440
Give me time, I'll get it

83
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
Let me go around, let me go around

84
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,860
Let me go around again

85
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,980
Give me time, yeah

86
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,100
Give me time, give me time

87
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,080
It means I'm getting

88
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,300
Giving time, giving time

89
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,580
Giving time, I'll get it

90
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,020
Giving time, giving time

91
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,460
Did somebody say tan?

92
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,580
Poor misunderstood dude.

93
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm Reverend Watt DeFock, ordained in the Church of the Subgenius,

94
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,320
all of whose members get to...

95
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,140
create our own gospels, or myths, or schticks, whatever,

96
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,120
instead of those ancient, flea-bitten, old-bargain church abasement supreme truths,

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,020
all poorly translated and transubstantiated now,

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,780
and all originally created, obviously, for blatant political control,

99
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,360
you know, using our God-given brains for a change.

100
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,520
Anyway, my shorter persevere, Bob Dobbs,

101
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,240
was telling me about the backyard barbecue wing-dingy-flung,

102
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,060
for his friends and angels and sinners, back in 1966,

103
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
or was it 99666?

104
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,960
While Connie was doing a favor for Mr. and Mrs. God,

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,800
friends call them Yahweh, Vishnala, and Jezebel,

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,920
while she looked after their special needs child, Cthulhu,

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,980
well, Father God introduced Bob to his old buddy,

108
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,480
the head of Karma Cleanup and Soul Recycling,

109
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,220
whom religious authorities and other scheming hustlers insultingly call Satan.

110
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,320
But I'm ramblin'.

111
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,460
Must be the frop.

112
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,060
Anyway, Bob struck up a chat with old Metroton, who summed it up neatly,

113
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,560
You don't blame the garbage crew for the stench of their trucks.

114
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,360
That's your garbage, people.

115
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,340
And calling me the evil one is like saying trash men are made of trash.

116
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,720
And Metch explained that, of course, when he encouraged humans to think and stay healthily skeptical,

117
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,560
those goddamn religion peddlers called him evil.

118
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,300
They'd all lose their minds.

119
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,300


120
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,000
They'd all lose their jobs and become street beggars like Jesus was,

121
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:13,380
if enough of their Irvine flocked-up souls realized our minds are the true holy of holies.

122
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,940
And infantile brainwashed worship makes Satan's eternal employer God puke,

123
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,860
as Holden Caulfield put it metaphorically.

124
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,640
As, of course, everything is.

125
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,200
Where's the frop pipe?

126
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,440
Anyway, it's important to that big, bad, old devil to tell us humans

127
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,820
not to give our brains away to those evil, religious con men.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Not to believe their transparent B.S.

129
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,140
Stay like good baby sheep now and let us fleece you or you'll burn.

130
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,940
Maybe later, or maybe we'll burn your ass right now.

131
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,680
Everywhere the same con.

132
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,980
This matters to me, Satan told Bob, because the nastiest, filthiest part of our job

133
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,420
is all the deceit and hatred and violence and murder.

134
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,040
Murder that human religion breeds.

135
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,880
That my crew and I have to clean up down there in the Sheol Karma pits

136
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,280
where you're all gonna lose it before jumping into the big bath.

137
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,880
The last and first big banggasm.

138
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,500
Sounds like fun, don't it?

139
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,000
Getting born again, as we must, is the most fun we can have without our skeletons on.

140
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,800
But, as Metch warns, my crew and I are professionals.

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
Don't try this at home.

142
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Forcing your way out there.

143
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,800
There is, uh, well, he says, think of non-stop puking your own guts and feces.

144
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,300
That's fellatio from the Virgin Mary while Beethoven and Miles play a piano-trumpet duo.

145
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Compared to the mess where suicide plops you.

146
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,180
And, if you used to know someone who's doing that, well, think of them whenever you find

147
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,780
some simple, direct way to make another person's life easier.

148
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
And do it for them.

149
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,740
That means much more than it sounds like now.

150
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,280
But, I'm reverend.

151
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,260
What the fuck do I know?

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,260
As I walk thework, my brain is clenched into a

153
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,260


154
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,920
When this believed-to- collaborations began on the Temple at Buckingham Palace with Davis

155
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,960
later, there ar Platt, and the motion questo, the river that goes below, was livestream.

156
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,700
Thank you.

157
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,840
Thank you.

158
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,020
Thank you.

159
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,540
Thank you.

160
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Thank you.

161
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,540
Thank you.

162
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Thank you.

163
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,180
Thank you.

164
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,660
Thank you.

165
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,340
Thank you.

166
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,520
Thank you.

167
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,460
Ah yes dear friends,

168
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,660
the swinging love corpses.

169
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,220
will be all that you hear.

170
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,260
Now I'm gonna go back,

171
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,240
and I won't be stopped.

172
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm gonna go back

173
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,240
to smoke the ultimate fraud.

174
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,300
You just can't imagine

175
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,320
what it's like to you go

176
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,680
when reality's on hold

177
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,660
and Doc's Docs are show.

178
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,940
We got high,

179
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,880
so high,

180
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,200
Doc's Docs now do.

181
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,400
We got high,

182
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,500
so high,

183
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,480
Doc's Docs now do.

184
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,260
Oh, yeah.

185
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,460
I went way up high on Doc's Doc

186
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,300
Mountain. I climbed down.

187
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,660
I climbed up all the way to the top.

188
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,920
I took,

189
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,200
I took everything you could think of.

190
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,380
I shot

191
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
beers. I smoked

192
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,100
heroin.

193
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
I started marijuana.

194
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,060
I struck

195
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,740
I stuck, uh,

196
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,780
I stripped glue.

197
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,000
I put, uh,

198
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,220
um,

199
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
barbiturate

200
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,040
repositories in my rectal cavity.

201
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,300
I went home with a waitress

202
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,080
the way I always do.

203
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,180
Well, how was I to know

204
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,280
she was with the Russians too?

205
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,000
Hey!

206
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,500
Hey!

207
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,100
Hey!

208
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,960
Hey!

209
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,360
Hey!

210
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,080
Hey!

211
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,300
Hey!

212
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,300


213
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,300


214
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,300


215
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,300


216
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,360
I was hiding in

217
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,880
Havana.

218
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I took a little risk.

219
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
Sent lawyers,

220
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,380
guns and money.

221
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,500
Dad kicked me out of this.

222
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,140
Hey!

223
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm the innocent bystander

224
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,820
But somehow I got stuck

225
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,420
Between the rock and the hard place

226
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,000
And I'm down on my luck

227
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,180
Yes, I'm down on my luck

228
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,360
I'm down on my luck

229
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Yes, I'm down on my luck

230
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,580
And I'm hiding in Honduras

231
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,420
I'm a desperate man

232
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,780
Settling lawyers

233
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,040
Guns and money

234
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,980
The shares hit the fan

235
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,820
Settling lawyers

236
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,120
Guns and money

237
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,060
Settling lawyers

238
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,340
Guns and money

239
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,760
Settling lawyers

240
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,960
Guns and money

241
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,520
Settling lawyers

242
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,740
Guns and money

243
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,640
Welcome.

244
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:52,820
Welcome.

245
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,400
Welcome, dear friends,

246
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,520
to the Subgenius Radio Ministry,

247
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,720
Hour of Slack with Princess We Are Doe

248
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,020
here with me and the lonesome cowboy Dave,

249
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,060
I was hoping.

250
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,120
Will Coleman.

251
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,780
Hello.

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,640
Hello.

253
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,040
Oh, there he is.

254
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,920
He's our Dave.

255
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,440
So, Dave, I have to do the credits

256
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,540
because we just...

257
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm sorry, did me interrupt the credits?

258
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,400
We just finished hearing Bob Walkenhorn,

259
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,240
the first solo doing Lawyers, Guns and Money,

260
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,540
that Warren Ziva song.

261
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,660
I'm going to start from the beginning, actually.

262
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,180
The first thing we heard was the howls of dammit.

263
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:44,000
Then an introduction title sequence by Fernanda Nettily Moore.

264
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,540
We heard the swinging love corpses doing Save the Universe this time.

265
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,120
The Rainmakers.

266
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,760
The Rainmakers doing Given Time.

267
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,880
Some preaching by Reverend Watt D. Falk.

268
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,380
The Psychoskeletons doing I Dropped the Eyedrops.

269
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,580
And the swinging love corpses high on Dockstock Mountain.

270
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,300
And we're heading for Dockstock Mountain in two weeks.

271
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,460
And we will then...

273
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
be doing this show for six months from Fossil House

274
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,580
at St...on Dockstock Mountain in Stang Ranch outside Glen Rose, Texas,

275
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,320
which will be the new permanent address of the church, actually,

276
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,880
the next time we reprint membership packs.

277
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,800
But the good news is Lonesome Cowboy Dave's novel Neighbor World

278
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,660
is now out and around, out and about.

279
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:59,800
You can look at subgenius.com and you will know things.

280
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,640
Please, take it along.

281
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,100
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,580
Don't be sorry, Dave.

283
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,840
I entreat them, I beg of them to please, just take it along.

284
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,400
A teeny tiny, teeny, baby, teeny tiny little look.

285
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,100
And the music in the background is Mayan Ruins there.

286
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,800
Aha.

287
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,760
Yeah.

288
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,220
That's what it sounds like.

289
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,840
Ah, Mayan Ruins 2.

290
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, we have some news that Dave knew, and we actually mentioned just before the rerun last week.

291
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,460
And, as I said, the good news is Lonesome Cowboy Dave's book is out.

292
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,900
But the bad news is our old hound dog, Dammit, is not at home listening to the show.

293
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,160
Not recognizing his master's voice.

294
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,580
No.

295
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:02,380
He's romping with Pappy in the heavenly version of Stang Ranch, where he came from.

296
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah, friends, I am sad to announce that Dammit boarded the saucers.

297
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,860
His old age caught up with him a week and a half ago.

298
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,160
Rather suddenly.

299
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,620
And he died at the vet's office in our arms.

300
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
Falling asleep.

301
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:30,020
Falling asleep with the euthanasia shot while we soaked his fur with our tears.

302
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,000
And we couldn't talk about it last show.

303
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,500
Too new.

304
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,380
I was so shook.

305
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:46,700
I could not believe how much I missed that old dog, you know?

306
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,520
And so we're kind of dedicating this show to our dog.

307
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,720
Our child, Dammit.

308
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,880
I'd say we're all the way dedicating it.

309
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,880
Yeah.

310
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:07,560
Well, we do have hope because we know there are more Dammit lookalikes and treeing walker coonhounds out there.

311
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:16,940
The subgeniuses of the Scrub Genius Forum have canonized him as Saint Dammit.

312
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,360
Or actually, they caninized him as Saint Dammit.

313
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,860
And everyone vowed to bite the mailman in his honor.

314
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,840
So, September 29th has been declared Saint Dammit and Bite the Mailman Day.

315
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,620
I already bit a few mailmen.

316
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,180
Just to be in line with the procrastinators and the drill sergeants, I jumped right in.

317
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,980
And actually, it was a Federal Express carrier.

318
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,260
And I got him on the knee real good.

319
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,600
He squealed like a little baby brat and fell to his knees.

320
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,560
I kicked him a few times.

321
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,360
Well, I know you're just supposed to bite the mailman or the delivery agent.

322
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,460
Not to beat him up afterwards.

323
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,960
But I just, he was so small and easy to beat up.

324
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,740
I just can't.

325
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,760
I couldn't resist.

326
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,600
You know what I mean?

327
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,100
Well, I'm glad there's somebody biting the mailman.

328
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,080
But who's going to walk Princess Wee and me?

329
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,360
Who are we going to hurry home to feed every day at 5 o'clock?

330
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,120
Who's going to push his cold nose against my elbow?

331
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,860
When I'm typing to get attention?

332
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,120
Yeah.

333
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,100
Oh.

334
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,060
So we, we, we're, um, we, I can't say we got over it exactly.

335
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,820
But we got to the, last week we got to the stage of grief where we were mad at him for dying.

336
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,220
We drove past this park about ten miles from our house.

337
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,620
And I remembered how I'd been planning to take him to that park because he'd love it.

338
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,460
And now I can't.

339
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,140
And that really ticked me off.

340
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
He denied it.

341
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,320
He denied me the pleasure of making him happy.

342
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,820
It's weird.

343
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:02,500
We were, all the stuff that we were most anticipating, like seeing his face when he realized he was back home at the ranch.

344
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,480
That's never going to happen thanks to that thoughtless son of a bitch.

345
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,600
And I say that in all factualness.

346
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,280
It's, how could he do this to us?

347
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,180
How dare he?

348
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,000
Didn't he think about what would happen to his two pet monkey people if he suddenly vanished?

349
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:29,180
So I guess that's, we're going through that, I'm guessing that's a healthy stage of the grief process.

350
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,400
Princess, we studied on those, right?

351
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,300
In case.

352
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,380
What's the next step that we go through?

353
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,100
After realizing there are monkey people?

354
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,740
Yes.

355
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Getting a new puppy is the next step.

356
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,940
Well I always thought it was, first was the realization that you are monkey people.

357
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,860
That's the first thing you think of.

358
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:54,280
The second you think of who's going to take care of you after you realize you're a monkey people.

359
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,240
Is it going to be a dog or a cat or some, or both of them?

360
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,660
Two dogs and a cat don't stink.

361
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,380
As long as they, you know, they can farm for Jesus.

362
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,800
I think.

363
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,720
Farm?

364
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,980
Farm for Jesus?

365
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,520
Dogs?

366
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,100
Cats?

367
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,960
This is all news to me, Dave.

368
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,580
Yeah, that's right.

369
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,040
Yeah, they donate the blubber, the whale bubble.

370
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,180
Excuse me.

371
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:25,860
The whale blubber on the anniversary march, they donate to local foodie charities and needy characters.

372
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,500
We're needy.

373
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,740
Oh, like you never heard of such a thing.

374
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,300
Oh, excuse me.

375
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
We're needy.

376
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,380
We need a needy dog again.

377
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,380
I know.

378
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
They want something every five minutes.

379
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,920
It's funny.

380
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,660
They're trying to give it to them.

381
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,420
Exactly.

382
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,800
That dog had us so well trained.

383
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,200
We were like really good service humans.

384
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,420
And now we don't have anybody to service.

385
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,900
Our master is gone.

386
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,160
It's, I mean, it's hard to, you know, it's hard to be super funny.

387
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,480
Although he, that dog had a funny claw.

388
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,780
He had on his, the, the.

389
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:15,900
The.

390
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,780
The third claw on his right forepaw was black.

391
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,580
And all his other claws were white.

392
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:32,260
And for weeks now, Princess, we and I had a black line painted on our corresponding right hand finger to show we're in the Dammit Club.

393
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:41,900
So, you know, if you see me with a black fingernail, that means I'm not so much mourning for Dammit as remembering him.

394
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,440
It's creepy.

395
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,520
I mean, he could be.

396
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,800
Anyway, his name is spelled with an E, not an I.

397
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,600
And there's no N in it.

398
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,780
So it's not a cuss word.

399
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,980
Oh, like damn it.

400
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:58,700
Our friend, Reverend Zafod suggested that when we get a new dog that we call him some bitch.

401
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,540
That's okay to say when you talk about dogs, right?

402
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,240
Yeah.

403
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,000
Some bitch.

404
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,280
I guess.

405
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,220
So we.

406
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,420
You could call them Knuckles or Pee Pants or any number of different things.

407
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,160
They seem to like all those different names.

408
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,400
Who knows what they call them?

409
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,860
So they were dog names.

410
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,740
Of little dog names, Snuggles.

411
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,560
Not Snuggles.

412
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,500
Knuckles.

413
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,720
Like on your big beefy third finger.

414
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,100
Your hands.

415
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,680
Your meat.

416
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,560
You know, it's funny.

417
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,540
Okay, no more Pollyanna arguments, I suppose.

418
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,180
Well, like I know what happens when an animal dies.

419
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,360
They go to subgenius heaven.

420
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,180
And then when they graduate from that, they go to subgenius hell, which is even better.

421
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,340
You could not only can you chase cats, you could catch them and kill them over and over and over again.

422
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,380
Sort of like subgenius heaven for subgeniuses.

423
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,280
You can catch that school teacher that slapped you on the wrist and do it to her for her idea of eternity.

424
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,280
Although you can stop and let robots continue it.

425
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,340
That's a horribly, well, it's a wonderful thought, really.

426
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:19,380
I don't know how it arrived at such a conclusion, but it is certainly the place to be in downtown Clubbage.

427
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,220
Well, you know.

428
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,040
The abnormals and the subhumans.

429
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Oh, here's the sad thing.

430
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,020
Princess Wee, about one month ago, read the sentence.

431
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,060
Treeing walker coonhounds can live to be 12 years old.

432
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,340
Well, his 12th birthday was last July 5th.

433
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,060
And she burst into tears when she read that.

434
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,360
I mean, you know, he.

435
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,900
So it's not like it was unexpected and it's probably good that it was sudden for his sake.

436
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,840
But I'm still mad at it.

437
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,360
A little bit.

438
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,600
I spent a lot more time on Facebook last week than I normally do.

439
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,240
It's the first time I realized why people do that.

440
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,320
Normally, I have a I've had it pretty good.

441
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,660
I haven't had any terrible setbacks for a long time.

442
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,280
And and when I did, I got to admit, I got on Facebook.

443
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,460
But friends, we have but we have news and it's a big butt of news.

444
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,940
A bucket of news.

445
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:38,840
Huge news about new church projects that are going to impress the living daylights out of everybody.

446
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,780
And get this.

447
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,920
We can't talk about it.

448
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,160
We honestly know we've been instructed not to reveal it yet.

449
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,320
Big things are going to start in two days.

450
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,880
Our time.

451
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,840
That's not Internet time.

452
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,700
Actually, it'd be about the time this show gets on the Internet.

453
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,640
The big, big, big news can be revealed.

454
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,700
It's tricky, too, because we're not allowed to talk about certain things on college or public.

455
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:09,700


456
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,720
Public supported radio.

457
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:18,460
And, you know, this show actually goes to four other college stations and a couple of Indy.

458
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah.

459
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,020
But but I'm telling you, friends, you're going to want to know.

460
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,420
So, you know, watch.

461
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,220
I'd like to know.

462
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,320
You watch your subgenius.com front page.

463
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,660
Watch your subgenius Facebook pages.

464
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:43,200
That means you have to constantly monitor at least 25 different Facebook pages.

465
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,740
Yeah.

466
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,020
Fifty two pages.

467
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,220
Twenty six pages in real time because it's on both sides.

468
00:34:49,560 --> 00:35:00,600
There was even one Reverend Baby Bear started a Facebook page a couple of years ago called There are too damn many faced subgenius Facebook pages.

469
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Yeah.

470
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,420
So Facebook pages are Facebook pages.

471
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,280
Why not both?

472
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,360
A Facebook and a Facebook.

473
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:17,700
Well, if I were an outer space musician, that's the first thing I'd bring to a cocktail lounge gig would be my Facebook of Facebook.

474
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,880
Well, the Facebook is the Russian sponsored one that's very pro Trump.

475
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,480
Oh, I like fake news.

476
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,320
I see what you mean.

477
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,160
Yeah.

478
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,620
Yeah.

479
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,120
Fake news.

480
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,920
You know, like this is often a term for like when they say you got your book.

481
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,720
You like it for going to a gig and stuff.

482
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,440
You know, they said you got the book meeting.

483
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,240
Do you have the fake book meeting?

484
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,120
Do you have a bunch of changes for songs that you kind of know?

485
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:51,800
But you would normally if you were playing, you'd normally miss a certain quarter, two or three or four, sometimes like in my case, five or six.

486
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,780
And just have a real stupid expression on your face.

487
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,920
You'd be singing along, but it would be the wrong words.

488
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,340
This way.

489
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,660
We've seen you do that.

490
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,620
Everyone who's been in a band with you has.

491
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:05,700


492
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,940
Noticed you changing the words and the song structure as you go from what was rehearsed.

493
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,600
But that's just because that would be a big deal.

494
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,960
They've so damn creative.

495
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,980
Well, yeah, I think it would be too boring for Dave if it was exactly what you rehearsed.

496
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,620
It has to be.

497
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,180
Yes, it can.

498
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,760
Stemper any eyes somehow.

499
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,480
Just how I can do good after rehearsal.

500
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,280
If I sleep.

501
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,460
I mean that I don't sleep.

502
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,480
I detest those little snatches of death.

503
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,420
Which nerd can quote?

504
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,300
Which nerd knows what movie I was quoting?

505
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,500
It's based on Jules Verne's story.

506
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,260
That's your hint.

507
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Oh, Journey to the South of 2,000 Miles Below the Earth.

508
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,540
Yeah.

509
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,440
20,000 Leagues Beneath My Sock.

510
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,340
Leagues Under the Sock.

511
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,240
Yeah, I can't say the full name of that band.

512
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,560
Remember that great, there's a band in Cleveland.

513
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,220
That was a great band, yes.

514
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,960
Yeah.

515
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,180
Nut is the missing word.

516
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:15,980
Flack is the name of most of the hired for selfishness reasons members of Trump's cabinet.

517
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,880
They're all a bunch of flack-hacking PR wiener heads.

518
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,100
Or some of them are, okay.

519
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,920
They're not all.

520
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,060
Some of them are just getting a check and trying to make, what are they doing?

521
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,380
Babysitting.

522
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,080
I knew that.

523
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:44,040
And not doing a very good job at it because they're babysitting the most pouty, screaming crybaby coward we've ever seen on television.

524
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,080
He has pergapetulance.

525
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,780
And half the country likes it.

526
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,140
Yes.

527
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,980
Oh, he's, anything that makes smart people mad makes them real happy.

528
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,140
That's the bottom line, man.

529
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,420
That's the way it is.

530
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,400
Ugh.

531
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,720
Ugh.

532
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,120
Hey, friends, we, well, here's a hint for one of the projects.

533
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:15,140
We went to Ashtabula last Friday and filmed Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

534
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:26,180
And someday people will get to see what he looks like if we don't, you know, replace his face with a CGI performance by Andy Serkis.

535
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,700
Of an animated Dave Hemsworth?

536
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,840
Actually, there was a character in a movie called Conspiracy Theory.

537
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,960
Oh, I know.

538
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,820
Where Mel Gibson, of all people, played Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

539
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,200
Yep.

540
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,880
He was a taxi driver.

541
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,300
Way.

542
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,660
He talked just like Dave does.

543
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,340
If you can even imagine another person sounding that way.

544
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,640
And he even had the same hat Dave was always wearing back then.

545
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,120
Back then.

546
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,500
It was the craziest thing.

547
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,980
It was like some Hollywood people had written a script about Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

548
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,420
After studying him carefully.

549
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:00,640
Yeah.

550
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,440
I noticed, I went and looked at hours at work today.

551
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,580
And I went to the bathroom and I looked in the mirror.

552
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,200
And I don't have big creases on my face.

553
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,560
I got small ones that are invisible.

554
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,660
But somehow on the one monitor, it looked like somebody took a magic marker and put creases going down by my jaw area.

555
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,180
Oh, when you were looking at the video that I shot?

556
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,560
Mm-hmm.

557
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,360
Well, that was the CGI Arnold Schwarzenegger I replaced you with.

558
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,080
Oh, you put a cleft in his chin?

559
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,140
Oh, a bunch of them.

560
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,380
They were all over his face.

561
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,060
He was cleft in even his palate.

562
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,480
Oh, I've had that for quite a while.

563
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,200
You just accentuated the obvious and the impossible.

564
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:52,740
And don't latch on to Mr. Inbetween and all that Cole Porter or whether it was Johnny Mercer song, I think.

565
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,660
Why not both?

566
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,060
Why not Cole Porter doing Johnny Mercer as a free-born ape living in a cave?

567
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,300
They're no human beings.

568
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,180
They're out of Jewish and Jewishسمic origin.

569
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,820
Yeah, Remember Harold итог tore up Mickey Mouse correspondent Donald Trump Packers story in the puddle?

570
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,320
See, the story will not make any sense.

571
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:11,980
You Capitol County governor, Donald Trump and Mrs.夢.

572
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:17,400
There was a Holly Powell CEO, who has你是 gun alimony.

573
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,060
He's never played James Bond before.

574
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:26,400
I mean, yeah, d抑a¿ ?

575
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,760
Now, Jimi Hendrix.

576
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,680
That was a Hendrix line I heard him say.

577
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,340
That was an actual Hendrix line.

578
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,920
They forgot that for 5,000 years now.

579
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,580
Yeah.

580
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:47,860
Oh, we sold Princess Wee's old record player that must have 1,000 Hendrix albums go through it.

581
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,320
Dave, we've had a long, long weekend.

582
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:59,060
Because after we filmed you, we filmed him talking about the Kickstarter thing.

583
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,220
And we interviewed him for about half an hour or more.

584
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,780
And had three cameras on him, but two of the cameras are bad.

585
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,260
They're just plain bad.

586
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,260
I'll go ahead and send them the footage, but they're not going to do anything with it.

587
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,440
The main camera was good.

588
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,120
The iPhone, I thought, was good.

589
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,320
And if they like it enough.

590
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,860
If I did a good enough job, they might send me to Portugal to interview the great G. Gordon Gordon.

591
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,140
We live in hope.

592
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah, no kidding.

593
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,440
Man, that guy's one of the most.

594
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,960
He was one of the main subgeniuses all down the line.

595
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,340
Yes.

596
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,620
And he's from Austin.

597
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,000
No, they moved from Austin to Portugal just when these people in Austin started working on this movie.

598
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
Yes, this movie.

599
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,600
Oh, I can't reveal everything.

600
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,560
I can't reveal too much, but you'd be amazed.

601
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,160
Yeah, Johnny Depp is going to play.

602
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,400
Me and Scarlett Johansson is going to play Princess Wee.

603
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,540
And Andy Serkis is going to do Dave as motion cap.

604
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,500
Motion capture animated figure like they did in Avatar and King Kong.

605
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,540
Now, that's just silly.

606
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,580
I thought you were going to have Andy Serkis play Bob.

607
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:18,320
No, Ray Harryhausen's reanimated skeleton is going to be resurrected.

608
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,860
Okay.

609
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,300
I'm going to dress him.

610
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm going to dress it up as Bob, and I'm going to animate it.

611
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm going to put little wires between the bones to hold him, and I'm going to stop motion Ray Harryhausen, his skeleton, as Bob.

612
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,080
Yeah.

613
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,820
I'm going to make him look at all the black stuff he's got in there.

614
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,360
I didn't know Ray Harryhausen had black stuff inside.

615
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,480
He does now.

616
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,780
Well, actually, there's probably not much left.

617
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,120
He died quite a while ago.

618
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,140
You know, I shouldn't talk about my heroes that way.

619
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,380
But he's dead.

620
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:51,900
Who cares?

621
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:59,020
You ought to hear what I say about Frank Zappa sometimes, just because I was told not to.

622
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,480
But I'm not going to say it in this family hour.

623
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,280
No, Frank Zappa was quite a narrow-dived politician.

624
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,260
Huh?

625
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,060
He gained 152 pounds over the past three, before he got the prostration.

626
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,840
Who?

627
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,120
Who?

628
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,080
Huh?

629
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,140
Huh?

630
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,200
Who?

631
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,280
Frank Zappa.

632
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,760
Oh.

633
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,360
He was a fine politician.

634
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,360
He's, you know, from, I think, a retrograde foot mart in Connecticut.

635
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,140
They call it Department X.

636
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,360
And he was one of the founder members, and he was also a representative in a local snake house.

637
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,160
You know, actually, sometimes I say mean things about Frank Zappa.

638
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:50,060
Not that I mean them at all, but because I was told not to by a Zappa.

639
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:50,420
Right.

640
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,260
Religious nut.

641
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,640
You think he's like a post-media icon.

642
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,840
Named Sterno.

643
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,760
And so I have to say mean things about Frank Zappa every now and then, just because Sterno

644
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,560
told me not to.

645
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,720
And Sterno was the guy who invented that, doing what everybody tells him not to.

646
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,620
Yes, but he threatened to toss us out of his car if we said anything negative about Mr.

647
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,320
Zappa.

648
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,620
Right.

649
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,220
And then he had a record album, and he spelled it B-F-A-R-T.

650
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,500
No, that was...

651
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,340
Commander B-Fart.

652
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,460
Yeah, Commander B-Fart.

653
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:26,960
Captain B-Fart.

654
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,980
And he was pretending, but he wasn't the real Captain B-Fart.

655
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,760
The Dan, Don, Dan, Don, Don, Von, Vla, you know, that guy.

656
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,920
Don Van Vliet, or Vla.

657
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,260
I actually don't know how that's pronounced.

658
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,980
Don Van Vliet?

659
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:49,640
You know, that movie, Frank, is loosely based on B-Fart's eccentric,

660
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,920
way of doing, working with a band.

661
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,400
Really?

662
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,940
It's also based on an English guy who wore a mask all the time.

663
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,980
B-Fart didn't wear a mask all the time.

664
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,460
The English guy really did.

665
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,940
Well, he didn't have to, yeah.

666
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,740
But B-Fart was part of what they put into the movie version of that.

667
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,640
He was a big, juicy woman with preponderant-sized, deep breasts.

668
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,240
And he could swing on a trapeze for hours and hours and never, never be seen.

669
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,240
He was invisible.

670
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,300
He was a simple at certain times.

671
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,280
And at other times, he made the tanks run on time.

672
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,820
Looks like a bloody big beef heart, doesn't he?

673
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,080
That was where he got his name.

674
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:37,800
Some dirty old man that would walk in naked or with his pants off and say that.

675
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,700
I'll let the listeners put those two things together after the fact.

676
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,560
It's like...

677
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,520
Oh.

678
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,140
It's like...

679
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,340
It's like when...

680
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,860
It's like when you take a math...

681
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,800
When you take a...

682
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,720
When you take a mathematics test.

683
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,940
And also in your grad school.

684
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,280
And you fail, miss a foot because you forgot the tables are five.

685
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,240
But you know the nine is...

686
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,340
She has to do that just to try and confuse you.

687
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,260
I have.

688
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,080
Oh.

689
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,840
Hey, you know what we did this weekend?

690
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,040
That made us basket cases?

691
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,140
Subgenius yard sales.

692
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,800
Subgenius yard sale.

693
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,400
Yes, we had it.

694
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,040
We did it.

695
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,120
And it killed us.

696
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,420
It just about killed us.

697
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,680
Everything we had ever bought at yard sales was in our yard sale.

698
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,640
And about half of it went.

699
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,900
We gave a lot of stuff away.

700
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,220
Oh, yeah.

701
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,880
A lot of stuff.

702
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,360
A lot, a lot, a lot of stuff.

703
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,440
In fact, if anybody was one of our neighbors or anyone we knew,

704
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:49,820
we'd say, oh, yeah.

705
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


706
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


707
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


708
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


709
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,820
Oh, just take it.

710
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,340
Yeah.

711
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,320
But...

712
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,740
Well, you should.

713
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,420
After all, that's what the patronage system was based on in the Renaissance.

714
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:05,700
If you could sell enough folding chairs, you could become queen or king of utopia.

715
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:13,240
Well, you know, speaking of utopia, okay, we had this yard sale in Cleveland Heights for two days.

716
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,220
And for the most part, everyone who...

717
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,820
All the neighbors and customers that came by were shocked.

718
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,180
Shockingly nice.

719
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,680
Yes.

720
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,800
So nice it made you superstitious or suspicious, I mean.

721
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,880
And it was so the opposite of the way a lot of subgeniuses see the world, it made me think I was going crazy.

722
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,600
Because to listen to people on the Internet in general, everybody's mean and angry.

723
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,820
And it's nothing but strife and hatred between the races.

724
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,960
And yet, we saw the exact opposite going on.

725
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,700
We sure did.

726
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,720
We did have a couple of bad apples.

727
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,120
Princess We realized that this lady had stolen a little ring.

728
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,060
I still can't believe that.

729
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,040
A ring that was in a box.

730
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,620
And I watched her take the sleeve off the box and then open the box.

731
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,940
And then I walked away.

732
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,660
And the next time I came back, the box was there.

733
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,240
But the ring was gone.

734
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,820
And this was...

735
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,640
This is what looked like a rich white lady.

736
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,240
She did look like a very wealthy lady.

737
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,400
I know rich people whose fun thing to do is shoplifting and seeing if they get caught.

738
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,680
And they let them off usually unless it's their third time.

739
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,940
A yard sale, though?

740
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,240
I mean, come on, man.

741
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,000
A yard sale.

742
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,100
Everything's a dollar.

743
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,500
We answered most questions with the phrase, a buck.

744
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,360
Yeah.

745
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,720
What do you want for this?

746
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,480
Two for a dollar.

747
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:46,920
A dollar.

748
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,760
Yeah, but she had this...

749
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:55,780
And we also had a troublesome old drunk lady, kind of early in the morning,

750
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,400
who had me polish off three perfectly clean coffee tables.

751
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,380
Just, I think it was mainly so she could let me know she figured there'd be germs all over my coffee tables.

752
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:19,380
And then, after I did that, then she realized that she didn't have room in her car for even one of those coffee tables.

753
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:28,900
And then she hung around for like an hour, mumbling and asking about one thing after another and never going with any of it.

754
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,620
And furthermore, she pulled her car into our driveway where we had everything laid out.

755
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,640
Just just but ran over it.

756
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,020
She pulled the front of her fender right up to the table, about an inch from the table.

757
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,000
Then she tried out a little chair that she had bought.

758
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,440
It collapsed under her.

759
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,600
And then she yelled at me because she had gotten hurt.

760
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:52,940
And then she said,

761
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,380
It was a tiny little flimsy camp chair and she was a fat hog.

762
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,280
The minute she fell down, I was thinking, that's why she's here.

763
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,440
So she could hurt herself and sue us.

764
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,040
And then she pulled out a sandwich and ate it in front of me.

765
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,660
Thankfully, she was too dumb and drunk to even think about suing us.

766
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,740
Yeah.

767
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,060
That's where we lucked out.

768
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,660
She was too much of a mess to do the obvious, which was threatened.

769
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,360
And she was trying to sue us.

770
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,980
I was ready the whole time to go, Well, maybe you should do that.

771
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,640
Let's call a police officer and see what he thinks, because that usually shuts them down real fast.

772
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:29,980
Yeah.

773
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,220
Especially if they're drunk and they've been through it all before.

774
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,720
Exactly.

775
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:47,400
So but everybody else, every it was like a Jehovah's Witness illustration of heaven with all of the races getting along in perfect harmony and nobody making any kind of a big deal about anything.

776
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,780
And, you know, it's just it was really.

777
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,140
Really, really.

778
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,700
Everybody having a good time finding really weird old stuff that they loved.

779
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,040
And it was great.

780
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,120
Well, between customers, we were both miserable and fighting and worn out.

781
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:09,240
I had to move so much stuff out into the driveway and then it was going to rain that night.

782
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,480
So I had to move it all back up onto the porch.

783
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,000
Yes, he did.

784
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,420
And then we had to move it back out onto the driveway.

785
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,000
Yes, he did.

786
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,580
And then it's raining tonight.

787
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,600
So we had to move it all back again.

788
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:18,800
We had to move it all back again.

789
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,180
Some genius yard sale.

790
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,360
Some genius yard sale.

791
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,640
Perlmutter is on his way to Norway.

792
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,380
Who?

793
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,080
So there could be rain tonight.

794
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,700
Who's on his way to Norway?

795
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,740
Bob Walkenhurst?

796
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,560
No, Kirk.

797
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,260
Comrade Perlmutter, the fourth disillusionment forces.

798
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,920
Comrade Forfmeyer?

799
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,140
Huh?

800
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,900
Comrade Forfinger, the fourth leader of our neutralistic antibodies.

801
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,400
The least of the ones that we're smoking right now.

802
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:51,980
I see.

803
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,780
Okay.

804
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,400
Okay.

805
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,160
That's why I was wondering if you didn't kick that drunk lady right in the brisket where it belongs.

806
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:09,460
I was real glad when Princess Wee came home and took over because I was getting close to telling the lady what I thought.

807
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,640
I don't.

808
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,600
Which isn't much.

809
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,220
Well, I don't know why I didn't even just tell her to get her car out of my driveway when I first got home.

810
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,720
I couldn't believe somebody pulled right through.

811
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:18,880
Well, wait.

812
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:18,880


813
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:18,880


814
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:18,880


815
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:18,880


816
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:18,880


817
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,020
Well, in the back half of the butt of her car was blocking the road.

818
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:22,520
Yes.

819
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,200
Yes.

820
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,500
For 40 minutes, people had to drive around.

821
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,920
She had no idea what was going on around her.

822
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,320


823
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,480
I hope she's listening now.

824
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,720
I can't imagine that she is, though.

825
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,640
I just hope she doesn't come back tomorrow because she came back later in the afternoon and said, I'm coming back.

826
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,480
No, she's not.

827
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,500
She said she was.

828
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,560
No, she's not going to do any.

829
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,900
She doesn't remember where that house was and what street it's on.

830
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,460
I hope not.

831
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,460
Anyway, that's over with.

832
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:53,420
Dave, did you know that you called in about five minutes late and the show's five minutes from being over?

833
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,080
No, I thought I, well, I thought I was a minute late, but.

834
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,500
No.

835
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:05,220
And we have a three-minute song dedicated to Damme, our dog.

836
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:11,400
And, but I also have a concert by Damme, which we can start playing right now, darn it.

837
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,120
A concert by Damme?

838
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,260
Yes, you'll remember it.

839
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,700
Let's see.

840
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,960
Wait, how come it, how come it, no?

841
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,160
A concert, Damme and the Coyotes?

842
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,400
Oh, this one, yeah, that's it, there we go.

843
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,080
Woo!

844
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,520
Woo!

845
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,340
Woo!

846
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,140
The microphone was right on our window sill.

847
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:42,900
Mm-hmm.

848
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,900
And it was late at night and there were coyotes out there.

849
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,440
Woo!

850
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


851
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


852
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


853
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,180
His voice only got that trill when he was howling at coyotes.

854
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:52,540
Yeah.

855
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,340
Woo!

856
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,160
Woo!

857
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:56,820
Woo!

858
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,440
Woo!

859
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,760
Woo!

860
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,480
They sound close.

861
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,000
They were probably right outside the fence, giving him a hard time.

862
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,460
But you know he loved doing that.

863
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,320
He listened to that.

864
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,840
Oh, yeah.

865
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,260
There's some fine dog symmetry in those, the markings.

866
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,160
Woo!

867
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,320
Woo!

868
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,060
See, he repeated that.

869
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,280
He's a good boy.

870
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:18,440
He's a good boy.

871
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,040
I can tell you that this will be the third time now.

872
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,880
He never made that sound here in Cleveland Heights.

873
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,340
No.

874
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,820
Although I hear, we've heard that coyotes are on their way.

875
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,240
They've been being seen in the northern Ohio.

876
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,060
Yep.

877
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,000
Yep.

878
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,060
That'll help thin the deer out.

879
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,100
We can't get to our car because we're tripping over the deer.

880
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,860
We have to push our way through crowds, herds of deer between our front door and the car.

881
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,240
So we need some coyotes.

882
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,560
And we're pushing.

883
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:44,560


884
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,600
Damme never paid any attention to the deer.

885
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:47,840
Damme never paid any attention to the deer.

886
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,420
Yeah.

887
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:48,580
No.

888
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,840
I had two wolves walk by my house one time.

889
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,180
They came up on the front porch.

890
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,360
And I could tell they were wolves later because they looked like coyotes but they had real

891
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,120
long legs.

892
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,960
And at first I thought there were some dogs out there trying to eat a cat or something.

893
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,140
So I said, hey, go on, get out of here.

894
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,700
And I looked and they just like looked at me like, okay.

895
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,740
And turned around and walked away.

896
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,020
I went, holy crap, they're wolves.

897
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,580
That's all pretty strange.

898
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:13,980
It's wild.

899
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,380
Yeah.

900
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,760
You don't usually get that.

901
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,400
Bears are back too.

902
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,400
I guess there's where they're from.

903
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


904
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


905
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


906
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


907
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


908
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


909
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


910
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,020
I went to the place where I work there.

911
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,760
There's another report of a bear sighting by a schoolyard.

912
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,860
Oh, no.

913
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,980
But the first thing they do around here where there haven't been any bears or coyotes for

914
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,200
a long time is they kill them.

915
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,420
Right.

916
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,120
They hear them rather than get ODNR to trap them and put them in a wooded area.

917
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,580
We have no animal control at all, I don't think.

918
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:42,940
Anyway.

919
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,320
You have no bowel control either.

920
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,060
No, you're talking about the show.

921
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,380
And we have to get out of here.

922
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


923
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


924
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


925
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


926
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


927
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


928
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,380


929
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,880
We have to end this show because there's another show coming up.

930
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,300
I do have a song.

931
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,940
About a month ago or two, we played a live version of the song.

932
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:05,360
Yes, it's the Rainmakers, but this is the studio version from an album called 25 On

933
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,900
that commemorated them being a band for 25 years.

934
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,300
And that was like in 2005 or something.

935
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,360
So Dave, we're going to go.

936
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:18,360


937
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,340
We're going to have to say good night.

938
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,400
Thank you for coming.

939
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:21,820
Good night, Don.

940
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,680
We'll see you in the movies.

941
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,800
And this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

942
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,540
You can learn everything important at subgenius.com.

943
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:38,060
And here's the, here's that song.

944
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,580
We'll smell you later, Dave.

945
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,120
Later, Mommy.

946
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,620
Kind of like to see you.

947
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,340
Wouldn't want to be you.

948
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,120
That's coming right up.

949
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:03,160
You're the kind of man who seems to leave a trail behind him of old friends who used

950
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,620
to be so close.

951
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,760
But then in some concocted scene, they've done you wrong.

952
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,040
And so you write them off and bye bye, they're gone.

953
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,120
If you don't like dogs, what do you like?

954
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:18,360
You're the kind of man who seems to leave a trail behind him of old friends who used

955
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:18,360


956
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:18,360


957
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,020
to be so close.

958
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:28,820
If you don't like dogs, you're going to wake up some cold night.

959
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,200
And how at the lonely moon.

960
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,700
If you don't like dogs, there's something wrong with you.

961
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,340
You're the kind of man who seems to leave a trail behind him of old friends who used

962
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:53,680
to be so close.

963
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:00,740
And so you write them off and bye bye, they're gone.

964
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,340
And so you write them off and bye bye, they're gone.

965
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:12,340
And how at the lonely moon.

966
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,320
You're the kind of man who seems to leave a trail behind him of old friends who used

967
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,000
to be so close.

968
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,340
And how at the lonely moon.

969
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,660
If you don't like dogs better just go home.

970
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,060
I used to be a friend.

971
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,700
Even now, from time to time I wish that I could see you.

972
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,860
Wouldn't want to be you.

973
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,300
You might have a brain of your own.

974
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


975
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


976
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


977
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


978
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


979
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,300


980
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,460
The car, the money, and the home

981
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,460
But you know and I know you'll always be alone

982
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:01,400
You're the kind of man who wants to know real love

983
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,740
But all that you can do is talk about young girls

984
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,920
And tell all colored jokes and act all kinds of flirty

985
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,060
But when the truth be told you're afraid of getting dirty

986
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,160
If you don't like dogs, what do you like?

987
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:29,680
If you don't like dogs, you're gonna wake up some cold night

988
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:36,160
And howl till your heads are throbbing

989
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:43,740
If you don't like dogs, what do you like?

990
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:44,540
Problem

991
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,980
Problem
