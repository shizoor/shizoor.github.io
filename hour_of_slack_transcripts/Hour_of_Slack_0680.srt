1
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,020
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

2
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:56,380
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,160
And it was pleasing to Bob.

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,680
Hey, old Diablo's here.

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,520
Oh!

6
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,260
Just wandered into the studio.

7
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,340
Just thought I was starting to...

8
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,600
Into the new ship.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,380
The new...

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,180
The new escape vessel.

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,500
I'll be hauling this...

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,040
Oh, man, listen to this.

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Now Jesus calls.

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,640
Well, we're just so popular.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
Yes, well, here we have...

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,100
We have Papa Joe Mama,

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,300
Pope S. Lillis,

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,220
and Bleepo

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,920
all on the phone tonight.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
And Dave in the studio.

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,000
And Bleepo Adpanaki.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,220
Yes, there's one more with me.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,960
There's one more.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,260
And yet more in the Bleepo...

25
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,880
Oh, there's a Bleepo clone.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,940
The Bleepo net.

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,280
The female Bleepo clone.

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,300
Oh, and they are...

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,880
They haven't even had to bleep Bleepo yet.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,380
What's your...

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,600
Not a clone.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,820
You're not a clone?

33
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,120
No, I'm sorry, I am not.

34
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,860
You are the original whoever...

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,620
What is your name now?

36
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,180
I am Contessa Conchetta Dabalina.

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,940
Oh, you are the countess devil lady herself.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,480
Oh, yes.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,540
You may even experience intense breath

40
00:01:59,540 --> 00:01:59,980
or you may not.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,620
Thank you.

42
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,540
Thank you, Contessa.

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,900
Oh, friends, we have so many guests.

44
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,200
Most people in our society

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
are addicted to subventilation.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,020
And subgenius.

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,200
We have subventilation and subgeniuses

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,860
in our society.

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,980
But friends, everything will be all right.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,960
Everything, I promise.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,740
And, you know,

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,800
Bob or me

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
or any holy man

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,000
wouldn't.

55
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:29,980
Wouldn't.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Lie to you.

57
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,380
Now, would we?

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,500
But, uh...

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Friends, welcome to the third

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
of our formatted shows.

61
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,220
Now that we've done 680 shows,

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,160
we've got a format.

63
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,920
And right now,

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,660
the format calls for the news.

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,040
And I'm afraid the news

66
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,620
is fairly typical this time.

67
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,500
Um...

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,980
U.S. populace...

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,240
lurches methodically

70
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,320
through the motions

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,560
for yet another day.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,460
The wall-eyed,

73
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,680
slack-jawed U.S. populace

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,020
beaten down into a state

75
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,460
of near catatonia

76
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,700
by the relentlessly deadening

77
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,600
banality of their joyless,

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,840
insipid lives

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
dutifully trudged through the motions

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,700
for yet another

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,100
emotionally blank day.

82
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,800
Monday.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,160
Sources reported.

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,460
Against all logic,

85
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,520
the nation's citizenry,

86
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,080
their insides withering away

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
with each passing moment,

88
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,700
somehow managed to continue

89
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,520
filling out invoices,

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,600
shopping for footwear,

91
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,280
loading dishwashers,

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,620
eating Whoppers,

93
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,980
pressing buttons,

94
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,080
watching reality-based TV programs,

95
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,520
vacuuming floors,

96
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,240
engaging in conversations

97
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,980
about petty office problems,

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,360
politics,

99
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,600
riding buses,

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,940
sitting in traffic,

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
mailing letters,

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,340
and tending to the little rubber mats

103
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,120
people wipe their feet on

104
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,320
as they enter the lobby areas

105
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,420
of vast, windowless,

106
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,120
industrial complexes.

107
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,440
How they managed to do it,

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,980
no one can say.

109
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,900
The populace's minor victory

110
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,000
of continuing...

111
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,680
Pardon me, friends.

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,700
I'm reading this from The Onion.

113
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,880
The populace's minor victory

114
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,900
of continuing to participate

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,860
in the meaningless charade

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,900
that is their lives,

117
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,980
sources said,

118
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,780
was rendered all the more futile

119
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,260
by the inescapable realization

120
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,620
that they must do it again

121
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,040
tomorrow and the next day

122
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,220
and so on and so on

123
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,900
unceasingly

124
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,140
until the day they inevitably die.

125
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,120
Friends,

126
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,280
that's one way of looking at it.

127
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,740
We don't read from The Onion

128
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,220
that frequently anymore

129
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,640
because The Onion is now

130
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,660
very well-known and popular.

131
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,940
It's the most, I'd say,

132
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,900
the most ripped-off humor magazine

133
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,500
in America today.

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,640
It is a humor news magazine

135
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,340
and I guess it's www.onion.com.

136
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,900
They give it away in cities up north.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,940
But I don't think they'd like it

138
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,060
down south here, friends.

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,720
But what we do like here

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,140
is a sub...

141
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,080
You know, that's one way of looking at it.

142
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,120
What I just read to you,

143
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,820
that's one way.

144
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,600
That's what the pinks did.

145
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,780
That's the news for the pinks,

146
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,820
those shadows,

147
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,380
those three-dimensional,

148
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,100
fixed-legged fools, friends.

149
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,120
But there's another way to look at it.

150
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,540
There's another type of news,

151
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,360
one could say,

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,400
that the revolution has occurred.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,880
You may have been too busy

154
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,100
watching Seinfeld to notice.

155
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,440
And guess what?

156
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
The bad guys won.

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
And now most of the population

158
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,040
lives in a de facto state of slavery,

159
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,500
bound to their miserable lives,

160
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,580
jobs, and homes

161
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,260
by the bonds of socioeconomic control.

162
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
Sounds like a bunch of leftist

163
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,340
Bolshevik propaganda, doesn't it?

164
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, of course it does.

165
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,580
Unfortunately, it's true.

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,980
Slavery, as defined by the book,

167
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,680
as defined by the dictionary,

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,340
is submission to a dominating influence

169
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,820
or a lack of freedom.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
And just what is this dominating influence

171
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,880
that has such a large chunk of the population

172
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,240
in its iron grip?

173
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,720
Money.

174
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,900
Moolah.

175
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,940
The long green.

176
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,120
Dead presidents.

177
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,740
Nobody ever feels they have enough, do they?

178
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,800
How many people are stuck

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,460
in miserable, hateful jobs

180
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,660
because they have too many bills

181
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,020
and financial obligations?

182
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,460
How many people do you know

183
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,700
who can comfortably pick

184
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,620
and go, pick up and go where they want?

185
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,180
Can you?

186
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,340
What happened to your freedom?

187
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,740
Studies indicate

188
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,740
that wealth is becoming concentrated

189
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,720
in the control of the smaller and smaller

190
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,100
segment of the population.

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,060
Who the hell are these people

192
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,340
that are hoarding all the gold?

193
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,280
Buckminster Fuller called them

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,680
the great pirates.

195
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,420
Plutocrats that dominate industry,

196
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
government, advertising, and marketing

197
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,140
in order to fulfill their insane lust

198
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,340
for wealth and power.

199
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,240
Not satisfied with the possession

200
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,780
of more money and control

201
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,320
than any normal entity

202
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,720
would ever know what to do with,

203
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,720
competing groups of these great pirates

204
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,220
vie to exploit more land, labor, and material

205
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,520
in an insane race

206
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,960
to die with the most toys.

207
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,240
How do these avaricious rogues

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,120
get away with it?

209
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,180
What insidious form of mind control

210
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,080
do they employ to keep the money hemorrhage going

211
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,080
and the people ignorant and complacent?

212
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,500
What can you do to break these bonds?

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,540
In the following few shows,

214
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,020
the subgenius hour of slack

215
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,680
reading from this pamphlet,

216
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,300
There He Is,

217
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,240
outlines a few simple steps you can take

218
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,940
to better understand the predicament

219
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,680
and liberate yourself.

220
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,000
Certainly, this sounds like idiotic,

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,540
overblown extremist nonsense.

222
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,580
We'll admit that.

223
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,660
The real question is whether the problem

224
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,680
is being exaggerated to make a point,

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,740
or is actually understated

226
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,660
because the truth is too horrible to contemplate.

227
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,760
And friends, this pamphlet,

228
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,580
written by my cousin, Crawford Smith,

229
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,800
it's called S.O.S.,

230
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
Stamp Out Slavery,

231
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,700
From There He Is Productions.

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
Here's the sample.

233
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,660
Here's the sample.

234
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,120
It's many Вотul chapters

235
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,000
and part 2 of the first three.

236
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,760
Here's the Good,

237
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,560
Han,

238
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,560


239
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,560


240
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,560


241
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,560


242
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,740
that's good.

243
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:04,900
It's also not bad.

244
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,200
I really enjoy my book.

245
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,080
It's really good.

246
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,080


247
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,080


248
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,100
That's a good thing.

249
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,400
It's good.

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
It's a good thing.

251
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:31,800
but vote anyway. Statistics are meaningless 87% of the time. Organized religion, nemesis of mankind,

252
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:41,340
take that job and detonate it. Stop reproduction before it starts. Laugh or die. And the secret

253
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,520
of happiness. Hey, let's skip ahead to the secret of happiness, the very last page of the booklet.

254
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,020
It's simple, really. Just accept that happiness comes in small doses and at irregular intervals,

255
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,640
and that you must learn to appreciate those unexpected peak moments when they occur.

256
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,720
Attempting to seize or prolong these events is as useless and futile as trying to grab a fistful

257
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,420
of water. Face it, there's no way you'll be happy all the time, so learn to enjoy the moments that

258
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,160
you are happy. So there you have it, the secret wisdom of the ages. Yours absolutely free,

259
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,980
just for listening through a few pages of insane rants on this dopey radio show read from a poorly

260
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,420
thought out and cheaply done pamphlet by Crawford Smith. Pretty good deal, huh? You know, get out of

261
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:40,960
here now. Get out of here. You're standing in our light. Oh, and speaking of light, the light music

262
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,500
in the background is by El Diablo.

263
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,040
I don't know what comes next on this old media barrage type, but we'll figure it out. Come on.

264
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
We're already two hours late for the show.

265
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,580
Oh, watch it with that water, man. We don't have much.

266
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,680
Where's the road?

267
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
I think it's behind us.

268
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,400
Behind us?

269
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,020
What the? I thought we were going towards the road.

270
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,580
Okay, give me some of that air before it's gone.

271
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
Before there's just a big blank space and nothing else.

272
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,500
I hope it lasts till it gets there.

273
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,360
Yeah, I know.

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,200
God, my feet are killing me, too.

275
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,480
Look, look. See, the sun's this way, so the road's gotta be over there.

276
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,280
Yeah, but the moss is growing on the other side of that.

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,340
And the radiation warning signs are all pointing that way.

278
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,580
It looks kind of menacing. The sun's just coming up.

279
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,980
If that really is a sign.

280
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,160
Yeah, the sun's just coming up.

281
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,460
It looks pretty weird.

282
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,700
Boy, the air smells good. I just wish...

283
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,740
I don't think this is...

284
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,300
That looks like the Cactus Wren, Arizona's national...

285
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,500
No, I don't think that's the Cactus Wren.

286
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,500


287
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,300
I think this is Arizona, Hal. This is Texas.

288
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,220
Yeah, there it is.

289
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,900
We've gotta be in Texas.

290
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,040
Let's get out of here. It's creepy.

291
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,500
I just hope the Indians haven't, uh, set one of their deadly traps.

292
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,620
Hey, watch out!

293
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,580
Boy, we'll never get back to KPFA at this rate.

294
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,260
KPFA?

295
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,900
I thought we were going to K-N-O-N.

296
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,200
I thought we were just going to Hope Studio.

297
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,920
All we have to do is use the mobile field antenna and we can start our broadcast.

298
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,680
And also, we should just be able to see the rocket from here somewhere.

299
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm afraid that went down several hours ago.

300
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,600
A rocket?

301
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,640
It would have shown up on our locator, but...

302
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,720
Hey, look over there.

303
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,940
Just a natural rock formation. Nothing to be afraid of.

304
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,340
That's an abandoned secret.

305
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,900
That's a secret.

306
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,140
It looks like a big scary monster. I know, but...

307
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,360
You know, out in the desert, things can look like things that they aren't.

308
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,420
It's called a psychic heat mirage.

309
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,860
They call them duendes.

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh, don't talk about the duendes.

311
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,660
Yeah, the Indians say they're little shriveled...

312
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,880
dried up, mummified like beings about a foot tall that...

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,860
It ain't just a legend.

314
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,200
This rock over here just...

315
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,100
Oh!

316
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,300
Just tear a piece off.

317
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,020
That...

318
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,420
This cactus doesn't feel like plastic.

319
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,620
These rocks are made out of paper mache.

320
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,160
This is a...

321
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,700
This tree is made out of a spring.

322
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Maybe we can get some water, huh?

323
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,760
I don't know, you guys. What does that symbol mean?

324
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,260
Oh, yeah, this is bed springs.

325
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,460
We don't have any more coffee.

326
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Doesn't that mean biochemical hazard or something?

327
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,460
No sugar, no more beans.

328
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,060
You can't figure out where the road is.

329
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,420
At least we got a good astronomical observation last night.

330
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,960
Check out the man pack, see if we can figure out where we are.

331
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,020
We better get a Geiger counter reading.

332
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,080
...star called SS 433.

333
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,580
It's kind of cold out here.

334
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,740
They don't call it nuclear winter for nothing.

335
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,560
...readings. We can take another reading a little later on.

336
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
I just hope we've got something to say when it's time for that broadcast.

337
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,900
Yeah, no kidding. I love my script.

338
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,480
A lot of people are counting on us. Remember that.

339
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
All ten listeners in the Bay Area.

340
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,520
The Bay Area.

341
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,920
They've got to hear us or they just can't make it through the noise.

342
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,460
This is Texas.

343
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,700
...as it were.

344
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,700
Come on, you guys.

345
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,940
Oh, look, a jackalope, Arizona's national rabbit.

346
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,160
Man, I thought those were extinct.

347
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,580
There it goes.

348
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,640
Okay, it's glowing.

349
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,480
That little speaker's in its head.

350
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,640
Yeah, I wonder where that's coming from.

351
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,620
It's probably an observation drone.

352
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,100
We all follow where the artists lead us.

353
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,240
They are our Galileans. Our Lewises are Edisons.

354
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,000
Is there still law?

355
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,300
There is still law, yes.

356
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,120
But how can there be law without the father?

357
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,320
Father.

358
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,320
He hasn't left us.

359
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,280
That is what I will tell the others.

360
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,580
But his spirit is watching over us.

361
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,500
We must wait for a sign.

362
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,060
That is what I will tell the others.

363
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,900
They'll believe anything.

364
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, the father, he's still there.

365
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,160
Don't worry, it's all right.

366
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,280
Everything's fine.

367
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,660
Bob will take care of everything.

368
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,360
Just rest your head down here.

369
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,000
That's right.

370
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,500
Father will watch over us.

371
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,940
Bob loves you.

372
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,000
Would you like some more book?

373
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,300
Oh, sorry.

374
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:32,960
It's all right.

375
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,840
Within every person, there's some good

376
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,140
and there's some evil.

377
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,680
There's some bad.

378
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,380
And it's a choice.

379
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,380
You choose whether you want to love or hate that person.

380
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,660
And for myself, I just choose to hate most of them.

381
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,280
Now, when a subgenius says that he hates,

382
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,460
what kind of a hate is he talking about, children?

383
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,580
Is he talking about your average, run-of-the-mill hate?

384
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,340
No!

385
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,920
Oh, I just hate Reagan.

386
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,420
That's pathetic!

387
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,000
Or even worse, the nampy-pimpy, pitiful little,

388
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,400
I just hate myself.

389
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,600
No!

390
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,880
What we talk about when we talk about hate

391
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,260
is an all-consuming, an all-encompassing,

392
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,540
an all-pervasive hate!

393
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,060
Yes, I believe it!

394
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,460
An infinite hate!

395
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,960
A hate that knows no bounds!

396
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,720
A hate that extends to the very end of all of the universes!

397
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
A hate!

398
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,000
A hate as black as outer space itself!

399
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,240
We're talking about an all-consuming hate!

400
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,660
More hate!

401
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,400
Ah, yes, the harvest.

402
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,300
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.

403
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,700
God scolded his people in the Old Testament.

404
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,000
The greatest people on earth.

405
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,560
And you walked in with the Judas tribe,

406
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,880
and the wife of Judas might be one of the ladies I'd laid to make a socialist.

407
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,580
I knew I couldn't trust anything but communism and the principle in me.

408
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, I knew that that's what I had to depend upon,

409
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,340
not depend upon the arm of the flesh,

410
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,020
and never put all your eggs in one basket.

411
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,840
So, honey, I put my eggs in many places.

412
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,840
You figure that out if you want to.

413
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,480
Some of you are too naive.

414
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

415
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,040
You can't even follow him.

416
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,400
You haven't even smelled where he's at yet.

417
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
Much less followed him.

418
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,540
You don't even know who he is.

419
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,140
And you might miss him if you didn't have a real good look at him.

420
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,380
You wouldn't even know who he looked like.

421
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,040
You really haven't got an excuse.

422
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
But I've got all kinds of things in store.

423
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,040
Bob, get out of the box.

424
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,020
That's last!

425
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,140
That's last!

426
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,720
Yes!

427
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,480
I feel sorry for the friends of mine who never bought a membership.

428
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,220
I've always tried to expose them gently to Bob's word,

429
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,520
not to force it down their throats,

430
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,580
not mail them pamphlets constantly.

431
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,320
I have turned some people to the church.

432
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,900
I am very proud of those people.

433
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,920
I look forward to greeting them on the saucers.

434
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,280
You know?

435
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,400
But it's kind of sad that my mother,

436
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,640
who really is a wonderful person,

437
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,120
never did buy that membership.

438
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,100
Then again, I don't know what she would make of the saucers.

439
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,740
And of course, there are my enemies.

440
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,440
I do have people in my life who have hurt me

441
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,740
for no particular reason all the way back in high school.

442
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,600
And once I get my memory editing,

443
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,480
I'll be able to remember who you all are.

444
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,240
And I probably will have specific tribulations set aside just for you.

445
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,780
I understand them.

446
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,340
They don't understand me.

447
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,700
To the fucking beat now.

448
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,220
They can't beat us!

449
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,360
We're subgeniuses!

450
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,440
The End

451
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,060
The End

452
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,660
The End

453
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,280
What the fuck am I doing here?

454
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Write us toён

455
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:15,980
Blood!

456
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,560
From my dead boy,

457
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,780
A subscriber heavy hitter

461
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,300


462
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,920
But what I cannot live for

463
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,640
is what this dare

464
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:25,640

Thank you.

Thank you.

00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,460
Thank you.

471
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,820
Thank you.

472
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,180
Thank you.

473
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,160
Thank you.

474
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,220

482
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,320

Bye.

527
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,740
Bye.

528
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,680
Bye.

529
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,140


530
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:02,580


531
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,240
Bye.

532
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,740

535
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:04,740
Bye.

536
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,740


537
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,740


538
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,740


539
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,740


540
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
I have a telegraph first.

541
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,040
Yeah.

542
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,740
Just saying all the radios will be gone.

543
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,000
Instant.

544
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,660
Instantly.

545
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,540
There'll be, we'll be back to horse and buggies and a big rush on blankets for smoke.

546
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,460
Telegraph.

547
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,920
Hey, don't pile.

548
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,640
Hey, you need to feed those horses something.

549
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,220
And then we'll have to have a lot of.

550
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,560
sacrifices because it didn't work out last time.

551
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,700
I think it's not enough bloodletting.

552
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
I think we need to take a few drops more.

553
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,520
How important were the

554
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,140
computers to the

555
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,560
telegraph system at the turn

556
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,520
of the century? Well, I know the Vikings needed

557
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
them real bad. Yeah.

558
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,080
They couldn't get anywhere without them computers.

559
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,520
Like those wires they stretched all

560
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,240
over the country had a chip on it.

561
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,660
Yeah. Sometimes

562
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,520
they had those curly fries.

563
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,800
What if the Y2K problem is

564
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,000
retroactive and the shockwave

565
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
goes back in time, destroying

566
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,120
all computers in the past as

567
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,020
well. So that means we'll have to go back

568
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,080
even more epic. We'll all

569
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,000
be in America that has never been

570
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,160
discovered by Columbus because he didn't have

571
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,860
the computer to make his map.

572
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah, it instantly wipes out

573
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,320
all artificial intelligence in the universe.

574
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,140
Even beads will fall off

575
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,560
of abacus. Yeah.

576
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,160
Bees will pass out too coming out of the

577
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,200
combs. Animals will become

578
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,220
very confused. That'll be hard for most of the

579
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,840
listeners to live with if they have to go out

580
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,580
side and pick turnips, you know. Yeah.

581
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
I don't know if I want to live

582
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,700
through it. A new dark ages.

583
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,900
Yeah, it's baffling.

584
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,560
On the other hand, maybe we'll all just be

585
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,740
reincarnated as our ancestors in the

586
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,860
year 1900. Oh, that'd be

587
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,820
scary. I think what'll actually

588
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,840
happen is our consciousnesses will be

589
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,040
blasted amidst all of our ancestors

590
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,720
so all of them will have this

591
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,780
vague memory of a strange

592
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,060
time when everyone had magical machines

593
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,960
that did everything for them, but it'll all

594
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,220
end in 1999.

595
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,620
Yeah. And then they'll all live

596
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,660
forward and eventually produce

597
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,940
us and in us the memory will be concentrated.

598
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,480
The terrible thing will happen in

599
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,780
1999 and then it will happen again

600
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,780
and our consciousness will be blasted back to

601
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,600
1900 again. That's an

602
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,160
endless loop. It's terrible.

603
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,760
That's an ill prescription for mankind

604
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,400
to constantly keep reabsorbing

605
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,600
itself. Maybe we can, this

606
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,800
time around, maybe we

607
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,680
can plant something that

608
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,820
will clue us in as

609
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,740
we're living our lives, you know, as kids,

610
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,620
and stuff like that. We won't know it's

611
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,760
coming, but maybe we can

612
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,260
leave something behind that will

613
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,040
send us a message

614
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,020
to start working on...

615
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,100
We need an artifact that's completely computer

616
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,200
untouched so it won't be destroyed.

617
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,660
Right. And we need to immediately impregnate

618
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,480
the first person we see in that

619
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,760
world so that our seed, like

620
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,660
a tiny little oak, can grow out of

621
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,720
them and impregnate the rest of the seeds

622
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,600
of mankind's depleted accordion.

623
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,520
Um, uh...

624
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,480
Maybe we could just bring along business cards instead.

625
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,260
Or sub-accordion. Yeah.

626
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,500
Yeah. That's a different

627
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,480
pitch place that you're gonna go in there.

628
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,580
We wanna get people to dance

629
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,500
into the new century, right? Or just kill

630
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,420
themselves again, or what?

631
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,720
I think they should dance until they die.

632
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,680
All time ends, as far as I know,

633
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
from listening to, like, a lot of radio.

634
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,840
Uh, talk radio

635
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,460
and stuff. Whatever you are doing at the

636
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,440
moment of the turnover, you will do

637
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,400
for all eternity. That's right.

638
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,300
Frozen in that one moment. So obviously

639
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,760
you should be having sex.

640
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,760
Yeah. So if you can just

641
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,200
reach orgasm at

642
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,720
midnight. You'll be scrubbing it

643
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,940
forever? That's right.

644
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,760
Well, what about Pat Boone? Is that guy gonna be

645
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,700
on a heavy metal stage saying

646
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,480
the world's gonna end in six minutes

647
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,280
for the rest of time? He's gonna be singing a heavy...

648
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,520
For all of eternity. Pat Boone singing

649
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,860
a heavy metal version of We Are the World.

650
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,020
Forever. With Metallica,

651
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,240
you know, special guest.

652
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,160
The real despotically

653
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,440
bone-chilling Christian

654
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,620
undertones there, just kinda like putting

655
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
you in the mausoleum in the Inquisition

656
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,500
at the same time you're getting rocked out.

657
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,460
Yeah. And if you're reaching

658
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,340
to scratch an itch at the moment,

659
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,480
you'll be eternally reaching for

660
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,520
that terrible itch and you'll never be able

661
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,280
to scratch it. You'll just be spinning around

662
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,540
forever and ever, reaching.

663
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,460
Reaching for that spot in your

664
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,320
back you can't quite reach.

665
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,520
Yeah. But you'll be eternally ungrateful.

666
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,560
Forever and ever. If you got it.

667
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,460
Yeah. Well, at each moment

668
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,300
I suppose there'd be a plethora of delights

669
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,460
that would last or kill you forever. Maybe we should

670
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,380
start killing all the computers now.

671
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,440
Just to get used to it.

672
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,680
If you can't fix the problem

673
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,320
in a year, I'm sure we could kill

674
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,820
every computer within a year.

675
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
How about we all become Buddhist?

676
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,660
Nah. Nah, there'd be a few computers

677
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,280
left over. It's kinda like, you know, the...

678
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,420
Someone would hide theirs. They'd have their underground

679
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,240
shelter with the rank of batteries.

680
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,480
We gotta kill... It'd be like the killer, you know,

681
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
that movie Killer Bees, you know, where there's

682
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,300
that one bee left up on the seat

683
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,340
at the top of the... Bill Gates.

684
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,460
Superdome. That's him, Bill Gates.

685
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,300
That's what I was getting to. That one last

686
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,260
killer bee that we gotta get. No, it won't be a big guy like

687
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,520
Gates. It won't be a big guy. They'll get him first.

688
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,260
But he's the... He is the evil one.

689
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,220
He is the evil one. He will...

690
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,420
It'll be one of Gates' spawn. The unnamed

691
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,720
spawn with that chip

692
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,180
directly coded into his DNA.

693
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,420
That one would escape.

694
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,100
I think Gates has already implanted that chip into

695
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,320
that spawn wherever... Oh, they're rushing right now

696
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,300
to clone people so hard, too.

697
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,320
Do you know that, folks?

698
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,140
Oh, yeah. Oh, we gotta do it

699
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,920
tomorrow. Of course. Jeez.

700
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,420
You know,

701
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,200
hardly six months has gone

702
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,140
by since it was the bad idea. Now,

703
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,140
we're all supposed to be for it. Well, they have to hurry up, though. They have

704
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,600
to come to term before

705
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,760
1999 rolls over.

706
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,000
So they only got 11

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,180
and a half months. Look, I'm

708
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,400
a Dos Equisist, actually.

709
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,200
And I don't really think there is

710
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,060
gonna be any problem after July

711
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,240
5th anyway this year. I don't know. And then none of

712
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,520
the clones will come to fruition.

713
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,280
I never really thought it was gonna happen on X-Day.

714
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,060
I was a Dos Equisist all the way.

715
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Yeah, I'm a bohemian man myself. 1999.

716
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,980
I think it's gonna keep on going on

717
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,500
with grueling drudgery forever.

718
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,020
I've been labeled a Nexus

719
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,040
and I don't shrink from

720
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,660
that label. How about a Plexus?

721
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,020
Either one of those are spots that

722
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,160
can't be scab-picked.

723
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,760
The Nexus or the Plexus. Your lunar

724
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,640
Plexus? The Plexus.

725
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,000
That's that special spot on your ass

726
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,680
where if someone kicks you, you can't breathe.

727
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,120
Your lunar Plexus. Yes, it's

728
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,740
a chakra of yoga. Uh-huh.

729
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,000
For those of you who want to get off the planet without

730
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,080
a body or with one, either way, you gotta

731
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,060
use it. Uh-huh.

732
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,040
We might need to build some kind of dynamic cadre

733
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,780
of robot

734
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,960
android computer killing people

735
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
that can use it like Chonk Twine.

736
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,040
Based on a DNA segment built

737
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,960
on the dodecahedron. Who can

738
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,200
kill all the bad guys here and then still get off the planet

739
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,840
and then maybe come back and kill some more like

740
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,880
pirates. And can exist in any dimension

741
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,660
up to a level. Hey, you guys, what's up?

742
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,340
What's up, man? Hey, man, what's up?

743
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,800
Hey, you know, X-Wings, I got these new kind of fighters

744
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,320
and they can kill your robots off.

745
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
And, uh, and friends, I think that

746
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,580
collar, in some

747
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,460
respects, shows more

748
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,500
maturity and

749
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,700
realistic, practical

750
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
grasp of things in this modern

751
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,640
world than our unfortunate

752
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,900
friends at Einstein's

753
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,680
Secret Orchestra.

754
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,740
Chaz and Dave with their special guest

755
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,460
Princess Weard. Oh, and

756
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,700
actually, you didn't hear Princess We much,

757
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,740
but Friday Jones

758
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,560
was taking us back

759
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,980
in time.

760
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,640
And, uh, friends,

761
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,480
we've been, this is great with this,

762
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,480
I got through most of the departments

763
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,780
before we even

764
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,520
started the show.

765
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Or, wait a minute,

766
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,720
what am I saying? I don't know what the hell's going

767
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
on. Let's see what...

768
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,420
Oh, I...

769
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,500
Whenever he starts going

770
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,900
you know that it's time for the pill.

771
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,380
Yeah, that's what it is.

772
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,920
Take another one of their pills.

773
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,000
I am pills.

774
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,580
Salvador L. Dolly Parton once said,

775
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,700
I am pills. There was a time before pills.

776
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,320
No, friends.

777
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,200
You must be one with the pills.

778
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,020
The Dave and the pill are one.

779
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,280
But there's a time we have to think about

780
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,380
before the pills. Hey, Leib, could you paint

781
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,300
that scene for us? We'll shut up for a second.

782
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,360
Alright. There was a time

783
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,140
before the pills.

784
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
When the pills

785
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,960
were liquids and powders

786
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,340
in their separate forms.

787
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,320
Alone

788
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,400
and bottled.

789
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,520
Bottled and alone.

790
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,080
Alone.

791
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,860
And as...

792
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,680
The seas swelled and the various

793
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,720
lubricants slurped around

794
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,920
the ancient seas.

795
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,740
A conch shell...

796
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,780
A conch shell formed from the

797
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,360
sands around the seas.

798
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,600
And as the seas

799
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,000
churned and mixed the liquids

800
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,720
and the powders,

801
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,780
the conch shell

802
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,800
embraced all that was

803
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,920
to become the pills.

804
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,300
Aphrodite rose from the waters

805
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,500
with her one Etruscan breast

806
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,000
showing.

807
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,960
Flipped skyward.

808
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,000
And she held forth

809
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,720
two bottles.

810
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,220
In one bottle were the uppers

811
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,200
and in the other

812
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,080
the downers.

813
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,300
And in between

814
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,400
were all the other pills that would ever be

815
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,300
or ever might be imagined.

816
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,480
Dr. Fence, a veritable

817
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,900
laboratory of...

818
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,200
Not alone.

819
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,840
We can sure have...

820
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,820
And the Yeti people surrounded her

821
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,200
and praised her.

822
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,840
And began to paint her picture.

823
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,800
They wondered about the pills

824
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,620
that she held.

825
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,940
This is the great goddess Naya.

826
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,460
The great goddess Naya

827
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,820
who brings not only fertility

828
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,300
but great pork and bean sandwiches.

829
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,660
I fed all the others.

830
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,540
Thank you for the letters.

831
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,920
And pills, Davey.

832
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,180
Pills too.

833
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,620
For we're talking about the pills

834
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,060
and the time before the pills.

835
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,320
Two pills.

836
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,740
Late 50s, I think it was.

837
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,400
Four pills.

838
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,800
I don't know.

839
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,160
Five pills.

840
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,300
And the people and the Yetis

841
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,320
looked on the pills

842
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,840
and they wondered.

843
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,160
The pills.

844
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,240
And the subgeni came

845
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,980
and they asked the goddess

846
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,720
for the pills.

847
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,980
And the goddess said...

848
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,760
DMT.

849
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,160
The goddess said...

850
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,000
DMT.

851
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,640
DMT.

852
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,040
Yes, the goddess laughed.

853
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,780
Guilty.

854
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,220
Guilty.

855
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,180
Hang each and every one

856
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,540
of these private parts.

857
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,160
Take them separately

858
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,860
and hang each and every one

859
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,660
of the other parts.

860
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,600
That's why I take this.

861
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,020
Yes.

862
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,280
Papa Joe.

863
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,440
Yes, sir, ma'am.

864
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,340
The goddess says...

865
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,620
Climb up on that podium

866
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,480
and give us a minute or two.

867
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,960
As I step within the 13 deadly steps

868
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,960
upon the loosely nailed scaffolds

869
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,500
I stand

870
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,780
and look upon the sea

871
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,900
of sickening pain.

872
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,720
I stand

873
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:49,720


874
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:49,720


875
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,240
These are the looks

876
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,460
of those who will scream in pain.

877
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,300
Yes.

878
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,820
The rocket

879
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,160
of the fire sky

880
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,720
on the sea today.

881
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,820
For as we have fooled

882
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,540
the normals

883
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,000
into thinking

884
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,260
X-Day 1998 has passed,

885
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,020
X-Day 1999 approaches

886
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,560
in a gallop

887
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,020
of the seven horsemen

888
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,640
of the apocalypse.

889
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,840
Let them who doubt

890
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,800
not attend.

891
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,540
Let them who doubt

892
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,820
scoff and laugh.

893
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,300
And let those

894
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,440
true believers

895
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:18,880
laugh.

896
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:18,880


897
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:18,880


898
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,780
Gather with their oxygen masks

899
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,900
and big,

900
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,740
stupid,

901
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,020
to gather

902
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,700
for the rest

903
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,060
of the day.

904
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:26,840
Bob.

905
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,240
My corpuscles

906
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,180
are exploding.

907
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,020
Only as they ascend

908
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,080
the escalators

909
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,800
into the pleasure saucers

910
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,300
to see

911
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,380
what they think

912
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:36,900
will be

913
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,160
an eternity of bliss

914
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,420
will they realize

915
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,380
that Bob

916
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,480
has been preparing

917
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,780
a special sauce

918
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,280
for them.

919
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,220
Yes,

920
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,740
the bodies

921
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,720
in the barbers

922
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,980
will be separated

923
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,720
from the true

924
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,220
believers of Bob

925
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,560
and the subgeniuses.

926
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,960
For even now

927
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,820
with 10,000 members,

928
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,140
10,000 paid members,

929
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,680
there are too many

930
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,600
to ascend

931
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,800
into the X's

932
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,660
pleasure saucers

933
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,000
and to planet X.

934
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,380
We must separate

935
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,240
the wheat

936
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,560
from the chaff.

937
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,620
The wheat.

938
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,020
You need to

939
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,580
close the valve

940
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,040
down there.

941
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,060
And that, my friends,

942
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,200
is why we have

943
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,500
the special subgenius

944
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,260
slogans

945
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,960
to separate the Barbies

946
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,640
from the true subgenies.

947
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,960
So we will know

948
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,540
who will be

949
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,400
those who travel

950
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,160
to and fro

951
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,700
and who will be

952
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,680
the food for those

953
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,960
who travel to and fro.

954
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,640
Fro!

955
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,160
Fro!

956
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,380
I vote fro!

957
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,400
Vote fro!

958
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,240
Yes, my dear friends,

959
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,900
you don't need

960
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,600
to be a peewee hermit

961
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,580
in order to enjoy

962
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,080
the flesh of humans.

963
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,920
All the flesh

964
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,740
are Barbies

965
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,420
and Barbettes.

966
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,380
But remember,

967
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,840
it is more pleasant

968
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,300
and good

969
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,080
to feed

970
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,000
than it is

971
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,820
to be fed upon.

972
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,920
Eat while the carnage

973
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,520
is fresh.

974
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,140
Ah!

975
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,740
The corpses

976
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,460
were swollen

977
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,240
into the land.

978
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,180
It is always better

979
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,860
than not enough.

980
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,800
The river's

981
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,700
running red.

982
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,880
Pink is

983
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,740
as pink

984
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,520
does.

985
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,260
It is always better

986
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,640
than not enough.

987
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,200
Even the pinks

988
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,680
are pink on the inside.

989
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,460
Too much

990
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,540
is always better

991
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,580
than not enough.

992
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,260
You can...

993
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,320
You can never

994
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:18,860
have...

995
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,180
You can never,

996
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,200
ever, ever

997
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,360
have too much

998
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,720
solid rocket fuel.

999
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,600
It's been five months

1000
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,280
and though it's left

1001
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,720
in the...

1002
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,440
in the...

1003
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,020
in the heat for so long...

1004
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,560
Hey, let me show you

1005
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,660
too much rocket fuel

1006
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:30,980
underneath.

1007
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,440
Save is always better

1008
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,720
than not enough rocket fuel

1009
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,920
Hey, guys, let me show you

1010
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,960
my frop rocket.

1011
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,860
Oh, frop rocket?

1012
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,100
All right.

1013
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,340
Yeah.

1014
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,340
It could only be lit

1015
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,240
with an actual

1016
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,020
frop joint.

1017
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,560
Let me ride.

1018
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,700
Let me ride.

1019
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,680
Let's ride.

1020
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,460
Here's my frop rocket.

1021
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,760
Is that a waste of good frop?

1022
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,520
Do you stick a...

1023
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,160
No, no.

1024
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,300
No, no.

1025
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,520
No.

1026
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:48,800
Whoa!

1027
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,160
Did I get right in the middle

1028
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,900
of the frop-a-thon?

1029
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,060
Oh, man, Stang's here.

1030
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,380
Oh, my God!

1031
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,960
Papa Joe Mama's here.

1032
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,160
Bleepo's here.

1033
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,260
And Pony Rack is gone.

1034
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,320
And Dave's in the studio.

1035
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,620
Gary's in the house tonight.

1036
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,300
He's not wearing

1037
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,700
It's a full house tonight

1038
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,380
here on WCSC Cleveland.

1039
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,440
It's a royal flush here.

1040
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,740
And let's not

1041
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,780
forget the Contessa here.

1042
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:06,780


1043
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,380
Yep.

Addicato.

1053
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,120
Ladies and gentlemen of the world,

1054
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,740
it is my utmost privilege to announce to you

1055
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,980
that these little green men actually do exist,

1056
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,860
for they are part of the eternal past

1057
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,180
and venture from all regions of our galaxy

1058
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,980
to find homage in our Earth's center.

1059
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,160
Governments of the world have been very good

1060
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,400
at concealing these little visitors

1061
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,560
and preparing the public with loving movies

1062
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,720
and pleasant melodies.

1063
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,840
You see, like this one.

1064
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,240
You hear that?

1065
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,160
Yes, controlled media has to cushion the impact

1066
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,620
of the arrival of our little friends.

1067
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,700
Throughout history, many people have claimed to see

1068
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,400
strange lights in the sky.

1069
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,160
The truth of the matter is that these lights and beings

1070
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,520
will only reveal themselves to those who are pure at heart,

1071
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,220
for these enlightened aliens

1072
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,120
leave permanent imprinted information

1073
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,060
on the psyche of those chosen humans

1074
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,740
only to be revealed to our deteriorating planet

1075
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,640
at the point at which our civilization

1076
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,580
shall enter the new age of

1077
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,040
Light Without Heat.

1078
00:47:52,020 --> 00:48:02,600

Oh, friends, a classic of melodramatic cheesiness there from Steve Vai.

1118
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,700
I guess he's some kind of a guitar god to some people,

1119
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:39,140
but that was an interesting derivative and yet inspiring piece of something.

1120
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,020
And we've mostly been listening to E.

1121
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,980
Now that we went through the old stuff departments,

1122
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:57,320
it's been an instinct like an orchestries in old men of Dave and Times.

1123
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,100
Ooh.

1124
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,040
Will it be?

1125
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,640
Will it be you?

1126
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:02,780
You.

1127
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,240
You're standing there in the dark.

1128
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,900
I can see your face clearly now.

1129
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,520
Will it be you?

1130
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,980
You with the shining face.

1131
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,160
Will you take us out of this place?

1132
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,620
Lead us far, far away.

1133
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,400
Come, come.

1134
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,880
You come up to the front of the stage.

1135
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,860
Show them who you are.

1136
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,860
You're golden boots, aren't you?

1137
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,480
You've come to take us away from...

1138
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:39,460
Plutonium storms and the endless dark and the air with no moisture and the croaking of the birds as they die.

1139
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:48,180
You, you will take us away to a place where there are no birds anymore.

1140
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,580
Well, that about wraps it up in a sandwich so far.

1141
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,960
It seems that, uh,

1142
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,680
some people are having a hard time getting their way.

1143
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,400
The window's open.

1144
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,780
The, uh, detritus has reached an alarming level of 15 centimeters.

1145
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,040
If you're out today, you're probably going to die.

1146
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,980
You don't want to reach for the, uh, thermometer, though.

1147
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,700
You don't want to reach for that evacu-gen.

1148
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,360
You want to make sure that everybody, including the pets, are inside the house.

1149
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,080
Well, those of us who can make it to the stars,

1150
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,940
perhaps we will try and get there.

1151
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,680
And I will word from the Reverend Forrest Mellon,

1152
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,880
the Church of the Apocalyptic Vision tonight,

1153
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,740
the incorrect assumption and the play on worms by our lady of the Wombat,

1154
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,900
a spoken ceremony without any ending,

1155
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,280
concluding the following passage.

1156
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,740
Hello.

1157
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,040
I have been a wanderer through the stars.

1158
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,040
I have left my footprints.

1159
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,600
On Mars.

1160
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,920
I have settled strumpets in outer space

1161
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,140
and specked their booties and their face.

1162
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,200
These words, dear Reverend and sisters,

1163
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,720
these words were uttered by our father and jingoistic leader,

1164
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,620
Punicum and Ten Wenmen, in the year 6,

1165
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,800
when the Mayan calendar first was discovered.

1166
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,640
Thank you.

1167
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,380
And as the calendar was discovered,

1168
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,560
we realized here at Cathedral Central we needed plans.

1169
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,460
Plans were in order.

1170
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,780
We need to get ready to leave this place,

1171
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,980
which we have left our urine-infested and toxic wastes for so long.

1172
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,240
And now it's time to split it like an old port-a-booty,

1173
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,660
which we have no further use for.

1174
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,020
I don't want some of you out there, if you are out there,

1175
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,400
some of you are right in here, where I keep you.

1176
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,560
And I will not let you go from this minute forward.

1177
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,040
You're stuck.

1178
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,800
You're stuck in this box.

1179
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,720
A box of your own creation, friends.

1180
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,400
And as you wander in this creation,

1181
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,920
this box, this trapezoid you have created

1182
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,640
from your own silly iniquities and stupid, irresponsible actions,

1183
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,160
you look inside, back inside,

1184
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,640
and you see that there is,

1185
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,020
there is an answer to your prayers, if you will,

1186
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,900
to your beckonings, if you want,

1187
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:41,460
your innermost desires for spiritual tranquility and bliss.

1188
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:49,000
Ah, yes, friends, and I think you know the answer to the P.O. box

1189
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,020
of where you can get that bliss all over yourself.

1190
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,220
Friends, just, you got that pencil ready?

1191
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,620
If you want to know all the rest,

1192
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,360

And friends, I've got some other addresses for you,

1200
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,560
because, but we, I almost forgot

1201
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,720
the Subgenius Zine Reviews Department

1202
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,420
and upcoming shows.

1203
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,420
Upcoming shows, well, Memorial Day weekend,

1204
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:54,200
there's this giant subgenius revival in Seattle, Washington,

1205
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,420
with every preacher,

1206
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,920
Pope David and Meyer, myself,

1207
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,840
Doctors for Bob, and Papa Joe Mama,

1208
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,520
and Pope S. Lilith is sponsoring that and preaching,

1209
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,340
and it will be just a, I don't know who else,

1210
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:13,420
and June 10th, June 10th, friends, in Portland, Oregon,

1211
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,080
the Lemurian race shall rise again up out of the ocean,

1212
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,160
out of Portland Sound,

1213
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:27,740
and shall grab out for news, subgenius,

1214
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,040
souls, new minds and hearts,

1215
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,020
that we can squeeze like sponges,

1216
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,560
and get that red stuff all over everything,

1217
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,400
and of course, X Day, friends,

1218
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,020
X Day, Dos Equis, Double X Day,

1219
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,800
the great double cross, 1998,

1220
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,760
the July 5th weekend in Sherman, New York,

1221
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,680
the sensual and sensationalistic,

1222
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,900
if you ever wondered how weird

1223
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,480
400 of Bob's most devoted followers are,

1224
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,240
and some of them naked,

1225
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,820
your vivid and unrelenting answer

1226
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,800
can be right there in front of you,

1227
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,640
July 5th, 1999,

1228
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,360
the end of the world.

1229
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,920
Friends, it's coming.

1230
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,800
By the way, this is Zug's rift in the background music,

1231
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,040
with, I think with Joe Newman also.

1232
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,560
Friends, here's a quick zine review,

1233
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,900
because it's a quick subgenius zine,

1234
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
but this is a book, and it's called,

1235
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,380
The Yeti Times,

1236
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,860
and it's a printed amateur publication,

1237
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,460
with excellent graphics and art,

1238
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,760
called The Yeti Times,

1239
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,700
and The Yeti Times is available for like a buck in stamps,

1240
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:48,000
from Post Office Box 07442.

1241
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,200
Got that pencil ready?

1242
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,980
That's Post Office Box 07442,

1243
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,480
Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

1244
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,340
53207.

1245
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,360
That's Milwaukee, Y,

1246
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,240
W, WI, WI, 53207,

1247
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,140
produced by Yetis for Bob.

1248
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,520
It's a subgenius zine called The Yeti Times.

1249
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,580
It's fully illustrated,

1250
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,060
and actually is a great contact point

1251
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,860
for many other subgenius zines.

1252
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,120
It is for mature audiences only,

1253
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:25,920
like most,

1254
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,440
subgenius materials,

1255
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,660
and, ah, yes, friends,

1256
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,680
it's so good, good, good.

1257
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,680
Let's close with our,

1258
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,920
tonight's X Day hymn,

1259
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,480
off of the X Day music tape.

1260
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,260
Don't even know for sure which one's gonna come up.

1261
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,420
Let's just hit it by random, friends.

1262
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,240
Ah, yes.

1263
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,640
Good night, little droogies.

1264
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,720
Happy trails to you

1265
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,980
Till we meet again

1266
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,520
Happy trails to you

1267
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,800
Keep smiling till then

1268
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,100
Happy trails to you

1269
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:27,500
Till we meet again

1270
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,520
Happy trails to you

1271
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:56,780
Keep smiling till then

1272
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,500
Happy trails to you

1273
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,420
Happy trails to you

1274
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,520
Happy trails to you

1275
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,800
Happy trails to you
