And now, the Self-Genius Hour of Slack!
Then, a step as important as any to happiness is the opportunity for self-expression.
If a boy is encouraged to have slack of some sort, he is no longer bored and at a loose end.
It is the slacker who is always ready for the companionship of him who finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.
Indoctrination classes begin this a.m.
And so, you see, they naturally fit everything. One size fits all.
You sit in the little chair here, and these restraining straps keep your arms and legs from moving around.
Oh, there's egg everywhere.
Yes, the egg will drop one at a time.
No, they just slipped on the egg.
They come down through this.
It's okay, somebody's come in to do something.
They are timed, so it's just as the yolk and the albumin is running off your head from the last egg that was dropped,
the timer drops another egg on your head at that time, and so the cycle goes.
And also, this high-pitched, high-intensity music will be played while you're lying prone.
What's up? What's up, homies?
A good day to...
A good day to you.
And welcome y'all to Chap in the Hood.
Yeah, that's right. This show's hella down.
Yes.
I am Sir Charles Laybridge Stuart Fotherington.
And these are my chums, Sir Fixer Blunt...
Hey, what's up?
Fahad Muhammad Rakeem...
Peace to you, my brother.
And my main homeboy, Butterknife.
Hiya, what's up?
I say, what's up, G-Dog?
Man, homs, just chillin' and shit.
And to my old-school peeps doing time in Stoney Lonesome, keep your heads up.
Fight the power, my brothers.
Yeah, fight the man, yeah.
Well, what we do here is discuss the contemporary issues of the day that confront our post-9-11 society.
Yeah.
Along with some scammin', slammin', and of course, jammin' with the OGs.
Yeah, keep it real.
Aye, it's all good.
You join us as we were discussing the difficulty of easily obtaining large quantities of dank in a security-obsessed society.
I was voicing the opinion that...
What? Oh, shit!
Oh, my.
Aye, yo, heads up.
A carload of members of a rival crew has suddenly rolled up on our crib.
Damn.
I say, homies, heads up on this shit.
We don't know what they intend.
Yeah, watch out for that shit.
Oh, my.
Look through the door, brother.
Damn.
Someone is approaching the door of our humble cottage.
Damn, watch out for that.
Look out.
Damn, careful.
It's all good, gentlemen.
Do not fret, for I got my hand in my pocket and my fingers on the trigger.
Aye, it's all good.
Know what I'm sayin'?
Got your back, fool.
Got your back, brother.
Got your back, brother.

Hello, hello.
What's all this, then?
Good heavens.
It's Sam Smythe, the most infamous dodgy bastard this side of the Atlantic.
Yeah, that's right, Charlie, and I'm here because I'm right pissed, you git.
Oh, dear.
What seems to be the trouble, dear chap?
You be stealing some of my best wraps, mate.
I'm right fit to cap your arse right now.
I know you blokes are biting my lines, and now that I caught you, your arse is mine.
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't understand, my good fellow.
Aye, this fool's sayin', like, uh, you, like, stole his rap and shit.
You know what I'm sayin'?
You, like, you, like, stole his rhymes.
Ah.
You, like, stole his rhymes and shit, yeah.
I see.
Well, dear chap, I have the advantage.
You see, I got a dove sack, and my posse's got my back.
Got your back, fool.
And even if you got away, well, then, we gotta follow you home with the chrome.
Aye, we got you covered.
Well, mate, my boys got your arse surrounded like, outside.
So I got the drop on your sorry arse.
Shit, he's got homies all up in this shit.
You got a hell of homeboys outside.
There's a hell of fools out there.
So will you admit you ripped off my best snaps?
I say, this does look like a bit of a standoff, for I cannot recall biting a single rhyme of yours.
Look, sport, don't make me break you off something.
Do you know, I believe a few caps on your arse will quieten you down, my dear boy.
Right, well, then, there's nothing else for it.
Aye, aye, you better not try, motherfucker.
Aye, step up, fool.
Get that motherfucker, man.
I say, before we do this thing up proper,
I couldn't help noticing...
...that it's 420.
Aye, that was 420.
Shut your piehole.
Blimey, you're right at that.
And you do know what that means.
Oh, yeah.
420, that's the type of smoke.
420's down for this old school bloke.
Well, then, how about some hits from the bong, as it were?
Do what now?
Hits from the bong, old boy.
You see, a bong is a water pipe for smoking denk.
The denk is filtered through the water.
When you take a fat hit,
the pressure drops in the head.
The pressure drops in the holding chamber.
So the smoke gets pulled through the water.
You think I don't know what a bong is?
I rolled in that get low hood too, squire.
Let's take some fat green hits from that five footer.
Here.
Alright, governor.
Oh, what is that, eh?
Ah, yes.
Ah, yes.

Lovely.
Blimey, that's the chronic that is.
Hey, yo, this is clogged, G.
Say, that pipe's bugged.
That's rather fat one.
Yo, don't hide the crock, cause I got the easy one.
Hey, yo, look out for that cherry, fool.
Oh, bloody hell.
What seems to be the trouble?
What, what?
Oh, bollocks.
I'll burn a hole in me brand new diggy.
Ah, don't trouble yourself about that.
You may have one of mine.
What?
I say, butter knife, roll us some fatties, Holmes.
Damn, fool.
I already rolled up some hella fat spears.
Look at that fool.
Hey, I got the most...
Ah.
Oh, bugger, beam me up, Scotty.
That's the dank that is.
Tally-ho.
Oh, blimey, mate. Damn, I'm fucked up.
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.
Oh, yes. Are you down with Nickies?
Oh, yes. Are you down with Nickies?
Well, I used to drink them every day.
Straight forties to the head, fool.
Ah, butter knife, forties for us all.
It's all good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.
Ah, damn.
Right, um, what were we on about?
You know, call me daft, but strangely enough,
I can't seem to remember.
Hmm.
They forgot what it was about the Bustercat.
That's fucked up.
They forgot.
Yeah, that's fucked up.
Hey, yo, trip on this, governor.
You wanna go score a fat key then, Charlie?
Indeed.
Let's go half on a bag of dank.
We could go down to pub and bomb up on a Guinness.
Maybe throw a few darts like.
Oh, yeah, man. I'm all up in the Guinness.
Spot on. You read my mind, L. Bean.
Spot on. You read my mind, L. Bean.
Let's roll up on that place.
Damn, it's cold.
Well, once again, we out of here.
So, as always, let me leave you with a few words of pithy advice.
So, as always, let me leave you with a few words of pithy advice.
One. While you were at your job working nine to five,

the Beastie Boys were at the garden cold-kicking it live.
And two. Remember,
to all my peoples in the pens,
keep your head up, keeping it real out in the field, y'all.
And if you don't know...
And if you don't know...
Now you know.
Let's go, brother. We ghost.
Come on, fool. You're waiting on your ass.
Well, we've got to slide. This bit's been played out.
See you around. Peace out.

piece there. Chap in

by Ronald
Redball of
the National Cynical
Network, and you can get information
or check out their

But friends I've got someone
to talk to ya'll
about whizzing by
our planet by a
mere seventy-five
thousand miles
from this news story ever since
news was invented. And
its barely a blip in the media
of friends that will be forgotten tomorrow. A tiny zit between some supermodel's breasts
on a hair goo commercial. Check this out. Astronomers have revealed that on June 14th,
an asteroid the size of a football field made one of the closest ever recorded approaches
to the Earth. It is only the sixth time an asteroid has been seen to penetrate the moon's
orbit, and this is by far the biggest rock to do so. What has worried some astronomers,
though, is that the space object was only detected on June 17th, several days after
its flyby. Cataloged as 2002 MN, the asteroid was traveling over 10 kilometers a second,
23,000 miles per hour, when it passed Earth at a distance of only 75,000 miles. It's a
wake-up call.
Wake-up call, friends. If it had hit the Earth, it would have caused local devastation
similar to that which occurred in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908, said Dr. John Davies of
the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. If an asteroid were to approach close to an imaginary line
joining the Earth and the Sun, it would never be visible in a nighttime sky and would be
quite impossible to discover with normal telescopes. Its arrival would come literally
as a bolt from the blue.
Friends, we wouldn't even have known what hit us. There'd have been a nuclear-sized
explosion in Madagascar or someplace, and every nuke in the northern hemisphere would
have left its silo, and even if they didn't go off, it'd be cloudy days and bad crops
for a hundred years. But will they learn? Hell no! The X's give them this blatant warning,
a shot right over their heads, and do they heed? No! They go on with their pop stars,
and their sports, and their worries about the textile contracts getting to the print
shop on time. Gabriel blows his horn right in their domagogue faces, and they just kinda
go, huh? And carry on with their fretful little lives. Friends, nothing can shake them from
their complacency. You plop their most trusted symbol into their most trusted symbol and
kill so many of them it's like spraying for bugs, and still they act just like bugs. Friends,
this rock will be back.
They'll be back around again, and they'll still let it sneak up on them. They could
have been ready if they'd been half serious about all their nuke toys. They'd have seen
this coming. And even if it came out of the sun like a bat out of hell, they could have
used it for some hellacious target practice. But no, friends, they wussed out again. If
they had any nut, they'd pay Dr. Legume to perfect that meteor magnet of his so that
the next time it would hit them dead on and put them out of their foul misery.
But first, friends, let me get off and let Barbie slack.
. All right. The thing is, if that meteor would've slammed into somewhere in America,
George Bush and Dick Cheney would've gone attacking anything that moved in any part
of the world.
Yeah, that's the other .
But they would've been in their nice little Bush penthouses and –
All of our nukes would've been there.
have gone off automatically. All of the
other guys' nukes would have gone off automatically.
If the asteroid had only
wiped out a few Bushmen in Australia,
we would finish
wiping off everybody.
But why couldn't it wipe out the Bushmen
in Washington, D.C., and we would all
be safe sleeping in our beds?
Dave, you can't say that kind of stuff.
Can you feel it? No.
Can you emotionally? Not on the radio.
You can't even emotionally feel it
on the radio? No. Why not?
No, you don't really want a whole bunch
of people wiped out unless
it's been carefully
planned by Bob.
You cannot specifically say
anything about wiping out
anything to do with the president.
You can make fun of the president all
you want to. Okay, I had a
vague dream where he fell down the steps
and he couldn't get up.
But Dave was talking
about an asteroid from outer space.
Right, I was saying if it was more correctly
positioned, our favor would have increased.
No, but just don't pick on GW.
No, because he never picked Sean.
I don't want a new FBI file
on this. Now, Chaz, how
come, you know where I heard about
that asteroid that barely
missed the Earth? Canada. From you.
You emailed me the news.
I didn't hear anybody else talking about it.
It's kind of
around, just like Planet X.
Well, it's just this little thing happening.
I hadn't heard about it either. Somebody emailed it to me.
Yeah. Oh, really?
It's not even
No.
Not even.
Regular radio talk.
No, just a friendly email came in.
Isn't that synchronistic to you, though, that this
occurred so close to your own day of X's?
I mean, just think of it. There is some sort of
cosmic interlude which bubbles beneath your
pants. You can just see it. You can smell it,
too, unfortunately. Well, the moral of the story is
they paid no attention. They're not interested
and the next time it happens, they'll go,
oh, gosh, what a surprise.
But we know it probably won't hit Brushwood
now. Hello? Protection
up in place. Too bad we didn't
use our used old nuclear weapon.
It's a shield against
asteroids and collars
from the beyond. Everybody's looking
for Osama, but I think he's hiding in the asteroid.
I think that's where he's at right now.
I think his face is the face
buried in the asteroid. No, but I'm surprised no
religious cults or anything aren't out there, you know,
calling it for it to come back.
Well, they're always off base, much like
you know, the Church of the Subgenius.
Swore that he would improve
his meteor magnet.
Yeah. Can I ask you
about your mental health a little bit, Reverend?
I don't have any. You're taking these deep
sighs. Are you on some sort of a
Lincoln-ish drug, or are you just
a... I've got methane. I'm just
emitting the methane right now
and I'm sucking it in deep. He's lit, baby.
He's lit. I mean, it's like, you know, what's with all the
You can run your
house on methane if you eat
enough beatery, my friend.
Well, I'm trying, but, you know,
I've been trying to breathe it because I heard
it was economical. Unfortunately, it's
not working too well. Well, you'll create your own planets
in your bowels if you do, because methane...
Methane is the crescent of all lifelessness.
But we have a funnel over the house.
So, I'm trying.
Deck no!
Woo-hoo! My friends, that asteroid
could have your name on it. There could be another
big sister asteroid coming right
behind 2002MM.
It could be B-O-B
13013 with
your name on its name tag,
buddy. Your house address.
Can you sell advertising states on the asteroid?
He's still talking over there.
Ivan Stank can talk forever.
Yeah, he's speechifying and preachifying.
Bringing the word
to the big night at Heathen.
I want you to check a box
next to each one of these that's a true statement.
Come on, everybody. Let's go get fresh eggs, ham, and bacon.
A true statement. I salivate
at the sight of mittens, true or false?
Garlic.
My father was a good woman,
true or false?
A little salsa in there.
My mother dresses me funny, true or false?
I believe
in an afterbirth?
True or false?
This is a subgenius quiz.
I often lie to make myself obnoxious, true or false?
I prefer spiders to lima beans?
Spiders?
Digitally.
Think you're most older than your dad, Tom.
Often I think I am a special agent.
Plan is to
invade, to infest key men
in government and industry with
some alien force from outer space
that...
seeps into the human body and takes over.
Bob.
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob
for this brief minute of slack
from the church of the subgenius.
from the church of the subgenius.
Ah, yes, dear friends,
this is Reverend Ivan Stang
with another reading from the sacred
pre-scriptures of the church of the subgenius.
And, yea,
he climbeth down chimneys
and delivereth us the gifts of the flesh
and of slack. He will not be a slave,
he commandeth horned demons
with cloven hoofs to take to the air
and pull him in his chariot in glory.
For he knoweth when thou
hast been sleeping, and he knoweth
when thou art awake.
He judgeth if thou art
damned or worthy.
So heedeth this for thine
own sake, for his eyes
are everywhere, like unto
Big Brother. He puffeth
on his pipe, and laugheth
at our follies like a bowl
full of Vaseline. But yet,
yea, in his mercy,
he giveth us days off,
and he bringeth us goods, yet billeth
us not. So imagine, friends, somewhere
in the snowy north, the Santa
Bob trudges mindlessly
on, driven by strange
forces to complete his
nameless errands. And he
may show up at your house.
If you've been a good
subgenius,
let there be slack.
We've seen
Santa on his way, and he
missed us by seventy-five thousand
scant miles. A Nordic
whatever the hell it is
trying to wipe out the planet, I'm sorry.
That was just strange to see.
An asteroid with the face of Wotan
narrowly missed
the planet Earth, although we couldn't see
its face since it was coming
from the sun. They didn't even know it was coming
until it was on its way
away. Yea, away.
Three days later. Can we get
away from Wotan and have our own gods
like Bhutan and Cretan and...
you know, the more friendly deities?
Oh, where have you been? Of course we've
done all that. Been there, done that.
Well, gee, that's what I wanted to hear. Poofty
poofty poof. I want an explanation.
Zeus, Wotan,
Negi, the old ones,
Nyarlathotep, the babbling idiot
blind god who crawls at the
edge of the earth.
The old
faith.
Gimme that old time religion.
Gimme that old time religion. Frying
cows on the top of a mountain with
half-breasted young women.
Lifting their hearts out. Are you
listening, sheeple?
Mithra. Are you listening, sheeple?
As you turn into sand.
As the vibrations
from Big Dome
and the corporations crush you down. Yes, friends, Bob's gospel's
coming through. The old ways are the best.
And we're gonna return. We're going
home, friends.
Bob's gonna take us home. We're gonna
party all the way. In our suitcases,
in our mind. Your blues here on
planet earth are over, my friend.
We wish it is our desires.
Yes, yes, yes. Bob's gonna take you home.
Can you hear the angels singing?
Can you hear that choir of nude
topless angels?
Table dancing angels, friends,
on the escape vessels
of the sex goddess. Quiet little
confidants. Come and see
darling. July 5th, this
year, 1998.
Yes, friends,
my faith in Bob rings true.
Your arms will be like
mighty spider wings. You'll swim in
that pool of plasma. You'll swim
in that pudding like a piece of
cherry unctuousness in that
top of that scummy pie. The river
is rising!
And runs right through it.
Try to breathe.
Try to breathe.
Bob's got a life
preserver that he could go to. A river of slack
runs right through that
Brushwood Folklore Center.
And your hands
and his hands will
merge in the cosmos.
And your brain and his brain
will be one brain.
What the fuck, Jeff?
He's got the whole world in his
brain. He's got the whole world
in his brain.
What if there is a form of life in space?
Not on some planet, but
just drifting. Not life as
we know it. With intelligence, yes,
but pure energy with no organic
structure. Invisible. Invisible?
Now the rocket passed through its path. It
entered the rocket. It found living specimens
of our form of life. Cell
organisms. Humans, exactly.
Now, if even by accident
it could enter one of those structures,
what a way to invade
the Earth. Now look, sir, I'm not
over intelligent, but when you... You saw the film, you know
what happened. Holy God
knows where and how far that rocket traveled.
Something got into that rocket.
And it's found other forms of life.
The cactus.
You mean
Kuruza? The cactus. He's now in
the shell of the man being transformed.
If one of these cactus plants was subject
to the same mutation, there could be an affinity,
a union between plant and animal,
with the ability to destroy
and possess
and multiply.
An alien cannot invade
a dead man. We're merely using this
corpse for a demonstration of placement.
You ever been in a cockpit before?
No, sir, I've never been up in a plane
before. You ever
seen a grown man naked?
Shite. Oh,
X-Day, yeah.
I really don't care who's gonna be
playing. Well, what do you mean who's gonna play
Saturday night? There is no
Saturday night. There's no playing
neither. Friday morning at
7 a.m. forever
and ever and ever. Look at this nice
sunrise. Until the bulls come, yeah.
A little bit chilly. With their clubs
and their trenches. Forever and ever
and ever. Yeah, they're
gonna make us move to another camp, another X-Day,
further on down the line.
Frogs down in the pond
making their little sexy
sound. Enjoy the chirping while you can.
We'll be eating out of bean cans
five miles down the road, depending
on whether the pigs come or not. Friends, those of you
who've been to Brushwood,
I want you to listen to these sounds
and be ready for a lot more.
What they're doing is, it's these tiny little
frogs that live in the ponds
and they, as a mating
call, they stretch their little frog
penile cloacas
as far as they do and they
strum them. They pull them real
tight with one little forearm
and they strum them. Thus
the phrase, pluck your magic
twanger, frog.
Heard
in the background.
Oh man, we gotta get more of these frogs. Look,
they're glowing. Put them in the box here.
It always rains at X-Day. Make sure you
don't get out these things. And you end up
huddling under these teepees
and tents with the
pagans and the
subgeniuses. It's not gonna be my government truck. It's gonna
look like a regular truck. It's gonna be a
fucking thing. And that's actually where the
show is, friends. It honestly
is. They're sure there'll be some
preachers and some
bands and all
that stuff and a stage.
But when, really
the best part of X-Day
is when it rains and you're...
stuck
with someone you didn't know before.
A bunch of weirdos that you really
didn't want to get stuck with. There you are. You're
stuck with them under the trees or under
somebody's little tent.
Gotta share the same ovaries
and the same can of beans if you want to
get along with the flops. You're forced to deal
with the other subgeniuses.
It's long been raining down here,
Sporty. You're forced
into it. It's called
involuntary slack, friends, and sometimes
it's the best kind. Because you don't know
what slack is until...
But it could be something you never
heard of before. It could
be something you don't think
you want right now.
Like a job.
Can you believe there could be such a thing
as a slackful job?
Believe it or not,
there could be such a thing.
You don't know.
You don't know if it's gonna be good or
bad. You don't know if an asteroid's gonna
come flying out of God's
spitwild,
or if you're gonna win the lottery tomorrow.
You don't know.
Tomorrow may not be your tomorrow.
It may be someone else's today.
So you can either just
not find out.
There's only one way to do that.
That's to do like Man the Song says.
Just go ahead.
Jump off the bridge. Hey, you know,
somebody was saying,
Chaz, somebody said,
now if everybody jumped off a bridge,
everybody jumped off a bridge,
would you jump off a bridge too? And I said,
well, eventually,
probably would. You know,
after breaking into every drugstore
and robbing...
I think that's... Driving, you know,
wrecking Maseratis all day.
Well, by then you'd have a big pile of humans, and it
wouldn't be much of a jump at all. Right.
It would cushion you. So actually,
the idea's like moot, as they say.
Eventually. I'm thinking, you know,
after ten years, wouldn't you get tired
of being alone? You'd get lonesome.
You'd finally do what everybody else had done
and jump off the bridge.
I'm lonesome. If everybody jumped off the bridge.
I'm gonna jump off the nearest bridge. I don't know, really.
You know, if you could get your hands on a real doll,
you might...
You might idle your years away
in plastic splendor. Well, I mean, for a while.
That's why I say, eventually, you wouldn't
go, oh, look, everybody's jumping off the
cliff. Wait, are the other animals
still here, though? You'd let them jump off the
cliff. You'd go out and party.
You could use the animals as cushions, too,
along with the dead bodies. No, I'm not worried about cushions for the animals.
But... Why not? You're thinking about
love and tenderness, right? Yeah.
Well, I could go live with a bunch of chimps. Well, a corpse can be pretty tender
after it's decayed for a while. Yeah.
I'd just be their king.
I could be the chimp king. The king of the corpses? Oh, the
chimps. I thought you were gonna be
the necro-king of the corpses.
Yeah. Me, Chaz! Me, Vanovo King!
Five-finger man!
Yeah. So maybe
I would, you know, maybe I could make it
interesting. You know, a game of it, you know?
And sperm monkeys, the rest of your
poor existence? If the other animals were still here. But if the other
animals were not here, and you were
the only living...
The only sentient sort of thing.
Mammal, yeah.
Yeah, if the lizards were all here. That wouldn't be much
of a party if you were the only sentient mammal
on Earth.
That would get even the lowest dog
lonesome. That's terrible
to think about. In fact, why did you
bring up such an ill prescription to begin with?
Eventually you'd jump off the cliff, too.
Eventually. Might be twenty years.
Thirty years. So, I'd get an AK-47
and, like, do target practice on the corpses,
like, for jokes and stuff, and wear their hats
and everything, and take pictures of them next to them.
And then they'd be close to me sitting in the chairs, you know?
I'd put my arm around them, you know?
But then they'd rot away. That would only last you a year or so.
Right. And then it probably wouldn't be too pleasant
if there'd be skulls. Then there'd be skulls.
Well, those would be fun to have bowling matches with
and, like, new ball games. With who?
Yourself. Don't get... Think of the internal
man, Chaz. You're so socially oriented.
It might be the best thing there is
to have. Wait, taps for the human race.
The Omega
man plays the bugle.
When 2-0-0-2
MN sister...
Sister meteor.
Eight times beside.
Slams into Earth
three weeks from now.
When he comes screaming out of the sunlight.
He's standing in that same position that he has been
for the last 25 years
since 9-1-1. Only the cockroaches will survive.
That fateful year, that fateful day,
that fateful morning.
And here comes the Corps of Engineers
to erect the dam now, the instant cookie.
And they're filling him up right away.
And there's the president off on his merry, merry way.
Another celebration
of America,
of our pride, and our true feelings
for ourselves,
as this day,
the 379,000th day
since the first day
that everything changed,
begins once again.
And you'll be
a fool to cry
on that day,
July 5th,
1998. There'll be no crying
on July 5th, 1998,
whenever that is coming up.
Coming up in 2002.
There'll be no crying
on that morning.
There'll be only happiness
as we all
take a dip in that pool,
baptize ourselves.
What about us fellows
in the detention center?
Are we gonna have an easy time?
We're dead, huh?
No pie in the sky for the detention center guys.
Are you afraid to die?
We're gonna dive in,
to plunge into the plasma bomb.
It's wrong
because there's nothing wrong with it.
It's fine.
It's wrong.
No, no, no.
It's wrong.
And when did you become aware?
About five years ago.
Uh huh.
What happened five years ago?
Came to know the Lord.
Oh,
how special.
So,
back then, five years ago,
at that time,
Intense, intensified
smell.
It intensified, right.
Yes. Right.
Did your life intensifying?
I became kind.
That's wonderful.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Well, we're gonna see about that.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna
Bible, right?
Now, oh, but,
Okay.
Okay.
What we can do is we can do it in things
we as adults
or let the

At the end
never experienced love or friendship or formed any lasting or constructive relationship.
But today at last they will become a part of something. They will belong. They will
come a little closer to their unrealistic dreams of power and glory. Today finally they
will join the stupid ghastly tragic church of the subgenius. Please remove your jackets
and roll up your left shirt sleeves. Yeah, yeah mate. My spaceship's pretty cool. My
spaceship is. My pleasure vessel is very pleasurable. And now it's all over.
It's all over now. There is no more earth. Heavy as God. The earth has been burned to
a cinder. All their little wars are as nothing compared to what the exes done to them.
But you know I kind of miss the old gal, the earth, now that it's gone. I've preserved
a few chunks. Chaz, did you know over on my pleasure vessel I kept a couple of that big
museum from Amsterdam. I was over there playing golf the other day. Yeah. Did you notice I
got the Grand Canyon? That's a great, yeah. Nobody else even thought about that. Oh, I
thought about it, but damn, this one's cool too. Yeah, you've got those golf greens from
those fancy golf greens. Yeah, yeah. I've got those golf greens. I've got those golf
However renowned

know
that
cheese
pnk6
he's my navigator now
it's weird what some of the subgeniuses have done
I've noticed
when they suddenly for $30
had all the power in the world
could do anything they wanted
some of the most trivial crap
you know like beaming up all the
the old little Lulu comics
from the 40s
weird stuff like that
and other stuff got just completely
trashed on X Day
I'm sure I mean look at
there's just a cinder down there
and then we all got what we wanted
and burned the hell out of it
I just have a feeling a lot of people
are going to be going
oh damn I forgot my dog
oh my little brother
you're not really hearing this broadcast
either
it isn't happening
but hey isn't that
what
what
what
, isn't that an interesting thing though
that if you're in a band
that has a big influence on a generation
when you die
your music is emanating out from earth
at the speed of light
along with your spirit
yeah too bad you're not going with it
no you know that's if they leave the planet
I was thinking about that
when you said that earlier
I was thinking well
what if they don't leave the planet
what if all the spirits just stick around
that's a hell of a lot of ghosts
and think of the elephants
and the birds
and the blue whales
what about the great big things
where do they go
where do their souls go
when they die
one of the things
one of the things I have is
are they stacking up on the ocean
check this out
on my pleasure ship
every half hour or so
an F-16 does a flyby
and it's
it's like you gotta watch for it
it just kind of keeps you awake
where it comes from
oh man
what you guys
you're kind of low
isn't that cool
that was the actually supernatural shell
of one of those blue whales
in another dimension
so I think you're probably confused
in between the two of you
the two perceptual vacuums
I have guests in my pleasure vessel
I forgot to queue up for a CD
did anybody remember to save the whales
out of the four or five thousand subgeniuses
that happen to still have their membership cards
the next day
did any of them remember the whales
what about Legumes Ark
what about Legumes Ark
he took two of everything
only two
but it was stuff like leaves
and pieces of dead crayon
and stuff like that
I'm sure he's making
NAD's saute of each and every beat
he's taking away
rustic samples
of every type of pubic hair
ever invented
two of each kind
Frizzy
Will-o'-the-Wisp
Predronatoral
and
well there's the last Bengal tiger
and cricket expectorant
well there's the last white rhinoceros
mmm
boy these NAD's are good
what shall I have next
are you talking about goat vessels
are you talking about the
perhaps the drum
that might be used
to pronounce goat rhythms
like panwood
what would you
what would you
what did you bring with you
on next day
what did you
I brought a pair
I brought my own NAD's
my own NAD's
great
and that was two of every kind
I could think of
don't rub it in man
he's just
or one of every kind
it doesn't matter
he's such a
he's a flashy
or the number doesn't matter
he's got
his NAD's are the kind
the kind NAD's
the kind that makes
hamsters and rabbits
and small animals
run in disarray
the kind that makes
small mammals
cry
yeah
they have tear ducts
just like the rest of us do
when properly used
well
it could be
the last

last
but in the Mayan calendar
it's 2012
or is it 2002
and obviously
Charlie Manson

of pleasure vessel
besides the one you get from Bob.
Well, Bob cannot be trusted.
Manson was right, man.
Manson was ruptured.
Bob was Manson.
Manson's pleasure vessel
is just next door.
You want to go visit Charlie?
To Bob's?
He's weird, man.
They had him on some strange drugs
when he was in prison.
Well, I remember the Indians
used to try and drown
his pronouncements out
when he would send letters
to the family
over the audio and video wave
the Indians next door
would go hi-yi-yi
until the evil spirits
went down the toilet.
Charlie was weird.
Charlie was real weird.
He fell in with a bad crowd.
Those silly girls.
There's a lot of bad crowds
going around.
Think of the Japanese now.
They've invented a way
that they can hear with their skulls
and you don't need your ear tools.
No, that was in the old world, Dave.
The world is gone.
X-Day happened hours ago.
The world that has left
our memories.
He doesn't remember anything.
That's what he forgot.
To bring with him is memory.
Dave, did you get ruptured
without that one brain cell of yours?
You mean this is the day
after the day
after the day
after the day
after the day?
Damn.
Where do you think
Chaz got all those jets?
The sleeping voice.
Think he's been saving up
from his rock and roll professor job?
As he's first asleep.
Buying jets?
Or the audience.
I got the audience, too.
Those are some realistic clothes
you've got down there
to worship your ass, Chaz.
The windows.
You're really into that
rock star thing, aren't you?
Yeah, every day.
The golf playing rock star.
It's a stadium concert every day.
You always wanted to.
I got all the good rock stadiums.
Which one is this?
And Bob Dylan.
This is Wimbledon, right?
Did you bring Bob Dylan?
Yeah.
Yeah, man.
One of the first dudes I snagged.
Everybody to get on board.
It's the day.
Yeah.
To the day.
It's the end of the lifetime.
When I'm twilight blood.
Black and easy was the first.
Now he's all black and blue.
It's been a hard climb up that Route 61.
Revisit you one more time.
You know, my students,
just last week,
before this all happened,
we were watching all the 60s stuff.
Berkeley in the 60s
and all the different
kind of culture movement
and civil rights movement and stuff.
And a student come in
just on the day before.
It's all happened and said,
I went home last night and read the paper
and was amazed that all this is still going on.
What's all this?
What did I just say?
The whole civil rights movement,
the women's rights, you know,
you've got fundamentalist Christians
getting together with people from Sudan and Libya
and Iran and Iraq to discuss anti-abortion laws
and stuff like that now.
So you've got religious nut cases from America
that George Bush has appointed
to some cabinet or another
meeting with nut cases from other countries
who are in the evil of access
to access of evil thing.
But don't dare.
But it's all over now.
Well, but the kids,
the kids thought that was important.
That stuff was still going on.
It not only did it,
man, it all,
it will air go on
and it never stopped
and it's been going on.
Take the blue pill
or the red pill.
Right.
Take the blue pill.
Around the block.
And hey, it just keeps going on and on and on.
Hey, I've been around the block.
Take the red pill.
It's all right, Ma.
I'm only crying.
And you'll get that shelter from the store.
There are a few small rocks.
I just want to encourage you to consider very carefully
what kinds of games and toys you play with.
I'm only saying this because I care about you.
Hmm.
That is pretty far fetched.
But Casey, how can we know what books we should read?
I'm glad you asked Bob himself.
We read the books we read.
Bob tells us to set any vile things before our eyes
and vile means Bob does.
That's right.
We allow things that are sinful into our minds.
Disobeying Bob is sinful.
So is hating other people
and doing violent things to hurt Bob.
There are many things that are sinful.
The point is, make sin look like a good thing.
Sin is disobeying Bob.
But it's not.
Now think carefully about how much sin is in Bob's.
Man!
You mean I have to worry about
They are Bob Doves.
I thought being a kid was supposed to be fun.
Bob can show you what kinds of things you should think about.
I want it.
Whatever is true.
Whatever is noble.
Whatever is right.
Whatever is pure.
Whatever is lovely.
Whatever is admirable.
If excellent or praiseworthy.
But it's not.
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, it's not.
So you mean that we should fill our minds with
They are Bob Doves.
Not things that are good and worthy of praise?
That's exactly right, Jimmy.
If we fill our minds with evil, good things will come out of us.
That's right.
I think that Captain Destructo or these wrestling shows are admirable.
And I think that they make Bob happy.
If any TV show or movie we want to watch has too much violence, we probably should watch it.
Oh.
The hero in that story uses evil magic.
Now you're starting to get it, Bobby.
That's right.
Whatever is true.
Whatever is noble.
Whatever is right.
Whatever is pure.
Whatever is lovely.
Whatever is admirable.
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, we should find something else to do instead.
What are you doing here?
I forgot the damn words, man.
It's funny how Dave's pleasure vessel looks like his car.
It's such a bell-like tone to his voice.
It looks like his dingy house.
It looks exactly like his car.
It looks exactly like his cruddy...
That's so many of them.
They could have an entire planet.
There's a dead Pinto in the backyard.
And it looks like their apartment all the way down to the spots on the ceiling, the coffee
stains on the carpet.
There's one of them fuzzy things on the toilet seat.
I know.
I can't believe you.
Picture Jesus with the eyes that follow you on the front.
Right underneath the bed, there's a lot of dead fuzzy socks and worms living alone.
The refrigerator's got a mind and a nervous system and a metabolic rate and a brain that







can't be helped.
And because of that, it's living on its own.
A lot of things are harbored in there beyond just your average shady terrorist tags.
We're talking about new, new weapons of mass destruction.
Now for our next experiment.
The current will flow unhampered and cause them to be electrocuted.
and the angels sing 1938 a little before my time

Why don't you go play some nice Keith Moon by himself in his underpants?
I love that kind of thing.
On next day, Keith Moon will rise again.
John Entwistle will rise again.
Hendrix will play.
Lenny Bruce will open the set with some light humor.
My friend Janice Johnman will sing.
Jim will sing.
John will sing.
That's right.
We're out of here.
We're out of here.
We'll leave the orchestra playing.
Bob!
We're on the run now, baby.
Earth is long gone.
It's long.
Cinder down to nothing.
It looks like there's perhaps a million of them.
I didn't bring Bruce, but I did get Clarence.
They're okay.
Torches, flashlights.
I got the sax player.
I didn't take Bruce, but I got his sax player.
Some of them are waving the peace with no dignity sign.
Others are just waving themselves goodbye.
I remembered Willie Nelson.
It's our, their, his, she, his's, their, its last day here on this place.
Soon to find another freaking place.
Some freaking, freaking, freaking place.
I remembered Bruce Dern.
I remembered.
I remembered.
I remembered, um, Tali Shavales.
Not only Tali Shavales, but, uh, Akim Tamaroff.
Do you remember Akim Tamaroff?
You remember the first day?
Boris Karloff.
Vincent Price.
They'll make movies again, friends, on the escape vessels of the six goddesses.
Eddie Munster.
Jesus Christ, our famous horror star.
Alfred Hitchcock was your favorite horror star.
Willis O'Brien will animate King Kong on the best computer stuff you ever saw.
Uh-oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nothing but mountains and seas and fields of dead birds.
And thousands of decapitated heads.
It's a sight for sore ears as you soar over the backgammon game.
And thousands of other penalty parts played out beneath you.
It's the way you wanted it.
Lots of death and destruction.
No dirty fingernails.
Keep going.
Breathing free, light and easy.
And make it your way all the freaking way out of freaking, freaking, freaking.
I'm sorry, Diane.
Diane, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you.
Yeah, we got our magic bus.
We gotta make the tissue.
We gotta make the tissue.
Did you get your magic bus?
Are you gonna be there?
I got my magic bus.
I'm there, baby.
I'm there.
I'm there, baby.
July 5th, 2002.
It's time I go for a magic bus.
For a magic bus.
Double, double, double dot subgenius dot com.
You're either on the saucers or you're off the saucers, friends.
Get on the magic bus.
Either you're with us or you're against us.
Come by foot.
Come by airplanes.
Come by balloons.
Come by any method, canoes, any means possible.
But make it on down there sometime because you're not going to want to miss the final end of the world.
You're gonna have a party coming to you.
You can just tell them about it.
You can't incite to action.
Okay.
You can't say, get there, go there, take whatever you can.
That's commercial radio, right?
Yeah, right.
Come on down.
Yeah, right.
You can't do that.
But you can do, think about actually being there.
You can do, and your body might follow.
Think about actually being there.
Remember, this is the realm of the psychic.
It is in the landscape of possibilities for you to present your fantasy.
It is in the landscape of possibilities for you to present your fantasy.
We are visiting, again, you can do this, you have only this, you've got the opportunity to present.
A physical self at Brushwood Folklore Center next weekend.
Not this one, next one.
And what a sumptuous landscape it could possibly be on your mind's left eye.
A physical self at Brushwood Folklore Center next weekend.


Just think of all the naked women which might be there.
Just think of all the naked women which might be there.
Think of all the horrifically stupid parties you'll go to and take too many drugs and get
confused and walk around for hours and feel very tired and then wake up and then stand up
and...
You need food, man.
I gotta get some food because maybe...
I need water is probably what I really need to try.
We got to go.
We'll see you later.
That's it, Gil.
Do you have a cigarette?
It goes out like that.
Not with a bang, but with a whimper.
Oh, that.
Keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the wind.
You're sacking the saddle.
See y'all.
Get that sack to Princess Wayne.
Ha!
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.
We'll see you later.






Next year, I want more.
More flirting.
More time off.
More money.
You'll be under constant surveillance.
If you see anyone unknown to us
or contact anyone
for any reason whatsoever,
you will be murdered.
We'll meet again at midnight.
