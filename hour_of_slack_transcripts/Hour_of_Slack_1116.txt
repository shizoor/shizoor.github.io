Look! No, I won't. Listen, you can't make me...
Step aside, open wide.
What?
It's the Longer Lift.
Yes, sir.
The Longer Lift was a madman.
Maybe.
Yes.
The Longer Lift, the heavy subterranean temple of the sun.
Oh, my arm. Oh, he plugged me right in the arm.
That was your fault.
Well, they'll all return to their homes and live normal lives again.
Oh, that's bad.
I'll be right back.
Longer Lift!
And what does that mean?
Uh-oh, excuse me. What's the matter?
Bet you we got the same old malarkey.
What's that?
Well, oh, wait a minute.
The Soul Genius.
Oh, good.
Power of Swatch.
God, listen to him.
It's the same old...
stuff, all right.
Well, you practically can't resist it.
Good for you, too.
Yes, but free speech means the right to tell lies.
Shut up.
What?
Shut up.
Well, that's strange.
You're telling me.
Very strange.
Why, yes, sir.
Well, okay.
But something tells me we're in for trouble.
Bad trouble.
Have you ever opened your mind
with the sound of acts concerning U.S. foreign policy,

I thank your Whioni
Thank you
Gas Chamber.
Gang, I'm here to frighten you.
My only purpose in telling you about accidents in the home
is to touch firearms that may be found in your home.
And, if possible, to help you touch any medicines
unless they're administered by an adult.
And to help you climb in or out of your tub
simply by coating the underside with a slip-proof material.
And here's something else.
Play safe by putting a rubber mat in the windows
unless they're adults present.
Because an invisible dry rot has weakened the windows.
Another important thing to remember is never,
and I mean never, be smart, play safe.
That can be prevented by something that seems to be the right thing,
but turns out I was loaded.
And I mean that.
So that you may remain alive and poisoned.
I stood behind her looking at the pink, fresh doll
that had been tossed out in the rain.
Oh, Bob!
Is he here?
Of course not.
He'd been drinking heavily.
He's wandering Chicago somewhere right now.
Oh, no.
It seemed cultured.
Why, Bob, what are you doing here?
You know it's not right.
No, no, I don't want him in here.
I don't want him in here.
I'll have to get rid of Bob and get some things done.
Of course.
Bye.
When we left there, he was wearing a big, toothy smile
as if he was trying to pick up a few bucks with a toothpaste ad
that reminded you of a furnace full of marshmallows.
His eyes were open, and he looked surprised like a baby,
and I said,
Stale beer.
I'd like to kill you.
I'd like to kill you.
Truth is fiction.
And this is Be Orbit, Be Not.
The Curtis family of London sure have a lot of lip.
After some time, the overgrowth of lip becomes so enormous
that the lower lip, which had been driven into the heart of a suicide,
took root and grew into a tree.
Be Orbit, Be Not.
General Townsend of London gave the Indians their first taste of fire water.
A good time was had by all until September 25th, 1927,
when some girls referred to the island as the place of drunkenness.
Be Orbit, Be Not.
When people say you're bright, they mean you've used drugs.
They mean you've changed their brain.
They mean you've...
Waste your brain.
For information, call 666.
All radio is dead.
Which means that these tape recordings I'm making are for the sake of future history.
If any.
Future history, I said.
Aren't you a little old for those things?
Yes, any.
Match.
The Martians can conquer the Earth in six days.
Is that...
the same number of days it took to create it?
But it's...
magic.
Ye god!
What a splendid idea.
Lead the way to Lilac Park, Ant-Man.
Yes.
Lead the way.
We all pitched in.
You won't regret this, Bertie.
Please lead the way.
We all pitched in.
I can't remember Lilac Park.
Is that near the zoo?
Or is that the place where they hung that child back in 1972?
That was the Hour of Slag.
Slag.
Slag.
Slag.
That you're thinking of.
And dear friends, this is the first time we've been...
in the studio.
The live WCSB studio.
And our ovarian glands are busted...
In the most longest while.
...while.
Ah, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's so good to hear...
hear those headphone-boosted timbers...
Sure, Stanley.
...and splinters off of my wooden...
...my wooden...
...my face and voice.

Ah, it's so good to be here.
It's so good to be in one place...
Princess Wee...
...Wee Eye are both here.
...wee eye are both here.
...are both here.
...are both here.
...are both here.
Well, I...
...I...
...have some weird, weird, weird stuff to play.
...have some weird, weird, weird stuff to play.
Well, I...

It's playing in the background.
Our old friend, the subgenius saint...
My...
...Byron Werner...
...does a radio show at a station...
...Byron Werner...
...in Little Rock, Arkansas...
...where he lives now.
He does a radio show there called Rural War Room.
Now, is he a rural dweller?
Does he live out in the sticks, so to speak?
No, he lives in Little Rock, it's per se...
No, he lives in Little Rock, it's per se...
...oh, he lives in Little Rock, per se.
But to some people, that is rural.
Even the big city of Little Rock is considered hick town by some people.
Well, I thought he lived in one of those bedroom communities,
which consists of nothing but a bedroom out in the middle of the wilderness.
I think he lives in one of those coffin hotels.
Oh, well, those are popular now, too,
but I think they're not going to make as much money as they expected
because nobody's going for the vampire routine.
But if you were interested in Byron and Donovan Seward's rural war room,
at yahoo.com would be the place to contact them,
ruralwareroomatyahoo.com.
Now, Fernanda and Andy Lemur, and separately,
the good or bad, Norrell Preff did the collages
that took up the first part of the show,
and there's a lot more.
All of these collages that I have set up for this particular show
are sort of on the subject of brain damage.
Brain damage, indeed.
Now, you said these were not going to be collages,
but actual colostomies.
Right, these are colostomy.
These are parts that were removed from the artists and the cut-up,
the engineers that do these radio cut-ups and colostomy collages.
So it's a form of plagiarism or theft?
Well, we like to call it culture jamming.
That's what the modern-day art thief or art bum refers to.
Also, yogurt.
When you take other people's material and chop it up
and make it sound even worse than it already did.
Culture jamming, i.e. yogurt.
They do that to us.
I mean, every now and then I'll hear somebody has done that to us.
They chopped us up and spewed us all over their product.
And usually when you're...
Chopped up, dear friends,
they leave different parts in different places
so you can never be put back together again.
So if you expect one cogent thought from what you've heard from yourself,
don't expect it to happen again because it's just kind of a lead-on.
This whole particular episode of the show
is probably just going to be one non-cogent thought
that kind of snowballs along,
gathering moss and crud
and imagined paranoia.
It's going to be a lot of weird fantasies
as it drags its sorry butt across the airwaves.
I'm afraid that's what's happening right now.
This show is dragging its heavy, sack-laden butt across the airwaves.
There is synchronicity in this world and many others
if you just keep your eyes on the skyrocket.
Look over here on the left.
There's also a little, little, little, little, teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny man
living in a...
any tiny matchbox house.
Look in there.
There's a television set and a computer screen
and a radio and a phone.
It can hardly...
Can you live like that without a television set, though?
Don't you pretty much have to have a TV?
You must have some for a screen.
You cannot breathe without a screen.
It's all right.
Where do you get for it?
How could you loom?
If you don't have a screen, how are you going to loom, man?
How are you going to zoom in?
How are you going to zoom in?
Zoom in.
Zoom in.

Zoom in.
Zoom in.
Zoom in.



Zoom the lumen and...
Never wake up again.
Yeah.
A computer.
A computer is like a TV set now.
Floating in the darkness.
Little heads giving you commands.
You can hear them.
An influencing box the size of a shrunken skull.
And it makes a shrunken skull.
It makes you into a shrunken head.
Your head isn't physically smaller, but the inside...
Excuse me.
...actually becomes bigger because it has more empty space.
The more television you watch.
Because the TV is actually sucking your brain out.
You're placing your brain cells right now one by one.
And here's the first jump to its...
It's trading you entertainment for brain cells.
And that's what we're doing too, except that it's not that entertaining.
So we...
That's why we don't have many brain cells.
It's a vicious circle, you might say.
But as you breathe more cells in your mind,
then you have more brain cells.
You'll see the enrapturing comes.
And they all must become part of the great design.
You must buy.
You must live and breathe and think and do and be and be and be and be.
Along these lines...
We stayed at a cool B&B the other day.
...and for you...
It had that B virus.
The B&B virus that is causing B&Bs all over the country to close down and disappear.
Fly away.
They just disappear and never come back.
I thought that was the unremoved underwear of the elderly.
What? There was...
A fractious moment.
I get confused because there's so much news, you know.
We do have news, don't we?
I think it's better to cut this news up before it's even snouted out.
Oh, there is so much news.
There's just an overflow of news.
Well, we have a great source for news, which is ModaMac's Bulldada News Blog.
Dear friends,
if you've never checked this out on the internets, as they call them now,
you can go, if you're curious, to a place called modamac.com.
And he has a news service that is only the weirdest and most bulldada news.
There's another news service called signsofwitness.com
that our friend, Reverend John Shirley, has helped inspire.
But these are...
And that collects really scary news.
And it's a story about signs of the end times
that pretty much convinces you that the world is about to come to an end.
But this is all verifiable information.
The human world.
Is it not verifiable, real news?
Well, no, he actually throws in...
John, signsofwitness.com throws in special reports that he gets from anonymous people
that are really scary sometimes.
But he also uses, you know, the usual paranoid...
And what's the worming, earthworming that is going on and...
Signs of...
Well, just signs of crime and sickness and depravity.
But if he's getting...
Abomination!
But if he's getting inside information from a certifiable schizophrenic,
does he or does he not realize that one of the symptoms of schizophrenia
is the attending of secret meetings, the possession of secret papers,
the understanding of secret items, which no one else understands.
Well, speaking of which...
He does know that, doesn't he?
Yeah.
He, she, it...
Doesn't he know it?
Yeah, he does.
He does give you a fair, you know...
Warning that he was taking liberty...
Yeah, take it with a thumb in your butt.
Yeah, in your butt, yeah.
So, now...
But that reminds me, Alex Jones...
The Lady Liberty.
Our rival conspiracy kook...
That put him in the...
Alex Jones was arrested.
The Lady Liberty.
We saw this on the Bull Dada News blog.
It came from infowars.com.
Where it says...
The Lady Liberty.
Which is the site of prophecy.
Yes, it's a news flash, actually.
It's...
Alex Jones arrested by NYPD.
And it's...
Yes, it's very current here.
September 8th, 2007.
Media activist Alex Jones was arrested by New York Police Department officers
while filming a documentary about the sixth anniversary of September 11th
and joining the protest against the official version of what happened on 9-11.
According to Infowars sources, Jones was singled out by police from the head of a crowd
of about 400 9-11 Truth activists and protesters.
Hmm.
Heard in the background.
Some machines are made up of hundreds of...
He was verbally accosted and forced by the police officers to present identification,
which he was not carrying at the time.
...simple machine.
NYPD officers arrested Jones for unspecific charges and removed from the protest crowd.
The protest crowd is now in the area where he is currently.
Rob Jacobson, camera operator on Jones' documentary production crew,
indicated that a large portion of the protest crowd has moved to the precinct
where Jones is being held to ensure his fair treatment and safe release.
Some say Smith, some say Jones.
Either one, strip the flesh from your bones.
Beach party!
Some genius beach party!
Okay, here's the big problem with those days.
Some genius beach party!
These guys think they run the whole show, the Globemakers,

and the Goblins are taking over at the same time.
Well, he does speak the truth in some ways for a person who's very interested in his own career,
but I wouldn't add that because that's wrong to say that.
Well, you have to be interested in your own career to keep getting the message out.
I've been amazed.
That guy used to have to drive around in Austin with a bullhorn,
like a subgenius on a golf cart at X Day, you know,
preaching to whoever happened to be mowing their lawns.
And he changed that into a shtick now.
Right.
He's a real-time showbiz now.
And he's also picking up a lot of AM and FM stations with his straight-up conspiracy stuff.
Right.
Which is mostly documented stuff.
And friends, we actually recommend that you check out crazy men like the great Alex Jones.
And what's that really ridiculous one, the Rents.com?
God!
John from Ohio is also enlightening.
Have you ever heard of the character known as John from Ohio?
No, I know of Kurt from Tallahassee, though.
He's an elderly fellow who probably a union strong left background and stuff.
Well, he calls up programs across the country, and he's a full-
John from Ohio?
Yeah, that's his tag.
Oh, I guess all the prostitutes know him.
Now, hey, speaking of Johns, there's a John from Detroit, John Sinclair,
the famous old radical that went to prison and Abby Hoffman got kicked off the stage at Woodstock yelling about it.
Yes, he was the manager of the MC5 and a general activist, a thorn in the side of whoever's in charge.
He's been living in Amsterdam for the last couple of years.
He has a radio show on Radio Free Amsterdam, and we're going to go and be partying with him.
Get off of here!
And doing shows.
And please don't return.
Yeah, we're going to do shows with him at the Amsterd, the Subgenius Frop Cup, which is like a week-long event that coincides with the High Times Cannabis Cup.
No, this is just-
We're interested in frop, you understand, friends, not cannabis.
But it's a great audience because those stoned hippies will buy anything.
Just anything.
And so we'll be preaching the word of Bob.
Dr. Howell's going to be there, thanks to Roknar, who sponsored Dr. Howell.
And we're going to be hanging out.
We get to take over the milkweg during the days because Sarah Seeds is, I guess, sponsoring that or something.
I don't know.
When is it?
It's in November.
Oh.
Sort of the middle of late November, yes.
Yeah, it's going to be a busy November for subgeniuses.
Besides Kennedy Day, we have Baltimore Devival on, I believe, the 6th or the 10th.
I can't remember which.
It's a Saturday anyway.
In Baltimore with Reverend Carter LeBlanc and Pisces and amino acids.
It'll be like an indoor X Day.
Maybe we can drag Dave down there.
Who knows?
Yeah!
I used to love Baltimore.
It's like you'd have to drive is the problem.
It would be a long November drive and not good weather.
And then after that we have to drive to Holland, right, and do that cannabis cup.
All that yacking.
Howell is a...
It's on the foreskin hydrofoil, though, and you get there very, very quickly, at least if you're into rock, sock, rap or jazz.
Don't count the X's on the back of your eyes as any indication of anything spectacular.
I saw that Triple X movie, so it's real easy to get to Amsterdam.
That's the symbol of the city.
The logo of the city is three X's.
Do you click your little wooden shoes together three times and say there's no place like the Vondelpark and the Rijksmuseum?
Which I have dibs on, by the way.
When X Day comes, the aliens take us up.
Us dues-paying subgeniuses.
Not you, listener.
Us dues-paying subgeniuses.
They take us up.
We get powers to teleport parts of the earth that we want to preserve, such as...
And these are mine, so don't even try.
Let's not get in a fight on X Day.
I've got the Rijksmuseum, the Grand Canyon, and...
Oh, I know, Monument Valley.
Monument Valley.
That's right, Monument Valley.
Bryce Canyon.
I heard that you were renting the...
Is there anything you want us to save you out of Nigeria, Charleston?
Winning...
Screamers.
The end of the anthology.
Well, that's what I'm hoping.
I'm hoping that...
There's no memory at all.
I'm hoping there's no memory at all, but apparently there is a lot of memory if you
become a subgenium.
Well, we're talking about when the world ends and those who believe in Bob are lifted up
into the flying saucers.
Well, why is it so important to believe in him anyway?
Oh, you don't have to believe if you just spend the 30 bucks.
God, we don't...
Why would you believe that stuff?
Well, of course...
Except to get on board those saucers in case they're there, you know.
So there is some documentation.
We're not telling people not to believe.
We're not telling people not to believe in other things.
We always suggest that people repent on your deathbed.
Always be ready to repent on your deathbed and, you know, repent of your sins just in
case.
You don't know.
What if the Southern Baptists are right?
I think that's a silly idea.
Well, one of those religions is bound to be right.
What if it's Church of the Subgenius?
Wouldn't that be ironic?
If you had to...
But that would be the perfect irony, see?
The Lord obviously has a sense of humor.
It's time to step right up and enjoy yourself any way you possibly can.
And here's your little booklet.
Sit right down.
I'd be surprised, frankly.
The first thing you're going to be in the gardening is hydroponic Buddhism.
Now, to repent in hydroponic Buddhism, the first thing you have to do is take off your shoes.
Now, remove those devices from your ears.
There's nothing else you want to hear right now.
What's that?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Okay.
Hydroponic Buddhism.
Same, too.
Hydroponic Bouddhism.
See, there's another one.
We just invented another religion.
It's Bouddhism.com.
I got dubs on that.
Better file that domain name real quick.
Well, speaking of Bouddhism, here's just a one-liner news item for you.
The British fashion industry will come under fire this week for failing to send a strong
message out to women who are not ready to wear their best clothes.





Listen to this news arc.

I knew there was a size 1, which I thought was really funny, since I'm size 12.
I Irish, good.


It's確 tree here.
Thank God.
are ghosts, right? Spirit beings
that are modeling clothes.
I can't think what else it means.
I mean, it could mean really, really...
It is undefined.
In mathematics, they would say it is undefined
or undefinable. When you multiply anything by
zero or zero divided by anything
is undefinable because it comes out
zero because...
But they could be like .0001
size
models on those runways.
I would say that a size zero is probably the women that look
basically like a skeleton with skin
laid over it. Well, I guess I must
be a size 12
fan.
You look like a swashbuckling
300-pound giraffe
wearing probably one of those
ska necklaces from the early
1970s or 60s
and probably
carrying a goot of cheese at your side
whistling to small children
and also some of the elderly
Danes of the neighborhood who have
given you their private
jellies that they store
in the...
And those private jellies are available
at the county fair here, heard in the
background at Denton,
Texas. This is
Brave Combo
in the background. I hadn't heard
from those guys in years. I used to, when I
lived in Dallas, we ended
up doing shows and things
and protests.
The Brave Combo and Church of the
Subgenius were the only two Dallas
bands that would show up at the
Rock Against Reagan
stage outside the
Republican National Convention in Dallas.
How about that?
With the Dead Kennedys. I didn't know who the hell
the Dead Kennedys were at the time.
At the time, neither did they, especially after the assaults
by the Comodos. They knew who we were! That was the
weird thing. Jello Biafra,
I guess it was him, came up and said
that they were into Bob from
San Francisco. And Bob was the
coolest thing in the world in
San Francisco for about
six months in 1984.
Which is a microsecond in the
fame meter of the
overall. It was enough that the Dead
Kennedys loved Bob. But I
had not, since I lived in Dallas,
I didn't know who the... I knew they were
a band that Philo liked and
hung around with. Philo used to
go to Dobstown. He got to go to all those
parties. Well, that's how he
wants to... I never got to do any of that stuff,
really. So you didn't
have the multi-similar and
the convergence accident that
Philo did where he lost his
hairy spleen? Is that
what they call the organ? No, but what I did,
I had...
Bob, you know, had visions in the hospital
after he had undergone a hernia
operation. And I wanted to be like Bob
so much that I
deliberately gave myself a hernia
and went in the hospital to
get a hernia operation.
And that was how... what a devoted
Bobby I was. I was like the first
Bob.
I wasn't really...
Actually, I think Henry Kissinger may have
been the first because Bob knew Kissinger
in the
early 50s.
So now you're saying Kissinger and
Bob gave you an early artificial
kidney hernia or
whatnot? No, I was just imitating Bob.
I was just being a fanboy of
J.R. Bob Dobbs. So you were
just being like a Bobby and suddenly
a hernia popped from your abdomen?
I wanted to have visions.
I heard that if you were in the hospital,
for a hernia
operation and
cornea licking, then you would
see Bob.
And I wanted to
see Bob. So why did
you not? I'm just
asking you. I did, sort of. This is
a commonly prescribed way
of reaching that goal. I had a
trans... I had a
transcendental experience,
yes.
Giant nurses came and
injured me, did things to me.
And that's good enough? Yeah.
Yeah. Except for if, like, there are
like nurse diesel types.
Remember when they named them after trucks
and things?
The nurses? No, no, no, no, no.
Ratchet. Nurse Ratchet. I remember
her. I had her for years.
No, she was named after a tool. Some of them
are named after trucks and stuff like
that, like Nurse Sonoma.
Nurse... Oh, I was
thinking of the Partridge family being
incinerated by that crazy guy. Never mind.
I guess.
This is your old friend Tom Weasel here,
with his kitchen and some time,
checking on some hot and groovy jazz,
and we'll sit right back and have a
car mania at that part.
Though I'm afraid not.
Not that part of my brain, no, but
you can come on in, sit right
down and relax.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!









Ow!
Ow!
One, uh, piece of
one of the particular article I was interested in
was, uh, I think it was
3,000 quarts and very
overst страшion.
And I think if you lost yourself somewhere, you could probably find your way back just by using these common pieces of articles of faith here.
I don't know, strewn out on the floor.
The first one is by Reverend Reverend... No, it's by the Princess Weir... No, no, wait.
It's by Harriman B. Tuckerwood.
By Pinkerton.
I figured my personal privacy I dropped on Spadnagate was because his breast was moated in his shoe pocket and left.
Crumbling, knobby, ramshackle, leaky, bobbing, huge, creaking, grimy, greasy grasshoppers.
I would like to see the wedding.
Oh, I'm... I'm... I'm... Oh!
Because Odiperl just swiped.
You knew no one.
No one, you know.
No.
Outside, Dr. Hunt, I'll be dating anything I'd sell anything's correct.
It was Jason that compared like a book was a pet that was the oil well of this Hollywood.
The change still was flat when you let them hide out in quiet.
I've been hunting wetbacks for two months.
Hide!
Hey, wake up in there!
Who is it?
Drug addict.
Drug addict?
Just a minute.
What do you want?
Narcotics.
Not for me, but I beg for my kid.
You won't have to.
We'll see if we can get you some drugs.
Diego?
Go ahead, senor.
Come on, give me the stuff.
Man was a drug addict.
He's probably just as well off dead then.
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.
Oh, then it's all gone.
Well, yeah.
Thanks to my old life Diehardże.
Durge!
I hope you enjoy the Vogue stage for getting your future right.

Hey, thanks a lot, dude

But it is better than any sound you've heard before
It's more brain damaged
And that's our theme for tonight
Is Dane Bramagers
And isn't it quite a wonderful, wonderful thing we do
When we scrape the insides of our skull
And we lift our pineal glands
Our little third
Or however many
Our little, little tiny micro-eye
Our internal eye
Towards the idea of Bob himself
Itself, itself
Yes, you look up to Bob
But not just with your normal eye
You've got to get in discernment
In the spirit
In the vision
So that you whiff-read his
His presence-ship
His divine presence-hood-ship
Through your third eye
Or your third nostril
You cast a disparaging expression
In his general direction
And everything comes to a halt

And everything comes out in a flash-read
Backwards
It's immediately accessible and available for you
And that's why we recommend that
Most of you out there
Begin the silence now
Now, the silence is
A vast ocean
It's a big place
And you'll probably get lost
You need to be told what to do
Now pay attention
Now listen to me
When I say the words
You hear that, kids?
You got it?
You got the instructions?

Catchy passage
From the Gospel of Matthew
Saying, do not worry about your life
What you will eat
Or what you will drink
Nor about your body
About what you put on
Is life not more than food
And the body more than clothing?
Don't worry about eating
And all that other stuff
Or your job or anything
Because God's more important
Apparently the head of the
U.S. federal government agency
That doles out benefits to disabled veterans
Is under fire for saying
Bible study is more important
Than doing my job
Yes friends
Veterans for Common Sense
And Military Religious Freedom Foundation
Demanded an investigation
Of Daniel Cooper
President
Bush's Undersecretary
For benefits at the
Department of Veteran's Affairs
And they complained
Because Cooper was
Appeared in a fundraising video
For the evangelical group
Christian Embassy with a using of an isolated website

a bunch of other Bush higher-ups.
We're very concerned about this because hundreds of thousands of veterans
are waiting for their benefits while Cooper himself says that promoting his religion
is more important than helping the veterans.
Since Cooper was appointed head of the Veteran Benefits Administration,
the numbers of veterans waiting on their disability claims has doubled since 2002.
On average, a U.S. war veteran must wait six months for an answer to their application,
and it can take up to three years.
Also, VA hospitals and clinics and so forth report that more than 52,000,
52,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
But under Cooper's leadership, less than half of those veterans were approved for disability compensation.
The group is also upset that Cooper gave his top aide a $33,000 cash bonus
while the claims backlog grew larger for the actual veterans.
He's prostituting his position.
He could have done just as poorly, says this guy,
as he's done by sticking a German shepherd or a cactus on that job.
So, friends...
Truth is stranger than fiction.
Yeah, there's this Bible beater who's apparently beaten off Bibles
instead of making sure that those poor devils coming back from the meat grinder
get their hospitalization and their pills paid for.
They ain't got no pills, friends.
They don't have the good pills.
I mean, okay, they did go and volunteer for the worst job in the universe,
but they did their job.
Got shot up, beat up, traumatized.
Now they should get the good pills.
General Pirate...
Look what happened to Dave.
Dave is a good example of what happens when you don't get the good pills
and can only get the bad, bad pills.
Talk to Tony.

from a bad bowel movement,
an incorrect thought,
or a trick around the corner.
This is what we believe.
Uh, I think it's...
Is that what we believe?
Uh, I believe...
Yeah, look at my script says...
No, no, I answered your question.
We have to believe.
It is what we believe.
This is what we believe.
Friends, do you believe that's really Osama bin Laden on that new tape?
Well, according to this, uh, kook site, rymph.com,
it can now be reported that that tape is fake.
As they've reported, Osama bin Laden's been dead for six years from kidney failure.
The new videotape was made in the 90s,
was dubbed and spliced with the assistance of the Israeli Mossad.
Copies of the fake tape were actually kept in a vault of Newsweek magazine for the last 30 days.
Item?
The 9-11 black op was originally staged for both political and economic objectives.
First, the current occupational government, the Bush administration,
needed to legitimize a stolen presidency.
Second, the 9-11 black op gave Bush group
executive emergency control over U.S. Treasury
and the power to devalue the U.S. dollar
and take control over private national security custodial accounts
which were under power of the attorney of Ambassador Leo Wanta.
Uh-huh.
Should Osama bin Laden's death be confirmed and certified by the U.S. government and media elite,
billions of dollars in the custodial account by contractual agreement
will revert back to the private corporation set up for the purpose of removing the Soviets from Afghanistan.

A Reuters report from the U.S. government.
A new report from Barcelona targeting the gay consumer
is proving lucrative for some businesses as gay Spanish entrepreneur Juan Julia has found.
But the potential of the pink dollar remains for many firms a missed opportunity.
Attitudes toward lesbian and gay advertising are changing
as more firms stop worrying about whether marketing specifically to gay consumers
could alienate the general consumer.
My friends,
Bob doesn't care what color your dollar is or your euro.
He wants your row.
He wants your dollar.
He wants it whether it's pink, green, or whatever color.
He doesn't care what gender you bent yourself into or out of.
He doesn't care about any of that.
He wants your love and your money.
It's love and money that's what it's all about, baby.
He wants you to believe in him.
Actually, he's not the answer, but neither is any of you.
He's not the answer to anything else.
And that's his whole point.
Well, one of his pointy little things, anyway.
Someone has to go let...
What's his pointy little thing?
We have to...
They're trying to break the doors down, friends.
They're trying to get in here.
They're gonna Koresh us.
They're gonna Jim Jones us.
But we're gonna get this message out.
Oh, thank God.
They're not gonna shut us up.
Thank Dubs, praise Dubs, that at least we're protected by...
The word Bob is gonna be broadcast in the...
...by those same gay paramilitary group that is protecting the pink dollar,
the fighting nectarines.
Just like little tiny peaches, they've surrounded the aura here,
and to me, it's quite a dismal aura.
It smells...
Oh, they smell better than most soldiers.
They smell so much better than the average soldier.
Well, of course they smell so much better than average soldiers.
But they're not average, and they're not real soldiers.
They're not even human beings as we commonly know human beings.
They're human beings as we uncommonly know,
fizzooks and zarbzins.
Have you never heard of these phrases or others?
Well, if not,
then please go examine yourself less lightly.
Take a look down there where it hurts,
and don't be afraid to measure the aura in the stinky parts.
Once you stand back three or four feet from the screen,
and take a good look at your skeleton,
you'll realize you're made for the company,
and there's more purpose in your life than you ever wanted.
Well, I...
Take more Pogro, take more Pogro.
What if a dog is misremembered to take on some contactless Pogro?
More people have let have cold, I'm quite Pogro.
More organ takes for more complete relief than ever
is had cold on the animal.
More Pogro.
More Pogro.

Not only will the contents of the one true pipe at last be told,
No, no, it won't be told. We're not going to tell that.
Go tell it on the mountain.
Stop censoring yourself, Vagina.
Don't you realize that every American's got a part to play in the big puzzle that's about to unfold?
Think of it.
You and your kids and my kids are all going to have kids someday.
Yeah, yeah.
And they're all going to carry weapons and different kinds of guns and things, see?
And they're going to go out and shoot bad guys and good guys and shoot them up real good, see?
Because that's the American way.
I'm sorry about my breath, honey, but it's something to do with...
Oh, yeah, that's okay.
The Department of the Interior.
Breath? Yeah, right.
Yeah, right. But it's not a secret anymore.
Well, anyway, you and your children and my children's children and Stang's replicants
and all the other people that resemble him, at least the ones, you know, the nano-churn,
and they're coming out and around, coming out and around, going to get guns and guns.
Even the old nanobots?
Oh, even the old nanobites and boxes.
They're all going to be wearing trunks, see?
Like huge trees.
They're going to shoot everything.
Everything in sight, because that's the American way.
Shoot them up, huh?
Shoot them up.
Take a look over there.
That's your target.
See that man with the sphincter on his head?
Yeah.
That's where I want you to point your finger.
Oh, okay.
Yes, right.
Point it right over there.
Okay.
Now lift up the hammer of the gun thing there.
This is scary.
I don't know a lot about it.
I don't know.
Is it too heavy for you to hold?
Yeah, it's kind of hard to hold, too.
Okay, well, put it up on this rock here.
Okay.
Some substandard item of furniture that we found.
Okay, here it is on the rock.
All right.
All right.
Okay, now put it up.
Put it up there.
Now look right through those sights.
See?
Yeah.
Yeah, when you find it across here, fire.
Oh, wait.
Pull the trigger three times.
No, shoot him.
Shoot him.
See, that's the American way.
See?
Stop crying, you little runt.
Listen to me.
America's not going nowhere.
I don't want to shoot him.
What would Bob Dobbs take of you?
Get over here.
Get over here.
Son of a...
Well, some kids don't want to live.
I'm not going to make it on the escape vessels.
They're not even going to make it out of here.
No.
They're not going to make it out of Dobbs Town.
Let's go to the beach, baby.

No, no, no.

And I guess it was a flying vessel.
A human blood vessel.
It was like a huge hematoid thing with flaps on it.
It came down and it was offering different things to different people.
You know, they could read its mind.
You think I'm lying.
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
You think I'm lying.
You think I'm crazy.
You bummed out yet, friend?
Sorry you took them drugs now, aren't you?
We knew you did that.
And we wanted to teach you a lesson before Satan gets a hold of you.
You think Bob's a bad trip.
Wait until you find Satan and Saddam Hussein together in your bedroom, my friend.
And hell.
Well, that was in that South Park movie.
Oh, yeah.
And so, friends, this is to let you know that we are serious about this religion thing.

Yeah, we love your money, too.
Yeah.
We like the Christian sweeties, too.

Thank you.
I.
Well, thanks to Byron Werner and his friend Donovan on the rural war room,
we have this background
of...
Man.
...that makes you feel like
you took too much
cold medication, doesn't it?
Byron, he the man.
Que bello bambino.

Oh, no.
World War Room.
He has horns.
He has a huge...
He has horns.
May I repeat?
The man has horns
where his neck should be.
And there's a giant diamond
in between his eyes.
As, of course,
it's like the old days.
We used to have
as many subgeniuses
talking on one mic as possible.
That was in the days
before we got deaf
and couldn't distinguish
between the various human voices,
the voices in our heads,
the...
The legal we.
The tinnitus.

The recorded voices.
And the World War Room

Dame F. Pistol
would like an evening's auction
in spanky remarks with you.
Dearest Mr. Reverend Ivan Stang.
Take a letter.
Mrs. Pistol.
Yes, yes, yes, sir.
Dear Ivan Stang,
as a member of the Peerland
and as strong supporter
of the Conservative Party,
I believe that your church
is a cult
and as such would like
to invite you to our annual
Pink the Ticky Whistle
and Stink the...
No, no.
Pink the Stinky Whistle.
That's pink.
It's pink.

Pink the Stinky...
Pink the Stinky Whistle.
Are you taking...
Look, it's perfectly written
exactly as you've said.
Your writing is impossible to read.
I can read it.
No one else has to.
All right.
Pinky the Stinky Whistle.
Pink the Stinky Whistle.
And the Magic Cartwheel.

Which takes some, apparently,
to other dimensions,
but that's...
Mr. Stang...
Reverend.
Reverend, please.
Reverend.
Reverend Stang,
if you would attend this...
Debacle.
If you will attend this...

We would be pleased
to make you our favorite debutante,
debucly.
Pleased to make you...
Sincerely, I'm...
Sincerely, I'm...
Most Dame Queenie Bad Brux...
I'm up for any program.
Very good, sir.
Yes.
Whip it out.
Of course, whip it out.
We're ready to go.
Right.
We're ready.
I'd love to go to one of them
swinging, what do you call them, parties.
You know, they get the Hellfire Club.
They got the guys smacking each other
in the rump with the...
Really?
Well, yeah.
They get fried chickens and so forth.
And then they hang...
You're talking about the X-Day Drills,
aren't you?
Oh, man.
No, not the...
We're talking about the Nose Drills.
Well, that was an old tool,
but it did some good work for a lot of people.
We got more people...
We actually had more people at the Nose Drills
than we did at the X-Day Drills.
You had more people at the Nose Drills?
Yeah.
Well, you know, they wanted it removed
and they felt bad about how they felt bad.
So they had to have it done.
Friends, you're listening to Hour of Slack
number 1,116.
Yes, there's 1,116 hours of Slack.
Actually, there's probably a dozen or more of those reruns.
But they're only partially reruns.
And you can get more information
about Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius
from subgenius.com.
Subgenius, for you subgeniuses,
is not spelled with an O.
There's not an O anywhere in subgenius.
But there is in .com.
And, of course, you can also write to us, friends,
and find out about whatever...
...else there might be available.

If I were a student of numerology,
I would notice that the 8 and the 1 and the 4,
and the number,
are probably the key to Steng's mind,
if you can call it a mind.
The 8, the 1, and the 4?
The 8, the 1, and the 4.
See, if you combine 8 and 1, it becomes 9.
Oh, we scrape a lot of this out of other people's minds.
Norrell Preff.
And this whoever that loop,
have an hour loop, or whatever.
God, I'll have to figure that out next show.
And Norrell Preff.
And coming up, friends,
we've got to get out of the studio
and make way for...
Noah's Ark, which is coming in next.
Christian Hour.
Yeah, the Christian Hour is next.
But we're about to hear a little bit of a clip
from Starwood about what really is in Bob's pipe,
followed by the Mondo Retardo band
live at X-Day.
Beat me to a pulpit.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Not only will the contents of the one true pipe
at last be told...
Psych!
Psych!
Well, it was just to get you in here.
We're not going to tell you what Bob...
Bob's smoking.
Everybody figures he's smoking frop.
And everybody thinks frop
is the subgenius cute term for marijuana.
No, frop,
habifropzipulops is the medical name.
It's an herb that grows
in Tibet,
only in the moonlight,
and only on the graves
of dead Tibetan holy men
or on the droppings of the Yeti.
And it's hard to get.
There was a movie made
sort of about it called
The Werewolf of London.
Back in the 30s.
But, no, most of the time, friends,
it's...
If you want to be literal about it,
Bob's really smoking this cheap stuff
he gets at Walgreens
called Borkham Riff Cherry Blend.
It's just these crappy pipes.
What your dad probably smoked
when he smoked a pipe.
But metaphysically...
Well, look at that.
I don't know if you can see this shirt here.
This describes it perfectly.
There's a brain at the end of this pipe.
But,
if you think about it,
the flame is up here.
It's almost as if Bob is the pipe
and this brain is sucking
the...
from the bowl.
Bob's brain is being smoked
by the pipe.
Now, that is a mystery to sit and think about
when you're in your excrementation chamber
up at the top of the hill
or the foreflash.
But, really,
what Bob's really smoking in his pipe
is your brain, my friend.
Are you man or woman or tranny enough
to jump into that bowl?
Let Bob smoke you.
Maybe your brain will be the molecule
that gets him off at that moment.
You know, that's something to live for.
So, I guess when that bonfire...
See, when the...
I get... I'm really honored
because I was asked to help light the big bonfire.
I can't believe they let a subgenius
take part in that sacred ceremony.
But, they do.
And I always think of it as like,
hey, we're lighting Bob's pipe.
He's gonna be smoking all of us.
Yeah!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, beat me to a pulp
and I'm praying for some pain.
I ain't got religion.
I got a damaged brain.
And if I had a dollar
for every licking that I took,
I'd buy the pulpit back again
and write a dirty book.
Oh, beat me to a pulp
and I'm praying for some pain.
Beat me to a pulp
and I'm praying for some pain.
I ain't got religion.
I got a damaged brain.
I ain't got religion.
I got a damaged brain.
