1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
It's just Bob. It's just Bob. It's just Bob. It's just Bob is what it is. It's just, it's literally Bob.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,720
I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,820
And it hit me. No, it couldn't be.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,520
The subgenius power of Bob.

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:42,620
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,880
All right.

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,900
All right.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,920
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

9
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:06,760
And finally, Bob said, life after death, why wait?

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,700
Because, friends, Bob promises something greater than life or even death.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,300
Bob promises slack.

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,520
Yes, slack.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,660
And so many people say, well, Reverend Stang, what is slack?

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,760
Is that like when I drink a beer and watch TV?

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,880
It might be.

16
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,500
Slack is indefinable by definition.

17
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,040
It's different for each person.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,980
It's pure, pure perception unfettered by common sense.

19
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,340
It's literally something for nothingness.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,040
Whatever works for you.

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,300
If nothing works, then fine.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,440
Let it.

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,880
You already have slack.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,580
That is the point of the Church of the Subgenius.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,140
You just haven't appreciated it yet.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,160
You have more slack than you can appreciate.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,020
Until it is taken away.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
You have it.

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,900
In fact, friends, you have it all.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
You just haven't believed it yet.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,440
So, I could go to a Q&A for the last 15 minutes.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,360
I could also tell you the real conspiracy behind 9-11.

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,900
The real thing behind 9-11.

34
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,000
This was, this was, somebody said, well, which seems more likely to you?

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,020


36
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,020


37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,020


38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,520
Bush and his cohorts, including a multitude of Arab leaders and the press, are all evil geniuses

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,600
who not only conceived this intricate plot, but managed to execute it to perfection by working together?

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:50,680
Or, are our leaders and theirs are terminally pink moron fuck-ups, pawns of a conspiracy bigger than even they can comprehend?

41
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,560
And this subgenius, Cuttlefish, said,

42
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,860
I think the Twin Towers cut themselves.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,260
And the next guy said,

44
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,020
They were cleaning their airplanes and they didn't know they were loaded.

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,880
The hypnotist who hypnotized the bricks the towers were made of fell asleep and the bricks stopped believing.

46
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,700
A janitor was cleaning the basement and he saw a big red button that said,

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,980
Do not press this button.

48
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,840
Jonathan Livingston, who is the head of the astronomer, said,

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,840


51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,620
Winston Segal flew back into this dimension after 30 years at two-thirds the speed of

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,940
light and smacked into it.

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,920
It was Colonel Mustard in the conservatory of the United States.

54
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,700
Some wise ass said, look, Pamela Anderson is running down the street topless and everyone

55
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,020
rushed to one side of the building at the same time.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,000
And last but not least, all together now, the Jews did it.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm getting so tired of that one.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm not even Jewish.

59
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,120
Let's see.

60
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:12,620
Some gods are evidently so weak that they need humans to do their dirty work for them.

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,520
And you can't say it's just the gods' fan clubs to blame.

62
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,120
The gods let them do this crap.

63
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,500
Now you're real gods.

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,000
You're probably not.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,940
Proper old-timey gods get what they want by sheer omnipotence and magic, not by bombs

66
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,180
or YouTube videos.

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,720
And they must really enjoy the hell out of all this ruckus, the sick bastards.

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
And I've got a little postcard here from a subgenius I don't even know.

69
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,600
But you can tell when Bob channeled stuff.

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,660
Because this one, this is a new Bob saying announced here for the first time.

71
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,880
Tell me if you can explain it.

72
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,520
The road to heaven.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,060
Is paved with meat.

74
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,240
The road to meat.

75
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,640
Is not paved at all.

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,580
See what I mean about, you know, only Bob would come up with something like that?

77
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,400
I think Zippy the Pinhead must be his cousin.

78
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,900
Actually, we're told that Jack Handy came up with that one.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,380
But let's get down to business, friends, and continue with session seven in the Subgenius

80
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,740
University course in Identification of Monsters.

81
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,200
One, eats food, magma of underground.

82
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,420
Two, shoot fleezing rays through eyes.

83
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,940
Slow down, I'm writing this down.

84
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,000
Three, a gigantic angler.

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,760
Shoots ray.

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Northern Pacific had a big damage.

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,980
Now does this seem like an angler fish with a lang, a lantern hanging at the end of its...

88
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,560
I always wondered about that.

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
I think it says a gigantic angler.

90
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,180
I assume it means that type of fish.

91
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,620
Yes, it is a Japanese monster.

92
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,360
They are based on...

93
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,540
Some of them are based on marine organisms.

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,640
Let's not be racist.

95
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,400
We won't attribute any race to this.

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,380
Just look at it, man.

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,420
Look at the screen.

98
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,860
It's obviously a Japanese monster.

99
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,620
It's an Asian monster.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,840
I see you out there, El Cerrito.

101
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,360
Let's just say Asian.

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,760
Let's not...

103
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,800
Well, there is a difference.

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,740
There is a difference between Hong Kong monsters like Mikey the King Man.

105
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,760
Well, it's a Far East Asian.

106
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,420
Korean monsters like Yongari Monster.

107
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,340
How about we say a Far East non-peninsular Asian?

108
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,660
And an ordinary Japanese monster like Yongari Monster.

109
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,260
Let's say an Asian.

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,660
All right, all right.

111
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,460
We'll say it's an Asian island.

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,400
So what's going on in L.A.?

113
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,920
Come on.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,280
They come from Ozu Island.

115
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
It's not...

116
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,280
It's not...

117
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,480
It's not a mainland Asian monster.

118
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,900
It's not a mainland Asian monster.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,320
They come from Monster Island, from happy Monster Island.

120
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,220
They're here from Monster Island.

121
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,080
Monster Island is their home.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,320
Popular culture may be as much a mirror of our society as it is a perpetuator of our

123
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,640
best interests.

124
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,640


125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,640


126
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,640


127
00:06:50,660 --> 00:07:04,260
rode a horse no longer able to금.

128
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,940
They're the beginning.

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,960
associate with Johnny Depp, the fascinating Monaten Anyway, I'm killing some of these

130
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:09,960


131
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,420
Do they Кann.

132
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,540
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . P 좋 terraена,

133
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,320
I want to see some guy running through the Kmart with an automatic weapon firing at the clerks.

134
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,960
Um, could you check the class of one more time?

135
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,660
I want to see thousands of people in the street killing policemen.

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,920
Um, could you check the class of one more time?

137
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,400
I want to hear about a nuclear meltdown.

138
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,760
I want to know the stock market dropped 2,000 points in one day.

139
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,420
I want to see people under pressure.

140
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,900
Uh, if anything, uh...

141
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,020
Are you sure there's nothing under my bed?

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Uh, nope, no monsters here.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,840
Uh, uh, nope.

144
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,680
Nope, no monsters here.

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,100
Okay?

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,500
Okay.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,780
Okay.

148
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,400
The ideology of the external threat...

149
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,780
is integral to the Western political culture.

150
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,100
It provides the fuel which makes the propaganda model operate so vigorously.

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,500
External threats have been ingrained into journalistic practices to the point...

152
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,660
that even in periods of peace, it is expected for journalists to frame issues...

153
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,260
in terms of our guys versus the bad guys.

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,040
But the reality is, the government is the only one that can stop the government.

155
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
And it's the only one that can stop the government.

156
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,720
For strangers, my friends, might be our own monsters.

157
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,360
And that piece was by Reverend Phineas Narco.

158
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,340
You can get a lot more from him at, uh, nationalcynical.com.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,300
This hour of slack is about monsters.

160
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,200
Monsters of the mind and of the conspiracy.

161
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,720
And also of the exists of Dobbs Prophecy.

162
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,400
Because, uh, they talk about that a lot on KPFA Berkeley show.

163
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Puzzling Evidence show.

164
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,400
Um, with Dr. Violet Drummond and Dr. Howell.

165
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,600
And Puzzling Evidence.

166
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:39,420
Um, is our god, Bob, not after all, to some people, including me, the ultimate monster himself?

167
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,740
And are monsters not the second coolest thing to...

168
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,280
Well, whatever the first coolest thing happens to be for you?

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,800
Anyway, back to Philo, Puzzling Evidence, and Dr. Howell.

170
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,620
Uh, they did that show reluctantly due to an accident with the De-Bigifier.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
But they did it anyway.

172
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,080
We've got to do it.

173
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,540
Well, not really.

174
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,180
She's mouse size and, uh...

175
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,120
Burr, right here.

176
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Within the next 47 minutes, she'll come back to normal size.

177
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,240
Okay, well, while that...

178
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,320
I'm not sure if we can control her now.

179
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,300
I didn't realize it would take that long.

180
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,540
Oh, what?

181
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,320
Philo?

182
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,160
What on...

183
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,600
Sorry, how you got carried away.

184
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,520
If they put me down, I'll come back and then I'll...

185
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,580
I won't do that anymore, I promise.

186
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,900
But, are you sure?

187
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,980
They said there would be those who were like us, but were actually some kind of mutant.

188
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,040
Well, uh, yes, it is a mutant.

189
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,500
Mutant!

190
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,780
It is a mutant, but nonetheless, it doesn't have to give us our work assignment.

191
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,400
It's a mutant invasion.

192
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,580
It's a mutant invasion.

193
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,700
So, by the way, what's the deal with, um...

194
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,900
With Philo contacting the aliens?

195
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,300
Are you talking about the desert?

196
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,900
And now you're contacting aliens as well, you whistling?

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,720
Well, the Overman was charged with that back in, uh...

198
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
At a time when your country needs you.

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,220
Back in 1980.

200
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,040
They helped your country.

201
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,860
The Overman, uh...

202
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,740
They had the official deal?

203
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,300
Yeah.

204
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,840
Yeah.

205
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,880
Oh, well, yeah.

206
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,860
Back in 1980...

207
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,720
They're killing our women and children out there.

208
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,940
Uh, Puzzle and Evidence went out to the desert with, uh, Overman, first class.

209
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,280
You did!

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,960
Because he's charged with contacting the aliens.

211
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,020
And we have video footage of that.

212
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,300
How much was it?

213
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Uh, I don't know.

214
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,400


215
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,120
I don't know how much was the charge.

216
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,180
It'll be up on YouTube soon.

217
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,840
So I just wondered what the deal was with that.

218
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,120
Wow.

219
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,660
You see the aliens on YouTube?

220
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:20,900
What's the deal with that?

221
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,000
I think it's, uh, it's just what the church was responsible for.

222
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,300
I saw some very eerie footage on YouTube, but I can't describe it because it's so far

223
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,300


224
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,360
This is not the footage you're describing now.

225
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,540
...the charts, but, uh...

226
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,320
Really?

227
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,180
You shouldn't watch Puzzle and Evidence TV if you're gonna feel like this.

228
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,080
The gag at the end is, uh, not suitable for airplay, unfortunately.

229
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,180


230
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,380
So I can't tell the anecdotes.

231
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, don't.

232
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,500
Don't do it.

233
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,840
It's just important to hear.

234
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,940
Don't give the anecdote.

235
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,820
When the cops come over here, we lose our license to fly the show.

236
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,100
Yes, we want to make it very short.

237
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,620
Stay within the standards of life.

238
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:54,920
You're in the land of the free.

239
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,940
Yeah, in the land of the free.

240
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,120
Right.

241
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,420
Good, good, good.

242
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,940
Good housekeeping, seal of approval.

243
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,140
Use the land of the free.

244
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,640
You can do anything you want.

245
00:11:59,760 --> 00:11:59,980
Broadcasting here.

246
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,780
Within the zone of comfort and good, honest family values.

247
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,200
You can do anything you want as long as you don't get caught.

248
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,400
As long as it's in your mind.

249
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,520
For Caucasian Christians in common.

250
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,180
And you don't have to devise the mind control technology that, uh...

251
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,780
But if you have a mullet, you can automatically get away with it.

252
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,120
Mullet?

253
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,920
People don't realize the business in the front, party in the back.

254
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,600
But the mullet TV show didn't succeed.

255
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,360
Thank you.

256
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,300
Thank you very much.

257
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,680
Yes, I did think it was necessary to point out that the mullet show was not a success

258
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,760
with the American public.

259
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,120
But no, not really.

260
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,320
Seriously, what about the, uh, the overman and the aliens?

261
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,120
Well, there is a story, but I know the overman personally.

262
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,120
And he would never get together with aliens against the human race.

263
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
He is, uh...

264
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,980
He might...

265
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,880
It might seem that, but I trust him.

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,560
I'll hold on.

267
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,620
I'll be the last person.

268
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,780
I believe he would be a cosmic quizling.

269
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,500
Now, I would suspect that he...

270
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,920
And you can take that to the bank.

271
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,460
He may be, uh...

272
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,920
Maybe only in the short term.

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
He's appearing to be a quizling.

274
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,780
Oh, look at those shorts.

275
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,240
A cosmic quizling.

276
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,080
So that he can...

277
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,720
Well, um...

278
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,260
Procure the appropriate funds to...

279
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,760
To fund the actual...

280
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,340
Uh-huh.

281
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,760
Uh, rebellion itself.

282
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,460
Uh-huh.

283
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,900
So he's sneaking into the back pocket of the aggressors, stealing their cash funds.

284
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,160
And he's...

285
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160


286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160


287
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160


288
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160


289
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160


290
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160


291
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,120
He's stealing from the man to stick it to the man.

292
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,300
And he's using that to arm the insurgents.

293
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,480
He's stealing from the man to stick it to the man.

294
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,360
We're insur...

295
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,000
Insurging the armants.

296
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,520
He robs from the rich and he gives to the poor.

297
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,160
No, I mean arming the insurgents.

298
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,900
What happens in the footage is the...

299
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,200
That the overman in the nighttime goes out and sees the alien...

300
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,320
And he's not notching.

301
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,820
And the alien approaches him and then he disappears.

302
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,260
And then there's rumored to be footage of him later aboard the UFO...

303
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,820
All special glowing alien approaches him.

304
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,200
...shoving over the ancient...

305
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,180
He fights monsters?

306
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,860
...missions.

307
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,120
Across the field.

308
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,620
And then he...

309
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,000
And that's when he shoves over the ancient...

310
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,140
In the heat of the...

311
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,720
...mission, right?

312
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,960
...of the night in the Midwest.

313
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,020
The alien guy does that.

314
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,240
He destroys the ancient mission.

315
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,560
You can smell the plants and the crops growing.

316
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:45,860
Yeah.

317
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,980
And the alien is there glowing.

318
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,540
And that can never see the light of day.

319
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
His own body glows.

320
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,440
He stands...

321
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,140
Just in case somebody recognizes...

322
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,760
...taller than a man.

323
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,880
...the ancient mission.

324
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,780
...the planet that would never die.

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
...the one piece of dirt that...

326
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,720
They would recognize what looked like to anybody else a large ant bed...

327
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.

328
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,960
...in the middle of the desert.

329
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,600
Those people look like ants down there.

330
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,760
...is actually a remnants of a mission...

331
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,680
Those are ants down there?

332
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,440
...that was from an ancient...

333
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,980
I'll go ahead and scorch them.

334
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,660
...it wasn't like it was a Spanish mission.

335
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,500
It was a mission from an ancient civilization that predated any...

336
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,380
Look, they got a little tiny mission down there by the ant hill.

337
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:12,740
That's it.

338
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,680
I don't believe it.

339
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,580
It must be Catholic ants or something.

340
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,080
So it was like, yeah, it was this pile of ant poo was older than all mankind.

341
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,680
Right.

342
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,640
Older than Cheech and Inza.

343
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,740
Older than the hills.

344
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,440
Older than...

345
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,600
...if it didn't matter.

346
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

347
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,200
It better be for the hills it was built on.

348
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,680
...early tales of Woldercan and the god Yawthor.

349
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,560
Yeah, it was just an unbelievable conundrum wrapped inside of a smegma fish head.

350
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,040
But there need be no stigma.

351
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,260
I mean, no.

352
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,640
An enigma fish head.

353
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:38,640


354
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,660
This enigma can be unwrapped like last week's fish wrapped in a newspaper.

355
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,200
Wrapped in a newspaper-shaped mystery.

356
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,700
Yeah, all I know is that the overman walks off and then he talks about the alien life

357
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,400
after he...

358
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,260
I was just wondering about the original tasking that he got from Church of the Subgenius about

359
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,340
talking to the exes and the...

360
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,460
Watch out.

361
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,280
You nearly hurt Kitty.

362
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,640
...the men in black.

363
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,460
Yeah, he was trying to make a deal so they would kind of decide what he could really...

364
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,840
I was reading up on the old church recently.

365
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,220
Oh, yeah, you were, huh?

366
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,080
...those ancient records left by large...

367
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,140
Yeah, going and trying to write some...

368
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,380
...by large...

369
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,760
...and then you just go to read about that in your ancient pamphlets.

370
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,040
The ancient textuses, that's what I trust.

371
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,380
You've got copies, hard copies, eh?

372
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,600
The real textuses.

373
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
They can't disappear into digital form.

374
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,420
The hard, the hard stuff.

375
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,460
Yeah, the hard copies.

376
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,720
They really exist.

377
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Because that's what turns me on.

378
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,040
That's like hard-coded into your hardwired mind.

379
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,180
To see the ink scratches.

380
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,040
Well, you...

381
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,300
Yeah.

382
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,900
How many of these alarming documents?

383
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,600
What are they saying?

384
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,100
These are top secret documents.

385
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,680
You've got, yeah, you've got some...

386
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,180
How many do you have of them?

387
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,420
...of that nature?

388
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,540
How many pages would you say?

389
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,680
Here, I'm just counting them now.

390
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,820
They're in this bucket.

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,760
Oh, I see.

392
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,440
Well, I...

393
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
Oh, yeah, that is a very large bucket.

394
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,760
...can't hate someone to kick that bucket out.

395
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,020
Hey, hey, hey.

396
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,920
Don't, don't kick the bucket, man.

397
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,640
Don't kick the bucket.

398
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:42,640


399
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,020
Find anything, Bob?

400
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,420
No, Doctor, not a thing.

401
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,540
There you are.

402
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,840
You see, there's no sign of any excessive radioactivity anywhere in the area.

403
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,180
Odd, wouldn't you say, for something coming in from outer space?

404
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,340
I don't know what's odd and what isn't anymore.

405
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,700
But I do know I expected you to be more open to the idea than the others.

406
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,580
You're a man of science.

407
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
And therefore less inclined to witchcraft, John.

408
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,140
Not witchcraft, Dr. Snell.

409
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,800
Imagination.

410
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,740
Willingness to believe that there are lots of things that we don't know anything about.

411
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,220
Look, there was a time when people thought the Earth was a level plane between two mountains

412
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,140
that were set there to hold up the sky, and that the stars were lamps hung from that sky.

413
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,920
Then a better idea came along and people were willing to listen.

414
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,580
Be realistic, John.

415
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,780
We've worked together before.

416
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,100
In the meantime, you can do an article for us.

417
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,580
Yeah.

418
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,640
Here.

419
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,600
An intense young man.

420
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,940
Yeah, and an odd one, too.

421
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,400
More than odd, Bob.

422
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,880
Individual and lonely.

423
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,300
A man who thinks for himself.

424
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,720
Report on the arrival of strangers from outer space.

425
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,980
Hello to our friends in Hawaii.

426
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,500
In Honoururu.

427
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,280
Not Waipahu.

428
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
Out there with the president who's in Kailua.

429
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,320
That was pretty cool.

430
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,300
So Kailua lost power.

431
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,380
Most of the island lost power.

432
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,980
Little presidential elects in the dark.

433
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,380
That's when the aliens move in.

434
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,740
The island lost power?

435
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,140
It's a place, man.

436
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,080
We've got to take it over.

437
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,480
It's the last place where the power is.

438
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,800
Yeah, but they're not compatible with our system.

439
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,200
I know, but we must own all systems and crush them with a tractor beam.

440
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,760
But then how do we get everything to work?

441
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,720
You know, like the TV and the toilet and...

442
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,940
Luke Skywalker.

443
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,020
The toilets aren't working.

444
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,920
That's Aunt...

445
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,780
What is it?

446
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,760
Aunt Bee and Uncle...

447
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
What's his name?

448
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,420
Aunt Beru.

449
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Their bodies, Aunt Beru, were not buried out there in the desert.

450
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Remember, they just left there.

451
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,360
So they became fly piles for a while.

452
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,140
Luke.

453
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,140
Luke.

454
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,620
I am the father.

455
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,120
Oh, I'm coming, Aunt Beru.

456
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,640
Luke.

457
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,980
I am the father.

458
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,360
I am the father.

459
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:53,980
I am the father.

460
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,320
And at the end of the program, the most horrific thing happens.

461
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,520
Darth Vader tells Luke what happens in the future movies.

462
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,340
He whispers it in Luke Skywalker's ear and he goes,

463
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,040
Oh, no!

464
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,940
Hey, there.

465
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
Hey, there.

466
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,700
That's really funny.

467
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,760
You better be the bad guy.

468
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,420
Everyone just pees their pants and laughs so hard.

469
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,600
You're gonna be the bad guy.

470
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,880
You're gonna see Luke's world ruined by Darth.

471
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,420
Why do you think Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their name to KFC?

472
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,680
The signs were a lot cheaper to paint.

473
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,520
You know the real reason, actually, I heard?

474
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,320
Because they wanted to take the word fried out of their name back in the day.

475
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


476
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


477
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


478
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


479
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


480
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


481
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


482
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


483
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


484
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


485
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


486
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


487
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,320


488
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,640
You know, when, when, you know, because frying food is not good for you.

489
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,540
Right.

490
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,360
Actually, I heard that they wanted to take chicken out of their name so nobody could

491
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,300
sue them for not actually using chicken anymore.

492
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,840
Urban legend.

493
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,420
Really?

494
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,360
Well, I mean, just ask the PETA people.

495
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,120
They think those are real chickens.

496
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,480
Well, parts of it, anyways.

497
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,440
You know, if it's got a thigh bone.

498
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,740
They're fanning chicken trees now, don't they?

499
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,460
Where it's just a sort of a vegetable-like creature with no head that just chicken meat

500
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,200
that grows off of a, sort of a raw chicken.

501
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,200


502
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,200


503
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,300
They've gone beyond urban chicken.

504
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,300


505
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,300


506
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,300


507
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,300


508
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,760
They've gone beyond the root chicken and all these, these chicken breasts and legs

509
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,920
and wings and stuff.

510
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,300
Meat that grows on trees, actually, those trees are a very complex symbiotic, symbiotic

511
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,380
relationship, actually.

512
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,660
For example, you know, you have to have extra large amounts of nitrogen-fixing bacteria

513
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,620
in the soil there as well, you know, just to make sure that they can get enough protein

514
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,620
from the air.

515
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,900
Well, and they haven't been able to get rid of the skin yet, right?

516
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,600
I mean, they, they got, they don't have feathers, but the, the meaty fruit, as you might call

517
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
it, still has this sort of...

518
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,280


519
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,520
Skin.

520
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,800
It's a barky skin.

521
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,180
It's a barky skin that has to be removed.

522
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,640
See, all you gotta do is, is take a chicken genome or one of the chicken genomes and implant

523
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,400
it into the tree, into the primordial cell, the first cell, the original cell.

524
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,640
Well, that's what I'm talking about.

525
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,000
They've been doing that for two years now.

526
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,360
Mm-hmm.

527
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,460
That's, that's where the, that's where most of the chicken in the supermarket comes from,

528
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,220
chicken trees.

529
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,420
Mm-mm-mm.

530
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,880
And the Japanese...

531
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,140
Somebody else had the idea for cow trees.

532
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah.

533
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,420
But people just couldn't stomach that.

534
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,140
They wouldn't...

535
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,300
Well, you know, that's, that, that's the kind of tree that like, you know, they're saying

536
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,720
we should plant more trees to, to curb the greenhouse effect.

537
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,240
Right.

538
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,020
A cow tree would do the exact opposite.

539
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,400
Right.

540
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,260
They'd be breaking wind and then knocking themselves over simultaneously and it wouldn't

541
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,360
be good for the logging industry or any of us.

542
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,560
Hello, you were...

543
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:25,740
Okay, right.

544
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,680
You're on the air.

545
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,740
Yeah.

546
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,200
What are you guys talking about?

547
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,920
What's it sound like we're talking about?

548
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
We're talking about meat trees.

549
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,520
We're talking about genetic engineering, man.

550
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,060
Something that's very important to humanity right now.

551
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,060
You should be paying attention.

552
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,280
What do you mean by meat trees?

553
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,420
We're talking about trees that grow flesh on them.

554
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,860
Haven't you heard?

555
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,080
No, I...

556
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,980
Explain.

557
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,260
You never heard of a chicken tree or a beef tree?

558
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,460
Professor, you sound kind of quiet actually.

559
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
Well, they outlawed the beef trees.

560
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,880
Who's...

561
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Now, what's, what's the status of the pork tree?

562
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,480
Are, are we still getting...

563
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,320
No, they won't make mammal, they won't make trees with mammal flesh because there's a

564
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,140
law in the U.S. that says...

565
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,040
I don't have any arguments against it, although I understand that in some foreign countries

566
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,560
they're, they're about to legalize it.

567
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,460
Legalize it?

568
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,360
Yeah, legalize beef and mutton trees.

569
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,460
Legalize it?

570
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:23,640
Apparently it's not that hard to do, but it's the, the, the, the, the presence of little

571
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,740
tiny mouths and eyes and beaks and things here and there along the branches of the tree

572
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,440
freaks people out.

573
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,300
So they don't, they don't advertise much that that's the way they do it.

574
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,260
They'll say farm raised chickens and...

575
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,680
I can't wait.

576
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:40,760
What does that mean?

577
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,080
I can't wait until long pig is available.

578
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,120
Well, it already is available for a limited time only at your favorite supermarket, but

579
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,380
it's not real, real long pig.

580
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,240
There were human genomes introduced into the pig so that it has a longish flavor, but it's

581
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,600
not real long pig yet.

582
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,980
So I guess...

583
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,500
Some of those swine...

584
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,420


585
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,900
Some of those swine have, are kind of cute.

586
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,100
Well, they have pretty legs.

587
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,360
Like, you know, they, cause they, they, I don't know how they did it, but they'll have

588
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,840
these, these, they look mostly like pigs, but they'll, their hind legs will look like

589
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,800
Betty Grable's gams.

590
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,800
And it's, it's kind of a shock, you know, it makes you uncomfortable to look at one

591
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,100
of those.

592
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,060
Like I went to the state fair in Texas where they had some of these new crossbreeds between

593
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,960
humans.

594
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,800
And farm animals.

595
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,460
And...

596
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,160
Well, in some parts of Texas, that just happens naturally.

597
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,740
Right.

598
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,660
Well, on the other...

599
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,200
That happens in parts of Ohio too.

600
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,900
There's a lot of people who look increasingly like pigs, but I'm talking about these genetically

601
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:53,000
engineered pigs and those are the only kind I've seen actually.

602
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,060
Ever.

603
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,100
The pigs that have been, have some human...

604
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,420
Cause apparently human and beef doesn't... that kind of thing.

605
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,420


606
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,680
Yeah.

607
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,960
The combination isn't that tasty, but pork and human are close enough together that...

608
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,560
If you get, if you get the, the human and beef combo, um, I've, I've, I know some, I

609
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,980
know some Chinese restaurants that can do it pretty well actually.

610
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,420
Kind of like the whole Four Seasons dish or whatever, you know.

611
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:16,740
Yeah.

612
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,020
Yeah.

613
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,040
Chinese chefs have been fronting.

614
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,960
I've been here once in a while too, but yeah, they, sometimes they're long on the long pig

615
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,960
and sometimes they're a little bit short, but yeah, it's a taste treat for this time

616
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,460
of the year.

617
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,880
Yeah.

618
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,480
It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

619
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,800
I haven't enjoyed this thing in a while, but I remember.

620
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,820
Mm-hmm.

621
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,220
Good.

622
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,440
Turduckmen.

623
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,340
I wonder why...

624
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,580
I will not eat any food that starts with the word turd.

625
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,840
Man turducken.

626
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,500
If they can, if they can, if they can take the turducken and just rearrange the parts

627
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,240
of that name, then I might be interested.

628
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,240
Like turdkey or something or?

629
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,580
Man pig turducken.

630
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,460
See?

631
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,440
With a big apple in its mouth.

632
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,780
I can't believe that they would release that on unwitting society.

633
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,400
Can you?

634
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,220
That we...

635
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:15,200
You know, if we thought about it, even in a satirical way, somebody in Brunei or Saudi

636
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,540
Arabia has tried it.

637
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,780
Some, or Japan, some rich dude with the money, if we think of it, somebody has already tried

638
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:23,980
it.

639
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,340
Well, we should start thinking of things that save our own skins then.

640
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,440
What about the one...

641
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,360
Well, no, because some other guy will just save his own skin first.

642
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
So you got to...

643
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,840
If you think about it, don't let yourself know you thought about it, because somebody

644
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,660
will steal the idea.

645
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,720
That's...

646
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,460
You got to keep it secret even from yourself until you're ready to put it right into production.

647
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,420
I was just thinking maybe Ulysses was the progenitor of the man pig race, because wasn't

648
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,400
it Circe who was like a pig and she was like really hot or something like that?

649
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,020
Did you...

650
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,700
Do you know anything about that, Dr. Sinister?

651
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,940
I know you know a bit of classical literature.

652
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:02,960
Oh, gosh.

653
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,260
The name sounds familiar, but I can't remember.

654
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960
Are you talking about the Circe?

655
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,720
Circe?

656
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,940
Circe, the...

657
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,340
Circus?

658
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,540
The Circus Soleil.

659
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:20,060
No, I'm talking about a pig in mythological, in mythology, who, you know, the sirens used

660
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,240
to...

661
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,400
Were singing to him, but a pig did allure Ulysses to some sort of...

662
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,400


663
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,080
He would get lured and then they would turn him into pigs.

664
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,800
But he killed the swine.

665
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,960
He did kill the swine because he knew it wasn't really a hot babe.

666
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,700
I guess he came to his senses and killed it.

667
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,200
That was after he was done with it.

668
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,440
Yeah, after he had...

669
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,060
He was...

670
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,140
Yeah, it was like...

671
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,640
Well, how many of us have awakened in that sleazy motel room and looked over and went,

672
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,200
oh, my God, what was I thinking?

673
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,080
No, it hasn't happened to me, but how many of us has it happened to?

674
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,500
Raise your hands.

675
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,060
I don't know.

676
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,240
You're asking...

677
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,180
How many of you wish it would...

678
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,240
At least that much would happen to you?

679
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,260
If only that would happen to me.

680
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,240
If you could actually...

681
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,540
I don't care how much regret I have afterwards.

682
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,040
I just want it to happen once.

683
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,020
I would.

684
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,800
I thought you were calling us all in the office now.

685
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,440
This show smells...

686
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,720
What's the matter?

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,060
This show smells like yesterday's newspaper stuffed with...

688
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,060


689
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,160
...inside a mullet wrapped in today's newspaper and fresh frozen.

690
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,640
Check.

691
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,940
Surrounded with creamy white chocolate.

692
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,280
Check.

694
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,920
Very appetizing.

695
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,620
But there's no chocolate mist.

696
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,960
You can smell it all the way over there.

697
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,660
Ben's fighting words.

698
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,320
It does smell.

699
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,440
That's the important thing.

700
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,200
It smells for us.

701
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,660
Smells?

702
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,720
Smells all the way across the room.

703
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,600
Just put it in the fridge.

704
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Smell that surround you.

705
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,240
I know, and all he's trying to do is find out why the overman was chosen to talk to

706
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,780
the exes.

707
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,200
That's all.

708
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,040
Why the hell?

709
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,760
That's all.

710
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,480
Oh, why?

711
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,220
Oh, why?

712
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,000
You know...

713
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,480
Exactly.

714
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,940
Oh, and there, the collar gave up on me.

715
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,320
The smell just came in the way.

716
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,220
He had the right facial angle in the way.

717
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,600
He's a doctor out here.

718
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,220
He's a doctor out here.

719
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,020
Anything you want, you will say, will be used against you.

720
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,000
There is one hardwired sense of xenophobia.

721
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,780
Whatever and wherever possible.

722
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,620
Only the facial features of the overman can disarm the aliens and cause their wrath to

723
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,860
turn to mildness.

724
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,800
That's what it is?

725
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,400
It's a smile?

726
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,040
Just looking at the overman will contain the aliens' eyes.

727
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,120
I'm sure he's a little higher, but nothing else will... anything regular humans do will

728
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,480
inflame their anger a thousandfold.

729
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,760
Why is that?

730
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,860
What is that?

731
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,260
Well, that must be one of the great unanswered questions on this bardo.

732
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:43,940
Bardo?

733
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,320
This wheel of...

734
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,640
How do we get out of this jungle?

735
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,020
This jungle of stickative lies.

736
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,740
This jungle of questions that I'm lost in now.

737
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,080
I'm trying to figure out what to do out here.

738
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,620
There may be an oasis about 50 clicks from here.

739
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,020
I don't know.

740
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,140
Maybe.

741
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,560
Oh, I guess it's not over there.

742
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,780
Yeah.

743
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,180
Quick, poke that stick in there and maybe...

744
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,520
Oh, quick poke him?

745
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,280
Quick, poke that stick in there.

746
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,200
Fight the giant pygmies of Peshawar.

747
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:18,740
The church does not appear to be a flight of fancy as once thought, but an actual hardcore

748
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,140
dogmatic...

749
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,300
Travel through the cannibal forest of T'Challa.

750
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,020
Back to the pamphlet-style church.

751
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,000
So, there's the temple.

752
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000


753
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000


754
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000


755
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000


756
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,620
These are the Dromundian minions here gathered on the plain of Ligarnar.

757
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,780
Discovered by the lost Dromundian civilization.

758
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,980
It's tough love, but it happens and it works.

759
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,860
Outpost of ancient Kansas.

760
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,740
I think that European contact is our friend in Berlin.

761
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,760
Where are we? We're in the jungle now?

762
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,260
In other words, the consumer confidence level is at an all-time low.

763
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,600
Really? Low.

764
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,860
This is news.

765
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,300
All right, all right, all right, all right, thanks.

766
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,820
I forgot the musical accent.

767
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,620
This is PR.

768
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,760
PR, PR, PR, PR, PR, PR, PR, PR, PR News.

769
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm moving again.

770
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,080
It happened in the town of Chasada in northwest Pakistan.

771
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,200
He said no one could have survived.

772
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,640
On Wall Street, 310-1055-664-999-1121.

773
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,480
Earlier today.

774
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,000
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this is PR News.

775
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,800
Citing the financial turmoil weighing on Wall Street,

776
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,820
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that they have found the wreckage of PR News.

777
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,620
PR News wrecked there by Limer.

778
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,680
And now some more serious discussion,

779
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,760
this time on Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland,

780
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,920
about monsters, specifically the monsters known as SUVs.

781
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,880
I don't like SUVs.

782
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,420
I would like to see less of them on the road.

783
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,600
Fatmobiles.

784
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,120
But that's an American right to block the next guy's vision.

785
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,800
It really annoys me.

786
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,320
What are you going to outlaw? Big cars?

787
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,220
This is a big country for big, beefy men.

788
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,840
America's fighting men need beef.

789
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,140
Plenty of it.

790
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,860
How many of these trees?

791
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,280
Remember, every tree.

792
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,500
You cut down could be a potential beef tree for an American soldier over there.

793
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,020
So you guys have the middle of the forest, a green forest.

794
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,620
That's not a forest.

795
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,660
Oh my God, it's a monster.

796
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,420
Those are fake trees just designed out of paper bags and plastic bags.

797
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,200
Have this footage.

798
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,780
Sent in by one viewer of KGTV.

799
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,840
Just to give the citizenry a sense of what things were like back when plants existed.

800
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,880
Remember, trees.

801
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,960
We do.

802
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,780
Yes, people do.

803
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,220
You may not know what they were or what their purpose was, but we still remember kind of what they looked like.

804
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,700
So we've built these models here and you can be the nearest to a proxy tree.

805
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,680
Out near Hunsdorf.

806
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,820
We don't even know why.

807
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,460
Hunsdorf?

808
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:07,900
Yeah.

809
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,040
On Highway 253.

810
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,100
Ach, du lieber und stoller.

811
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,020
Out in the mountains.

812
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,920
Boy, that's nice.

813
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,600
Up in the mountains, it's lonely.

814
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,840
Those are real mountains.

815
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,460
That looks real nice.

816
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,920
Those are mountains.

817
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,960
You're a good hillbilly, but you've been lost.

818
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,200
That's what the concrete looks like over there.

819
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,540
Really?

820
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,320
It's a concrete-ist poem.

821
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,820
They're all green already.

822
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:27,820


823
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,960
They just put green paint in their concrete.

824
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,060
I'm going to go down to Spain and see who this is listening to us in España.

825
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,620
It could be a robot.

826
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:34,800
It's only Spain.

827
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,580
It could be a robot.

828
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,560
It is a robot, actually.

829
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,060
Global warming has killed all of the plant life in Europe already.

830
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,380
This is actually just the downloads.

831
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,720
Wait, what robot?

832
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,480
The radio listeners.

833
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,040
Can you run that back?

834
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,600
There's no robot here.

835
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,340
It's a nice robot, Hal.

836
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,080
What?

837
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,960
I went to school with that robot.

838
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,100
But that, it's a renegade robot.

839
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,920
That's a rogue robot, man.

840
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,160
Rogue robot.

841
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Do you think it'll hurt us?

842
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,080
I hope so.

843
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,040
Well, it's not yesterday's model.

844
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,580
Insert digital gold effect.

845
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,740
The sacrifice will take place tomorrow.

846
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,220
Tomorrow night.

847
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:20,980
Behold.

848
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,160
When the planet Saturn comes into conjunction with Mars

849
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,960
and under the evil influence of Uranus,

850
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,680
then will occur unimaginable disasters.

851
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,340
The oceans will rise.

852
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,660
The mountains crumble.

853
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,900
And inexorably, our moon will draw near the Earth.

854
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,600
Through this cataclysm, only our form of life can survive.

855
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,820
After the long night of sleep,

856
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,960
we shall become the masters of the Earth.

857
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,240
But how shall I live then?

858
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,560
You will have the reward you have earned, Samara.

859
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,280
Your beauty will never fade.

860
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,120
And your power will be equal to ours.

861
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,440
You will possess all the riches of the world.

862
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,940
But remember that there is still one task you must carry out.

863
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,660
Kill Hercules.

864
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,700
Have no fear.

865
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,880
Hercules is already in my hands.

866
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,940
He will die.

867
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,520
Don't tell me you're watching that movie again.

868
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,080
I haven't a life without him.

869
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,500
I think it says a lot about my own society and the creative dreams of men.

870
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,820
Yeah, whatever.

871
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,240
If you just turn it down, this is like the 15th time you've watched it in the past three days.

872
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,980
It says a lot about my own society.

873
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,120
It says a lot about my own society.

874
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,680
It says a lot about my own society.

875
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:46,680


876
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,480
It says a lot about my own society.

877
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,800
It says a lot about my own society.

878
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,020
It says a lot about my own society.

879
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,900
Ah, damn it.

880
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,960
There he is.

881
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,180
He's the one.

882
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,880
He's the one.

883
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,760
He's the one.

884
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,120
He's the one.

885
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:57,800
He's the one.

886
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,920
He's the one.

887
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:57,920


888
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,860
He's the one.

889
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,160
Has this ever happened to you?

890
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,020
Has your dog's head broken because of some kind of freak accident?

891
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,680
Well, now there's an answer, friends.

892
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,160
Call 1-9-MILLION-13013.

893
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,800
That's right.

894
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
1-9-MILLION-BOB.

895
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,660
And we will fix your dog.

896
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,100
Don's head for free at a reasonable price.

897
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,760
That's right, for free at a reasonable price.

898
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,200
Call now.

899
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,820
I hear someone is looking for a Bob Repairman.

900
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,900
Yay!

901
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,600
Shop as usual and avoid panic buying.

902
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,280
I used to go into this place that would take a popover.

903
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,380
Well, I'd take popover too, especially when he couldn't drive.

904
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:44,860
It would shoot.

905
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,480
Put that away.

906
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,660
Then they would take this big syringe and inject it with custard.

907
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,980
That's the furry with the syringe on top.

908
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,300
Then they'd dip it in chocolate.

909
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,180
I never want to see that injection part.

910
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,520
I don't want my donut violated.

911
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,700
I don't want to know about it.

912
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,980
Well, it has a hole, right?

913
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,140
So you have to face up to it.

914
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,240
I know, I know.

915
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,820
That reminds me of a movie I saw called Van Wilder.

916
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,580
Where they replaced the cream in the eclair.

917
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,980
Remember that part?

918
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,420
I like that.

919
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,040
This is going to be good.

920
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,440
Yeah, this is great.

921
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
Look at him replacing that cream.

922
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,600
Milo's acting out the part in the movie that he likes, playing all the parts.

923
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,000
Where do you have time to watch all these bad movies?

924
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,580
Wow, that's amazing.

925
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
That's all I do is watch bad movies.

926
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,920
It's like watching 15 tropical thunders at once.

927
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,460
Watch them on your commute.

928
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,460
And this is where I play the blonde muscle man, Hinchman.

929
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,660
I'll have a tropical thunder.

930
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,220
No umbrella, no cherry.

931
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,680
Just a drink, please.

932
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,380
Yes.

933
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,460
I'm going to put some cream on top.

934
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,700
Hold on.

935
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,160
Hold on a minute.

936
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,640
Everybody seems to be wanting to add cream to these drinks.

937
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,480
This isn't milk from contented cows.

938
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,980
These cows were victims of the capitalist conspiracy.

939
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,060
Cow punchers.

940
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,880
Yes, these udders were only a punching bag to the ruthless.

941
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,640
First you will need a hammer as small as possible to tap in the pits.

942
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:25,040
Take the base piece of wood, the larger of the two oblong pieces, and lay on a flat surface.

943
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,100
Flat?

944
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,160
Where am I going to find the flat surface?

945
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,640
With one of the side pieces, you'll need to tack the panel pins in.

946
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,500
Wait, wait, wait.

947
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,760
If you have access to a little wood glue, water-based PVA, polyvinyl adhesive,

948
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,700
and a little bit of glue, you can use the wood glue to make a good wood glue.

949
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,280
This is the best.

950
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,500
There, there.

951
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, I know this.

952
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,360
Milo just took off running across the desert, and there was this UFO guy chasing after him.

953
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:53,660
What on the world?

954
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,420
The edge is the joy before you tap the pin, Jim.

955
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,520
He was shooting his ray gun at him, but he couldn't get a good bead on him.

956
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,300
Stop and be friendly, Earthling.

957
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,320
Yeah, sure, and he's shooting ray gun.

958
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,900
Ray gun died of natural cause.

959
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,820
Burned little holes in there, so the cleanup crew had to come along and clean up the burn-up holes,

960
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,360
because they couldn't leave that evidence behind.

961
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,080
Why, anything might have made those holes.

962
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,660
A meteor storm?

963
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,220
Anything.

964
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,680
A gas cloud on Jupiter?

965
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,600
Well, that's a little bit far-fetched, I will have to admit.

966
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,140
Swamp gas could explode up and create these holes.

967
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,020
Remember Nibibia?

968
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,800
Nibibia, yeah, Nibibia.

969
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,280
Tippecanoe and Tyler, too.

970
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,820
Remember the Alamo.

971
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,200
54-40 or fight.

972
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,600
Hail Fredonia.

973
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:38,600


974
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,280
Going to tell you a story about a man

975
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,740
that is out in the woods.

976
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,280
He's sick.

977
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,440
He doesn't want to be part of the rat race no more.

978
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,680
He doesn't want to be part of the business race no more.

979
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,300
He doesn't want to be part of the human race no more.

980
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,360
This is the story of the Lakeview Man.

981
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:52,900
This is the story of the Lakeview Man.

982
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:33,020
This is the story of the Lakeview Man.

983
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,100
How's it for me to listen if you can?

984
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,280
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

985
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,180
I took the shortcut to the river last night.

986
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,400
A beard and a blur in my long-beam lies.

987
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,680
I drank a bunch of beer, skipped a bunch of stones,

988
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,280
and I drove a little faster.

989
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,900
On the way back home.

990
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,780
A dog disappears, a cow is found dead.

991
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,960
A chicken is missing, a mountain missing its head.

992
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,240
A shotgun gone, a print in the sand.

993
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,480
Two-toed shy, the Lakeview Man.

994
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,580
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.

995
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,180
Lives in the woods outside of town.

996
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,300
How's it for me to listen if you can?

997
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

998
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,220
The Lakeview Man

999
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,580
Is a wild man.

1000
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,180
Lives in the woods outside the town.

1001
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,240
How's it for me to listen if you can?

1002
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,420
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1003
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,640
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1004
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,860
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1005
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,220
You might need a leg to land

1006
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,460
On the ground

1007
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,020
Bob Walkenhorst did that live.

1008
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,600
You can see bobwalkenhorst.com.

1009
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,120
Before that, some puzzling evidence shown.

1010
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,300
Before that, a collage by Reverend Sweetness McGee.

1011
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,420
And the background music that just is ending here or doing something

1012
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,360
is by Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm.

1013
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,980
And in fact, it's the song Beautiful World.

1014
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,880
And now, the nature of the conspiracy

1015
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,400
is sexily addressed and undressed by Dr. Howell.

1016
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,100
Reality had changed for women as for men.

1017
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,980
Again, old values no longer reflected reality.

1018
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,140
Even if the ruling elite in most countries

1019
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:16,200
was determined to cling on to the martial, chivalrous ideal of manhood

1020
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,860
as the survival of a pre-industrial age,

1021
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,780
masculinity, defined as muscle power,

1022
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,380
had become all but worthless.

1023
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:29,140
In a world dominated by machines and specialized technocrats,

1024
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,460
wrong was losing out to brain.

1025
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,100
And the latter was not, despite the protestations

1026
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,300
of anti-feminist scientists,

1027
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,340
the sole dominion of men.

1028
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,180
Confusing the visible agents with the invisible causes of change,

1029
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,500
both anti-Semites and anti-feminists directed their hatred

1030
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,380
against the group they perceived as corrupt and sexually abnormal.

1031
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:00,520
Both Jews and women came to symbolize the male fear of being unmanned

1032
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,680
through being turned into the soulless self of the man.

1033
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,500
And that's all she's willing to give.

1034
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:04,900
And that's all she's willing to give.

1035
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:15,800
And that's all she's willing to give.

1036
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,660
And that's all she's willing to give.

1037
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,420
And that's all she's willing to give.

1038
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,740
I don't know. What does it sound like there?

1039
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,880
I need more empathy out of you, caller.

1040
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,840
He doesn't care anymore.

1041
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,320
Turn that caller to the cold and death.

1042
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
He turned himself over to the cold and death.

1043
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,000
Now he's sinking in the swamp.

1044
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,560
This is a stream of consciousness.

1045
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,700
Where it goes on forever were it not for the stopping

1046
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,640
and starting points imposed upon us

1047
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,120
by this arbitrary and tyrannical radio station.

1048
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,280
Then and only then.

1049
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,300
We love it, don't we?

1050
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,540
We will finally.

1051
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,160
Yes, thank you for that.

1052
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:02,980
Thank you.

1053
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,120
After all is said and done,

1054
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,880
the answer to this question is...

1055
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:12,260
the mystery. We will finally know that answer. We will know whether Napoleon's penis is really

1056
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:18,560
in New Jersey. If you have a pipe, Bob will give you one. But if you do not have a pipe,

1057
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,380
he will take it away. That is all the formal statements I have. We have 15 minutes for like

1058
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:33,280
Q&A. Yes. Oh, by the way, I'm kind of deaf. So you have to really speak up. How can we live in

1059
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:40,580
consciousness if we're eating off of single-use plastic plates and drinking out of single-use

1060
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:47,200
plastic bottles? How can we live in consciousness if we're drinking out of single-use plastic and

1061
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,880
all the stuff that completely destroys the environment? Oh man, what was my snacky comeback

1062
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:03,160
for that? Besides, well, that doesn't have much to do with living in consciousness.

1063
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,240
We're eventually going to fill up the planet with crap to the point where there's no other animals

1064
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,580
left except humans. Then we will destroy our environment to the point where we devolve back

1065
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:24,200
to an animal-like state. And there's very few of us left. But from that point, the human-like

1066
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,920
little horrible devolved critters can then evolve back up into different things. There'll be little

1067
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,260
naked human-like things that live underground. There'll be little naked human-like things that

1068
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:39,240
fill the niche that moles have. There'll be humans that learn how to fly like flying squirrels and

1069
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:46,560
build little nests in the trees. Every creature will be descended from humans and they'll live on

1070
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,580
a horrible, disgusting planet made of plastic bottles like this. Now, there is a sub-genius.

1071
00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:01,760
Now I remember what the snappy comeback is. And it's actually looking towards the future.

1072
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,240
The sub-genius is back.

1073
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:11,060
I just believe in strength through disfigurement. That is, build up your immunities. Don't fret about

1074
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:18,400
whether this food is going to have too much sodium or might give you cholesterol or something.

1075
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:26,120
Go for it, man. Eat that burger. Just indulge in that. Don't resist temptation. Give in to them

1076
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:33,100
and build up your immunities. You know, strength through disfigurement. That gives

1077
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:39,580
people excuses for all kinds of terrible activities. You know, this is a religion.

1078
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:45,600
This isn't a science and it doesn't have to make sense. It only has to sound good. It's

1079
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,500
a pep talk. It's just to make you feel good for a little while. It doesn't have to be

1080
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,900
based on anything real. In fact, if it does make sense, it ain't a good religion. You

1081
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:02,760
don't use your mind to think about your religion, Bob said. You use your foot, your soul, your

1082
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,080
foot.

1083
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,460
It's right here. That's where you think. It's what you use to think about your religion.

1084
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,720
You walk on it. You don't sit there waiting. You get out there and walk on it. Friends,

1085
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,140
I got a thin soul.

1086
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,260
Maybe he's right. Maybe there is something the matter with me. Just don't see how a world

1087
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,540
full of such wonderful...

1088
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,460
Oh, God, there I go again.

1089
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:37,320
Now I'm ripping off Disney's Little Mermaid. Next thing I know, Michael Eisner will be suing

1090
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:45,880
me. Since when did art become so illegal? Who am I kidding? I'm a wash up. All I've

1091
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,240
ever done is rid on the coattails of other people's ideas and trying to cover up that

1092
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,100
fact by accusing others of stealing mine. The problem is there are no new ideas anymore.

1093
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,440
Just new rip-off versions of old ideas. Even the idea of this movie is a new idea. I'm

1094
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,260
a pessimistic internal monologue I stole from Woody Allen's cinematic asides in that last

1095
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,080
Ronald Redball Halloween show. Damn it.

1096
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:18,740
Well, I suppose it could be worse. It could be rainy. Great. I even stole that joke from

1097
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:24,880
Young Frankenstein. I'm through as an artist. I should just end it all. That'd teach me.

1098
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:31,220
I should just go and buy a shotgun and blow my useless head off. Christ, even that's been

1099
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:38,820
done before. Kurt Cobain stole that idea from Ernest Hemingway. Jeez, I've been walking

1100
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:45,880
a while now. This isn't such a good part of town. Where the hell is that art station?

1101
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,180
Where the hell am I? Somehow I don't think it's a good idea to be walking in this part

1102
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,280
of Oakland after midnight.

1103
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,920
Taxi! Taxi! You know, it'd just be my luck if some hopped up, crack-crazed gangbangers

1104
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,840
came around that corner and caught me in the crossfire of some drive-by vendetta shooting.

1105
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,760
That would be so typical.

1106
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,700
Get out of there! That's gunfire!

1107
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:38,040
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen. It's my sad duty to inform you that Phineas Narco has

1108
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:49,840
left the building and, well, apparently, he's been killed. I'm afraid this Megastar celebration

1109
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,740
telephone will just have to be cancelled. So, we now join our previously scheduled program,

1110
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,900
already in progress, Telecrime.

1111
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:13,080
You, on the other hand, might be a loner. A lot of subgeniuses are. You don't want some

1112
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:20,300
messiah breathing down your neck, waiting for you to check in and kiss his ass. And

1113
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:27,880
that's the wonderful thing about Bob. If you want to be alone, you can be alone with Bob!

1114
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,320
Yeah!

1115
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,100
Yeah!

1116
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,100


1117
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:30,420


1118
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:30,620
Yeah!

1119
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,040


1120
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,860
You're still alone! That's the miracle thing about Bob. He doesn't care about your sins.

1121
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:42,660
He comes not to forgive, but to rationalize your sins. He brings not forgiveness, but an

1122
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:49,420
excuse. And what did you really need? If you want your sins forgiven, friends, do it yourself.

1123
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:57,340
If you're a subgenius, you're probably already pretty good at that. Jesus may have died for

1124
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,200
your sins, but Bob Dobbs made a damn fool of himself.

1125
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,200


1126
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,800
And of you! For your sins. Praise his sweet name.

1127
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,160
Praise Bob!

1128
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:20,920
What did you say I was going to talk about here? I did compose the title, The Bob and B. Obama.

1129
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:30,960
Conspiracy and coincidence. But I didn't write the rest. I bet Ian Corrigan did. Can the president have slack?

1130
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:41,720
That would depend on the president, I guess. How does sheer dumb luck allow the vilest members of the species to pretend to rule the world?

1131
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,920
Well, you know what? It's not sheer dumb luck. It's called democracy.

1132
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:54,600
There's a serious problem with democracy. Sometimes I don't have any answers for that.

1133
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,940
Friends, if Bob Dobbs is who he says he is, he's already world overlord.

1134
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:05,180
And we sell little buttons over there that say, don't blame me, I voted for Bob.

1135
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,340
They'll come in handy no matter what.

1136
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:17,520
We also had a bumper sticker. Bob's sayings did not always come true, but one of them that did was, quote,

1137
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,120
it's gonna be a bummer, man.

1138
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,940
And you can't argue with that one. That one did.

1139
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,840
The other thing Bob said is the one law in our church.

1140
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:29,920
The one law in our church. The one law in our church.

1141
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,440
The one slogan that we live on, that you really can live by.

1142
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,860
The one thing that legitimizes the whole church of the subgenius is our one law.

1143
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,380
And I think some of you know what it is. It is, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1144
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:55,280
Pardon my English there. French, whatever. German, I think, is the original, where that word came from.

1145
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,700
But really, you can live by that philosophy.

1146
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:08,800
Try it. And see, you know, with the most frustrating moments of your life, try to remember that one line.

1147
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,180
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1148
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:21,700
Now, whenever I'm cutting these speeches for radio, I have to bleep every time I say that word.

1149
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,040
And then I suddenly lose perspective.

1150
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,680
And it's hard for me to say, fuck me if I can't take a joke.

1151
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,460
But I'm going to have to go bleep that one again.

1152
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,500
I might as well fill in the bleeps.

1153
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,460
Bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep.

1154
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,360
Okay, edit point there. Cut.

1155
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,280
You think I'm kidding.

1156
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:53,500
The only reason any subgenius is still alive is because all peeps and humans are such cringing, craving, gutless wonders.

1157
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,060
But forgive them first, and then kill them.

1158
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:05,260
Then he torched the place with a homemade flamethrower he'd brought along for the purpose.

1159
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,560
Unfortunately for Pardo, your homemade flamethrower needs very careful handling.

1160
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,820
He burned himself badly.

1161
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,800
Then he drove off in great pain and shot himself.

1162
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,780
No, just kidding. Just kidding. I really did have a New Year's resolution.

1163
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,040
This year I'm resolving to save not just the planet, but the entire society.

1164
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,240
Mr. Drummond, he was really a family man.

1165
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,840
And he knew the laws of this great land.

1166
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,780
And I say, why stop at the planet?

1167
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,360
You know, if the planet's messed up, oh.

1168
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,920
You tell him, Philo.

1169
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,240
The solar system's got to be worse, Shape.

1170
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,280
Hey, um.

1171
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,040
Well, they lost planets last year.

1172
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,960
Are you in line, Herod?

1173
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:58,020
We found them again, but, you know, I mean, you gotta wonder about a, you know, a scientific community that loses a planet every year.

1174
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,200
It's the scientific principle of the thing.

1175
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,620
That the principle of the thing.

1176
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,980
Yeah, you're gonna wear out that screwdriver.

1177
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,000
Hey, stop that. Stop feeding on that.

1178
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,640
It may seem only fundamental.

1179
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,980
But the basic fundamentals show the scientific principle of the thing.

1180
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,900
Bum, bum.

1181
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:24,440
Thank you, Puzzling Evidence and the Moon Man who met Hercules.

1182
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,320
Friends, you can help us save the universe.

1183
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,120
By looking at subgenius.com.

1184
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,120
Yes, subgenius.com.

1185
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,500
But, you know, one has to wonder.

1186
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:50,200
Could it be that the Church of the Subgenius itself is like what that kid at the Starwood revival was asking about?

1187
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,460
What he was worried about?

1188
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,840
Is the Church just another bunch of trash that's gonna help fill up the world?

1189
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,220
Pollution.

1190
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,380
Outdated from the 80s.

1191
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,920
Broken down.

1192
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,040
Toothless.

1193
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,100
Feeble.

1194
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,680
I'm sure Dr. Howell and Philo would agree.

1195
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,740
Of course not. It's useful. Recyclable.

1196
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,540
That's urban treasure.

1197
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:13,720
Reclaimable.

1198
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,740
It might not even have anything wrong with it.

1199
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,200
Some overly rich trust fund yuppie just got tired of it and threw it out.

1200
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,600
Could it also just not be a thing in it all?

1201
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,220
And just, it is a thing like an amorphous sort of...

1202
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,140
Indefined, non-qualifiable thing.

1203
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,820
There ya go.

1204
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,900
Could it be that?

1205
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,440
What if you did find some of that thing stuff?

1206
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,320
What would you do with it, Dr. Howell?

1207
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,460
Success and sex and real estate.

1208
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,900
You'd put it in your success course?

1209
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,420
I bet he'd take it to Ex Day because he's gotta be there.

1210
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,360
Your undifferentiated, amorphic appendage.

1211
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,860
The overman will be there too.

1212
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,100
Who will be there?

1213
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,280
Hey, I was thinking.

1214
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,000
Next year, do you guys want to ride out on the train together?

1215
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,860
Maybe next year.

1216
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,480
When you're riding on the train.

1217
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,040
And take a, like a cross country, uh, we could film it and make a big deal out of it.

1218
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,560
You know, like some geniuses go across country to go to Ex Day and go on the train.

1219
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,880
That's right. 2010. Ex Day.

1220
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:08,280
Yeah.

1221
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,800
Wanna do that, Howell?

1222
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,940
For 2010?

1223
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,960
Yeah.

1224
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,180
Yeah.

1225
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,000
He said next year.

1226
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,100
Will Amtrak be there in 2010 for you?

1227
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,540
It's been up to now.

1228
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:17,940
No, no, no.

1229
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,440
Will Amtrak be there for you?

1230
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:19,600
Yeah.

1231
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,680
We're getting down to just getting there will be the tough part.

1232
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,660
Will anything be there for me?

1233
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,120
Or you.

1234
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,040
Exactly.

1235
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:26,440
Or us.

1236
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,400
Will anything at all be floating around?

1237
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,280
It could be that the asteroid is here before that.

1238
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,260
I'm ready.

1239
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,260
Have you got your affairs in order?

1240
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,980
You're ready whether you know it or not.

1241
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,420
Oh yeah.

1242
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,320
And in fact, everyone is ready whether they're ready or not.

1243
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,580
Yeah, it's true.

1244
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,680
For ye never know when the master cometh.

1245
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,540
What?

1246
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,760
Because he waiteth for no man.

1247
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,320
And he is not even a he.

1248
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,840
It's not even a it.

1249
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,420
Not even a whole.

1250
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:53,640
It's just a thing.

1251
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,080
It's just a thing.

1252
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,460
It's not even a thing.

1253
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,340
An unthinkable thing.

1254
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,260
It's a thing you find on the street in San Francisco in the garbage.

1255
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,200
It's a senile space god from outer space.

1256
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:09,000
Any other description is just an arbitrary assumption by a human mind and intellect that's

1257
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,620
too weak to absorb the consequences of such a thing.

1258
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,880
Balderdash and Falderal.

1259
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,400
Well, you may say so and yet you don't even know what Balderdash actually is.

1260
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,820
It's made of.

1261
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,700
Mmm, made of delicious succotash and Henry Chung's orient spices.

1262
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,640
Yeah, I had some of that.

1263
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,540
I had loads of that on my plate.

1264
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,180
With a little bit of turmeric too.

1265
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:34,980
Mmm.

1266
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,060
It really adds to the spicy, smoky flavor.

1267
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,640
Ah.

1268
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,620
So let's have another barbecue.

1269
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:49,700
What a huge, fixed steak that costs $16 down on the grill and it looks quiet out there.

1270
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,300
Maybe it looks too quiet.

1271
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,920
It's a little too quiet, yeah.

1272
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,260
Right.

1273
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,380
It's a little too quiet.

1274
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1275
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1276
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1277
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1278
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1279
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1280
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1281
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1282
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1283
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1284
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1285
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1286
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1287
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1288
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,380


1289
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,160
Yeah, right, exactly.

1290
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,320
Oh wait, you ran out of paint you say?

1291
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:56,960
Oh no.

1292
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,620
Well, it's too quiet but um.

1293
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,480
But not for me.

1294
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,560
For you.

1295
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,400
But there's something to be said for silence.

1296
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:05,960
For you.

1297
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,220
Praise Ba.

1298
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,780
But not for me.

1299
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,880
For you.

1300
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,520
But not for me.

1301
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,680
For you.

1302
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:15,860
Praise Ba.

1303
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:15,860


1304
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:15,860


1305
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:15,860
