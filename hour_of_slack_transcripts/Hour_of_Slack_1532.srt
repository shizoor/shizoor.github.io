1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
It's a machine.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,660
Isn't that right, Bob?

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,720
What that thing was, was up.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,380
And that music.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,860
It's the hour of slack.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,400
Slack.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,140
Number 1532.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:44,020
And we're listening to a recording from last night of the devotional of a band known as Rural War Room.

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,180
And they're in the house tonight.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,420
We'll be hearing from them.

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,360
But for now, we'll just hear them.

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:24,840
Rural War Room.

13
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,300
Rural War Room.

14
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,940
Rural War Room.

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
Rural War Room.

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,520
This is really wonderful.

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
I don't know what to say.

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,480
Rural War Room.

19
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,480
Rural War Room.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,960
I start to hear the voices of the ocean as well.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,000
Rural War Room.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,840
Rural War Room.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:54,840


24
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,700
Oh, that's so fabulous.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,260
This is awesome.

26
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,180
Oh, that's so fabulous.

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, that's so fabulous.

28
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,420
Yeah!

29
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,120
One, two, one, two.

30
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,960
Praise Bob.

31
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,120
And that was Rural War Room last night

32
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,980
at the devotional of 2015

33
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,680
dedicated to the devos.

34
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,000
But tonight it's Hour of Slack.

35
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,620
Straight here, live from our studios

36
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,620
at KTFT, Fort Worth, Texas.

37
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,700
No, wait, this isn't Slam Bank Theater.

38
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,760
It is the hour.

39
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,120
It's Hour of Slack.

40
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,780
And we had a great time at the devotional.

41
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,820
Stayed up late, watched all the bands.

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,260
The headlining band was what you just heard.

43
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,940
That was recorded with my little hand recorder

44
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,400
and may not do justice to the real thing

45
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,220
now that I hear it on good headphones.

46
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,240
But we dragged back with us

47
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,100
one of the members of Rural War Room.

48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,840
There's only three.

49
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,280
There's only three of them.

50
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,280
And the other two had much better sense.

51
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,460
I think they're at Cedar Point or something.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,300
But Byron Werner, St. Byron Werner is here.

53
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,960
He's an old friend.

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,940
And he's also someone we've known for a long time.

55
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,180
He was involved with the subgenius meteor barrage projects

56
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,840
and artwork and all kinds of interesting stuff

57
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,400
since the year of 1980.

58
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,380


59
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,380
And...

60
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,880
You can imagine as you listen to us

61
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,860
someone who looks kind of like a cross

62
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,420
between Moses and Chappie,

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,600
that robot in the movie.

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,040
So...

65
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
That's a surprise to me.

66
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,740
I was going for kind of a Nicolas Cage look.

67
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,420
I wouldn't have thought that.

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Hello, everybody.

69
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,620
I've been on board the subgenius wagon

70
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,200
since, well, 35 years.

71
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,940
Oh, my God.

72
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,660
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,640
It's scary when you think about it.

74
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,940
It's the 35th anniversary.

75
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,640
And it shows.

76
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,200
Oh, God.

77
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,020
I can feel it in every joint.

78
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,320
And also the parts of my body that move and bend.

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,100
Oh.

80
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,740
So...

81
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,860
Here.

82
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,740
Here.

83
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,520
So we're going to be playing...

84
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,160
It's an unusual show

85
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,540
because usually we don't allow anyone in the studio with us.

86
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,240
And we're going to be playing Rural War Room music.

87
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,640
Back on and off all the...

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,880
What was this in the background?

89
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,080
Johann George Albrechtsberger.

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,940
Hmm.

91
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,580
Okay.

92
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,420
Sure.

93
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Background.

94
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,580
It's fine.

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,000
So what were some of the instruments you were using last night?

96
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Will, one of them was a grunt horn,

97
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,100
which is a deer call with a flexible sort of sleeve on it

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,040
that I can reach in and press on the reed.

99
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,160
And on the end of it,

100
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,100
I put a toilet plunger bell, I guess you'd call it,

101
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,100
to be able to use another one to kind of give it a wah-wah.

102
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,580
And it goes everything from a...

103
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
sort of sound all the way up to a...

104
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,420
It's both hilarious and tortured sounding at the same time.

105
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,240
It's the best.

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,320
Very few instruments are like that.

107
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,960
Yes.

108
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,780
Have you ever heard a coyote call?

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
I've heard...

110
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,900
Yes.

111
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,680
I've heard...

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,760
Look.

113
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,800
It's kind of high yips.

114
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,980
No, no.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,820
It's not supposed to sound like a coyote.

116
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,900
It's supposed to sound like a rabbit in a trap screaming.

117
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,140
It's the most horrendous screaming noise, if it's done right.

118
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,860
I think...

119
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,600
You could probably use that in your band along with your other...

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,000
I think that was a jackalope, wasn't it?

121
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,320
No, listen to that Jew's harp in the background.

122
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,420
That's a fine, fine Jew's harp right there.

123
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,140
Yeah.

124
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,000
You know why you don't find a whole lot of jackalopes around these days?

125
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,480
Well, they're extinct in most parts.

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,280
They're delicious.

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,640
Really?

128
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,400
Oh, yeah.

129
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,580
You know, in West Texas, they look down on...

130
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,080
You know, it's like if you eat jackalope, that's for low-class people.

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Well, see, what you do is you get it.

132
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,960
You don't even have to take the fur off it.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Just take it, turn it upside down, stick those antlers in the ground, kind of angle it over the fire.

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,800
And that way, you know...

135
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,460
Well, you've got to scan it.

136
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:53,960
It's all set to...

137
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,660
You don't have to.

138
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,340
Yeah, you have to skin it.

139
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,740
He says you don't have to skin it.

140
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,660
It'll burn all the hair off, and then it leaves that nice, crispy coating that some folks like.

141
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,180
Well, like I say, where I come from, we consider jackalope to be...

142
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,000
Kentucky-fried jackalope.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,680
You know, that's...

144
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,940
Kentucky-burnt jackalope.

145
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,280
It's tasty, but technically, it's illegal.

146
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,320
They're endangered.

147
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,580
Yeah, well, you guys don't eat catfish either.

148
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,460
Well, sometimes.

149
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,700
No.

150
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,940
I mean, we take the hair off of them.

151
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,440
For sure.

152
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,480
That's one thing I know.

153
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm not going to eat no catfish with the hair still on it.

154
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,740
That's gross.

155
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,860
There was a guy...

156
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,220
It's crazy.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,160
That's crazy talk.

158
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,020
That didn't make any sense.

159
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,380
Catfish.

160
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,020
There was a guy that said, you know how we cook catfish back in Texas?

161
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,480
I said, of course, no.

162
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,040
He said, well, you get a cow patty.

163
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,480
You put a catfish down on top of it.

164
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,100
You put another cow patty on top of that.

165
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,940
You cook that up for a while, and then you open it up and take the catfish out and throw away the catfish.

166
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,200
And eat the cow patties.

167
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,980
Da-bum-tsch.

168
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,400
Well, like, again...

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,620
That's just what I was told.

170
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm not saying that.

171
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,020
Some families do that, and some people buy their cow patties at the supermarket already catfish-ized.

172
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,320
You know, it depends on whether you're a po-bucker or what.

173
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,780
It depends on how you take your cow pies.

174
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,220
Hey, I'm getting hungry.

175
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,460
Well, that's the thing.

176
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,920
I hate to talk about it.

177
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,160
I hate to talk about food.

178
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,800
It makes all the radio listeners all excited, and me too.

179
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,460
My stomach's grumbling.

180
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,920
My mouth is watering just thinking of that catfish hair.

181
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,820
So, Lonesome Cowboy Dave should be calling in any second.

182
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:48,300
Otherwise, I would put on another World War Room cut, which we still could.

183
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,700
Just keep Dave hanging.

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,720
Yeah.

185
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,260
We could.

186
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,140
We could.

187
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,280
We could.

188
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,500
We could.

189
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,700
We could.

190
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:53,920
We could.

191
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


194
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


195
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


196
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


197
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


198
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


199
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:53,920


200
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,140
We could.

201
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


202
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


203
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


204
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


205
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


206
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


207
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,140


208
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,800
You just handed me that we're going to put on.

209
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,520
It's a cover of a Devo song called I'm a Potato.

210
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,720
Oh, another Devo cover.

211
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,000
You guys do a lot more than just cover Devo.

212
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,200
Yes.

213
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,080
You only do that to get attention in Cleveland.

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Well, I'm doing that because we just played this gig, and we're high on the Devo vibe.

215
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,340
Yeah.

216
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,680
That's easy to have.

217
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,420
That's why they do that stuff.

218
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,140
Is we not men's?

219
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,120
Okay, let's go ahead and whip it out, then.

220
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,700
Here it is.

221
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,500
I wish you pretty much knows that stuff.

222
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,200
No, it's not.

223
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,400
Actually, until the song is gone.

224
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,400


225
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,400


226
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,400


227
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,400


228
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,420


229
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,420


230
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,420


231
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,020
Of course it's a scene where I understand why I'm suspecting their kung fu a little bit.

232
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,380
I think it was to Всё とるると安全。

233
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,680
The Government Department, as well.

234
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:51,680


235
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:45,060
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

236
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:09,360
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

237
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

238
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:10,460
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,620
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

240
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

241
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

242
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:03,020
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

243
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

244
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:19,820
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

245
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,540
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

246
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:21,660
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

247
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,900
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

248
00:18:51,900 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

249
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

250
00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:06,060
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

251
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm a potato and I'm so bad

252
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,400
Have a break and wake up

253
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,400


254
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,400


255
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,920
And know my heart

256
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,280
And know my heart

257
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,220
And know my heart

258
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,380
Thickness and everything

259
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,720
Thickness and everything

260
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,240
Lights in the dark

261
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,660
Fires and all that

262
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,400
a hippopotamus on the cover with a halo

263
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,960
and a big fireball coming out of his mouth.

264
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,160
That's the flaming yawn.

265
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,840
But flaming yawn is actually a pun on filet mignon.

266
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,480
So the next time you're in a fancy restaurant,

267
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,680
ask for a flaming yawn.

268
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,180
And they'll bring you a steak.

269
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Not what you asked for at all.

270
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,540
It would be a big old slab of hippopotamus.

271
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,840
And this is a song called Trouble From Within

272
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,220
which we did with the group Die Alten Maschinen

273
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,520
which is from the Czech Republic

274
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,060
that our friend Jerry Casale also did a song with Die Alten Maschinen.

275
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,460
So this has also got bleepo on it.

276
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,600
Good lord.

277
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
It's crammed with subgeniuses.

278
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,280
Yes it is.

279
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,640
See?

280
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,240
I'm planning, you know.

281
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm trying to tie in all these loose ends

282
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,440
or these loose cannons.

283
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,740
Dave has had trouble with loose ends today, he told me earlier.

284
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,720
But that's probably more.

285
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,580
We need to know.

286
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,680
Oh, loose ends, yes.

287
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,120
Okay, I'm going to play this song.

288
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,900
Okay.

289
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,680
If this really is a song.

290
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,360
It's song-like.

291
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,180
Okay, here goes.

292
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,100
Standby and action.

293
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,460
Fast.

294
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,420
The times were bad.

295
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,180
Roll us.

296
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,800
Kicking.

297
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,380
Set things right.

298
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,700
They need kicking.

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,700
Our best friends helped us out.

300
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,440
Spend our lives.

301
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,180
Enjoy the luxury.

302
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,840
The life's ain't that easy, everybody's been a slave.

303
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,840
Chug, chug, chug.

304
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,820
Then it seems to be a lie.

305
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,520
We became independent.

306
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,500
On all the repercussions.

307
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,380
Chug, chug, chug.

308
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,940
Such an individual.

309
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,180
Seeing many other gays.

310
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,860
Trying to call attention to all the little sense of ways.

311
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,660
We are never limited.

312
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,560
By the very end, it's dead.

313
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,480
May the cozy hand be tapped.

314
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Chug, chug, chug.

315
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,600
Then they flexed.

316
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,340
Their control brought us down.

317
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,540
From within.

318
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,580
We were caught in their web.

319
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,800
Chug, chug, chug.

320
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
They're all out there.

321
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,200


322
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,040
Out.

323
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,900
Must.

324
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,600
Some.

325
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,620
Away.

326
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,140
Out.

327
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,720
I took all those scientists.

328
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,700
Thinking of the common parts.

329
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
That'll cross another mind.

330
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,380
Chug, chug, chug.

331
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,160
I don't wish to interfere.

332
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,980
We're the world's century.

333
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,680
Then it hit us.

334
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,020
How are you?

335
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,820
Chug, chug, chug.

336
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,540
Magnetic at the head.

337
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,160
Found the intercession.

338
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,500
Flip around.

339
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,200
Coming off a star.

340
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,640
It's all right.

341
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,340
Fumbles on the ground.

342
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,200
Now we both have a chance.

343
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,200
We're all hands on the Russian women.

344
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,800
They look like they do.

345
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
Chug, chug, chug.

346
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,200
Chug, chug.

347
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,100
Chug, chug.

348
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,560
Chug, chug.

349
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,480
Chug, chug.

350
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,780
Chug, chug, chug.

351
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't think this mess produced carbon to the underground.

352
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,720
Made a waste out of town.

353
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,540
Chug, chug.

354
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,500
Fill us with the magic we need.

355
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,300
Start to go after the exam.

356
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,180
We're getting at the upper hand.

357
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Chug, chug.

358
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,020
Who says that life is peaceful?

359
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,760
She took the gold she ate.

360
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,460
Make hell a waste.

361
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:20,780
I need a house.

362
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,340
I need a home to operate.

363
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,400
Who has read up in the end?

364
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
Every woman burning a hole.

365
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,140
Yeah, it's trying to overhaul.

366
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,580
Chug, chug.

367
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,800
Who has worked for us once more?

368
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,560
But they're just as certified.

369
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,400
Cause they've all been modified.

370
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,260
Chug, chug.

371
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,040
There is no more scrutiny.

372
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,940
Turn into the paranoid.

373
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,000
Bring us out the androids.

374
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,760
Chug, chug.

375
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,520
Re-introduce obedience.

376
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,560
Special programs any day.

377
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,380
Strip up the imbalances.

378
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,280
Triple-fuck the human race.

379
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,120
Announce the rule by Necrotas.

380
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,000
Nanny S is where my choice.

381
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,920
We're both on the go-back course.

382
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,680
Chug, chug.

383
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,800
Chug, chug.

384
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,040
Chug, chug.

385
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,080
Chug, chug.

386
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,800
Good Lord, Pat.

387
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,000
I wish everyone could have been looking at those lyrics as I was.

388
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,720
Boy, they go through fast, don't they?

389
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,520
They sure do.

390
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,600
I would say it was jarring.

391
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,800
Somewhat remarkable.

392
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,920
A bit twisty and twinkly.

393
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,920
Somewhat unique in the fact that there's nothing you can do about repeating one thing 300 times.

394
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,640
Uh, we just like to do something different.

395
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,880
I think no other song really sounds like that.

396
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,380
Are those lyrics available?

397
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,440
If someone were to purchase that

398
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,060
and they wanted to...

399
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,880
to have the lyrics,

400
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,940
would they come printed with it?

401
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,340
I made up a bunch of them.

402
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,620
I hope they all still have the lyric sheet inside,

403
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,100
because that was very important to me.

404
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,160
And, uh...

405
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,920
And, uh...

406
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,380
It was an experiment to write lyrics for...

407
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,540
for a song where it's going too fast to actually catch it,

408
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,700
but it's all about a robot uprising

409
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,380
and how humanity got the upper hand once again.

410
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,320
A fairy tale, in other words.

411
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,620
Yeah, we're...

412
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,600
We're gonna lose our asses in the robot war right away.

413
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,040
It...

414
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,840
Excuse me, Dave?

415
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,860
How's that?

416
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,740
I'm sure you're ready for the robot war now, is what I mean.

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Um...

418
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm ready to...

419
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,240
to sell out my race to...

420
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,200
to the robots at any time,

421
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,740
as long as I can get something good.

422
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,380
You know, like a good, uh, stereo set or something.

423
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,280
Speakers.

424
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,580
I just wanna taste a real steak again.

425
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,420
I'm on five minutes with that robot girl over there.

426
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,180
That's all it'll take, believe me.

427
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,880
Well, when they're really well-made, yeah.

428
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,120
Mmm.

429
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,720
Ah, yes.

430
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,640
Love delicious.

431
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,340
Well, uh, there were some strange, strange sounds last night.

432
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm, uh...

433
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,620
I don't know how you guys got Ema Sumac in your band.

434
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,000
She looks a lot different.

435
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,980
She's so much younger than I would've expected.

436
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,740
Uh, she...

437
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,820
I always think she'd be older than me by now.

438
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,380
She... she transported in from the astral plane in a new body.

439
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,060
Nice.

440
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,760
She does that well.

441
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,480
Wow.

442
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,540
Now, that's...

443
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,220
You've got an agent that can do something like that.

444
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,500
You're in business in Hollywood.

445
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,860
Uh, they've been activists.

446
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,440
You've got somebody like that working for you.

447
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,860
He has the power of many theosophistic dogs and gods

448
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,940
that we all worship, uh, secretly.

449
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:57,980
Uh...

450
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,120
You know...

451
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,360
Actually, I had to leave Hollywood under a witness relocation program,

452
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,140
and I...

453
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm not supposed to talk about it now,

454
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,640
Now I'm blowing the whole thing.

455
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,220
Never mind.

456
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,340
What you talked about this morning was all the ray gun scenes that you did on all those movies.

457
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,120
Why don't you thrill our listeners and tell us all the different ray gun scenes that you had to...

458
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,960
Probably the best ray gun scene is the big Ghostbuster guns that shoot out those beams with the little things swirling around them.

459
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,400
You're not supposed to cross the beams.

460
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,140
Yeah, I worked on that one.

461
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,500
I worked on the electric beams, the lightning bolts that come out of the gozer's hand.

462
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:43,580
At the Ghostbusters, I helped them blow away the big Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

463
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,460
I worked on Star Wars, the original one, number one.

464
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,620
You were the guy in the R2-D2 suit, right?

465
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,740
I saw a picture of you inside of it.

466
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:58,300
I worked on the scene where the giant laser beam shoots down the tunnel there.

467
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,780
You can see all the different layers of the beam.

468
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,600
Boy, that was a mess.

469
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,740
I helped to blow up Alderaan.

470
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,100
The Death Star.

471
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,520
And I worked on Tron and Buckaroo Banzai.

472
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,200
Something Wicked This Way Comes.

473
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,220
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

474
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,660
Titanic.

475
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,820
Dante's Peak.

476
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,260
I'm building up to the good ones, you know?

477
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,900
Star Trek Nemesis.

478
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:36,460
And you were having such a great time working in Hollywood that you decided to move to Little Rock and work for the city.

479
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,520
You were in the city library, right?

480
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:46,060
No, I decided if I was going to lose my eyesight, my health, and my sanity doing artwork, I was wanting to do that on my own artwork.

481
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,920
And in Little Rock, you can afford to be a starving artist.

482
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,720
Plus, people were feeding you.

483
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,260
When they saw your beard, they assumed you were homeless.

484
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,780
Yes, and I had a number of responses for them all set, but never put them into practice.

485
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,460
I wanted to say, well, ma'am.

486
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,820
I'm not hungry, but I could sure use some sex.

487
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,420
But people were...

488
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,620
Byron was sporting a bit of a Duck Dynasty look for a while there.

489
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,900
And people were pulling over as he was walking to work.

490
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,020
And I had a bag over my shoulder, you know?

491
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,580
People would pull over and go, do you need some food, old fella?

492
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,660
Do you want a sandwich? What?

493
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,240
Could you wash my windshield, please, sir?

494
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,360
Hard to imagine for me, but...

495
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,480
I would urine on their windshield.

496
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,840
And then start to wipe it down.

497
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,180
They'd get all upset. I don't know.

498
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,040
Well, I think that's what any noble, young, human American in the United States of America would do today.

499
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,300
Especially under the pressures of various reasons.

500
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,760
To, like, crackpot regimes all the way from...

501
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,840
All over the place.

502
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,300
Oh, I'm not a young person by any stretch of the imagination.

503
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,200
Well, I figured if you were R2-D2's underwear and stuff, you had to be at least 45.

504
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,260
Uh, yeah.

505
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,120
Mm-hmm.

506
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,560
Mm-hmm.

507
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,560


508
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,920
Mm-hmm.

509
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,360
Mm-hmm.

510
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


511
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


512
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


513
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


514
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


515
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


516
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


517
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


518
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


519
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,520


520
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,980
I'd make some moves on me, but, you know, I didn't.

521
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,160
But, you know, one night, they got into those cantina masks.

522
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,740
Oh, boy, was that fun.

523
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Posing for pictures.

524
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,160
3-D pictures on the set of Star Wars.

525
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,560
Oh, boy.

526
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,580
Hello.

527
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,140
Um, let me see.

528
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,520
Which one we're going to play here?

529
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,280
Making light of such a salutary career.

530
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,300
It was 30 years in the dark, you know?

531
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,120
Sitting in a little dark room, 10-hour, 12-hour days, just tracing off little shapes.

532
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,080
Boy, does that sound glamorous and fun, huh?

533
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,540
No stars, no flashy stuff.

534
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,980
When they need you, they really need you.

535
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,740
When they don't need you, they really don't need you.

536
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,320
But they want you to hang around so that when they need you, you're all set to go.

537
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,960
Well, but you say you didn't hang around a bunch of stars, but I know that, like,

538
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,780
for instance, your bachelor party, don't worry, I'm not going to.

539
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,100
But you had people like the Devos and the Simpsons.

540
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,100


541
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,100


542
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,660
The Simpsons themselves were there.

543
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:14,020
Well, not the Simpsons, but we did have one of the creators of P-Dog was there.

544
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,640
And I think it's safe to say at this late date that, yes, Kitten Natividad was the performer.

545
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,080
Oh, we can say that.

546
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,700
Yes, we can.

547
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,140
Go ahead.

548
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,920
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

549
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,040
I'm not married anymore.

550
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,080
We're not going to get in trouble.

551
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,120
Who paid for Kitten?

552
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,500
Was it Matt Granig or my brother's father?

553
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,360
A number of people.

554
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,040
I understand.

555
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,420
Robert Williams.

556
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,080
He put it in.

557
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,680
He put it in some money.

558
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,880
And I think George DiCaprio, Leonardo's dad.

559
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,600
This sounds like a bunch of hogwash, friends, but actually, Byron has been a really big

560
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,200
part of the underground comic book and underground publishing and everything underground that

561
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,040
doesn't get you famous.

562
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,840
Yeah.

563
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,660
Or they're extremely wealthy.

564
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,540
No.

565
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,100
Beyond your imagination.

566
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,220
No, I'm not wealthy at all.

567
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,480
I'm on Social Security now.

568
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,280
That's a blast.

569
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,560
That's a blast.

570
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,060
No more Miller High Life.

571
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,440
Woo-hoo.

572
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,480
But you got slack.

573
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,120
You know, more rotoscoping for John Hollywood movies.

574
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,460
Yeah.

575
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,360
And see...

576
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,060
You get coffee, coffee, coffee, and lemon pie.

577
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,160
You just, you know, every day is a different, brand new, really stupid day.

578
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,600
And, you know what I mean?

579
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,580
Every day is a brand new beginning and all that.

580
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,820
And manana is so good.

581
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,020
Okay.

582
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,800
Oh, here's the cool part of Blockhead from last night.

583
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,620
And we're off a quarter.

584
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,680
Okay.

585
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,860
And I didn't agree at all.

586
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,840
Yeah, I know.

587
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:37,620
Blockhead.

588
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah, I know.

589
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,840
Blockhead.

590
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,080
Hey, guys.

591
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,620
Blockhead.

592
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,540
My recording just doesn't do justice.

593
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,820
No.

594
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,860
You kind of had to have been there, unfortunately.

595
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,180
You really just didn't taste that delicious voice.

596
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Oh, she's got an ethereal voice, doesn't she?

597
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,380
She does.

598
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,440
I can't believe we had someone who sings that well.

599
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,420
I see.

600
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,540
There's a little snoring in our living room this morning.

601
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,720
I heard no snoring.

602
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,900
That was probably Donovan snoring, I'm guessing.

603
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,980
No, I was just kidding.

604
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,880
Oh, humorous.

605
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,060
I like to think of beautiful ladies snoring horribly because I witness that almost every night.

606
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,040
I think of beautiful women farting.

607
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,360
Yeah, that's a good thing to know that.

608
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,440
That'll keep a man in step.

609
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,480
Knowing that women are not below excreting.

610
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,220
inflations.

611
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,360
They act like it.

612
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,220
Some of them hold it in a long time.

613
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,460
That's why they're acting that way.

614
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,960
Now, boys, boys, let's not get all

615
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,740
Trumpy here.

616
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,180
I'm going to play...

617
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,740
Especially if you're working in close quarters.

618
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,700
You've got to get in the other room

619
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,300
real quickly. What did you leave for?

620
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,480
Where did you go? I went out to the hallway

621
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,760
to make a loud sound.

622
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,860
It's not very...

623
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,220
I've been eating lots of vegetables.

624
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,140
Kill me, you know?

625
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,280
It's going to manifest itself

626
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,860
somehow.

627
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,660
It's another voice speaking.

628
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,060
Alright, what is this

629
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,800
next song that you handed me

630
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,280
that we can play?

631
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,120
This is another one by the Devos.

632
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,620
This is called Auto-Mowdown.

633
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,200
Mutant Mountain Boys did a cover of that last night.

634
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,040
Princess Wee is a new member of the

635
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,980
Mutant... She's a new boy in the Mutant

636
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,520
Mountain Boys.

637
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,320
Congratulations.

638
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,600
Congratulations.

639
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Thank you.

640
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,540
That was fun.

641
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,740
And action.

642
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,760

Let's listen for a longere

661
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,300


662
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,300


663
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,960
Week

664
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:32,960


665
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:32,960


666
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:32,960


667
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:32,960


668
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:32,760
,

669
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,500
guitar solo

670
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,180
guitar solo

671
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,220
guitar solo

672
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,840
guitar solo

673
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,160
guitar solo

674
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,400
guitar solo

675
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,360
Here we go.

676
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,220
Yeah.

677
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
I love that one.

678
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,860
I must say it sounds like

679
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,400
the soundtrack of my life.

680
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,220
Unfortunately or unfortunately.

681
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,420
I didn't like the references

682
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,440
to transgender chimpanzees.

683
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,980
I didn't think that was very...

684
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,380
Well, you gotta get

685
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,480
with that, Daddy-O, because that's part of the new age

686
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,140
that's coming. I'm still looking for one

687
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,660
to take on my work.

688
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,260
That was originally on

689
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,180
one of the not necessarily beautiful

690
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,060
but mutated sets, and

691
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,280
we've accumulated

692
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,540
a whole bunch of those and a couple

693
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,300
other cuts on a new CD

694
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,160
that we've got, Rural War Room

695
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,820
Devolved, featuring

696
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,900
Theramina and Pivo,

697
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,900
and you can find out information

698
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,020
about that and about our

699
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,960
radio show at

700
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,440
RuralWarRoom.com

701
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,060
Theramina is the

702
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,820
vocalist, the beautiful female

703
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,480
vocalist, right? Yes.

704
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,020
Does she have an Amy Kamish

705
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,260
like voice? I don't

706
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,740
know. It's kind of...

707
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,460
Can you assume that is?

708
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,180
It's impolite to ask a woman's history.

709
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,680
If she wants to volunteer,

710
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,440
volunteer that, that's one thing, but, you know,

711
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,120
I'm trying to be

712
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,360
polite, you know.

713
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,840
I'm kind of slow to the game.

714
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,500
How did that little funny-looking guy ever score her?

715
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,700
It's a long story.

716
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,720
I'm just kidding.

717
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,280
I could tell that guy said that

718
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,440
he's a sex machine. You can tell

719
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,500
by the spaz style of

720
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,560
his dancing and singing.

721
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,260
Spazier somebody is, the

722
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,320
sexier they are. That's what

723
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,360
we know in the Church of the Set Genius

724
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,920
and the Devo's.

725
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,560
Spaz equals sex.

726
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,500
Spaz is the new black.

727
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,260
That's right.

728
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,860
I mean color, not

729
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,680
race.

730
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
Spaz is a race, isn't it, though?

731
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,600
Isn't spaz a race?

732
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
Ever since

733
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,000
Bob took over.

734
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,840
There's no first prize

735
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,380
at the end because there is no end.

736
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,320
Of course, that sounds like a

737
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,240
prayer.

738
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,680
A prayer.

739
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:30,720


740
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,400
A prayer.

741
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,660
A prayer.

742
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


743
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


744
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


745
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


746
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


747
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


748
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


749
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


750
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


751
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:31,660


752
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,520
Unfortunately, that one was right.

753
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,420
Actually, it was a fun movie.

754
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,780
I'll never forget it.

755
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,640
Byron, I was meaning to ask you

756
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,300
for about 10 years now.

757
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,160
What's with the name

758
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,320
of the band? It's really hard to pronounce.

759
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,380
Rural

760
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,180
War Room.

761
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,020
Well, the idea was

762
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,000
that if we chose a name that was

763
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,780
difficult, and

764
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,160
it looks perfectly innocent when it's

765
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,000
written out. It's only when you go to say it

766
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,020
that it dissolves.

767
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,480
It's kind of like playing with the language

768
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,000
where stuff dissolves as you say it.

769
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,360
And we thought if we can get something

770
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,300
that's difficult, the people

771
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,220
that really are paying attention, they'll

772
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,360
learn how to say it. Once you know how to say it,

773
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,320
it's fun. Even if you say it

774
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,060
perfectly, people are going to go, the what?

775
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,700
And so

776
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,460
I told Donovan, you know,

777
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,180
if we're going to use this name, we've got to throw it off

778
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,500
like it's no problem

779
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,720
in the world. So we

780
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,220
would get together and drink a lot of beer and say

781
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,940
over and over again,

782
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,660
Rural War Room.

783
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,940
Rural War Room.

784
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,660
I said, let everyone else make the

785
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,700
Scooby-Doo jokes. We've got to

786
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,020
nail it.

787
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,840
And, uh,

788
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,660
well, our slogan on the

789
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,580
radio show is Worldwide Weird

790
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,620
because we play a lot of international

791
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,440
stuff and it's, we

792
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,740
like the weird. We don't think people are weird enough

793
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,680
and we're trying to give a frame of

794
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,600
reference, just expose people to

795
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,400
stuff they haven't heard before. Whether they

796
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,180
like it or not, that's up to them. But

797
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,240
if you don't like it, hang on. There'll be

798
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,360
else in five minutes.

799
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,420
What station? What's the name of that station in

800
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,520
Little Rock? K-A-B-F.

801
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,140
Right. I should know that.

802
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,420
And they never played

803
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,380
Hour of Slack, though, so who cares?

804
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,560
Uh, actually, we do play

805
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,100
some Hour of Slacks when

806
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,440
we exit the

807
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,620
the station and there's

808
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,360
nobody on until the morning we put on.

809
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,400
That's what they do here, too. So we've been

810
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,380
playing some Hour of Slacks, so back off,

811
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,400
fella. Oh, okay.

812
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,320
You've got an attitude.

813
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Yes, I do.

814
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,600
But I just believe that that song,

815
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,520
the name, or the name

816
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,800
Rural War Room, is fraught

817
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,560
with layers. It's filled with

818
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,460
names like, uh,

819
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,500
Decker Poundcake, or

820
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,460
something. You're guaranteed

821
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,440
that people have thought of this

822
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,800
before in advance, you know, not just you storyboard

823
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,320
guys in the PR room.

824
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,700
It just goes all the way to the very

825
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
top. And if you consider what

826
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,240
a rural war room might be,

827
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,200
that might be taking all those, um,

828
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,140
co-workers and Sandy Hook guys

829
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,600
off their cheesecake butts and

830
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,700
out to, um,

831
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,600
I don't know, shoot more ducks or something.

832
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,160
I don't know what they've been doing.

833
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,640
Hey, Dave, the music in the background is

834
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,600
you on guitar, believe it or not.

835
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,840
You probably can't hear it.

836
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,560
It's some witch disco

837
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,600
that I recorded. It sounds like

838
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,860
I recorded it because it's kind of muddy.

839
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,180
I love the witch disco.

840
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,120
I swear to God.

841
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,640
I bet that's for the kids.

842
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,860
I recorded it at a winter star in one of those

843
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,360
cabins. Really?

844
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,560
That's what it kind of sounds like to me.

845
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,980
Party tape.

846
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,620
Yeah. But, uh, yeah, that's

847
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,880
the late Chaz and the early Dave.

848
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,680
Ah, Chaz.

849
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,500
I miss the guy.

850
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,000
Oh, that's why you knew Chaz.

851
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,860
Because you came to a couple of X Days

852
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,900
when he was still around.

853
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,880
And I also wrote him a letter

854
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,800
once, and just to warn him

855
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,540
about Mojo.

856
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,580
Oh, right. Yeah, because he ended up

857
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,720
working for Dr. Mojo.

858
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,140
I said, look, there's you, and there's Legume,

859
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,040
and there's Mojo. Well,

860
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:10,920
you know,

861
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,860
I'm a, quote, friend of his.

862
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,040
That was in those days. I said,

863
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,480
you know, he kind of models his life

864
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,540
after the Three Stooges. Well, he's Mojo,

865
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,560
so he's going to be Mo.

866
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,600
Oh, I never got that.

867
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,860
And then Legume, he's got the bald head, so he's going to be Curly.

868
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,580
So what does that leave for you, Larry?

869
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,700
The schlub.

870
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,460
You've got to remember that as mean as

871
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,760
Mo is to

872
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,260
Curly, that's his

873
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,060
brother. He's not going to hurt him. But you,

874
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,560
he doesn't care. He's going to slap your face

875
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,740
solid until it's like

876
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,720
the sole of a shoe.

877
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,280
So, you know, I went on

878
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,100
and on, and Chaz writes me back and goes,

879
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,320
oh, oh, God, I'm laughing so

880
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,160
hard I can't breathe. I just

881
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,860
really got him. He thought it was a joke.

882
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,200
I was seriously warning

883
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,160
him in gentle

884
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,140
terms that anyone could absorb,

885
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,380
you know, and refer to.

886
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,420
Well, you know, it's

887
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,340
ironic because

888
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,140
he, Mojo,

889
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,500
this friend of ours, he's a rocket scientist

890
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,340
actually, and yet still

891
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,320
a subgenius. He had

892
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,460
worked on that old 3D

893
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,320
program Bryce, which was pretty

894
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,620
popular in the previous century.

895
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,340
And he wanted to make a Bryce

896
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,400
killer. He wanted to create

897
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,080
the new

898
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,440
Minecraft, but instead he created

899
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,180
the new Mojo world.

900
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,360
And it just didn't take off.

901
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,960
The way Minecraft

902
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,540
did wasn't quite the same.

903
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,460
No, it wasn't in real

904
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,420
time. You had to render it,

905
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,220
and it was incredibly complicated

906
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,720
and hard to work. I said, Mojo,

907
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,520
why didn't you do

908
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,340
it? The reason Bryce is

909
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,200
such a popular 3D program

910
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,440
for little kids and old people is because

911
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,620
it's easy to operate.

912
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,540
It's like running a cash register

913
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,720
at McDonald's. It's PICTO's

914
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,600
for everything. He goes, I don't want

915
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,020
I want him to have to learn.

916
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,620
I want him to have to learn.

917
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,140
I knew at that moment, oh God,

918
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,020
he expects people to read

919
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,240
the instructions. Well, I know

920
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,300
about how many people in a room full of 10

921
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,000
read the instructions. Me!

922
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,380
And nobody else.

923
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,040
And I wasn't going to read the instructions

924
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,720
for Mojo world, so there, that's it.

925
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,480
Enough said.

926
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,060
The story has been told. Now, weren't there certain

927
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,280
people that just played with it and tried to break

928
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,940
it and did great artwork

929
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,260
with it, just playing

930
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,440
with it, instead of trying to

931
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,320
operate it properly? Oh yeah, if you tried to break it,

932
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,280
you could do some cool stuff. Yeah, I thought

933
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,320
there were some great artworks that were created just

934
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,420
by playing with it and trying to break

935
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,200
it. That's the

936
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,260
only way Philo works any

937
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,380
computer program. It's another subgenius.

938
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,960
That's how you start. Instead of

939
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,180
playing, reading the instructions,

940
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,400
you start off trying to

941
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,360
break it, and then engineer

942
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,420
your way backwards to learning how

943
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,280
it works. It's actually pretty

944
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,180
hard to break a computer program.

945
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,020
So you try.

946
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,740
I think it's a satisfying way of

947
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,540
both the issues involved.

948
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,440
It really does. Just kick the thing, throw it out

949
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,460
the window, attack.

950
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,320
I think maybe attack elderly people

951
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,220
with it, because they don't understand

952
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,980
them quite as well as younger people do.

953
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,620
And I think that would add

954
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,520
a moment of pride to the whole experience.

955
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,860
And you could tape it.

956
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,300
I think part of it is that old

957
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,220
people don't know how to type with

958
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,860
their thumbs.

959
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, why

960
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,140
would they not know how to type with their thumb? Because

961
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,260
they're saying it's a more pre-Symeon

962
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,600
type of, you know, monkey thumb?

963
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,460
I say the fingers are better designed

964
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,260
for the typings than

965
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,300
the thumb is. The thumb is some sort of new

966
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,060
monkey science that's come up.

967
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,900
He's talking about how

968
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,380
you have to use the tiny

969
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,380
little phones now instead of the great

970
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,160
big computer keyboards, and that's why

971
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,140
there's no quotes on Bob's name

972
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,520
anymore. It's so modern, it doesn't

973
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,420
work. Sentences don't have periods.

974
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,260
...unless you triple-check.

975
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,440
So anyway, we're going to... All that

976
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,520
punctuation was just a waste of time

977
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
anyway. Yeah, grammar Nazis.

978
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,360
We're going to play one

979
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,480
of the greatest new groups out of

980
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:09,720
Japan.

981
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,140
Autopsy report of a drowned

982
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,260
shrimp. Go onto YouTube and look them up.

983
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,420
They'd be crazy. Okay, now blame

984
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,160
Byron for this, okay? This

985
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,460
isn't my fault. I have no idea what this sounds

986
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,420
like. I'm going to go ahead and whip it out.

987
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:23,920
Here it is.

988
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,120
.

989
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,120


990
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,680
.

991
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,580
.

992
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:54,880
.

993
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,060
.

994
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,860
.

995
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,600
.

996
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,020
.

997
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:09,580
.

998
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:09,580


999
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:09,600
.

1000
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:09,620
.

1001
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:09,640
.

1002
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:09,660
.

1003
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:09,680
.

1004
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,120
.

1005
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,320
.

1006
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:11,500
.

1007
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,240
.

1008
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,040
.

1009
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,480
.

1010
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,900
.

1011
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,180
.

1012
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:38,220
.

1013
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,260
.

1014
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,260


1015
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,260


1016
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,260


1017
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,280
.

1018
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,280


1019
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,280


1020
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,360
.

1021
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,720
Thank you.

1022
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:33,660
Thank you.

1023
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,020
Thank you.

1024
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,940
Good lord, man.

1025
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,100
Wow, you're so cute.

1026
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,640
I like that shrimp talk.

1027
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,720
Yeah.

1028
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,080
Yeah, they're crazy.

1029
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,620
So what's the deal with that band?

1030
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,300
Who are they and how rare are they?

1031
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,720
I think they may be made up of a bunch of guys that are in other groups

1032
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,360
but are wearing masks because of whatever reason.

1033
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,460
And let me see.

1034
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,780
It's the brainchild of Yamamoto Kazuki.

1035
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,660
They're known as Oro Rita Iba.

1036
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,480
You know, they've been around for a while.

1037
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,420
I may have the only CD.

1038
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,980
I don't know.

1039
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,580
Maybe they're probably less than five.

1040
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,740
And they got a new one coming out.

1041
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,780
I'm very excited about that.

1042
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,180
Go on YouTube and watch them.

1043
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,240
They are crazy.

1044
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,600
Visually crazier than their music.

1045
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:09,940
Wow.

1046
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,040
Without seeing them, all I could think of was

1047
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,080
Shinji Kukudis.

1048
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,980
Shinji Kukudis.

1049
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,560
Shinji Kukudis.

1050
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:14,700
Yeah.

1051
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,620
Kukudis.

1052
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,820
I can see how you would do that.

1053
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,520
Yeah.

1054
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,500
But they're all males, huh?

1055
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:23,600
Yeah.

1056
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,660
It's too bad.

1057
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,660
It's hard to tell they have masks on and colorful loose clothing.

1058
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,860
So, you know, you just can't tell anymore.

1059
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,480
Even if it's dressed like a woman, you don't actually know anymore.

1060
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,240
Could be.

1061
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,820
What do you think of 50 Year in Progress and the Norwegian time belts

1062
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,980
and all the different numbers?

1063
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,780
They've been trying to pull on people for years,

1064
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,560
trying to make them dress up like ladies.

1065
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,580
Scandinavia.

1066
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,460
That's where it all comes out of, you know?

1067
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,180
Damn them.

1068
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,420
And the big bustle dresses.

1069
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,540
The firmaments and stuff like that.

1070
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,920
How come women wanted to have bustles to make themselves look larger in the derriere or smaller?

1071
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,140
It's kind of an ape thing, you know?

1072
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,780
It's getting down to a body attraction.

1073
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,340
And it's getting down near the end of this hour of slack.

1074
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,340
The bustle was for a bigger butt bump, Dave.

1075
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,020
Well, apes do.

1076
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,860
I mean, they try to anyway.

1077
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,980
They have a valid code of honor.

1078
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,440
They believe the system is fortified by...

1079
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,840
Why do you think people go...

1080
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,500
When they have sex.

1081
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,400
It's that monkey drive, you know?

1082
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,400
Speak for yourself, dude.

1083
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:31,800
It's way back.

1084
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,920
Okay, listen.

1085
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:38,900
This was once the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1086
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,700
We're recuperating from the Devo convention or the devotional from last night,

1087
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,780
which was really great.

1088
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,080
And we'll probably have more from that later.

1089
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,680
Thank you so much for having me over.

1090
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,560
Thank you.

1091
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,020
Yeah.

1092
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,260
We actually had Byron over to our house.

1093
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,520
Reverend Susie the Flusie was in the slacker mansion for the first time.

1094
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,040
She sure was.

1095
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,580
Oh, and this is my copy of the new World War Room featuring Faramina.

1096
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,980
And Peebo.

1097
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,660
There's even a Peebo cat on there.

1098
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,200
I don't care about Peebo.

1099
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,240
You will.

1100
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,080
But Faramina is my new chardonnay.

1101
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,120
She's a sweetheart.

1102
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,560
Okay.

1103
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,000
So is World War Room.

1104
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,300
We're going to lead out with another song.

1105
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:28,700
It may not be that well recorded, but by golly, I recorded it.

1106
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,620
So I'm going to play it anyway.

1107
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,620
And it's a rural war room last night at the Beachland Ballroom doing popcorn.

1108
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,000
An old earworm that you may recognize.

1109
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,460
That's the one.

1110
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:43,960
Yeah.

1111
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,660
I didn't recognize it when you guys were playing it.

1112
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,260
You explained it later.

1113
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,060
So I'm going to play it now.

1114
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,540
I watched you sitting there.

1115
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,840
You're listening to it with your jaw hanging open.

1116
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,040
We have to stop now.

1117
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,820
That was because I was asleep.

1118
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,480
So long, Dave.

1119
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:01,760
No.

1120
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,940
Nice to chat with you.

1121
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,360
No.

1122
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,400
So long, Barron.

1123
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,740
It's been nice chatting with you.

1124
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,640
Very good.

1125
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,340
Hi, Dave.

1126
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,920
And so we've been hanging back up.

1127
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,340
What?

1128
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,640
We did it just a little longer.

1129
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,020
We had our casos for the last week...

1130
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,100
You guys...

1131
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,400
So very Beendo now.

1132
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1133
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1134
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1135
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1136
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1137
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1138
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,400


1139
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,820
So this is the Pogo.

1140
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,800

1141
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,400
Now he's saying hi in Belgian and I'll say bye.

1142
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,000
You'll know what it tastes like.

1143
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:50,880

1147
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,180
Oh

1148
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,540
Oh

1149
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,160
I am drowning in a cloud of wings

1150
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,080
Oh

1151
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,080
Oh

1152
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,400
You know it. Popcorn!

1157
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:47,720

00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,600

1163
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,120
It's a song we put our song

1164
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,280
If the song they could not stop

1165
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:44,100
If the song we could not stop, we should not stop, they would not stop.

1166
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,120
The song we could not stop, it's the song we could not stop.

1167
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:34,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1170
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,080
When I dream of you, why, why, why, why?

1171
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,400
I'm gonna die in a moment

1172
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,660
I'm gonna die in a moment

1173
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,640
I'm gonna die in a moment
