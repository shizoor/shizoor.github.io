The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear, what you say, and what you think.
Now, how much money do you think you're going to make out of this?
Oh, I don't know.
Money, talk.
Now it is time to grow up and take some responsibility.
So what? Why shouldn't they be offended?
Because they've done what they shouldn't be offended.
Uh, what was that?
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius Hour of Slut.

You are no longer in control, my friend.
We shall dominate you, dear listener, as we have dominated others of your species.
There's no escape.
You can only do your duty.
It was me who done it anyway.
But you know, friends, you start talking about that weird stuff.
You start talking about the neither forces.
You might end up summoning some of them things.
Yeah, we subgenius ministers here found out there's some things you just don't play around with.
You don't start messing with somebody else's religion, they say.
But you start messing with the elder gods, friends.
You stir up forces.
Suddenly everything's going wrong.
What you gonna do about it, boy?
Oh, what you gonna do to get straight?
Not much you can do if you get everything out of balance.
You thought it was real funny, didn't you?
Thought you'd go and pull the devil's leg, eh?
Go ahead, son.
It's funny. Funny big joke.
Let's go. Go ahead, little girl.
Let's go spray paint funny pictures on tombstones.
Let's go make a fake...
bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.
Oh, fun.
Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.
I'm ready.
He-he-he-he-he.
Yeah, you just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius.
Oh, we're in it as deep as you.
We took money for it.
We know our souls are damned.
Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped up we don't think about it.
Yeah.
I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.
Pathetic Bobby.
You're Bobby, ain't you?

Now he seems so truthful.

Look at him, trying to appeal the moon, and it's cold.

We like to make fun of religious nuts and other cults and so forth.
But, you know, sometimes it's not all that funny for some people.
There's a story here in Dallas.
It's been going on for a while.
There was an article in the Dallas Morning News kind of wrapped it up.
But it's a tale of the pursuit of allegations of satanic ritual abuse.
It pretty much ruined a bunch of people's lives.
And there never was any satanic cult ritual abuse.
But the accusations of it and the hysteria and the witch hunt that built up around it
actually happened.
It actually created more child abuse.
Anyway, a couple of people, this was in Gilmer, Texas, the mighty East Texas town of Gilmer.
A small group of East Texas child welfare workers and foster parents whose pursuit of
allegations of satanic ritual abuse culminated in short-lived murder indictments against
a police officer and seven other people are under investigation by their parents.
program called Propaganda.
The Consultants are setting up a program that isippingмер office in Queens City.
This was無 Arb retraining officers

social workers that the main to evil doing Christian social workers.
Once again, they never mention religion somehow in this entire article, evenYour Advocate is Urgent Urgent
though, the whole thing is obviously About like aèle who is trying to help whoa
bat's convinced of non-existent satanic abuse, which we've been hearing little heard of other
which we've been hearing about more and more of them kind of nuts.
There would have been much far worse for that group in Queens City, Kaie Parkwood,

The murder indictments, dismissed in March for lack of evidence, were only one consequence
of the social workers' efforts to unmask a satanic cult for which no independent evidence
exists.
Their actions may have seriously compromised the underlying child abuse prosecutions, widely
held to be well-founded.
Now, let's see if I can...
Uh, you can listen to my newspaper here, isn't it?
Well, where's that damn...
Okay, here we go.
Two foster parents involved in the case committed suicide last November after one of ten children
in their care was beaten into a coma.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the case workers had failed to detect signs of
systematic abuse and neglect by the foster parents, James and Marie Lapp, who were among
the welfare workers.
The foster parents were also involved in the case.
The foster parents were also involved in the case.
Now, the...
Apparently, the main welfare worker villain...
Welfare worker slash fundamentalist Christian villains, in this case, are Ms. Gore and Ms.
Minshew, estate child welfare workers who have said that the children's biological
family, the Kers, belong to a murderous, satanic cult.
Uh, however, it seems that, uh, these, uh, two wonderful do-gooders for Jesus against
Satan have done these following things.
Uh, they took children from their biological families without any investigations.
They moved children from foster home to foster home, sometimes without the knowledge of their
supervisors in order to keep them isolated from any outside influences.
See, these social workers only would work with, uh, fellow fundamentalist foster parents,
see?
They'd get kids away from...
Say some parent...
Some parents, you know, they screwed up.
They did...
They messed up and had a real bad day.
Or they were actually abusive.
Anyway, these social...
These fundamentalist social workers would get hold of them.
They'd give them to other fundamentalist parents who were themselves crazy.
Um, these social workers, uh, recruited their own investigators and special prosecutor for
the criminal investigation of this child abuse situation.
Their own investigators, of course, were self-professed experts in ritual abuse, the kind that teach
people...
They'd go around giving seminars about the Church of the Subgenius being a subgenius.

They'd say, you know, this is a cult, this is a satanic cult.
Man, you know, the only reason anybody even believes in Satan is because some ridiculous
Christian told them to...
Not to.
Let's see.
Uh, these folks, uh, these, uh, social workers, uh, reported many incidents of purported harassment
by this cult, uh, that they invented, such as animal torture, fires, and stalking, none
of which could be confirmed.
And they questioned the children so often and in such a leading manner that the children
may have felt compelled to fabricate stories of ritual abuse in order to please them.
The same kind of thing happens, is like a big fad with therapists these days, apparently.
Uh, you know, buried memories.
And, you know, it's funny the Salem Witch Trials work the same way.
You know, give a bunch of little kids enough terror and attention and they'll come up with
any story you put into their heads.
Uh, yeah.
Let's see.
It was Ms. Minshew, Ms. Minshew, as regional foster home developer who recruited, trained,
and supervised this, uh, the Lapps, which were foster parents, and Ms. Bass, another
one.
She was in the position to determine how many foster children they got and how much money
they received.
The Lapps, the ones who committed suicide, had five children.


Five foster kids and five adopted kids and were getting $2,500 a month, plus large adoption
subsidies and childcare payments at the time of their deaths.
They'd cared for as many as seven at a time and gotten $190,000.
Oh, no, Ms. Bass, the other one, had made $190,000 in foster home payments.
And this other group of fundamentalists who were buddies of the mainstay, they were the

ked out by one another.
They kept a former
son in the 혼 años, and they told her story to make it reconvenient.
him?
I heard some good stuff about you.
Yeah.
Rather than police or sheriff's officers, the child welfare workers relied on self-professed
experts in ritual abuse.
This case parallels dozens of others throughout the country in which children have told stories
of satanic or ritual abuse not borne out by evidence.
In some cases, children have recanted their statements saying they were only trying to
please insistent adults and that the lie simply got out of control.
In this case, these kids actually had been abused, although not just normal, hideous,
unspeakable child abuse, but not for any non-Christian deities.
But only nine months after this stuff was reported did these fundamentalist welfare
workers ever do anything about it.
When they did, they got the parents.
After the parents were arrested, then these folks got hold of the kids and let's see.
They began to interview this little boy.
They started in the morning and by nighttime the boy became so upset that he curled up
into a corner in a fetal ball.
He screamed and flailed and kicked begging, stop, stop, I'll do what you want me to do.
The adults urged him to tell them how he had been abused.
They told him they already knew that he had because other children had told them so.
The boy said what they urged him to say and then he soiled himself.
Well, you know, it's wonderful the way these do-gooders take care of these children, you
know.
Out of the, the kids, man, think of these kids out of the frying pan of the, of the
drunken abusive parent into the crazy abusive fundamentalist.
Um.

Fundamentalist number two, Ms. Gore, was moved to another office where she has no responsibility.
And Ms. Minshew was placed on leave.
But they're still looking into this whole thing.
The people who killed themselves, there was a foster couple who killed themselves because
the husband had beaten one of their foster kids to death.
Um.
When an officer and social worker interviewed the last child.




They were told that the child had collapsed after the kid died or went into a coma.
They got vague or unconvincing answers.
Their questions were deflected with descriptions of horrors the children purportedly had suffered
at what the hands of Mrs. Lapp called that damned cult.
Um.
A few hours later, several of the couple's ten foster children told social workers that
the Lapps had slammed the seven-year-old boy's head against the floor.
Um.
The Lapps were part of that small group of fundamentalist welfare worker and foster parents
who so driven by their unsubstantiated fears of a satanic cult that they disregarded both
agency rules and common sense.
Um.
Ms. Bass is described by some people as priding herself on getting children.

rights. Now to get these kids to talk about the satanic rights, apparently they
would bring out scary monster masks and things like that. And it's nice to know
that this couple killed themselves after they were found out as being guilty of
beating this kid to death. Oh that previous background music by the way, it
was by Tommy Lopez. Blue Ooze I believe he calls it. Anyway it turns out that
after this kid was taken to the hospital, the Laps told all kinds of different
stories about how the kid, basically they said he banged his own head against the
floor during a temper tantrum and deliberately had made himself
unconscious. However the people immediately started moving this
country.
The couple started moving from one town to another in Texas and would always tell their new
neighbors that they were fleeing persecution by the murderous satanic cult.
But they were always calling the police. The police chief said he found Mrs. Lap
curiously indiscreet for a woman supposedly in fear for her life. She liked the attention, he said.
Anyway it turns out that in the hands of these
Christians, the parents seem to be more interested in railing to their visitors
about the satanic cult than in reaching the injured boy's bedside. Nearly all of
the children said that they were routinely forced to run stairs, up and
down stairs, undergo beatings with a belt and forgo food as punishment.
Sometimes a number of the children said their parents, their foster parents banged
their heads against the floor. And this was all to get them to the hospital. And this was all to get them to the hospital.
The confession out of the kids that they had been abused by the satanists that these selfsame foster parents had imagined.
Dear friends, and they call the church of the subgenius some kind of a damn...
I mean...
God...
Yes, we do have a certain paranoia, my friends.
You know...
But...
Those of us who have been through the crucible do develop a certain edge of paranoia.
But I think that it may in some cases serve to make us just a bit more aware of what's actually happening in our real surroundings.
As opposed to the spirit world where it is so much easier for those who are always very
strong and white, to turn to falsehood
towards it that you are.
