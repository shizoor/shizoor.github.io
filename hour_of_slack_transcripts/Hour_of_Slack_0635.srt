1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
We're still at the X-Day Drill.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,440
We decided not to leave.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,460
Your brothers from out of space

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,760
are coming with advanced knowledge

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,320
to help

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,580
super race!

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,860
Bob will save all true believers, though, in 1998, right?

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,100
Actually, Bob, you better hope that Bob does some wheeling and dealing

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,720
for your soul come 1998.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,700
He is the salesman of the universe here to make sure that Earth

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,860
and your soul does not get sold to the robot mutilators.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,700
At least for not too low a price.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,920
So you better read that book with all three I's

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,500
or however many you have left

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,060
and leave the driving to Bob.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,840
That's right.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,680
You do the walking.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,880
Let Bob do the talking.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,540
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,480
What is waiting there for me?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Bob.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,920
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,420
Hour of Slang

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,820
sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,340
I love you.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,540
I love you.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,000
I love you.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,340
Friend, the elder gods have been sleeping, but they're waking up.

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,460
And you gotta find that word of Bob before it's too late.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,020
Before 1998, July 5th, the end of the world, the end of time as we know it.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,900
When the very, the very...

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,800
The score is racked up.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,860
The score is racked up and it's the time and a half time.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,560
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,120
We just won't have a chance.

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,200
They'll be able to have their ways with us.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,860
You've heard about the smallpox blankets and the Indians, you know.

38
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,760
Well, this is gonna be technological.

39
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,780
You've heard about the smallpox blankets and the Indians, you know. Well, this is gonna be technological.

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,280
You've heard about the smallpox blankets and the Indians, you know. Well, this is gonna be technological.

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Viral infecting of an entire planet with means of doing things, means of destruction, means of alteration of genetic patterns, means of controlling people's minds that we don't even...

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,180
To us, it's magic.

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,520
Any significantly advanced form of science becomes magic.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:22,500
If that smoke comes out of Bob's pipe no more, then we shall be reduced to that can of warm beer under the bed of a hungover elder god at 11.30 on a Sunday morning.

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,420
Bob is here to make sure that instead of it being the end of the world,

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:34,360
it's the end of their world and the new Jerusalem where slack begins.

47
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,380
Yes, the streets will be paved with slack.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Slack will drop gently from the sky.

49
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,640
Slack will ooze out of the pores of the faithful.

50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,020
The tribulation money will fall from the flying saucers.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,120
Yes, it'll all be floating around in those little green rays coming out of our feet.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,380
That's why we tell...

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:51,840
We have slack.

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,460
That's why we tell the public to throw their money away.

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,320
It's no good.

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,200
It's gonna be...

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
Currency's just gonna be flying down from flying saucers in a few years anyway.

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,300
Or give it to Bob.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,720
Or give it to Bob.

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,220
You give it to Bob while it's still good.

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,960
You cash in that money while it's still good.

62
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,640
Because they're gonna be...

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,100
See, people are just gonna be bringing all their money to Bob when the end of the world is upon us.

64
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
It's gonna be too late because money won't be worth anything.

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,780
When those tribulation times come down, that subgenius pamphlet, especially if you got a white copy.

66
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,520
Now, if you got a white copy and a brown copy, it's a little bit of difference.

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,360
But they're both worth more than a bundle of thousand dollar treasury bills a foot high.

68
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,240
A room full of bills.

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,560
And there will be people trading paragraphs of that pamphlet for boxcars full of food.

70
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,800
We think it will replace currency.

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:43,620
Bob will replace drugs, religion, rock music, and everything in a great paradise of unrestrained sales, unrestrained slack and sex.

72
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,700
And if you have any drug users in your audience, we should note that the book of the subgenius we found in a test that was conducted in Austin recently.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,580
That if adulterated street drugs are thrown on top of the cover.

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,560
All of the non-narcotic qualities are completely erased and indicated as negative and destroyed.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,300
All impurities are destroyed.

76
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,700
All impurities are removed, giving you that 1% of pure that you paid for out of whatever it was that you were.

77
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,480
By the way.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
That's better than pyramid power.

79
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,360
Yes, much better than pyramid power.

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,100
I'd like to say those.

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,900
Because it's in a plane rather than going to a point.

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,160
Book of the subgenius.

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,500
That's it.

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,240
Book of the subgenius.

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,900
That is from the fellow everyone knows.

86
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,900
Bob.

87
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,500
Bob.

88
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,900
Bob.

89
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,480
Bob.

90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,340
Yes, Bob.

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,140
See, man.

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,740
That is one strange dude.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,900
Who is it?

94
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,460
Bob.

95
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,020
Bob.

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,300
One strange dude.

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,580
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.

98
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,940
Oh, that's crazy talk.

99
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:45,900
But friends, you know, our critics have some people worrying now and then that the church might become corrupt.

100
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,880
The church of the subgenius might become corrupted by the conspiracy and there'd have to be a replacement for it.

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Well, friends, I tell you, we don't have to worry about that.

102
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,280
Because the true church, the true church of the subgenius is going to be up in the saucers.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,640
The pinks won't have to worry about even seeing the subgeniuses again.

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:22,100
There'll be all kinds of cheap cults and spinoffs left behind, just like the cargo cults among the last mutated remnants of humanity.

105
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,220
And also there'll be subgeniuses left behind.

106
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:32,440
The subgeniuses who didn't think they really needed that $20 membership card.

107
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,980
Did we just have a power failure?

108
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,800
I believe we did.

109
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:48,880
Yeah, those who, as I was saying, excuse me, friends, we're having serious, strange poltergeist effects in here as the lights flicker on and off.

110
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,920
Yeah.

111
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,480
Yeah, anyway.

112
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:50,760
Yeah.

113
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,140
Yeah.

114
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,140


115
00:05:52,140 --> 00:06:04,480
I mean, the ones who left behind, the ones who didn't think they needed that $20 membership card, the ones who tattooed Bob's face all over their whole bodies, the ones who put, they might have put Bob on national TV.

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,740
They might have donated their whole estate to us, but they never sent, they never sent their $20.

117
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:21,440
Now, it might be confusing a bit to those left behind after the rupture because the rupture happens for different people in different ways.

118
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:31,440
A lot of subgeniuses, when they undergo the rupture, what, the people standing around and back on Earth, it looks like a burning monk or spontaneous combustion.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,380
They just burst into flames and scream and scream.

120
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,900
It's the most horrible, painful-looking thing in the world.

121
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,780
But, of course, that, friends, that's just the image.

122
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,900
That's just sort of the hologram, the body being left behind, just the shell.

123
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,420
Because on next day, when you are ruptured, no matter how it looks, you know, you're, you're going to be left behind.

124
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,420


125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:58,800
Your youthful, perfect body is being recreated on the vessels of the sex goddesses.

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,860
And a thousand clones of kitten on TV dot are going to, well, I, friends, when you get on that escape vessel,

127
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:17,260
every person you ever had a crush on since elementary school is going to be there ready to have sex with you.

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,500
Either that or else simulacra of those people.

129
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,640
It might as well be the same.

130
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,540
Because the sex goddesses, you see, can change their form completely and totally.

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,740
First, you, you'll, you'll, there'll be the, say, the girl you had a crush on in first grade.

132
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,020
Well, now she's at a perfect, she's perfect and healthy at age 25, of course, you know.

133
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,960
And, but, and when, when she leaves, why, in walks the girl you had a crush on in second grade.

134
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Or, or here's that, that boy you had a crush on when you were 13 and he almost kissed you.

135
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,680
But now he's going to do it.

136
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,540
And he's still wearing the same clothes that he did at the prom.

137
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,260
Or that milkman or babysitter that you lusted after.

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,160
They'll all be there.

139
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,100
The sex goddesses tap your mind.

140
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,780
It's not really people.

141
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,220
It's part of the, the muom system.

142
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:16,640
The, a, a, a biomorphic toy that conforms to the fleshly configurations to satisfy any kind of lust you might have.

143
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,500
And they can pre-guess what you're about to think, friends.

144
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:19,780
They can pre-guess what you're about to think, friends.

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,720
They can sense a desire percolating up in your mind.

146
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,620
And just, for instance, just a few seconds before you, you think of it.

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,020
That zap comic that you always wanted to read a second time.

148
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,540
What just happens to be over there in the pile.

149
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,560
And you, and you look back and you think, man, this is, this is great.

150
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,960
If only I had a frop stick.

151
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
Well, here's a frop stick.

152
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Because muom and the biomorphs and the sex goddesses can anticipate your every wish.

153
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,460
They can whiff a desire coming on.

154
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:59,460
And you'll think, now if I could just, um, meet up with that, that haughty librarian at that one college I went to while I'm reading this comic.

155
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,460
And sure enough, in she comes through the door.

156
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,180
Well, if only she'd dance, you think.

157
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,860
Oh, if only she had a small whip.

158
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,120
And it happens.

159
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,000
As you think about it, there's no limit.

160
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,160
No limit at all.

161
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,960
And oh, if only she'd give me a ham sandwich first.

162
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
Ah, yes.

163
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,040
Now I'm.

164
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:25,620
And you'll sit there and think to yourself, you know, I can't believe there was a time when I wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks.

165
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:38,600
And you're sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich, getting a scarf job from that biomorph, watching wide screen color TV Elvis movies, and thinking, how could I ever have wondered?

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,360
How could I ever have doubted Bob for a second?

167
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,000
And, and to think of poor Bubba, my brother Bubba back there on earth.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,340
The guy that said, hell, send them $20.

169
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,980
That's just what they want you to do.

170
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,220
I'll pump gas for $2.38 an hour the rest of my life before I'd send a dollar to that damn sub gum church.

171
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:58,780
Oh, yeah.

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,580
Well, it's hard times for Bubba now, friends.

173
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah, just when you're thinking about old Bubba, the one that didn't want to join the church,

174
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,320
well, the TV on this escape vessel in front of you lights up and there's this shot of Bubba down there.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,160
Eating a rotten rat and hiding from the death machines that the rogue pinks made from the stolen womb parts.

176
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,680
And he'll, Bubba will be down there muttering to himself, oh, how could I do it?

177
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,720
I was so stupid.

178
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,120
I could have been saved, but no, I didn't send my $20.

179
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,380
Oh, God, here comes another rogue beast.

180
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:43,380
And here I am in this pest, festering pile of rat waste and dead people and stripped bare skulls.

181
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,060
If only I could die.

182
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,640
If only I could die.

183
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,480
But I can't.

184
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I can't.

185
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Why, if only Bob was here now, I'd give him my $20.

186
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,180
I'd give him $40.

187
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,680
I'd give you everything I own, Bob, please.

188
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,520
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob.

189
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,060
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs.

190
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,620
Didn't trust him $20 worth.

191
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,160
Okay, fine.

192
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,960
Fine.

193
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,560
No skin off our teeth.

194
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,140
Pay lip service.

195
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,920
Wear that Bob t-shirt.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,820
Be real hip.

197
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:26,700
But when those saucers come, well, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus, as those great proto sub-genii used to say.

198
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,120
And the dumbest nerd could get on the bus for $20.

199
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,200
Well, actually, those $20 don't count.

200
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,240
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade for.

201
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,540
But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are, at least made it possible for their betters to win.

202
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,980
To ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

203
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,500
And there'll be an orientation film that they'll show you when you're ruptured up.

204
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,900
You know, because otherwise it might be kind of confusing.

205
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,980
This orientation film is kind of projected into your head.

206
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,480
It's introduced by Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs,

207
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,560
who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon slash Viking Brunhilde

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,540
with metal pointed breastplates.

209
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,340
And a horned helmet and all this UFO insignia on anything.

210
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,180
And she is the masteress of the path of the beast resistance.

211
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,700
And she narrates this film.

212
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,200
And it's like, you will hear and obey.

213
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,240
Take off your clothes.

214
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,760
And you can watch the, you can either watch the orientation film

215
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,480
or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day.

216
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:40,580
Or you can just, you know, go back to having your fun

217
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,440
with the different simulacra and sex goddesses and so forth.

218
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,420
And, of course, your sweetheart's going to be doing the same thing too.

219
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,620
But because it's in, because it's on those, those spaceships

220
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,440
on the, on inside the escape vessels, it's, there's no time and no sense of jealousy.

221
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,800
It's, you'll always, it's like, there's no sense of possessiveness

222
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,340
because on that, in that no zone,

223
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,080
of the saucers, time ceases to exist.

224
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,300
Or at least it feels that way.

225
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,460
And you don't need to be grasping anymore like you did on Earth.

226
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,880
The overwhelming feeling that you get on the, on the escape vessels is like,

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,120
wow, the best part is it lasts as long as I want it to.

228
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,560
And I can take forever.

229
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm immortal for now.

230
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,660
And I don't have the urge to grab this and keep it

231
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,200
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing.

232
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,420
I don't have to kill or defeat another monkey man to hang on to these,

233
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,500
these big round soft things.

234
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,020
I'll have plenty of time to get to those other big soft round things.

235
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,840
More, more than I could ever use.

236
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,340
And my pipe overfloweth.

237
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,520
And the big round soft things shall follow me through the land of Dobbs

238
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,360
and I will dwell in the cleft in between forever.

239
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,860
It's like, oh, how were your multiple partners today, dear?

240
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, big and round and soft.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Ah, yes.

242
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,660
And there's, but people ask so many questions.

243
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,720
They say, well, well, Reverend Stang, is there just one giant saucer

244
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,340
or is it a bunch of regional saucers, you know,

245
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,440
like an East Coast saucer and a West Coast saucer?

246
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,660
No, there's a million kinds of saucers, friends, but it's, it's like virtual reality.

247
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,080
So once you're inside one of them, you might as well be in all of them.

248
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,460
You might as well be on Planet X.

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,080
You're not in normal space.

250
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,240
You can sort of phase to the other saucers or find your friends.

251
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,040
You can go to the Chinese saucer today or I'll go to the gay and lesbian saucer.

252
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,460
Gee, I always wanted to try being a lesbian female.

253
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,540
But meanwhile, those who are left behind, which is 99% of the population

254
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,560
and probably 90% of the subgeniuses, all those who didn't send their $20.

255
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,220
They'll miss out on next day.

256
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,940
You know, come to think of it, I never sent.

257
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,260
Technically, I mean, I've spent a lot of my own money on the church.

258
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,400
I've spent a lot of my own money on the church.

259
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,400


260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,580
I never sent my $20 in for a membership.

261
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,960
Dr. Drummond never did.

262
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
Palmer Vredes never did.

263
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,800
Puzzling Evidence never did.

264
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,940
Sterno never did.

265
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,300
And you know, friends, it won't matter what you did for Bob.

266
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,240
What'll matter is whether you sent that for that membership card.

267
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,640
I guess I'm going to have to get around to that.

268
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,100
Well, I got plenty of time, plenty of time till next day.

269
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,200
Oh, hell, that's 1998.

270
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
We got all the time in the world.

271
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,380
There will be one big escape vessel just for Bob.

272
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,660
For the doctors, for the hierarchy.

273
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,640
And I can just see Byron and Gordon and some of those other people up there going,

274
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,240
Hey, you know, we ought to go down and save Ivan and Philo

275
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,600
and all those who never got around to sending the $20.

276
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,800
And then they'll go, well, we'll get around to it.

277
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,300
We're not sure where the escape vessels of the sex goddesses go, dear friends.

278
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,200
As far as I can tell,

279
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
they probably just fly around.

280
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,720
But I'm going to go, I'm going to get off of this for right now.

281
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,480
We'll go to an old hymn.

282
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,220
This is a lovely old subject.

283
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,320
And I do mean old.

284
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,240
This is like from 1981.

285
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Old subgenius hymn by someone we only know as Doug number four.

286
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,540
Oh, yes.

287
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,100
Please, Bob, don't kill me.

288
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,520
I want to die for Bob.

289
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,180
I want to die in a holy place.

290
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,740
We hold and drown the bank boys and the normals.

291
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,200
If we have to, if we have to,

292
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,380
Bobkin makes them die.

293
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,800
And we'll all come back older men.

294
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,100
We'll all come back older men.

295
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,740
We'll all come back older men.

296
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,560
All over reason why.

297
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,060
Oh, yes.

298
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:19,120
Yes, what a wonderful, wonderful tune there from the good, the good, good Reverend Doug No. 4,

299
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,640
who got scared by the Church of the Subgenius very shortly after doing that very song.

300
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,540
And we never heard from him again.

301
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,140
And for all I know, he might be listening to this show going, where's my royalties?

302
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,200
But he's not going to lack for royalties, dear friends,

303
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,960
because he'll be on those saucers, and I hope, I hope that you will too.

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,960
I hope you'll join us there on that lovely day.

305
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:53,280
And to make sure that, let's go through some of these things to double check just before X Day.

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,560
There'll be more of this in our upcoming book, Revelation X.

307
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,100
This is where a lot of these notes are coming from, by the way, friends.

308
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,080
From a research session between myself and Dr. G. Gordon Gordon in conference

309
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,180
with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

310
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,040
That man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, yes, sort of a teleconference that we were on.

311
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
Praise this modern day technology.

312
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,480
That way we didn't have to be in the same room with Bob, don't you see?

313
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
It's a dream.

314
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:30,700
But anyway, I mean, you don't want to miss your chance to be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses on X Day.

315
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,620
You don't want to end up down on Earth being fried.

316
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,120
So make sure that you have a real Subgenius minister's card.

317
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,540
On you at all times.

318
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,360
Now, you never know, X Day might come early.

319
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,200
So keep it with you.

320
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,840
Subgeniuses often lose those in the wash.

321
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,780
We get a lot of mail from people saying that.

322
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,560
I washed my membership card.

323
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,340
Can I have another one?

324
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,020
And you don't want that to happen just before X Day, friends.

325
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,180
So if you have members who have lost their cards, but who are paid up and on the master disk of souls,

326
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,740
because we can tell, you can't fool us.

327
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,580
We'll give you a free replacement card from the Dallas headquarters anytime, free of charge,

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,100
just by subgenius.

329
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,980
Send in your self-addressed stamped envelope.

330
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,160
This is members only.

331
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,340
To Bob, and we'll be giving that post office box number soon in the broadcast.

332
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,860
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214 is what I'll be telling you.

333
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
But, ah, X Day.

334
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,800
You know, on X Day, for those down below on Earth,

335
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,580
you know, it'll be a little different than it would be up in the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

336
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,700
They'll look up trying to put, while they're trying to put,

337
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,000
put their clothes out,

338
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,760
uh, there'll be this huge eyeball in the sky,

339
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,920
this giant pyramid-shaped light form,

340
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,500
with a big eye that just covers the whole sky.

341
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,040
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens.

342
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,200
Ah yes, when we can watch what's going on down there, we can watch any part of it we want.

343
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,940
And we can also leave messages, because the big eye projects sort of billboards, holographic billboards,

344
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,260
from,

345
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,960
from horizon to horizon that say things like,

346
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,360
smile, you know, welcome to your stupid life.

347
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,260
You're being seen live on the escape vessels of the sex goddess screens,

348
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,100
where the subgeniuses are now partying, you dumb idiots.

349
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,240
I mean, a big billboard stretching all across the planet in all languages saying,

350
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,840
fools, we're having a great time.

351
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,300
And the subgeniuses can take turns broadcasting personal statements, so,

352
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,160
you know,

353
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:43,740
this horrible pink evil person will be down there, uh, fighting the Robeast,

354
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,180
and suddenly there's this, uh, voice will ring out.

355
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,340
Hey, Mrs. Darden, I was in your 1959 fifth grade class, remember me?

356
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,640
Steve Wilcox, haha, I'm up here, you're down there, ha!

357
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,900
Or, uh, like, pain radio, coming to you, Mr. Shaughnessy, the principal.

358
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,400
Remember when you expelled me? How do you like the pain, huh?

359
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,120
And, uh, you know, you get back at it anyway.

360
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,240
Oh, you laugh at it.

361
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,840
You laughed at me in junior high, Max.

362
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,340
You put me upside down into a trash can.

363
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,880
You and your jock friends, you aren't laughing quite so hard now, are you?

364
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,860
And there'll be little holographic, ghost-like things, green slime type ghost sort of things.

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,280
Millions of little 3D Jane-ers flying around, taunting, and saying,

366
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,080
you should've spent your twenty dollars, should've spent your twenty dollars,

367
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,900
oh, friends, friends, oh, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob,

368
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,500
it's gonna be so, but, you know, and so we find that the world isn't really to be destroyed.

369
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,400
It's that the humans, what happens is the humans are given all this alien technology,

370
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,180
and they screw everything up.

371
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,900
They've got a miracle machine there, this WOM thing, that could do anything they want,

372
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:01,020
but nobody pays any attention to it at first because, uh, they don't know what its capabilities are,

373
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,040
and it's real cautious about revealing itself too fast.

374
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,880
And they don't know that this, this, this is an alien.

375
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,500
fungus that's growing around them could fulfill their wildest desires because they don't believe

376
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,920
it can because they don't have any wild desires because they didn't think to ask

377
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,720
and people will be down there in the ruins begging us with their last potato to preach

378
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,740
and deliver unto them the word of dobbs because it's the only thing that'll save them it's subgenius

379
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,540
artifacts like old copies of the book of the subgenius or or illegal bootleg tapes of this

380
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:43,780
radio show original pamphlet number ones even an old dobbs head it'll be worth a boxcar full of

381
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,620
canned peaches friends because the luck shell the luck shell that we've always claimed was around

382
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,440
our various products that you thought we were only kidding about and that's real and and it will

383
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,540
become visible on x day a glow that's visible even in daylight any given page

384
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,980
of the printed word bob will be not only of practical use as lamps in the dark but more

385
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,480
importantly they'll be unthinkably valuable religious treasures dear friends the most

386
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,080
valuable things on the whole planet because you're safer if you have that if you've got a

387
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,700
copy of the show with you it tips your luck playing it helps a whole lot against radiation

388
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:31,520
and landslides and brain worms and noise demons and nerve runners and all that it didn't nearly

389
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,920

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,500


422
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,500


423
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,500


424
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,500


425
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,500

437
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,880
And now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened on that fateful day.

438
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,520
We're giving you all the evidence.

439
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:18,180
We're bringing to you the mind-terrifying audio.

440
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,300
It's right over my right.

441
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,780
What is it?

442
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,720
I gotta get out of here.

443
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,380
This won't trouble you. Go on. You're remembering everything now.

444
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:46,320
And I try to maintain control so Betty cannot tell that I am scared. Oh, I am so scared.

445
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,440
Go on. This won't hurt you. Experience it. It won't harm you now.

446
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,520
I gotta get my gun! I gotta get my gun! I gotta get out of here! I gotta get my gun!

447
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,380
I gotta get my gun!

448
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,360
I can't!

449
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,100
I can't!

450
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,580
I can't!

451
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,040
I can't!

452
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,540
I can't!

453
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,220
They're not emotional. Angels don't have any emotions.

454
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,660
Gentlemen, the situation at this time is so serious that it's the worst in human history.

455
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,100
The fate of the entire Earth is in our hands.

456
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,700
Every hour we are getting news that our factories and our refineries and schools are being attacked with rays of an unknown origin.

457
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,740
They haven't been analyzed so far.

458
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,140
Thousands of people are dead.

459
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,340
The attacks are not coming from outer space, our scientists say.

460
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,500
And certain monsters have been sent to Earth.

461
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,680
The

462
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:59,640
You've got to use all your power to knock them out.

463
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,040
All your power, believe me.

464
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,340
Laser guns?

465
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,600
Laser guns. Not only laser guns, but your crew. Get them up there and knock them out.

466
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,940
And when you knock them out, bring them...

467
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,780
But we're going to have trouble with the launch pad.

468
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,120
Well, the launch will be all right as soon as I can get there.

469
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:27,500
We know we've been behind it for years. It's been my research staff that came up with the initial evidence.

470
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,860
Dr. Moore?

471
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,400
Can your staff come up with a weapon to stop the Nazi hell creatures in time?

472
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,860
I can't say for sure.

473
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,500
But with luck, the technological provide us with the answers.

474
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,720
A man?

475
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,380
Is he a captain?

476
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,980
What is he?

477
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,660
And he's looking at me and I say, no.

478
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,880
I have to shake my head.

479
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,960
This isn't true. This can't be true.

480
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,100
And...

481
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,960
He's still there.

482
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:14,960
And I look up and down the road and I think, can't somebody come along and tell me that this isn't there?

483
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
But it's there.

484
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,800
Why?

485
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,160
What do they want?

486
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,640
What do they want?

487
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,640
Is the UFO mystery truly a mystery?

488
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,920
Is the scientific Watergate an incredible and dangerous cover-up?

489
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,360
Understanding of the UFO may be beyond our science and political system.

490
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,080
...twisted them to fit the Nazi ideology.

491
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,080
Thank you.

492
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:50,020
And Bob, by the way, is running for Big Brother or Universal Overlord or County Clerk in 1984.

493
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,240
Yeah, that's right.

494
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,700
He knows he's not going to win Big Brother. It's just to plant the seeds in the minds of the people.

495
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:05,920
Bob either wants to be a county clerk or a over-God of all reality in 1984.

496
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,760
As Alistair Crowley once said, if I can't be God, I'm not going to play.

497
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,880
This ain't no video game church. It ain't no Church of Bingo. It's a Church of Bob. It's a Bob Rogers Church.

498
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,040
I don't see what the hell's going on here. What the hell? Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

499
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,220
Yes, the Christian heaven is hotter.

500
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,660
That's because there are seven suns out of seven.

501
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,740
The subgenius hell is fine. Oh yeah, all your friends will be down there.

502
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,660
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, I must admit I know very little at this time.

503
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,520
The princess is a creature of antiquity, ten million years at least in age.

504
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,400
And the monsters are mutants of creatures that roamed the earth before the Ice Age.

505
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,540
It is likely that a super race of humans existed sometime in the past also, and somehow all of them, humans and creatures, went into hibernation far underground,

506
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:02,000
where they survived. They are intelligent. They are smarter than the most up-to-date supercomputers. We cannot underestimate them.

507
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,120
They're not emotional. Angels don't have any emotion.

508
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:21,680
These sinister euphonauts from the unholy reaches of the universe and traversing this great cosmos around us made a stop one day on this planet of ours.

509
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,520
Thousands upon thousands of years.

510
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:38,760
Made a stop to allow their house pets the leisure of relieving themselves outside of the spacecraft.

511
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:52,380
Certainly a few of these animals of amusement managed to break away from their masters and somehow managed to survive on this planet.

512
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,180
.

513
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,920
If this is so, evidence of them must exist somewhere.

514
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,180
I believe that evidence has already been uncovered and widely publicized of these animals.

515
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,060
The animals were probably the Yeti.

516
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:16,160
The Yeti's crossbred with human beings and the human beings as a result of that are...

517
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,420
Basically the subgenius has the biological heritage of the Yetinson or the Yeti.

518
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,680
.

519
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,760
The Yeti is a human being.

520
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:32,420
Basically out of the mountains of China, although there's a few that live in the mountains of California, they seem to be a mountain forest people that are...

521
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:42,060
Well, they're hairy only in their most pure state, but in sort of mongrelized Yetinsons such as myself, only certain parts sprout hair.

522
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,060
However, I have hair in unusual patches of my body, which is why I wear overalls.

523
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,940
.

524
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,020
.

525
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,140
.

526
00:32:52,140 --> 00:33:11,880
I am a caveman that draws from the deep inside, and inside dwell demons who move faster than I live and speak faster than the air carries sound, that wield the secret tools and emeralds of the sciences which I have forbidden thee, and these demons come among that leaders all swabbed in black and tamp them.

527
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,400
.

528
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,700
.

529
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:13,700


530
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:13,700


531
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:13,800
.

532
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,040
.

533
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,120
.

534
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,640
.

535
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,420
meet the uh the men from planet x the x's we call them men sure they look like men they can look

536
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:26,820
like rocks they can look like uh eight tentacled 30 foot tall monsters uh whatever is the requirement

537
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,020
of the human that they're uh that they're possessing or talking to 1998 is going to get

538
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,480
here we'll all wake up july 4th uh seven o'clock in the morning or july 5th pardon july 5th seven

539
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:46,640
o'clock in the morning hangovers from the fourth of july and uh nothing will ever be the same again

540
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,340
the planet will no longer belong to the humans or the subgeniuses

541
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,480
uh and that is why it is so crucial that the subgeniuses be in those positions of power

542
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,940
be at the coordinates the landing scripts when those those that angelic host

543
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:06,520
does descend uh when the second third and fourth comings occur during this period we

544
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,620
uh

545
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:23,900
i know that you understand i know that you understand and i know that you'll be with us

546
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:31,000
on that day faithful day x day 1998 bob will be on television he'll talk to us he'll give a speech

547
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,200
that will move billions not millions but billions to tears and it'll work out okay the world will

548
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,100
end just right

549
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,580
and keep going in the new way, the way of Bob.

550
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,660
Everyone would be subgeniuses except us.

551
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:53,640
You mentioned that the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

552
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,340
from inside the hollow earth are conspiring to take over the whole planet.

553
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,620
Yeah, we read about that in a pamphlet that was handed to us.

554
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,240
Oh, you did?

555
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,360
Uh-huh, and Bob confirmed it.

556
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,960
And there's only one organization that could possibly stop them.

557
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,140
They're the men from Planet X, and they'll be arriving in 1998.

558
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,540
And after the tribulation money starts to fall from the chariots

559
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,260
and the angels in the sky and coming up out of the ground

560
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,720
and spewing out of the back of them car exhaust pipes

561
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,000
and just magic everywhere,

562
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,820
and them tribulation times will be tearing those bad, evil, demonic people up,

563
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,300
and they'll be...

564
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,460
The subgenius people will be...

565
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,120
I think we should bring up...

566
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,540
That is Hitler's gem.

567
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,220
I'm waiting for the UFO

568
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,920
I'm waiting for the UFO

569
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,860
I'm waiting for the UFO

570
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,540
I'm waiting for the UFO

571
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,940
I'm waiting for the UFO

572
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,040
I don't know if it's right, but it's from his phone.

573
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,120
But if we yell at him real loud, he might be able to contact home,

574
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,080
but if we yell at him real loud, he might be able to contact home,

575
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,080


576
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,080


577
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,080


578
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,960
we could get back to the home planet.

579
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,560
remember, folks, which takes us to a planet of non-mortals

580
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,920
who are eons advanced in their civilization.

581
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,960
Our program is Otherworlds.

582
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,900
Another movie that's swept America is one entitled

583
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,320
The Encounters of the Third Degree.

584
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
May I tell you this?

585
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,900
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

586
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,060
I don't know if I believe them or not,

587
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,440
the New Zealand Air Force was on alert recently

588
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,800
because of the UFOs appearing over that nation

589
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,080
someone said do you believe in flying saucers

590
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,480
I said of course I'm a married man

591
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,820
if you don't get that now you may in the morning

592
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,800
over the breakfast table

593
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,140
you say what about UFOs

594
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,420
I don't want to delve into that

595
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,360
but I want to give you something that blesses my heart

596
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,500
I know there is life in the universe

597
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:06,000
why because evil spirits demonic spirits fill the universe

598
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,860
the cult is full of superstition and mysticism

599
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,600
we're scientists

600
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,760
laser beams shaped like vampires

601
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,940
with glow-in-the-dark brains

602
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,820
I've seen a vision ma'am

603
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,140
so play your cards right

604
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,280
yes

605
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,080
are you

606
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,440
dead

607
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,000
once everything goes in the right direction

608
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,000


609
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,120
let's take hover

610
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,980
you got reach

611
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,760
are you ready

612
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,060
holy shit

613
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,440
stop

614
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,440


615
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,700
have you ever thought that someone could be yours

616
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,400
you never really thought that someone could be real

617
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,420
when they met us

618
00:37:59,420 --> 00:37:59,420


619
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,440
and beyond. And if the true Messiah were to show up at that time, everyone would just know in the

620
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,980
bottom of their core programming that he's the Antichrist because he'll cuss and spit and take

621
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:17,460
the Lord's name in vain and hang out with whores and bulldiggers and dope addicts and cops. Another

622
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,200
down-home sort. This is a warning. Danger, danger, you poor devils. Things are more mixed up than you

623
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,880
ever dreamed. What was up is down. The priorities are all screwy. You're fretting if your hair looks

624
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,720
okay while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting out the front of your designer jeans.

625
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,440
Yes, this is bad talk. Nobody will listen to anything else. You won't look at TV unless body

626
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,840
parts or cars are jingling or crashing on it. You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve

627
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,160
drug in it. You haven't used your other senses since you were five, and you sure as hell won't

628
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,180
stop what you're doing until someone knows.

629
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:01,140
Much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more self-assured makes you stop, and you'll thank him

630
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:07,320
for it, and then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight, you'll realize that he

631
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:14,280
stopped you from doing the wrong thing. Good God, what in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this

632
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,640
world coming to? People bitch, people gripe. This is a sign of the end times. That's a sign of the

633
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,880
end times, when you should all be hollering,

634
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,740
it's all a sign of the end times.

635
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:32,740
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heretic on July 5th, 1998?

636
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,680
Would anyone like to take a guess what's going to happen to this heretic when the saucers come?

637
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:47,080
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998. He will be on those saucers with the sex

638
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,240
goddesses because he paid his $30 subgenius membership fee.

639
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,680
He had his membership card in the church, and even if you were to go out today and turn your back on

640
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,020
Bob's kids, have you ever heard any of this? Even if you were to go out tomorrow and get a job, maybe even as

641
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,180
president of the United States or a cop somewhere ripping apart people's cars searching for dope, you

642
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,600
would still be able to get on the pleasure saucers as long as you had that subgenius membership card,

643
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:22,560
as long as you paid for that subgenius membership card. Can you say the same? Can you say that you're

644
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,180
going to be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998? You're going to be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

645
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:33,180
Do you think you're going to squeak by just because you're cool? Do you think coolness is going to get you onto those space vessels?

646
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:41,920
Well, what are you going to do on X day when suddenly all your paid in full subgenius buddies

647
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,780
disappear? Many people would say, well, I'm not going to join up with the church of the subgenius.

648
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,120
The church of the subgenius,

649
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,640
it's an organization of non-joiners. So I'm not going to join. Well, I got a surprise for you,

650
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,160
folks. You're not going to be joining this on X day either. And X day, you have no idea what's

651
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:15,480
awaiting you all on X day. True slack, true slack is like better than getting gang sucked by a

652
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:26,180
horde of horny buxom Nordic Valkyries while eating a, while eating a big juicy T-bone steak on your birthday.

653
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:35,600
But X day, X day makes slack seem like you're wearing a helmet with a padlock chin strap.

654
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:43,680
That's right. By comparison, X day is going to make any slack you have seem like nothing.

655
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,960
Now you might think, well, I'm not going to spend any money on this church of the subgenius.

656
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm not going to spend any money on this. I got better things to do with my $30. I can go out and

657
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,460
buy a hoodie and the blowfish CD or something with that money. And I could sit at home and,

658
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,960
and I could listen to my hoodie and the blowfish CD over and over and over again.

659
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:14,180
And I, and I can sit back and, and just jam and have me a good time listening to my CD player.

660
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,500
Because you like music so much.

661
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,200
Well, on X day, that CD player is going to melt into a pile of slag.

662
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:33,660
That's right. All your cheap pink entertainment devices are going to be destroyed in the fires of, of, of the Xist invasion.

663
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:44,040
There will be no music then. The only music there will be, will be the screams of the dying.

664
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:54,980
You may not like the sound of this type of music, but we subgeniuses will damn well be dancing to the tune.

665
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:07,280
So what can you do? You can join up with the church of the subgenius or you'll be singing in the choir.

666
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,860
That's right, brothers and sisters. You'll be singing along with all that, all that screaming and pain and all that horrible,

667
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,820
horrible moaning and wailing and praying.

668
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,720
You know, when I was in Chicago last night, I was down in the dressing room getting ready to go up here and preach to the folks out there.

669
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,840
And a cockroach was crawling across the table.

670
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:38,580
And I took out my ink pen and I was kind of poking it along and it run, go across table and I'd reach over and poke it the other way.

671
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,960
And I'd watch it run and, and, and I'd sit there and watch the little things that got so frustrated.

672
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,360
And,

673
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,560
and then I took out my cigarette lighter and I started singeing around his antennas.

674
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:57,960
And then I reached around behind him and started burning off his wings and he flipped over and his little legs were kicking and screaming,

675
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,680
flying around in the air.

676
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:06,880
On next day, if you don't have a membership card, you're gonna pray.

677
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,480
You're gonna wish, you're gonna wish that you were that cockroach.

678
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,700
That's right.

679
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,180
You will wish you were that cockroach.

680
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,620
On next day, you'll wish that you could just be tortured for a little while and then,

681
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,180
and then put out of your misery in a burst of flame by some sadistic subgenius preacher.

682
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,760
But we're not gonna make it that easy on you.

683
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,620
No.

684
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:35,540
Brothers and sisters, the river is rising and you're gonna drown.

685
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,800
Tonight, I am offering you a personal flotation device.

686
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,780
To keep your head above this rising river, I'm offering you a personal flotation device

687
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,160
in the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

688
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,600
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

689
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,580
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

690
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,940
It is no accident that you are all here.

691
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:11,240
You all have been chosen to receive this message.

692
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,840
You have been chosen.

693
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,660
Thank you.

694
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,620
Because the water's rising up and it's just about to rise over your heads.

695
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,560
And we're gonna throw you this flotation device and you can either grab onto it and live or

696
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:30,240
you can pass it on by and you're gonna go down like yesterday's sh-t that's twirling

697
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,920
down the toilet.

698
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,920
It's no accident.

699
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,920
You must join the church of the subgenius or die.

700
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,380
You'll be damn glad that you joined.

701
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,120
you will be damn glad that you spent that pitiful $30.

702
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,760
I really don't want to see all of you die.

703
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,040
Some of you I do.

704
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,420
But I don't want to see all of you die.

705
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,100
We're here to help you.

706
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,040
We're your friends.

707
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,940
You must know, can't you feel, by looking at this man Bob,

708
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,540
how much he loves you?

709
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,700
Don't you realize how much Bob loves you?

710
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,200
He loves you so much that he's willing to offer you a chance

711
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,880
to have your every perverse desire be brought to life.

712
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,400
Your every sick sexual fantasy shall be made flesh before you.

713
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,300
Trust us.

714
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,440
Trust Bob.

715
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,320
Amen.

716
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,520
Maybe some of you still aren't willing to believe

717
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,760
to accept Bob into your lives.

718
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,000
Perhaps you need some proof.

719
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:52,400
Perhaps Bob, perhaps my main man, J.R. Bob Dobbs here,

720
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,180
will give me the power, the power to heal some lucky member

721
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,340
of the audience tonight.

722
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,580
Is there anybody here that needs to be healed of some horrible sickness?

723
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,060
Oh, wait.

724
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,940
We have a man here waving his hands.

725
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,440
Come on up here, brother.

726
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,260
Come on up here.

727
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,640
Come on up here, brother.

728
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,480
Let me help you.

729
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,480
Good evening, brother.

730
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,480
What's your name?

731
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,640
My name is Eric.

732
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,540
Eric.

733
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,780
And what brought you here tonight, Eric?

734
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,360
What brought you here tonight?

735
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,480
My crippled right leg.

736
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,080
Your crippled right leg brought you here tonight.

737
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,740
Well, Bob, Bob's going to give me the power to heal you of your maladies.

738
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,520
Bob's telling me that you have a problem in your leg.

739
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,660
Bob's telling me you have a tumor in your leg that you need healed.

740
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,200
Is this true?

741
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,520
And Bob told me that you had a terrible heart condition, brother.

742
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,540
Is this true?

743
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,720
It's true?

744
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,380
And Bob tells me that you have bursitis in your shoulder.

745
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,940
Am I right?

746
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,920
Have you got bursitis in your shoulder?

747
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,280
He has bursitis in his shoulder.

748
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,600
He has many maladies.

749
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,300
But Bob is also telling me that you've been having problems with your liver.

750
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,880
Is that true?

751
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,780
And that you've been having a problem with sexual dysfunction.

752
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,820
Is that true?

753
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,400
Yes.

754
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,780
It's true he's suffering from an obstruction.

755
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,900
Is it true that you're having some problem with your bowels?

756
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,240
Yes.

757
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:32,960
Yes.

758
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,640
And Bob also told me that you have a problem with really bad acne on your ass.

759
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,500
Is it true?

760
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,080
It's all over.

761
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,300
It's sad.

762
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,620
And that all the women call you pizza butt.

763
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,400
Is that true?

764
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,020
What women?

765
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,620
That's so sad.

766
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,400
A man with sexual dysfunction and a pizza butt who can't get a woman.

767
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,060
Bob is saying that you need to be healed of these maladies.

768
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,020
Bob is saying that you've had a problem with your throat too.

769
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,460
And your ears.

770
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,100
And the glands in your armpits.

771
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,400
And your left index finger.

772
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,880
And your right middle finger.

773
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,520
The one that keeps getting stiff every time a police car goes by.

774
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,460
Is it true brother?

775
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,740
This is the truth.

776
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,440
Well brother, tonight we're going to heal you.

777
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,720
We're going to heal you brother.

778
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:22,920
Oh yes.

779
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,000
Brother Bevilacqua is going to come up here to help me out with his healing.

780
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:34,660
Sometimes the power gets in me and it's so strong that I burn out the wires and actually accidentally kill the person I'm trying to heal.

781
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,440
But brother, we're going to heal you or kill you.

782
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,240
We're going to take care of your leg.

783
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,720
We're going to take care of your arm.

784
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,500
We're going to take care of your brain tumor.

785
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,080
We're going to take care of your sorry little limp and your packed up butthole.

786
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,680
We're going to take care of your angina pectoris.

787
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,500
We're going to take care of your swollen glands.

788
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,180
We're going to take care of that middle finger that sticks up on your right hand whenever a policeman comes by.

789
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,960
And make it so the middle finger on your left hand gets stiff when policemen go by too.

790
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,740
Brother, I'm going to lay my hands on you and heal you.

791
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,080
Beheal!

792
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:07,840
Oh my God!

793
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:13,680
Whoo, brothers! He isn't going to be needing this anymore.

794
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,780
Yee-haw!

795
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,280
Come on up, brother. Come on up.

796
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,860
How are you feeling now? How are you feeling now?

797
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,580
I'm feeling amazing.

798
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:30,520
Now go on out and find yourself a woman in this crowd and see if you can make your dysfunctional organs work.

799
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,160
But I've got total faith that Bob is going to do this for you.

800
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,420
I've got total faith that Bob is going to do this for you.

801
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,200
Yes, brothers and sisters.

802
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,780
You've seen the miracles tonight.

803
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,220
You've seen the healings and the inflictions of pain.

804
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,700
I see my brother here is actually over here carousing with a woman now.

805
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,960
Who's not looking at him as if he were a disgusting squid.

806
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,820
Oh, look at that. He's getting some action.

807
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:03,520
And Bob promises all of you all the action you'll ever need.

808
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,960
All the action you'll ever want.

809
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,360
And more.

810
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,540
Two and a half feet long solid aluminum.

811
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,940
The orifices are going to be stretching.

812
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,040
The heads are going to be collapsing.

813
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,340
And brothers and sisters, I'm not going to use any lubricant.

814
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,760
Oh, yes.

815
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,940
I have but one thing to say.

816
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,880
I have but one thing left to say to you all.

817
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,700
The supermarket has run out of food.

818
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,840
The highway out of town is jammed up.

819
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,160
Gridlocked.

820
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,040
The doctor's dead.

821
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,160
There's a meteor heading for your town.

822
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:59,220
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is sitting at the wheel of the last train out of town.

823
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,420
Brothers, sisters.

824
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,520
You've got to get on that train.

825
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:15,740
Because when you come right down to it, you either got to ride that train or you're going to get tied to the tracks.

826
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:27,700
Remember, it is far better to be a speeding car than it is to be a blind man crossing against the light.

827
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,280
Woo!

828
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,740
Woo!

829
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:30,880
Woo!

830
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:30,880


831
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,700
Amen, brothers and sisters.

832
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,420
Can I get an amen?

833
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,240
Amen!

834
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,200
Can I get a hallelujah?

835
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,040
Hallelujah!

836
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,460
What do you all want tonight, brothers and sisters?

837
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,280
Fire!

838
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,280
What do you want?

839
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,180
Fire!

840
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,980
Brothers and sisters, I need you to say it again.

841
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:54,500
But I need you to say it loud enough that the exes that are on their way here will hear you.

842
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,460
And they're going to crank up the radio and roll down the windows on their spaceship.

843
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,360
And they're going to light up a big fat-frop stick and smile.

844
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,460
And they're going to be coming down.

845
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,180
And you got to let them know that you're all waiting for them.

846
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,560
So what is it that you want, brothers and sisters?

847
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:11,600
Fire!

848
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,420
Yes, brothers and sisters, slack!

849
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,620
Oh, yes.

850
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,940
And who is going to give you this slack?

851
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:19,820
Me!

852
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,060
Yeah!

853
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,840
Go ahead!

854
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,380
Brothers and sisters, the train's leaving.

855
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,940
And a lot of you guys are on the right track.

856
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,520
Woo!

857
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,140
Praise Bob!

858
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,380
Praise Bob!

859
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,620
Thank you very much.

860
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,460
Good!

861
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,280
Woo!

862
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,680
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

863
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:53,400
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

864
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,320
Got your pencil ready?

865
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,920
Bob, Post Office Box 140306.

866
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,700
Dallas, Texas 75214.

867
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,980
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306.

868
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,760
Dallas, Texas 75214.

869
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,600
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

870
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,280
Woo!

871
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,960
You hand them that pamphlet, oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

872
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,900
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob, it's either truth or death.

873
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,740
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes?

874
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,660
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

875
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:38,120
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up, the Jupiter effect, oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

876
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:43,800
And men will, in the end times to come, men will gnash their brains and think backwards.

877
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:55,080
Dead Christians will come up from their graves, shambling and rotting like not of the living dead, but through it all, helping to profit from it all, is that one mighty link between Heaven and Earth.

878
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,500
That Bob, oh yeah, I can see it now, the miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

879
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:06,500
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends, but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob!

880
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:16,120
That face that can pile through eight-foot-thick titanium steel conspiracy fork-knock stores with that mighty pipe!

881
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,560
Oh, he ain't from another planet, he ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to, he's a man.

882
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,060
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh at you.

883
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,060


884
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,500
Right along with you, because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

885
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,860
Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what, that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again!

886
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:41,500
He's a fool today, he's a fool tomorrow, because he's the same Bob, he's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me.

887
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,000
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot.

888
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:54,360
That has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines, his nuclear reactors, that made him want to master the Earth,

889
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,340
no matter how nice it might have been before.

890
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,460
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate, the hate that makes us want to smite our brothers,

891
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,500
the hate that makes us get up in the morning and, friends, without that foolishness and that mighty hate,

892
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,540
why, we'd be no different from those normals, because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

893
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,020
And it's the mighty gripe power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.

894
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,560
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke, we may be drunk and neurotic, but we've got Bob and the hate!

895
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,340
And for that, we can hate!

896
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,460
Hate them! Hate them! Hate them!

897
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,000
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.

898
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,420
Oh, they've got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

899
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,300
Oh, I hate President Reagan. Oh, I hate my job. I hate myself.

900
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,840
That's the sick hate, friends. That ain't no kind of hate at all.

901
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,900
We've got that all-inclusive kind of hate, that hate essence,

902
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,680
and it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything.

903
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,600
So we can do something about it, because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

904
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,360
It's what keeps him on his toes. Bob is the aware man, the natural man.

905
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,480
He can be walking along humming to himself, playing pocket pool, but the inner Bob is aware.

906
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:07,780
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away, and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

907
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,220
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms.

908
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,580
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

909
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,000
Bob is aware, and that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

910
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,880
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

911
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,580
All those other flies, they're flies.

912
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,040
They're flying, flitting from pile to pile.

913
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,980
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob.

914
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,660
And they may laugh now, but winter goes by, summer goes by, all those other flies starve.

915
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,360
But that little Bob fly, he's still sitting there on that pile, a-munching away and a-munching away.

916
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:43,060
And that pile does not change because Bob, my friends, does not change.

917
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,220
Oh, he changes his mind.

918
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,920
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson.

919
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,620
But, oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

920
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,220
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

921
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:54,660
Bob.

922
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,680
There's a B on either side, opposite poles.

923
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,700
That's a lesson right there.

924
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,140
Flip it over on your tongue.

925
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,140
Say it front way.

926
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,840
Say it backwards.

927
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,740
Say it upside down.

928
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,480
And what does it say?

929
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,700
It says Bob.

930
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,740
Because Bob does not change.

931
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,260
His promise rings true.

932
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:15,160
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head, if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts of Bob, how are you going to get saved?

933
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,420
You can go to that party Saturday night, but you've got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

934
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,560
And you can drink beer.

935
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,500
You've just got to get Bob drunk, too.

936
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,780
And what about Wanda?

937
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,760
Oh, you're just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

938
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,200
That shouldn't be any problem.

939
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,320
Because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

940
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,200
Sit down, boy.

941
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,180
Because, friends, if you're wondering, Bob can love.

942
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,740
Bob can love.

943
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,920
Radio job.

944
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,760
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.

945
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,480
I was just a preacher.

946
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:52,480


947
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,540
Head up to here with it.

948
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,220
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities, I finally got to Hollywood.

949
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,860
I was offered four jobs, and I took one with a major network.

950
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:10,260
In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati.

951
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:17,440
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.

952
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,520
And it caused a lot of conversation.

953
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,900
I notice you keep looking out the window.

954
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,560
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?

955
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,240
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

956
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,000
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt then, huh?

957
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:34,580
No.

958
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,380
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

959
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,860
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers too.

960
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,420
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

961
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,420
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

962
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:03,260
Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God!

963
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,900
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

964
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:12,400
Yes, sir. Maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

965
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,640
Why, sure, Dad. What's cooking?

966
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,420
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

967
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,240
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Dad.

968
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,500
No.

969
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,500
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

970
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,280
Well, thanks.

971
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,280
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

972
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,580
Well, he calls it a...

973
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,620
When a man and a woman are married, Bob,

974
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,020
they love each other very much.

975
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,660
And in showing their love,

976
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,120
their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

977
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,140
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

978
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,460
They're the sperm, as the doctors call it.

979
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,980
Is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

980
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,160
No, no, Bob.

981
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,000
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the...

982
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,380
formed in two little sacs beneath the penis...
