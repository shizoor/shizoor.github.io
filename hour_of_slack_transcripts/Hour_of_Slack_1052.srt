00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,380
Let's hear the story of how one man developed a taste for beer.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,500
Oh, but I, uh, well, I, uh, I'd heard many good things about beer and had always planned to try it.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,480
So, try it I did.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,620
There's a certain relative who introduced me to beer, and I still detest him for it.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,380
It was just about then that he brought in the beer.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,160
I hope you won't mind if we waste the evening tasting this beer, a beer that made me famous.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
One, two...

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,840
Beer.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,280
Beaver, God knows you're lying.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:35,860
Oh, yeah?

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,200
Well, no.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,420
How?

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,140
Oh, because God knows everything.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,740
He sees everything.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,480
Are you kidding?

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,060
You know what happens to boys who tell lies?

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,800
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,580
You know you're going to have to be punished, don't you?

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,280
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,260
Well, what do you think a fair punishment would be?

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,360
Uh...

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,600
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,000
And I'm going to be miserable.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm going to be miserable all evening.

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,460
I don't care how miserable you are, you're going to enjoy it.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,600
Yes, well...

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:18,220
What you are in your inmost being escapes your examination in rather the same way that you can't look directly into your own eyes without using a mirror.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,960
You can't bite your own teeth.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,380
You can't taste your own tongue.

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,220
And you can't touch the tip of this finger.

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,140
With...

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
With the tip of this finger.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,820
And that's why there's always an element of profound mystery.

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,040
Something sets off the notion of a bird.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,360
Maybe you're thinking of a skylark you saw yesterday.

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,540
Or maybe you have a feeling of wanting to fly away.

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,720
The idea of bird includes all sorts of sub-ideas branching off,

38
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,980
even in normal consciousness,

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,100
such as flying, flight, wings, and tail.

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,580
In the expanded or hypomanic mind, there are two things happening.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,380
Thoughts are speeded up in time, more ideas per minute, and expanded in space, more ideas at once.

42
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:27,960
While thinking of a bird in this state, one might also have a sense of airplanes, rudders, ostrich, robin redbreast, blue jay, or even a bird.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,740
The �leley is a vision of a deer, a whale, encroached on a

The�를re mast and stileta begin to whisper words of all kinds.

pff pff.

55
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,860
Friends, that piece was by Reverend Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio.

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,900
And you can get all of that at nationalcynical.com.

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:19,100
National Cynical being one word, which I highly recommend if you recognize the value of your Slack.

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,640
You can easily see why it's your most valuable asset.

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,140
Slack puts our children through school.

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,900
We plan for their college education and expectation of Slack power and income.

61
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,820
Slack buys the vacations we sometimes take.

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:41,080
As long as Slack continues, we can meet our financial obligations and maintain the happiness, peace of mind, and security of our families.

63
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,560
No wonder our Slack is far more valuable than our home, our automobile, and all the material things we own.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,340
Ah, yes, dear friends.

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,080
This is your old, old friend and prayer partner, Reverend.

66
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:03,520
Reverend Ivan Stang, recording this only two weeks before the event that we call 9X Day.

67
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,120
The huge celebration of the end of the world that we subgeniuses hold.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:18,740
So far, every year, unfortunately, at a clothing optional campground deep in Amish country.

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,720
And this year, friends, this might really be the year.

70
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,440
Because if you'll look at the...

71
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,680
...website, you'll see that the...

72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,420
...the Exist portal, my friends, is set to open on schedule.

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,180
There are two great red spots on the planet Jupiter, you see.

74
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,120
You've heard of the great red spot.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,400
There's also one, and I'm not kidding now, called Red Junior, a smaller one,

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,260
which is moving towards the large one, the great red spot, and they are due to collide.

77
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,560
Or whatever they're going to do on July 4th of this year, which the conspiracy calls 2006.

78
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:12,200
Yes, friends, and so the great storms of Jupiter will converge on July 4th with unknown results,

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,520
or perhaps not so unknown, for this could be no less than the great conjunction predicted in pre-scriptures

80
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,120
when the 10 million monoliths emerge from the center of Jupiter.

81
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,400
And so the great storm will be the first of the vortex of the great storm in pairs, crisscrossed, to form Exist.

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,400
And that, friends, shall be our cue.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,760
And we shall arise, my mutant friends.

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,700
You'll notice, by the way, that July 5th lands on a Wednesday this year,

85
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,200
and we pray that you don't pink out, my friend.

86
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
Because think about it.

87
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,520
Ex Day is your only religious holiday.

88
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,740
Ah, yes.

89
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,240
Yes.

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,060
By the way, is the Billy Mayer show.

91
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,960
They will be performing at 9 Ex Day.

92
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,180
We managed to finish the new subgenius book, the subgenius cyclopedia of slack,

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
the Bobliagraphon, before the world ended.

94
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,080
But it probably won't be in bookstores until after the world's ended, so it's kind of a moot point.

95
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Makes for a great PDF file, though.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,900
Anyway, friends, although you might think that,

97
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,840
with we cultists expecting the world to end on July 5th,

98
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,180
that we'd blow everything off.

99
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:38,080
But ironically enough, we're pretty busy preparing to properly host the huge send-off party.

100
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,900
Ah, yes.

101
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:47,140
And it's true that, you know, we've expected to leave this doomed planet every year for nine years now.

102
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,160
And the positive thing about that is that we've built up lots of practice for the world ending.

103
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,120
Also, we've...

104
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,360
Built up lots of really bizarre documentary film and audio collections.

105
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,500
And in fact, this hour of slack, number 1052,

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,180
will mostly be the soundtrack of an unreleased DVD.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,900
It's actually a pretty good film about the 7 Ex Day drill of 2004.

108
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,000
But two of the breasts featured in it got cold feet, so to speak.

109
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,280
And I can't release it until I...

110
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,500
Remove the breasts.

111
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,120
So as you listen to this soundtrack, friends,

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,680
just imagine that the speakers of all the female voices that you hear have their shirts off.

113
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,340
This, by the way, is the Ex Day drill,

114
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,600
where the photos on the internet cause so much trouble for the young mom, Reverend Magdalene.

115
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,860
And, uh...

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,220
Ah, yes.

117
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,720
Uh...

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,380
Next week's actual 9 Ex Day drill will feature many of the same famous subgenius participants you'll hear,

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,580
including Reverend Magdalene,

120
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,500
Jesus,

121
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
Dr. Howell,

122
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,500
Dr. Philodrum,

123
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,520
Reverend Nikki Deathchick,

124
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,860
Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

125
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,200
Reverend Alex,

126
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,620
the amino acids, dear friends.

127
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,180
We're about to hear lots of cuts of them live.

128
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,060
And also, the Billy Nair Show.

129
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Heard again.

130
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,900
In the background, this is from their soundtrack album for The American Astronaut, a great film.

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,580
And now together, friends, let's imagine the 7 Ex Day uncensored video.

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,600
This one's a keeper.

133
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,420
Ah!

134
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,080
Ah!

135
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,980
So, hi.

136
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Just to bow our heads for a moment.

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,120
Turned up, served a moment of, uh, great deed.

138
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,360
Uh, honorable, sacred...

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,720
NOOOOOO!

140
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,480
PRAISE BO!

141
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,400
PRAISE BO!

142
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,120
PART! SUCKER! FUN!

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,020
You can beat the conspiracy with their own bullshit.

144
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,040
PRAISE BO!

145
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,100
PRAISE BO!

146
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,760
You take their bullshit, repackage it,

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,020
slap a Harley Davidson sticker on it, and the conspiracy will buy it back from you.

148
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,680
Because this man smiles, cause he knows that he's a good guy.

149
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:23,680


150
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
He knows how the conspiracy works.

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,600
He's trying to teach us how it works.

152
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,180
Through the teachings of Bob, we can overcome the conspiracy and sell him the own shit.

153
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,540
Friends, the life is the money, and I mean the blood, er, well, money and the blood and the slack,

154
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:48,100
and the life all mixed together with the sperm and blood on the stage of the Ex Day, the Bible in Brushwood.

155
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,260
No parking except for Bob.

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,240
You're all married now.

157
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,660
You're all married now.

158
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,300
You're holy men, and we can say that.

159
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,100
Although also, I might add, that by virtue of the fact that I'm a holy man,

160
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:07,760
I now declare that you may, as of this moment on, do anything that you want.

161
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,380
Concentrated Guru Pee.

162
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,600
This is dried Guru Pee that we burn.

163
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,460
We burn this Guru Pee, and it oxidizes into our mucous membranes.

164
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,800
And we imbibe the wisdom of the Gurus through this.

165
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,620
Is that what makes your nostril hairs grow?

166
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,320
Yeah.

167
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
So good.

168
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,420
So good.

169
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,560
Am I sexy?

170
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,160
We'll know.

171
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,260
But only when you will know.

172
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,080
As Bob said, I dare you to challenge my taunt.

173
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,460
And so?

174
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,840
The dark side has won.

175
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,840
And evil has triumphed in the form of a tiny gene.

176
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,900
Yes, a rapacious, greedy gene that Dr. Moreau failed to remove.

177
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:15,940
A gene, a tiny code made of simple chemicals, basic chemicals, common to all life, all over the universe.

178
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,980
Amino acids, they're called.

179
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,980
Yes, they exist in space.

180
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,440
In fragmented, distorted, mutated, other things.

181
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,620
They are in the form of a deadly, rude, foul-smelling form, such as seen here.

182
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,160
Forms pleasing to the human eye, and others which we would consider monstrous.

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,120
Remember, to them, maybe we're the monsters.

184
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Heavy, isn't it?

185
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,440
Yes, they are.

186
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,840
And if there is an X-day, then that means it's a day of destruction.

187
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,700
Yes, it's a day of destruction.

188
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,420
And if there is a day of destruction, then it's a day of destruction.

189
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,420


190
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,420


191
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,420


192
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,420


193
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,980
And if there is a day of destruction, then it's a day of destruction.

194
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:53,980


195
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,740
Man, I just got Diane Arbus, eat your heart out.

196
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,560
David Lynch, go home.

197
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,520
Kind of kick a little something past you for the G's and make a few friends as I breeze through.

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,740
You know, it's two in the morning and the party's still jumping.

199
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,100
And because my old lady ain't home.

200
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,860
The bitch is in the living room and getting it on, and they ain't leaving until 6 in the morning.

201
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,100
What you want to do?

202
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,160
I got a pocket full of rubbers, and my homeboys do, too.

203
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm a trap, this is a trap, and you're going to make me pay for this.

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,400


205
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:34,800
I am sexy. I am straight. I am gay. I am bi. I am boy. I am girl. I am child. I am adult.

206
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:44,320
I am woman. I am man. I am softcore. I am hardcore. I am independent. I am dependent.

207
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:55,420
I am disabled. I am evil. I am God. I am the devil. I am nothing. I am everything.

208
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:06,720
I am power. I am weakness. I am a galaxy. I am the universe.

209
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:34,340
Good evening. I am little Theodore. And this is my lovely assistant Babushka.

210
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,200
And we've got some ruminations

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,380
about our time on this slackless rock before we leave it.

212
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,460
Get up out of bed. Sour on my head.

213
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,020
Drinking down a cup. Trying to wake up.

214
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,400
Driving up the town. Feeling like a clown.

215
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,820
Some guy's in my lane. Heard a bullet through his window pane.

216
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,320
Pulling to the lot. God damn bosses got my favorite spot.

217
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,320
Greeting everyone.

218
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,840
Ch세� Center and Twitter

219
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,880
Trying to act trying to act dumb.

220
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,060
I don't feel I'm here.

221
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,140
But then of course the question isn't where?

222
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,200
People are all going blurr.

223
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm plagued by what breaks out.

224
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,400
It's become what my life's all about.

225
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,020
I had the match.

226
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,180
I was young and grown.

227
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


228
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


229
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


230
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


231
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


232
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


233
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


234
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


235
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


236
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


237
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


238
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


239
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


240
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,180


241
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,580
I wouldn't have to do this

242
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,600
If I had the map

243
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,740
I wouldn't have to do this

244
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,720
If I had the map

245
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,640
You too can be little Theodore in this jacket.

246
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,420
Just look at it.

247
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,080
The casual man about town elegance

248
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,980
the insouciance

249
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,860
the pretty amazing really

250
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,940
and this pinnacle of fashion sensibility

251
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,720
is being offered right here

252
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,700
if you have the smarts to go for this item.

253
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm opening the bid at one single dollar.

254
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,720
Do we hear more than one dollar for the jacket

255
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,360
that contains the heaving torso of Louis Vuitton?

256
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,180
Two dollars!

257
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,160
Everybody put your finger in your nose!

258
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,360
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your clothes

259
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,720
I don't know how you feel one way or another

260
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,160
Makes you feel happy then wipe it on your brother

261
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,420
But if you get taste, you won't Clark.

262
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,860
Da dum bop, da dum bop

263
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,760
No matter the temptation, I don't care what they think

264
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,900
I'd rather be some genius than wind up pink

265
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,200
Cause Bob still gives me gumption

266
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,100
and Connie flips my crown

267
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,900
and I'm not about to let them bastards

268
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
get me down

269
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,100
Da dum dum dum

270
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,120
But you know when you try to think about your own mind,

271
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,220
It almost always backfires because there's one thing far more powerful than your mind

272
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,520
You can try to do the right thing by analyzing your own motives and all that kind of thing, but ultimately

273
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,500
Something will win the ego

274
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,680
Yes, your ego is so much smarter than your brain will ever be that it fools your brain into thinking that it's got the upper

275
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,660
Hand uh-huh. Oh, yes, sir. But in the bottom line is you're always going well here in my own little world

276
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,480
I know I'm not really in my own little world. I've really got my act together

277
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:51,040
In my own little world friends ain't it wonderful to pull the wool over your own eyes then you can go wow

278
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,320
I still can't see but at least it's my own wool

279
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,680
But at least I know it that's important I don't think you do know it though

280
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,080
No, I do. Do you know you're an asshole?

281
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,940
I'm trying to tell you that you don't really know you're an asshole and you just think that pretending to be an asshole is funny

282
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, maybe you're right really when it when it's how is the difference between somebody who's really an asshole and somebody's pretending to be an asshole

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,740
Maybe I don't really know the depths of my own assholiness. Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you man as your friend

284
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,560
I have not even I mean to the extent that I have been an asshole for

285
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,480
Thousands of years. I've never actually refined it to the true art form that I have

286
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,060
Perfectly all the capabilities of doing and he's already forgotten how the sentence started

287
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,640
He's guessing how I started

288
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:57,260
You can't even remember what he's looking at so don't need to remember because they can just ramble ramble ramble ramble

289
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,960
They don't mean to and yet maybe deep inside they do mean to because that is what they are

290
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,860
So where's my frog stay go with it stay

291
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,260
Where's my frog man?

292
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,380
You're you want that award again, don't you the hey staying a little hey staying?

293
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey staying

294
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,700
See my butt plug staying

295
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,300
you

296
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:52,880
. Yes, we could be on in fundamentalism, and the food fundamentalism and friends

297
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,200
But best of all we put the Ha in hate

298
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,960
That's a new bumper sticker for you we put the Ha in hate

299
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,300
Yes, and in fact, we also put the very

300
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:20,920
low in love, we can take a soaring emotion like love and just make it low and big, wallowing

301
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,680
sex. That's true love, folks.

302
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:59,680
But certainly we all feel it, that inner vibe, that creepy little conspiracy pill that all of us have managed to swallow that keeps us from enjoying the high brow along with the low brow, that keeps us from enjoying the slack along with the anti-slack.

303
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,840
And friends, if you think there isn't anti-slack at Brushwood, well, they've got you by the balls.

304
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,080
Folks,

305
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,620
I

306
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:39,660


307
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,140
am a little trout yanking them out and bringing them down here.

308
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,460
That's what we do, ladies and gentlemen.

309
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,460
Boy, if that isn't what religions are about.

310
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,080
Try and grab that conformity that they've widened into your hips

311
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,580
through some subliminal way.

312
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:09,640


313
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,840
And try and rip it out.

314
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,300
Try and rip it right out.

315
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,480
Just like you would, you know, chuck off a load every now and then.

316
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,400
Next time you masturbate, be it male or female, masturbation, I don't rightly care.

317
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,800
The next time you do it, imagine that angry hate on.

318
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,020
It's this, it's the pole going in the hole.

319
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:52,040
I now pronounce you man and or object and wife and or object for the next 24 hours.

320
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,060
Now you must kiss very hard.

321
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,220
Wow, that's awesome.

322
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,380
This is the first time anybody's ever really done that.

323
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,820
Just tell people to do it.

324
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,360
Shut up.

325
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,640
You are now duly authorized and excused for sexual couplings of any perversion.

326
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,760
You are now the first unspeakable kind for a period of 24 hours.

327
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,220
Everybody's fucking.

328
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,080
So many people fucking.

329
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,620
Are dead and wild.

330
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,060
And I'm not.

331
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,860
And I'm not.

332
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,520
Glad that I'm not.

333
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,120
Fucking.

334
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,620
Oh shit.

335
00:23:31,620 --> 00:24:01,620


336
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,220
The next time you do it, imagine that angry hate on.

337
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,200
It's this, it's the pole going in the hole.

338
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,660
I now pronounce you man and or object for the next 24 hours.

339
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,620
I know.

340
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,820
That's what everybody's fucking.

341
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:23,940
And I'm not.

342
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:31,600
Can't I just say something.

343
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:31,600


344
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,680
I present to you a great man, Dr. Howe.

345
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,220
The Keeper of Church Secrets.

346
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:42,520
It is important, as Bob embraces Connie and the knowledgeable subgenius must endure, indulge in, and withstand the embrace of the conspiracy,

347
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:53,940
that we explore the viewpoint of the opposite sex by being that person and letting our inner nature come forth.

348
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:02,680
Satan or pornography, how often we hear them linked, going hand in hand or tail in tail.

349
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:10,520
But look at this fabulous outfit, the stockings, the sandals, and the matching handbag.

350
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,100
She is really gone all out to appear before us today.

351
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,700
Ladies and gentlemen, give her a round of applause, please.

352
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,400
My name is Helga and I want to have intercourse with your eyeball.

353
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,600
Ah, yes, the eye socket to me theme.

354
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,160
Well, that was short, that was expressive.

355
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,320
Who else?

356
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,360
You may have seen the Miss America contest.

357
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,180
They always ask the girls, you know, what are your plans?

358
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,860
And they always say they want to work with troubled children or be a brain surgeon.

359
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,800
Or unless they lose, where they get to be a stripper.

360
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,180
And now we have, I'm not certain I know the name of your identity.

361
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,020
You better tell us.

362
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,600
Philomena.

363
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,580
Philomena Drummond.

364
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,520
And she is just as cute as a June bug, as they say.

365
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,800
A little simpering perhaps, but in the spirit of things, certainly.

366
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,560
Philomena, how is your subgenius nature improved by your new identity?

367
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,080
That's all right.

368
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm not sure.

369
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,160


370
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,160


371
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,160


372
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,160


373
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,260
I have a question, Dr. Al.

374
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,680
Well, I didn't mean to ask a hard one.

375
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,580
Perhaps I should ask an easy one.

376
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,020
Does this make you love Bob all the more?

377
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,740
Oh, yes.

378
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,260
My love for Bob is just boundless.

379
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,800
I thought it would be somehow.

380
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,240
What's it like to be an overwoman?

381
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,040
Yes, what's it like to be an overwoman for a change?

382
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,360
I just don't know.

383
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,520
It's silly or something.

384
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,120
I don't know.

385
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,160
Well, he's just flowing with the spirit of Bob.

386
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,780
He gives Bob.

387
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,400
Yeah.

388
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,260
She throws him off camels and he goes out and grabs Bob's back.

389
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,260


390
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't know, but I feel the same, and that's what i'm not asusion to as it is.

391
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,220
One of my friends said it was a long time when I had passed.

392
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,100
Well, stopped fortunate, and had love for Bob.

393
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,260
She's an overwoman, you see.

394
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,120
I am中國, and I just enjoyed myself.

395
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,120


396
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,120


397
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,420
I think that's the problem.

398
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,360
No, not at all.

399
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,620
The're two of us that worked long, long fields to create sugar.

400
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,480
I wanted to have everyone's mark.

401
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,980
This is a

402
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:20,980


403
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,460
Well, just for what we do, it's one.

404
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
Those who call themselves my friends.

405
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,980
The thing is, of course, I've chosen my outfit

406
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,620
because this is the standard outfit for one of the brides of Christ.

407
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,440
And many of you don't really realize, but, you know,

408
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,200
this little bib, like accoutrement that nuns wear,

409
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,280
do you know what it's for?

410
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,240
It's called a wimple, is it not?

411
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,280
It is.

412
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,500
No.

413
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,920
This is to wipe your lips after you've eaten the body of Christ.

414
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,320
Share the load!

415
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,200
There you are.

416
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,120
After the transubstantiation of the host, as it were.

417
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:13,520
Here's someone who appears to be a devotee of America's national pastimes.

418
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:13,920
Yeah!

419
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,540
Woo!

420
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,920
Go, ladies!

421
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,800
Yeah!

422
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,980
Just so you all know, I am a pitcher and not a catcher.

423
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,880
Yeah!

424
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,420
An important distinction.

425
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,120
Yeah, baby!

426
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,440
I lost my drugs twice today.

427
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,640
Twice today.

428
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,580
If it weren't for the power of Bob and the love of subgenii,

429
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
I would be fropless.

430
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,440
I lost my frock twice.

431
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,980
And why?

432
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,620
And why?

433
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,400
Drugs.

434
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,540
Because the frock took your mind.

435
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,760
No, it wasn't a frock.

436
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,060
It was a false drug.

437
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,480
It was not.

438
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,860
It was the false marijuana.

439
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:50,680
Oh.

440
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,580
This stuff here.

441
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,900
It was not frock.

442
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,340
That's why it took my mind.

443
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,480
It's false drugs.

444
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,320
You don't want to smoke it.

445
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,400
It made me throw my sunglasses in the fire.

446
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,520
It made you lose your other false drugs.

447
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,080
It made me lose my real false drugs twice.

448
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,960
Not once, but twice.

449
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,880
Come on now!

450
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,820
Let's all take some vascular!

451
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,780
The Christians have landed.

452
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,240
The minds expanded.

453
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,140
The indefatigable being.

454
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,600
A subgenius.

455
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,080
Nothing else like it.

456
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,620
Don't expect this shit.

457
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,560
Look at what they get.

458
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,360
Spiling out.

459
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,080
In all directions.

460
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,300
In the race of science.

461
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,440
In the race of science.

462
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,440


463
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,780
Around us.

464
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,020
Friends, if you've got to buy a pack of lies, you may as well get it by the crate.

465
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,520
And you just might find in that crate, the true lies.

466
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:47,760
The true lies.

467
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,460
The lies that are truer than the truth itself.

468
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,200
Friends, buy bulk.

469
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,140
Buy Bob.

470
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,800
And he smiles because we know that we can destroy the conspiracy ourselves.

471
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,260
From the inside.

472
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,840
We can infiltrate the conspiracy through its schools.

473
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,560
With the help of the

474
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,720
This is something that I know all of you will be in tune to.

475
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,080
And probably there will be a rush when I explain what this is all about.

476
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,580
What this is all about.

477
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,460
when God becomes a drug.

478
00:32:53,060 --> 00:33:00,300
Now this one teaches you how to break the chains of religious addiction and abuse.

479
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,860
Those of you that have been in the Church of the Subgenius

480
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,400
are experienced in this particular perversion.

481
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,300
Father Leo Booth has poured out his soul and his heart.

482
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,360
Mascots often become super salesmen.

483
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,120
Look at that.

484
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,800
I just popped it open, picked it, proved it. There it is.

485
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:32,300
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!

486
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,700
We gonna do the St. Latha Latha murah!

487
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,020
Praise God! Praise!

488
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,100
Praise to Love!

489
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,280
A lot of people die, they have to have work today.

490
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,960
I want to be Bob, or eternity can play.

491
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,320
I want to be Jesus, or eternity can come.

492
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,500
I want to be Jesus, or eternity can come.

493
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,800
I want to be Bob, I want to be Bob.

494
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,360
I want to be Bob, I want to be Bob.

495
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,560
But his eyes grew dim, and his ears dull,

496
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,260
and the skin grew.

497
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
He grew yellow on his old skull.

498
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,680
Through his bony claw with a pale sheen,

499
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,320
the stony jewels slipped unseen.

500
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,280
No feet he heard, though the earth shaped,

501
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,500
when the young dragon his thirst slaked.

502
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,680
The stream smoked at his dark door,

503
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,480
the flames hissed on the dank floor.

504
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,260
And he died alone in the red fire.

505
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,120
His bones were ashes in the hot mire.

506
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,900
And now he leads us to be his accordion.

507
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:46,900


508
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:46,900


509
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:46,900


510
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:46,900


511
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,080
no,

512
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,120
no

513
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,320
one

514
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,320


515
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,400
no,

516
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,820
no,

517
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,100


518
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


519
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


520
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


521
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


522
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


523
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


524
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


525
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


526
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,180


527

578
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,480

okay we're going to crucify somebody it's either going to be this obscene disgusting murder this

and your wives and your moms and your dads or you can you can either crucify him or as they used to

583
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,520
do in ancient America you can instead crucify this guy who talks about peace all the time and smokes

584
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:31,620
pot oh by the way he also promotes uh free sex and says women are evil I thought that would do it

585
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,940
let's change the rules

586
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:45,220
the cross of capitalism to be born by this poor working man this particular working man

587
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,620
where's your God now

588
00:40:51,620 --> 00:41:05,120
let him be sprayed with pink fake blood

589
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,000
rather than bright red fake blood

590
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,140
how many times am I falling you gotta fall one more time

591
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,380
okay it's time to strip him of his garments

592
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:31,420
we need some young new ball women to come help him get cleaned up with with big breasts if you believe

593
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,240
you could see it it is the foreskin of Jesus and it will go on

594
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,660
the sale at the bulldada auction here it is look at the size of that foreskin look at the urethra

595
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:49,480
one hell of a circumcision look he's still bleeding truly he was the son of God I'm the

596
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,380
funniest fellow you ever heard my mother's a virgin my father's a bird so here's to the

597
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:04,740
disciples and fuck them all and we'll all live free James Joyce said that if they can't take a joke J.R

598
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,600
Dobbs said that

599
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:26,380
the show's over here move on move on the police can handle the rest they're just getting in the way of the fire department in the emergency squad there will be a conflagration at the roundhouse and perhaps even the fabled naked dancing

600
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:34,780
faggots perhaps one of them might even be of the female human variety we shall now embark upon the

601
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:44,000
scene how of the sacred oh that is a sacred icon in fact let's evacuate or vacate the evacuation

602
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:53,500
chamber praise Bob and let him go up in smoke so that the exes will know that at long last there's

603
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,440
somebody down here worth evacuating

604
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:17,680
where are the Bob enzyme pills this is the limpest Bob ever

605
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,040
I guess that I guess that male enhancement company owns Bob after all

606
00:43:35,880 --> 00:44:05,480
once again the King falls we killed Kennedy every one of us this Bob house was it was you and me we killed Bob yes he was born from our own brows ripped from our livers and uh spunked in our wet dreams and so we too shall destroy him like Frankenstein's monster I hope it ain't not too late I'm gonna have to go and get him

607
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,480


608
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,480


609
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,480


610
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,480


611
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh wait, no, Frankenstein's monster destroys Frankenstein.

612
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,720
I guess some of us are in trouble.

613
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:19,300
Well, looks like some of the goddesses have arrived from space.

614
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,760
Oh, she acts like she doesn't want it, but she does.

615
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,700
I know that they all do.

616
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,860
I know they all want it.

617
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,740
They all, all of y'all girls want it.

618
00:44:40,820 --> 00:45:01,360
I know that they all want it.

619
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,540
I know that they all want it.

620
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:33,060
Every year, the Exodus actually did rupture us, but they just take a little bit at a time.

621
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,900
They took P. Kitty's, uh,

622
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,720
insulin, and they took my memory.

623
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,240
They took several people's morals and values.

624
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,660
Jesus' hair!

625
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,860
Huh? Yeah, they, uh,

626
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,780
Sid Fulton's hair.

627
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,220
You know, it's sad.

628
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,600
I mean, bits and pieces of us falling off Wellman's teeth.

629
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,060
All those things are on the escape vessels, and, uh,

630
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,460
so, I guess we'll get them all back eventually.

631
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,480
Here's one part I've been so anxious about.

632
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,920
I'm anxious to see if you have no more.

633
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,180
And every year I come here, and I come here believing.

634
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,180
Not just wanting to believe, I come here believing the saucers will arrive.

635
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,240
July 5th, 7 a.m.

636
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,820
The saucers are gonna be here.

637
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,240
We're gonna be swept up.

638
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,660
We're gonna be caught up.

639
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,580
We're gonna be...

640
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,500
sucked into the, the, the conceptual, uh,

641
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,860
uh, orpuses of, of

642
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,460
pan-galactic, uh, uber-thought beings.

643
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,480
Projections that will gratify our every urge.

644
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,880
We're, we're gonna be, we're gonna be taken away from all this shit.

645
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,460
It's gonna finally happen in every single year.

646
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,080
I don't even fucking get up at 7 a.m.

647
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,700
Because, you know what?

648
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,980
I know in my gut they didn't make it.

649
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,320
Again.

650
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,440
And what happens?

651
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,360
I have

652
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,360
become utterly disillusioned.

653
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,580
I walk away from this going, you know, that was a hell of a party, but

654
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,860
God damn it, we didn't get the saucers.

655
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,720
And, and, and I find myself struggling with this.

656
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,640
I, I, so how can I, how can I continue to involve myself in an organization that continually lets me down?

657
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,220
It's not like I get sex from the church, you know?

658
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,760
It's not like I get cunning from the church.

659
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,300
It's not like I get friends from the, well, okay, actually, I, I have that.

660
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,320
I've grabbed in a lot of friends of us.

661
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,660
But regardless, the, the thing is, is there's this issue of doubt.

662
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,780
There's this, why am I doing this?

663
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,220
Why am I putting myself through this?

664
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,920
And, and, and, and why, why do I even waste my time with this?

665
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,440
And, and the thing is, is that's a gift.

666
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,300
That's a gift.

667
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,900
Because, I mean, ask, ask Heisenberg.

668
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,300
Ask Goodell.

669
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,880
Ask Schrodinger.

670
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,440
Ask fucking Einstein.

671
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,280
The universe floats in a haze of quantum indeterminacy.

672
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,660
That means that you will never know.

673
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,840
Because it just might not work out that way.

674
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,400
It's called, it's called relativity.

675
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,100
It's called improbability.

676
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,400
It's called, you know, it's, it's called slack.

677
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,700
Because you know what?

678
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,860
You don't need to know.

679
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,400
Ba dum ba.

680
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,420
Ba dum ba.

681
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,900
The times they are changing.

682
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,760
And things are getting grim.

683
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,060
Ba dum ba.

684
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,700
Oh, ba dum ba.

685
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,860
The X's are remissing.

686
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,260
And our odds are getting slim.

687
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,700
Ba dum ba.

688
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,080
Ba dum ba.

689
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,280
Sure, I could give up and let my hopes go flat.

690
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,000
I really got to ask you though.

691
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,400
Hmm, where's the slack in that?

692
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,440
Bob, ba-dum, Bob.

693
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,820
I hate to say that.

694
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,220
I hate to question such a basic thing.

695
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,100
But we must question authority.

696
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,180
And the ultimate authority, there you go.

697
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,980
Somebody's been reading their prescriptures.

698
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,280
See, that's the problem with it.

699
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,500
You can talk about awareness and enlightenment and all that,

700
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,580
but how do you know you're not just the robot that's programmed

701
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,660
to tell all the other robots how programmed they are?

702
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,240
Who's programming robots?

703
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,260
I often get the impression, oh, well, you know,

704
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,300
they wound me up and sent me out there to tell them about Slack

705
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,260
and how to free themselves from being wound up.

706
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:45,660
Man.

707
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,020
Anyway.

708
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,920
I hadn't meant to go into that.

709
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,040
You know, but sometimes I question this thing.

710
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:57,920
You know, I thought the X's were going to arrive at some point sooner than this.

711
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,780
I mean, gosh.

712
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,160
X.

713
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:08,580
Torture is waking up on X day morning with the worst heartburn you've ever, ever had.

714
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,100
Absolutely the worst day ever.

715
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,800
Absolutely the worst day ever.

716
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,320
It was the worst day, obviously.

717
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,000
Fuck Bob.

718
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,060
Fuck X.

719
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,460
Stop the X torture.

720
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,620
I am beaten.

721
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,620
It is over.

722
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,260
University is over.

723
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,260
Why do you X torture me, Bob?

724
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,740
It was obviously the worst day.

725
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,180
Something special has been given to those people that lost faith.

726
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,160
You know, those people have been given a gift.

727
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,300
A gift called suspicion and disbelief.

728
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,300
You know, anytime any of those people that have walked away from the church and the sub-genius,

729
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:10,880
anytime they go to another religion or another spirituality or another form of self-indulgent,

730
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,600
you know, self-gratification that we like to think of as religion,

731
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,100
but it's just really justification for our actions.

732
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:26,500
Anytime somebody goes somewhere else to find something else somewhere inside their mind,

733
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,500
they're going to be thinking.

734
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:32,300
They're going to be thinking, is this just another scam?

735
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,760
Is this just somebody else making money off of me?

736
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,160
Is somebody else getting rich off of me?

737
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,780
Just like, just like when I gave all that money to the church of the sub-genius.

738
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,480
Those people have been given a gift.

739
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,880
It's called disbelief.

740
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,900
Now, once there was a little boy who wouldn't say his prayers.

741
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,480
And he was a little boy.

742
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,320
And when he went to bed at night,

743
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,180
away upstairs,

744
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,420
his mammy heard him holler.

745
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,780
And his daddy heard him bawl.

746
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,240
And when they turned the covers down,

747
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,480
he wasn't there at all.

748
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:15,440
And they searched him in the rafter room and cubbyhole and press.

749
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,740
They searched him up the chimney flue and everywhere, I guess.

750
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:26,940
But all they ever found was just his pants and roundabout and the goblins.

751
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:27,860
That's where's the psyche of the age boys and broads,

752
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:27,860


753
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,480
They'll get you if you don't watch ot.

754
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,920
And we'd be apples tweets and heard ton of Europape and and sun Pat conveys them and

755
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,640
tell people that gof and enjoyVA Ethan and aid in life ahadetotostanechip DD-USU three

756
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:53,340
count wage and come too when they get too excited and then just when it was damn time cost

757
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,960
a exact shit hot boy what he wouldn't make hair when he wasn't a hundred, whatever it

758
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,300
be, which I don't think family didn't say, right.

759
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:55,620
Though maybe there's no gods in huis around town.

760
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,460
But he was a man and moving around like the word free fly hook on the sensations of freak

761
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:04,000
Black things a-standin' at her side, and they snatched her through the ceiling, for she knew what she's about.

762
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,940
And the goblins will get you if you don't watch out.

763
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,020
I wish they would drop dead.

764
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,700
I wish they would drop dead.

765
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,460
I wish they would drop dead.

766
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:18,600
I wish they would drop dead.

767
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:45,220
I wish they would drop dead.

768
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,700
I wish they would drop dead.

769
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:36,840
I wish they would drop dead.

770
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:06,980
I wish they would drop dead.

771
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:57,380
I wish they would drop dead.

772
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:27,440
I wish they would drop dead.

773
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,340
I wish they would drop dead.

774
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,460
I wish they would drop dead.

775
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,560
I wish they would drop dead.

776
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,800
I wish they would drop dead.

777
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,780
I just wish they would drop dead.

778
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,420
I go dook dook dook do.

779
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:14,560
Burr burr burr burr burr, burr burr burr burr burr, burr burr burr, burr burr burr, burr burr burr, brightery thay.

780
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,160
From PR news in Washington.

781
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,840
I'm accused of trying to wipe out PR news.

782
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,240
New York.

783
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,440
Officials secretly installed spyware programs that flooded your red Bulls deal.

784
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,360
users' computers with PR's reports.

785
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,460
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer was especially difficult to remove

786
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,260
with poison gas and other weapons.

787
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,160
In a statement, Spitzer said that Spitzer meant to monitor people's Internet use.

788
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,420
Lawmakers in Massachusetts turned violent in Paris today.

789
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,840
Paving stones, batons, tear gas, and PR news in Paris.

790
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,300
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney will face PR news Washington.
