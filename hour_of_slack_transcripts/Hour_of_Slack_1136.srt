00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Dear Hour of Slash, I'm standing outside of Ed Arroyo Auto Body Shop in San Francisco

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,900
waiting for puzzling evidence to come out of the taqueria where he's buying a Red Bull

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,000
because we're going to do a four hour show on Pirate Cat Radio with John Hell

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,300
and Pirate Cat Radio is located above Ed Arroyo's Auto Body Shop.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,700
That's where the Pirate Radio station is, above the Auto Body Shop in San Francisco

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,620
and I guess we're going to go over there and do a long, long show

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,840
which will be this episode of Hour of Slash.

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,620
Give me the hammer, Bob.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,760
The lunatic is in this room.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Shine the light on there, Bob.

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,840
Good night.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,440
The Soul Genius Hour of Slash.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,400
The Soul Genius Hour of Slash.

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,380
The Soul Genius Hour of Slash.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:41,020
The champ is gone.

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,520
This way, Joe.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,420
This way, this way, this way, this way.

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,900
Not only have I got it, I love it like a brother.

19
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,240
Good.

20
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,020
Good.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,960
It should, Louie.

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,020
It should, it should.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,660
The voice of the...

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
Bob howling for blood.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,500
Oh, perhaps the world is sick and I'm well.

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,680
Who's on the big show tonight?

27
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
Listen, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,320
Remember, Bob.

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,060
The Church of the Sixth Sense.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,580
Oh, thank you.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,300
Thank you.

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,520
Thank you, Norell.

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,860
And thank you, Fernandi Nandi, for the openings.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,400
Ooh.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,560
Ah.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:39,700
Hey, friends, this 1136th Hour of Slash finds us in San Francisco for the whole show at

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:47,920
the Mongoloidapalooza Devival, the KPFA Puzzling Evidence Show, and John Hell's Season in Hell

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,520
Show from Pirate Cat Radio, all there in San Francisco.

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,140
And we'll hear plenty of Mongoloid, Hell, Hal, and Philo.

40
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:07,860
And Puzzling, and Gary Gebrogfran, and Philo's latest daughter, and Morrell, and Murrly Murr.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:17,400
But first, there's this, well, there's this, uh, an outspoken concerned citizen named Frank

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,260
Chew in the San Francisco scene.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,420
Frank could be called a colorful and beloved eccentric local character and friend to many.

44
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,840
Now, I didn't get to meet him, but, uh, he opened up the show at, uh, 12 Galaxies Nightclub,

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,820
which actually is named after part of his rant.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Uh, he opened that show there, the Devival of the Mongoloidapalooza, after being introduced,

47
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,380
as we hear now, by Dr. Hal.

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,340
Dr. Hal.

49
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,800
Some geniuses, humanoid and otherwise.

50
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,740
Welcome to this historic occasion.

51
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,800
The Church of the Subgenius will proudly feature Mongoloid.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,220
And the first set will be Mongo Lounge.

53
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,900
But first, to inaugurate the festivities, the man whose words, after which 12 galaxies

54
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,300
is our name.

55
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,920
As you can see by the sign outside.

56
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,520
And the sign inside, held by Mr. Frank Chew.

57
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,320
Woo!

58
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:45,140
Well, uh, CBS Evening News, I met John Blackstone and, uh, Tom Brokaw that I met from NBC 90 News.

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,520
And the San Jose Mercury News, I was published by them.

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,340
So I was filmed of, uh, those populations at 12 Galaxies that were guilty with Bill

61
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,960
Clinton's.

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,720
And it was concerning myself.

63
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,940
It's that TV star.

64
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,120
That's the guy.

65
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,120


66
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,760
That movie star.

67
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,400
And it was also about those other rocket societies and the flying saucers and the space vacations.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,680
They were across in outer space and, uh, the Pentagon and NASA keeping it all top secret.

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,160
And those other populations were across those other galaxies and they were also top secret,

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,500
too.

71
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,580
So, uh, 2009, I think I'll get improvement in Washington, D.C., too.

72
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,440
Thank you.

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,500
Yeah!

74
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,020
Woo!

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,740
Thank you.

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,020
Thank you.

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,100


78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,100


79
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,780
19 Season's Scripture

80
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,420
So that's...

81
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,480
So, uh, that's not the beginning of compilation.

82
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,840
That's not the end of compilation.

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,400
The later.

84
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,780
The first part on the Ivy list.

85
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,780
Back to the Intro and the Part One.

86
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:36,780


87
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:36,780


88
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,660
hops on here.

89
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,520
Oh, no, we'll get a dopestack as soon as that's out.

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,680
We're printing into the radio.

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:42,840
And the big question here is kind of underwhelming right now.

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,140
I don't know.

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,480
Coming up!

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,060
So we've discussed the Onnit, uh, Se lyrics, and Tron, Celebration.

95
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,400
We're also showing the series team where there commitment, number three, Con Hanslund,

96
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,960
and the movie crew...

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:54,960


98
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,120
All right.

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,120


100
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,700
coming into the studio,

101
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,560
and Hal is going to introduce

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,520
a fabulous guest that we have here tonight.

103
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,820
Thank you, John Hill.

104
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,720
Yes, it is fabulous.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,640
An incredible short space of time

106
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,360
has witnessed the burgeoning and efflorescence

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,300
of many different devivals in different lands.

108
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,540
Lastly, here in San Francisco

109
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,540
on the Twelve Galaxies stage.

110
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,440
And then, as now,

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,140
it was my deep and profound pleasure

112
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,600
to introduce Reverend Ivan Stang,

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,580
the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,600
Why, there he is now,

115
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,180
delivering the sacred subgenius salute.

116
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,180
Thank you, Dr. Hal.

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,740
Man, what an inspiring evening that was.

118
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,000
It was so devolving.

119
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,400
It was devolutional, certainly.

120
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,540
And devotional.

121
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,120
Actually, you know, the term devolutional

122
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,480
is a misnomer because people don't really get devived.

123
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,280
They get revived.

124
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,660
It is a revival.

125
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,980
It just sounds cute to call it a devolvial.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,960
Well, they have a life.

127
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,620
But the fact that it was also

128
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,040
like a devotional to the band Devo

129
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,920
in that respect,

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,940
then the devolvial thing certainly fits.

131
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,240
I suppose you call it a devolval or devolval.

132
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,920
Well, that would be...

133
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
It's not like a volvo.

134
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,340
It's a specific, I think.

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,860
A vulva?

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,700
A vulva.

137
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,880
That's what we do in Africa.

138
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,620
A devolva.

139
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,120
They would come in out of the cold for that one.

140
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,600
But most people have a life.

141
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,260
It is a mistaken life on the treadmill of the conspiracy

142
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,960
and a devival takes them out of that life

143
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,280
and into a mongoloid or subgenius life.

144
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
How do you feel about that?

145
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,220
Does that feel okay?

146
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm kind of hurting just thinking about it personally.

147
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,580
But the microphone-age or the concept...

148
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,100
The concept.

149
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,880
It might be heartburn.

150
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,780
Sticking to the wall.

151
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,400
I don't know.

152
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,480
Well, John,

153
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,540
Hal is used to the style that I bring to the airwaves

154
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,240
since he and I have been the color commentators

155
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,520
at the Power Tool drag races numerous times.

156
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,660
There should be no surprise.

157
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,340
And how I've played the sort of Joan Rivers to Chicken John

158
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,700
at the Ask Dr. Hal show over the years.

159
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,920
That sounds terrifying.

160
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,860
And it is.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,440
Well, we also have mongoloid, Lloyd Mongoloid,

162
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,880
as John Hal just said,

163
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,080
and this is a historic occasion.

164
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,320
He is here to report on the afterglow

165
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,100
of Saturday night's incredibly successful show.

166
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,640
That's right.

167
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,220
How'd it go?

168
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,980
I don't remember.

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,560
Well, there was a lot of wang-bang-a-langing

170
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,540
and speech-a-fying and sound effects.

171
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,320
My wang didn't get banged.

172
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,820
There's some ding-dang doodles going on.

173
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,320
You know, if you can remember it,

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,580
it means you were ripped off.

175
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,360
I'll buy that for a dollar.

176
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,180
You were cheated if you can remember it.

177
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,560
But if you can't,

178
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,640
then you know you must have had a great time.

179
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,320
No one was ripped off.

180
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,400
Everyone was satisfied.

181
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,780
No one remembers anything.

182
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,460
I woke up.

183
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,580
I woke up wearing somebody else's clothes,

184
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,500
so it must have been okay.

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
Is that my underwear?

186
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,640
Those must have been hard to get on.

187
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll take it off my head later.

188
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,440
Not your size.

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,640
I woke up hurting all over

190
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,660
because I danced my fool head off.

191
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,260
Did they write things on your body again this time?

192
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,020
It makes me...

193
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,660
When I hear them Devo tunes,

194
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,100
I get all...

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,920
I feel like I'm young again and spry.

196
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,820
Man, notorious.

197
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,500
I get hopping around like a kid

198
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,520
in a punk rock festival or something.

199
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Famous cyberpunk writer John Shirley

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,980
was also flinging himself about

201
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,240
down on the dance floor

202
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,420
as he was enraptured by the Mongo Lounge tunes

203
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,860
and all the tunes that followed.

204
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,640
We're lucky that there weren't heart attacks

205
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,340
among all the old-timers there.

206
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,480
Haven't been that juiced up

207
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,320
since the last time they saw the real Devo's.

208
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,580
I heard somebody in the crowd say that

209
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,100
as they walked in the room,

210
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,520
they could feel an entire culture

211
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,960
coming down upon them.

212
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,700
Well, it smelled funny, too.

213
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,180
Now we're all bored

214
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,220
Cause we're gonna

215
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,860
Go down

216
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm making sales

217
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
And I'm on the grid

218
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,980
I got a bag of junk to sweep

219
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,480
Sweep it up

220
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,680
Sweep it up

221
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,240
Sweep it back in

222
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,200
I am poor

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,660
And I don't remember

224
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
So let's let it slip

225
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,100
A little bit

226
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,060
Sweep it up

227
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,060
You never be here

228
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,900
You're pretty excited

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,300
Cause we're gonna

230
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,180
We are gonna

231
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,660
We're gonna

232
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,800
Go down

233
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,380
So it's really a Mongoloid show with

234
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,340
With Lloyd Mongoloid and the boys

235
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,680
and me, your Thanks, Mark.

236
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:52,680


237
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:52,680


238
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,940
Dr. Howland Owl.

239
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,540
You'll definitely see puzzling evidence there.

240
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,600
He'll be videoing up a storm.

241
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,560
And, of course, Reverend Dr. Supreme Commander Ivan Stang,

242
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,040
his exalted holiness, and a right nice guy.

243
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,160
But Princess We Are Doe, unfortunately, will not be able to attend festivity.

244
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,280
She is in the midst of other matters.

245
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,780
In her celestial city.

246
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,180
And can't come this time.

247
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,440
Where did, uh, I blew up the little doll of Ivan Stang and the little cute one here,

248
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
where'd they go?

249
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,960
We spoke of them.

250
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,820
They're floating around the station?

251
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,540
Beyond.

252
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,660
They're probably, they're pounding on the front door from at the last minute.

253
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,460
The Nuosphere.

254
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,740
Oh, all right, well, that's not really that important.

255
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,180
Oh, my gosh.

256
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,020
The Gary Brokham will not be able to attend either.

257
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,120
No, I'm very sorry.

258
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,540
He's running for a political office in another county.

259
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,400
He's going to be supervisor.

260
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,540
Of Stanafruz County.

261
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,900
Anti-freeze platform.

262
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,540
The reductive theocrats.

263
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm going to let the Mormon come out of me this year, I think, in public office.

264
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,220
As significant in its way as the Mitt Romney Mormonism speech.

265
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes, but I'm going to melt Romney.

266
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,600
How is that?

267
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,900
Well, I'm going to hold a match under him.

268
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,660
They say he has an icy heart.

269
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,960
Exhale.

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,480
Okay.

271
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,040
He has an icy heart.

272
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,140
He said he didn't inhale.

273
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,400
Well, I didn't.

274
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:21,780
Exhale.

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,120
And I don't have four wives either.

276
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,860
I used to be hail and hearty.

277
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,000
You could say I'm exhale.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Anybody know about any more screenings of this thing?

279
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,260
No, I don't know.

280
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,040
Well, oh.

281
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,180
Well, I've heard there will be.

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,100
There was one at the Grand Lake and I missed it.

283
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,740
I forgot it.

284
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,800
Oh, we believe it.

285
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,040
I hardly believe it now.

286
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,740
Dangishness.

287
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,360
Run!

288
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,400
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, his exalted excellency.

289
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,380
In the past of honor, file a drum of advice.

290
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,320
Reverend Dr. Commander Ivan Stang, one of the saintliest men ever.

291
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,520
What?

292
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,520


293
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,520


294
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,060
He's the greatest man on earth.

295
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,780
He's the greatest man on earth.

296
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,280
Cleveland, city of light, city of man.

297
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,700
Look at that cute little ponytail.

298
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,640
He's documenting everything with assiduous thoroughness.

299
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:10,000
The flickering flashing of the stroboscopic brightness of flash cubes is throwing everything

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,220
in the studio into dreadful relief as a thousand cameras pop off as the paparazzi convulse in

301
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,260
an orgasm of overkill.

302
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,240
Self-fuck, yes.

303
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,840
Self-fuck.

304
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,520
So, ladies and gentlemen.

305
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm temporarily at a loss.

306
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,140
I don't know how to deal with this incredible incursion, but fairly soon, through the miracle

307
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,060
of radio hookup, they're going to get weird up.

308
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,080
And soon, you'll actually hear their voices and not just me talking about them.

309
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,760
I see Reverend Dr. Stang has brought the swag bag containing $40 million in...

310
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:44,840
Oh!

311
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,660
$40 million in prunes!

312
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,440
Yes, but they're very special prunes.

313
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,500
Yes, prunes.

314
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,040
They're not ordinary prunes.

315
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,580
Oh, my gosh.

316
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,920
You're an old man now, Stang.

317
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,880
This is the greatest medicine there's ever been.

318
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
You should see what Philo does.

319
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,340
And Dr. Philo Drummond.

320
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,400
I never thought I saw the day...

321
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,280
Agent of the 34th degree.

322
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,020
He also is here in the studio.

323
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,720
So, this is truly a turbo-philosophorum.

324
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,400
And if you believe that, I've got a radio show to tell you.

325
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,520
A convocation of subgenius savants.

326
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,180
What'd you pay for that glass?

327
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,000
That's a liquid scam.

328
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,820
They're darkening our towels.

329
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,100
They really are.

330
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,320
Darkening my bowels?

331
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,320
Hungry people from hell.

332
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,200
I would gladly give up my station.

333
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh, well.

334
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,580
Yeah!

335
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,140
You're going to go around one!

336
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,200
You gotta switch that person!

337
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,400
You gotta grab that gun go!

338
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,020
You gotta get there first!

339
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,060
George favored in themiyor.

340
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,060


341
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,980
I think I heard that word pop that we used to hear.

342
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,440
Bymyrka.

343
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,020
Sure thing.

344
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,620
And you wanna know what he's done here?

345
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:15,620


346
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,380
I want to be West Versus King.

347
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,500


348
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,500


349
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,500
But also Wouldn'tId just be Isla?

350
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,180
First, have you ever noticed that,

351
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,160
the original game was именно based upon the app's game

352
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:31,720
fucking brains out on what we wanted to be working on. The concept of work has gotten a bad name

353
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,240
because it's not work, it's slavery. Most people don't like what they're doing. They're just trying

354
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:44,380
to pay the rent. You know, praise Bob if you can even do that nowadays. But no, we're not going to

355
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,380
tell you what slack is because that's for you to figure it out. All we're doing is giving you a

356
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,960
pep talk. That's all any goddamn religion is. It's a pep talk to remind you that that one time

357
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,780
that you were doing that thing, that hobby or that whatever it is that you like to do. Maybe it was

358
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,000
jacking off or even fucking someone. Maybe it was doing a crossword puzzle. Maybe it was launching

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,420
the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer. But whatever it was, suddenly you found yourself sort of in the

360
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,940
zone. Your mind was clear. You were concentrating on what you were doing and you were having a great

361
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,360
fucking time. Hold on to that.

362
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:27,140
That thought, because that's where the slack is. Because you actually, despite what appearances, you actually are

363
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:39,480
smart enough to make your own slack. And well, we can sell you plenty of false slack starting at that sales

364
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:48,460
table back there with those t-shirts, DVDs and CDs, which you can memorize like I have and then forget

365
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,360
them like I have.

366
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:59,820
Stir up your pure minds. Where is lust? The Lord is slack. Looking for? The Lord is slack. I want to speak to you this morning on

367
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:10,860
Dog is slack. Today, dog is slack. Slack but is long. Now let me just simply say and say very quickly and emphatically.

368
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:19,300
Pleasure. Pleasure. Dog is slack slack and coming again. Understand that dog is slack. Dog is slack slack.

369
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,140

Dog is slack word.

Dog is slack.

384
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,680
Slack.

385
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,440
I want you to take this word today, and I want you to place it against your own heart.

386
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I have the right to develop a point because I'm a creature, and I can do what I want.

387
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,960
Here's one in which he's slack.

388
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,220
Here's another one.

389
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

390
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,500
Yes!

391
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,620
Let it be so.

392
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,560
Slack.

393
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,080
The Lord perhaps can be slack.

394
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,660
Dog is slack.

395
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,120
Oh, see how good this fruit looks?

396
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,920
Dog is slack.

397
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,900
Dog is slack.

398
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,360
So?

399
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,740
Dog is slack.

400
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,020
Dog is slack.

401
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:18,980
Dog.

402
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,840
Is slack.

403
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,340
Is slack.

404
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,880
Is slack.

405
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,200
Is slack.

406
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,380
Is slack.

407
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,740
Is slack.

408
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,140
So what's this one about?

409
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,040
An analysis of teeth marks on pipe stems.

410
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,320
Dear me.

411
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,520
Fortunately, though, I've had news of him lately through my underworld grapevine.

412
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,880
He is reputed to have some connections with a new cult that calls themselves the Soul Genius.

413
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,740
Our house.

414
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,740
Splendid.

415
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,020
What on earth does that mean?

416
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,220
Oh, some newfangled cult.

417
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,700
Heathens, most likely.

418
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,100
By George, yes.

419
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Well, it was quite a social event.

420
00:18:51,960 --> 00:19:00,880
Many people came, and I guess you may have seen that Laughing Squid has posted some videos on its site, including Stang's complete oration.

421
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,360
Really?

422
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,500
Yes, and then the assiduous...

423
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,220
I hope it was okay.

424
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,620
...bug girl put up, like, a few seconds of me.

425
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,840
Actually, I think Laughing Squid put up a rather truncated version of your speech.

426
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,360
But it looks like John Hell's digital digits are uncovering that right now.

427
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,240
So you might be able to get a preview.

428
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,840
You know, the scary thing about the Internet is every dumb thing you ever did is still out there preserved.

429
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,040
Tell me about it.

430
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,180
Like a fossilized portrait of drunkenness.

431
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,760
Yes.

432
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,940
I started posting stuff to the Internet in the 90s, and it took me a couple of years to learn the lesson.

433
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
Never, ever, ever post after drinking a bunch of wine.

434
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,980
And with that...

435
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,580
And with that...

436
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,320
Let's see how you...

437
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
It sounded after a little bit of wine.

438
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,040
Well, now, I stayed...

439
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,600
What?

440
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,040
Hold on, it's coming.

441
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,920
Here it comes.

442
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,420
You were on.

443
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,960
Straight from Laughing Squid.

444
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,700
For those of you who are not familiar with the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs, I don't want to preach to the same.

445
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,700
I love you, J.R.!

446
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,780
I will briefly explain everything you need to know.

447
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,760
There's only three things you need to know.

448
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,480
Bob.

449
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,480
Slack.

450
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,300
And...

451
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,980
The conspiracy!

452
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,900
The basics.

453
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,980
I get all upset when you mention the conspiracy.

454
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,000
I was fed on that growing up.

455
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,160
Yes, friends!

456
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,920
This man, J.R. Bob Dobbs...

457
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,380
Why is the Devo Lounge music on behind me?

458
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,540
It's supposed to be the theme from Abominable Snowman.

459
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,960
Well, we can't control every iota of the tech on stage and happening events.

460
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,900
...monster that has...

461
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,900
Uh...

462
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,980
...pretending to be God to many Earth cultures for thousands of years.

463
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,780
How's that war on God coming along?

464
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,540
...to beat Bob up and said to him,

465
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,120
Bob!

466
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,000
It's an ambitious project, isn't it?

467
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,120
One step at a time.

468
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,860
...normal people robbing away the slack of the abnormals.

469
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:16,000
And I command you, Bob, to found a church not based on a rock but on the shifting sandy beach of hypocrisy!

470
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,300
I've heard all this before.

471
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,160
How's the ratio with slack?

472
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,540
Back to sandy hypocrisy going.

473
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,100
Hypocrisy!

474
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,660
Where will any religion be like a...

475
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,420
Well, they go hand in hand if you're running a church.

476
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:25,960
...a...

477
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,420
...the song genius, our old...

478
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,660
...Squatchy!

479
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,660
Big, big, big, big...

480
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,380
Well, he was a pretty good sight.

481
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,860
How big was he?

482
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,420
Well, I took to...brought him home and...cleaned him and kneaded him.

483
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,580
Did you measure him?

484
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,280
Yeah, two inches long.

485
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,400
I was drunk.

486
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,840
I showed him all over the county. I reckon I did. I think I did.

487
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,080
A little bitty...a little bitty...but, uh...

488
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,720
...choked that head about three or four times. He just turned over on his side and just blow ball, blow ball, blow ball.

489
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,020
Yeah.

490
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,400
Well, stretching out. Straightened out, you know, sit. Stretching out.

491
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,240
When I jerked him, I thinks I'm hung. Didn't go nowhere when I jerked.

492
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,100
Well, didn't think nothing about it. I mean, good.

493
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,880
How often did you have him?

494
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,920
Three messes.

495
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,700
Well...

496
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,780
Oh...

497
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,220
I cannot hear anything.

498
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,420
Gentlemen, gentlemen, start your oysters.

499
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,280
First off...

500
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,060
We were too loud.

501
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,160
Now we're too soft.

502
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,820
Okay, you know what?

503
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,380
I listen to another show.

504
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,860
Yeah?

505
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,900
Bad girl.

506
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,760
It's worse than the other show.

507
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
It's more on KTFA.

508
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,180
94.1 FM.

509
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,060
It's called This is Hell.

510
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,660
And they have a chat.

511
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,340
You can chat with them while the show's going on.

512
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,560
Yes, hell is a chat room.

513
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,540
Listener participation, you know?

514
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
We don't allow that.

515
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,900
No, we don't like it.

516
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,240
What we do is we just spy on you while you're listening.

517
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,080
Yeah, we can see you right now.

518
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,080
That's all we've got.

519
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,940
How do you like it?

520
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,820
Hey, I just heard her click.

521
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,460
She just hung up on us.

522
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,780
She did.

523
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,460
Well, part of another click, you know?

524
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,220
There are so many of them out there.

525
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,540
We are going to be watching her very closely from now on.

526
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,920
She said we were childish.

527
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,780
The Department of Surveillance and Homeland Security.

528
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,760
It takes one to know one, Ivan.

529
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,140
It takes one to know one.

530
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,000
I have to listen to the...

531
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
It wouldn't be the music.

532
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,640
Maybe she meant childlike.

533
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,800
Childlike.

534
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,600
Oh, right, yeah.

535
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,320
Oh, yes.

536
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,800
It is childish.

537
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,640
Childlike.

538
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,560
It is childish.

539
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,100
Or maybe she meant youthful.

540
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,040
That's probably it.

541
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,080
Youthful.

542
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,040
Youthful and childlike.

543
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,800
It's like a...

544
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,500
That's what I was saying.

545
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,640
The show is like a playground all the time.

546
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,400
When I went over to your house last night or today, Dr. Drummond,

547
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,200
the only one that would talk to me was your tiny little daughter.

548
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
My child.

549
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,440
Yeah.

550
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,420
The two-year-old who doesn't really even talk yet.

551
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,460
Out of the mouth.

552
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,340
You couldn't...

553
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:30,280
Dr. Drummond and Mrs. Drummond had their brains locked on the TV.

554
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,580
And there was no one for me to talk to.

555
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:32,740
Scandalous.

556
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:32,800
Yeah.

557
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,480
Scandalous.

558
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,880
We forced him to watch television programs.

559
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,500
And she read Dr. Seuss books to me.

560
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,740
Is this how a subgenius acts?

561
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,340
And that's good because she's only like 17 months.

562
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,140
Wow.

563
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,980
She couldn't talk, but she read Dr. Seuss books.

564
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,900
But she never threatens.

565
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
She never wheedles.

566
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,860
She never whines.

567
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,340
She can't.

568
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,580
She actually can talk.

569
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,000
It's just kind of part of that.

570
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,540
She never sounds desperate.

571
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,500
I noticed she didn't wheedle nor whine.

572
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,560
She never whine.

573
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,000
I came out here on the HMS Bob Dobbs.

574
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,160
What are those guys talking about?

575
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,160
This is great.

576
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,920
The salt spray in my face.

577
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,380
And the waves at 35.

578
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,060
Oh.

579
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,120
Did you see them spray in that guy's face?

580
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,600
Hey, they forgot to take down the ground.

581
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:09,880
Say it.

582
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,820
Don't spray it.

583
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,260
Look at those iguanas mating on those rocks.

584
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,040
Iguana.

585
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,920
Is Michael Pepp in there?

586
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:16,920


587
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:16,960
Iguana.

588
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,120
Iguana.

589
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,360


590
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,480
Iguana.

591
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,480


592
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,480


593
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,480


594
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,480


595
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,480


596
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,680
Iguana.

597
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:18,680


598
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:18,680


599
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:18,680


600
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,580
Those dodos.

601
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,160
The herds of dodos running across the plain.

602
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,720
Look at those presidential candidates mating on the White House lawn.

603
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,520
God's country.

604
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,500
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.

605
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,420
And a cup of coffee and a cigarette.

606
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,460
And a donut and a hard-boiled egg.

607
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,480
And loose shoes.

608
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,260
And a pint of milk.

609
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,560
And a warm place to defecate.

610
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,800
At DEF CON 4.

611
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,600
In this big world under the big open sky.

612
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,180
or in the forest

613
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,900
where the Pope and the Bears

614
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,420
and the little things.

615
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,320
Parking lot?

616
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,280
Yeah, they fill the parking lot with about four feet of water.

617
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,840
Parking lot, a motion picture.

618
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,600
Stage one, I mean, I'm sorry, it's like stage five or something.

619
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,820
It has the side of the wall where they drop a site.

620
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,500
Just when you thought it was safe to drive back in.

621
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,280
The cloudy day site or the stormy site

622
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,360
or the beautiful day site.

623
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,000
And then they have little model ships go across parking lot one

624
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,160
at Raleigh Studios.

625
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,320
And you get Raleigh cigarettes.

626
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,880
For movies like this, anyway.

627
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,040
Yes, it all happens,

628
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,880
but you've got to be there at the right place

629
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,700
at the right time.

630
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,900
If you can't surf the luck plane,

631
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,560
well, mister, it's just not for you.

632
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,880
You know, I turned up four years ago

633
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,360
to be an extra in this movie,

634
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,840
Chameleon, and they still haven't

635
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,680
given me lunch.

636
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,920
We'd give you lunch.

637
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,180
We had great craft services for that movie.

638
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,420
In fact, uh,

639
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,480
too much.

640
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,980
I waited and waited all night long

641
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,740
for them to call my name

642
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,860
and I thought I would,

643
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,460
be a monster.

644
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,160
But no.

645
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,180
We still have a lot of rehashing

646
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,340
of the Mongoloid

647
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,440
Mongoloid concert

648
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,540
to do before we put that topic

649
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:09,840
to rest.

650
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,680
And now we have K-Rob.

651
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,440
We're going to be here until midnight.

652
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,120
Yes, we are.

653
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,540
We have plenty of time

654
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,220
to get the details all hammered out.

655
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,500
And if you haven't guessed so far,

656
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,320
we have a cavalcade of crazy critters

657
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,760
here in the studio on a season in hell

658
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,280
with John Hell.

659
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,420
Dr. Hal is in the studio.

660
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,820
K-Rob has just shown up

661
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
to mix some fabulous sounds

662
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,280
in his own K-Rob style way.

663
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,060
Lloyd Mongoloid in the studio

664
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,380
puzzling evidence on his way back.

665
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,700
And Reverend Ivan Stang,

666
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,240
founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

667
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,600
following J.R. Bob Dobbs' doctrine.

668
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,460
Sweet.

669
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:44,780
No.

670
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,440
Ouch.

671
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,160
It's important that...

672
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,620
No, I'm not the founder.

673
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs founded the Church of the Subgenius.

674
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,060
Dr. Philo Drummond and I

675
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,580
were the first two clerks,

676
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,360
you might say.

677
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,620
Philo's a personal friend of Bob's.

678
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,740
I'd never get to go to those...

679
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,680
Philo made the primordial alignment with Dobbs.

680
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,000
Right.

681
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,960
There was no organized church

682
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,620
before Philo.

683
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,940
He has to babysit tonight.

684
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,400
Yes.

685
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,820
Well, he has a young subgenius

686
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,960
coming up.

687
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,040
The rising generation.

688
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,760
Bob's taking...

689
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,360
There he is now.

690
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,740
He's the biggest man in the world.

691
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,540
He's...

692
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:35,480
Well, this is the part where Jehovah One

693
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,520
has to fight the unforgiving minions.

694
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,700
Yes, the Yakatisma.

695
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,940
The creatures from beyond the stars.

696
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,680
The gateway to the doorway to doom.

697
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,520
And, friends, you can avoid these traps of the spirit.

698
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,380
You can avoid getting too sucked into

699
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,320
material things or spiritual things.

700
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,680
The trick is to avoid slack abuse

701
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,200
or false slack.

702
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,660
The conspiracy's gonna have you thinking

703
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,660
that the only way you can really relax

704
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,280
is to take a $10,000 ski trip

705
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,140
or buy as many video decks.

706
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,380
You should buy as many video decks as you can.

707
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,420
Well, those things are fun

708
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,760
and certainly we'll use them

709
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,640
to overthrow the conspiracy if we can.

710
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,680
But in the meantime,

711
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,140
if I were you,

712
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,080
I wouldn't worry about how you're spending your money

713
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,840
but how you're spending your time.

714
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Are you getting slack on the job?

715
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,580
I think not.

716
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,780
I think many people out there

717
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,860
are sorely wanting.

718
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
They feel a need deep in their souls.

719
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,520
So, call in.

720
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,360
Call in.

721
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,000
Make a pledge.

722
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:45,820
.

723
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,880
Well, the final day of the convention

724
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,760
was Sunday, November 22nd.

725
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,200
The 18th anniversary of the assassination

726
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,960
of John F. Goodbrother.

727
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This was hardly coincidence

728
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,440
that it rapidly became

729
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,620
on the Dallas Daily Plaza

730
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,680
for the final rites.

731
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,360
As to escape and escape from it,

732
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,360


733
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,560
Assassinologists popped in and out of manholes where additional hitmen supposedly hid and took acid on that fatal day long ago.

734
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,000
So when we talk about the computer, we're talking about everything from the mass to finally march past the assassin's site.

735
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,580
Well, David Rockefeller and his men used to...

736
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,700
The Nazi mob is the most...

737
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,800
So?

738
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:35,840
Yes.

739
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Uh, yes?

740
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,020
What?

741
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,680
Oh, hi.

742
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,240
Do you...

743
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,300
Are you taking that stuff often?

744
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:51,580
Ah.

745
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,800
Yeah, it makes me remember back.

746
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,020
I was still so...

747
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes, it's true.

748
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:04,080
Oh, and our ten-minute segment on Bob was scheduled for sometime in February on Showtime.

749
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,540
An HBO competitor in What's Up America.

750
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,620
Subgenius Dark from Madness will infiltrate an estimated five to eight million living rooms.

751
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,340
This summer.

752
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,320
We'll be able to...

753
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,980
I just think you'll know about it.

754
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,900
I'm just listening to this tape right now.

755
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,520
No, I'm not.

756
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,920
Carl, the goals...

757
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,520
Final answer.

758
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,140
The best of the best.

759
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,000
False prophets.

760
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,840
False prophets.

761
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,200
The conspirators.

762
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,380
The media creeps.

763
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,660
The stupid people and the malignants who beat down our mouths.

764
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,020
The abusive territorial urges.

765
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,720
Without ever dreaming that they were doing it.

766
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,340
The ones who have tried to...

767
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,380
They are the ones who have been the ones who have been the ones who have been the ones to remain our self-respect,

768
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,460
down through the centuries, by making slack and anti-predictability taboo in human culture.

769
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,540
They are the offensive ones.

770
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,180
And they brought this Buck Rogers monstrosity of microchips and inflation.

771
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,520
Nothing making sense anymore and everything costing too much.

772
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,960
The weather is weird, and why did they do it?

773
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,140
Don't they know they're begging for the flaming sword of retribution?

774
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,500
The space monsters aren't about to let us get away with this masturbatory industrialization much longer.

775
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,940
They watch our TV shows.

776
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,440
They know all about us.

777
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,700
They can snuff us out already with all...

778
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,140
It's all right.

779
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,060
All right.

780
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:30,260
And you can buy many tapes of former radio shows that we have done around the country with different doctors.

781
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,020
It's pop-up in time.

782
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,260
That's right.

783
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,260
These tapes are available for sale.

784
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,620
They're only $8 and 90 minutes long.

785
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,400
That's right, 90 minutes from the Church of the Subgenius.

786
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,620
And that address is?

787
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:54,880
That address is Church of the Subgenius, P.O. Box, 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

788
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,180
And this planet will be sold down the river just as sure as Lee Harvey Oswald's clone.

789
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,960
What's that address?

790
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,940
That address is?

791
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,580
That address is.

792
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,240
P.O. Box.

793
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,700
P.O. Box.

794
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:15,420
1-8-1-4-1-7, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118, www.subgenius.com.

795
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,060
Or you can tear tin cans open with your P.O. 6.

796
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,540
If the last of your fingers itching is not well pleased...

797
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,540
We must understand that Dallas is quite far away from California.

798
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,800
The thinking is different here.

799
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,740
You're wonderful to hear you in this part of the country thinking and calling.

800
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,520
But it's not.

801
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,520


802
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,520


803
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,140
We've had some...

804
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,560
The river shall shake.

805
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,840
The sky shall fall.

806
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,980
The space jump.

807
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,700
Pornators.

808
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,880
Hail the size of Cadillac.

809
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
Is there a call coming in?

810
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,560
Do we have a call in here?

811
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,680
Is this an actual contact?

812
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,680
Let me check on the computer.

813
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:44,960
Let me check on the computer.

814
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,160
Let me check on the computer.

815
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,200
Yes.

816
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,640
Yes.

817
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,000
Yes.

818
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,280
Yes.

819
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes.

820
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,260
Okay.

821
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:47,880
Is Bob there?

822
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,140
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

823
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,240
Is Bob there?

824
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,240


825
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,440
No, he's not, but we are.

826
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,900
No.

827
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,220
No.

828
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,500
No.

829
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,300
As I say, Bob appeared to me this evening.

830
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,120
Did he really?

831
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:55,320
Yes.

832
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,120
Yes.

833
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,840
Was it over the station or was that a different one than...

834
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,360
He has a gland on the radio.

835
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:00,740
No.

836
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,040
It wasn't over the station.

837
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,240
Would you...

838
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,080
Could you...

839
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Sir, you were actually touched by Bob?

840
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,240
I'm touched by Bob.

841
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,160
Bob saved my life.

842
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,400
Bob.

843
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,640
Bob.

844
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,180
What happened?

845
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


846
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,360
What happened?

847
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,240
Um, I was about to be apprehended by the Oakland PD.

848
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,440
Uh-huh.

849
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,080
And Bob appeared over the horizon and guided my auto off.

850
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,420
And you...

851
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,220
You made an escape.

852
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,840
A miracle, friends.

853
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:29,280
A miracle in Oakland tonight through the radio power of Bob Dobbs.

854
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,920
And you've heard this living testimonial here on the telephone.

855
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,440
Hello, sir.

856
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,520
Yes, yes.

857
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,280
The Oakland PD was just going to nail me.

858
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,200
Well, what was your alleged crime, sir?

859
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,620
DUI.

860
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,680
Pardon me?

861
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,440
DUI.

862
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,100
Could you spell that out for those of the listening audience who don't understand?

863
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,020
DUI.

864
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
I don't know what DUI is.

865
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,420
No, there are some who don't hear.

866
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,700
I do.

867
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,260
Driving under intoxication.

868
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,080
I've actually seen this happening myself.

869
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,560
Oh, trance driving is what it's known as in the church.

870
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,140
Yes, trance driving.

871
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
This is something...

872
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,940
It's an opportunity in my moment of need.

873
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,920
Yes, he did.

874
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,580
Did he do it...

875
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,800
Was your radio on?

876
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,300
Were you able to put hands on radio?

877
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,560
It was definitely hands on radio.

878
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,160
Okay.

879
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,760
That's probably how you guided your car to safety.

880
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,980
We have all been...

881
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,680
It was late at night.

882
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,800
I mean, we...

883
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,780
You know, I had the power.

884
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,920
Bob operates on the...

885
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,160
Oh, friends, put Bob in the driver's seat.

886
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,280
Well, I sure did.

887
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,240
And Bob took me...

888
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,340
Bob jams police radars with a single...

889
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,560
No, Bob just got me out of a tough situation.

890
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,600
And I'm here to tell anybody who's awake at this particular hour of the morning.

891
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,940
So...

892
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,700
To send money to these guys.

893
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,720
Yeah, definitely.

894
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,740
To everybody.

895
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,140
I think everybody should just send some money to everybody they know right now.

896
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,180
Immediately, even if they don't need it.

897
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,980
Just get out of bed.

898
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,260
Or wake up and get out of bed.

899
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,120
But I did see Bob.

900
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,280
And there he was with his pipe.

901
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,280
Well, sir, you are indeed blessed.

902
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,140
It is only the lucky few who actually...

903
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,020
The miracle that Bob has moved through this...

904
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,200
This man.

905
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,440
Bob has moved through the very bowels of this city.

906
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,100
The United States.

907
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,820
Bob definitely works in strange ways.

908
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,260
And fortuitous ones.

909
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,260
Yes, Bob specializes in strange and mysterious ways.

910
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,220
And it's almost never spelled out.

911
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,240
And as a matter of fact, the reason it's not spelled out is to...

912
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,440
To keep the unattuned...

913
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,100
The unsaved out.

914
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,400
There's sort of a built-in alienation factor.

915
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,660
From PR News in Washington.

916
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,580
I'm disturbing.

917
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,060
The Justice Department's Inspector General has rocked the region.

918
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,040
More than 20 U.S. attorneys across the country are vacant and empty.

919
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,000
On Wall Street 3, 13th, 8237.

920
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,560
A British court has ruled that this is British PR.

921
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,480
But behind.

922
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,260
Later this hour, congestion and delays.

923
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,160
Morons will address concerns about PR News.

924
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,600
And so, as for the night of mongoloid...

925
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,140
Mongoloid-odious...

926
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,020
That's a new word.

927
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,580
Mongoloid-ious music.

928
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,620
How was the set?

929
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,120
How did the hardcore set go for you?

930
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,420
Oh, that was great.

931
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,120
That was great.

932
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:17,820
We were trying to dig up all the old Devo tunes from back in the embryonic days of Devo.

933
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Early 70s stuff.

934
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,380
And I wasn't sure how it was going to go over.

935
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,200
But we dug up that stuff and replayed it.

936
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,240
And all those Devo nuts went even nuttier.

937
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,560
How many songs were in that set?

938
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,640
We did about, oh, I don't know, eight songs.

939
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,320
Old school Devo.

940
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,580
Stripped down, really weird stuff.

941
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,280
Definitely a different taste from the stuff that's on the album.

942
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,460
That was pretty thorough.

943
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:39,960
Justice devolved.

944
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
It was good to begin with Mongoloid.

945
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,960
I think that put the crowd right in the right mood.

946
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,020
Agreed. Agreed.

947
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,480
And somebody commented to me that they saw the best Kentucky waterfall of the night.

948
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,560
And that belonged to you.

949
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,100
The way your hair was all splayed out.

950
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,900
It was quite wonderful.

951
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
My mullet?

952
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,440
Yeah.

953
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,940
Well, Michael Pepe calls it the Kentucky waterfall.

954
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,000
He should talk.

955
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,780
It's not really a true mullet.

956
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,880
You have to go to a real barber to get a proper mullet.

957
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,560
He's got a pair of Chester A. Arthurs that just won't quit.

958
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,360
It's a future comb-over is what it is.

959
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,200
I'm getting bald.

960
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,880
I'm going to have a lot to work with.

961
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,880
That's all right.

962
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,700
I can take it all the way over the top of my head, down the sides, and then form a little Amish-type beard with it.

963
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,320
And if an oil spill occurs, you can have it cut off and woven into a mat, which will absorb the oil.

964
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,280
Yeah.

965
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:33,960
Yeah.

966
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:42,380
You know, a lot of guys will, throughout their whole life, they'll wear their hair the way they wanted to in high school, but nobody would let them.

967
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,860
And that's the situation with me.

968
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,740
High school has such an effect.

969
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,200
Yeah.

970
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,860
Did you have the crew cut?

971
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,960
What, in high school?

972
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,180
Yeah.

973
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,940
I was at a school where they added a hair dress code.

974
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,540
We had to wear little suits.

975
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,460
They measure your sideburns?

976
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,360
I had to wear a suit and tie at school, and they called me Masta Stag.

977
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,840
It was a private school.

978
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,400
Masta Stag.

979
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,520
There were no girls in this school.

980
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,880
Only buck privates.

981
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,240
That's the kind of thing that can make a feller into a subgenius.

982
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,380
It's very frustrating.

983
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:15,980
Right there.

984
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,940
You already had ideas before you had ideas.

985
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:26,000
You see, you can mourn your lack of slack, but it could cause a rubbery response, a sort of a Newtonian boing in the other direction.

986
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,720
You could be being groomed for subgenius dumb and not even know it.

987
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,620
Well, that was the thing.

988
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,920
There weren't any girls in the school.

989
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,380
I was really frustrated, so I became a cult leader.

990
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,820
And now it's girls, girls, girls.

991
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,460
That's all it takes.

992
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,660
Want girls?

993
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,380
Start a cult.

994
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,180
Bob promised that you could have intercourse.

995
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,700
With a beautiful live girl or anything else.

996
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,600
And that's the important part.

997
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,440
And I was always interested in the anything else part.

998
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,780
And by golly, by gobs, it all came true.

999
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,680
His promise rings true, my friend.

1000
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,940
His promise rung true for me, too.

1001
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,100
True.

1002
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,300
William Shatner as well.

1003
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,040
Bob actually took away my slack for decades.

1004
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,960
But when the rubber band was, it was like a slingshot being pulled back for 20 years.

1005
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,840
That rascal.

1006
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,260
And it finally was released.

1007
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,180
It's been pure slack ever since.

1008
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,160
Now, sooner or later, I'm bound to hit the wall or the glass window of the old mean man across the street,

1009
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,060
which will set off some cosmic tirade of, you kids get off my lawn.

1010
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,040
We'll be X day.

1011
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,500
That's my word.

1012
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,440
When the church, the little stone that is the church of the subgenius goes through the

1013
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,680
plate glass window of the rich old man who is Jehovah.

1014
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,580
Jehovah One, anyway.

1015
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,300
President Grand Rapids Ford.

1016
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:45,940
He died.

1017
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,580
He died.

1018
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,560
Uh, uh, uh, sex life, sex life is still kinda interesting.

1019
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,780
But parted, parted, I, I, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, long time, long time.

1020
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,620
I'll tell you things.

1021
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,740
Sexual addiction.

1022
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,920
Famous dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

1023
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,920
I, I, but uh, but uh, I, I, I, I'm just touch that, touch that, uh, uh, touching, touching,

1024
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,660
the, the, but, but, but, but, really weird guy, really weird guy.

1025
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,720
Sex, sex, dirty sex, sex, dirty sex.

1026
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,760
We, we, we, we.

1027
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,820
We, we get along.

1028
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,800
I was a little too worked up.

1029
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,780
I'm a very troubled man.

1030
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,920
Really weird guy.

1031
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,680
You know what, you know what?

1032
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,040
It's nothing.

1033
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,860
I think it's something.

1034
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,320
It's nothing.

1035
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,140
I think it's something.

1036
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,920
I, I fear.

1037
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,320
I fear.

1038
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,540
I, I, I, I fear.

1039
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:24,940
Leave me alone!

1040
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,740
Leave me alone!

1041
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,300
Come on.

1042
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:26,940
Agh!

1043
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,060
The sons of God and man pale with the sun, but I speak only the truth and never in my

1044
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:39,780
days have I heard the soundtrack of the British film version of Brag of the Subgenius.

1045
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,080
Yeah, we saw that actually.

1046
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,460
It was on the screen.

1047
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:43,800
It was on the screen.

1048
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,000
A company called Bolex Brothers did that.

1049
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,760
They did The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb.

1050
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,640
That's a great film.

1051
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:01,100
You know, that too is a YouTube video which is in close proximity to the videos recorded just the other night at the Mongoloid concert.

1052
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,760
You can see the Bolex Brothers video because in searching out those other YouTube things,

1053
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:15,660
I noticed that over on the right-hand side, there it was, and many other pertinent pieces of video.

1054
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:23,180
If you type in subgenius on YouTube, you'll get quite an array of really awful material.

1055
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,160
That's some real neat stuff.

1056
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,840
Sting, are you doing some video work yourself?

1057
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,240
Oh, yeah. I've always done that.

1058
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,220
That's how I started out.

1059
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,600
I was doing video.

1060
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,680
I did video in the 50s before there was video.

1061
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:44,100
He did film, ladies and gentlemen, with sprockets and photography and projectors and all that stuff.

1062
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,920
Believe it or not.

1063
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,340
Actually, so did I.

1064
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,200
But he actually won awards, and then he went to other countries and made full-length motion pictures.

1065
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,160
Yeah.

1066
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:02,740
He went to Vietnam, and he made a film for them, the Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese, called The Coochie Tunnels.

1067
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,260
Isn't that right?

1068
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,840
Yeah.

1069
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,460
As opposed...

1070
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,240
As differentiated from The Coochie Girls, which was a different...

1071
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,040
Well, they were all around, but then they usually...

1072
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,340
And, folks, this continues.

1073
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:26,040
You could probably purchase copies of the latest subgenius video iterations just from Ivan Stang at subgenius.com.

1074
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:33,800
I saw Bob on night flight when I was eight years old, man, and I believed in you, but you let me down.

1075
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,620
I was a little scared.

1076
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,620
How about...

1077
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,480
Sorry.

1078
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,420
Such things as bug porn and Dobbs and Deliasticles.

1079
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,260
Bob's Lunch Hour is now online.

1080
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:53,640
That was a film that Philo Drummond and Dr. X and I started filming in 1977 and finished filming in 2007.

1081
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,120
30 years in the making.

1082
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:03,700
30 years in the making, starring Dr. Philo Drummond as Bob Dobbs, or a man named Bob Dobbs, although he doesn't...

1083
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,940
He doesn't look anything like Bob.

1084
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,700
And Bob's Lunch Hour, the lunch hour that lasted a thousand years...

1085
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,340
A long lunch hour.

1086
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:12,740
...actually cuts.

1087
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:24,700
There's a wonderful moment when it cuts from the 1977 Philo, who looks like a 70s porno star, to the 2007 Philo, who looks like the mummy.

1088
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,380
That crotchety old thing.

1089
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,500
And, uh...

1090
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,040
He looks like a 60s...

1091
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,780
He looks like a 60s porno star.

1092
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,320
He smells.

1093
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,240
He smells.

1094
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,240


1095
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,480
He smells.

1096
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,080
It's, uh, the longest lunch hour.

1097
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,720
And it's only a ten-minute video.

1098
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,400
Is it filling?

1099
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,780
It hurts longer than ten minutes.

1100
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,940
Is it filling?

1101
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Does he feel good at the end?

1102
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,880
Is it a good lunch hour?

1103
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:58,700
No, he throws himself off the top of a building, dies, and then goes to heaven, only to find that in heaven his problem has been compounded a million-fold.

1104
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,640
It is sad.

1105
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,080
It's an ironic...

1106
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,220
It's an ironic...

1107
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:02,920
It's an ironic story.

1108
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,160
It's an ironic story.

1109
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,220
It's an ironic story.

1110
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,100
That one caller that I thought was in New York was actually in Brooklyn.

1111
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,120
What a mistake.

1112
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,580
Brooklyn is in New York though, right?

1113
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,880
It's a burrow.

1114
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,700
Well, it's a burrow.

1115
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,380
Cute little fella with long ears and a twitchy nose.

1116
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:19,840
That's right.

1117
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,040
Yeehaw!

1118
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,560
Four hoofs.

1119
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,940
It eats all the insects at your home.

1120
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,560
Yeeow!

1121
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,180
Including the ones you like.

1122
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,980
Well, uh, I tried to ask you this while we were yakking, Stang, but, uh, did you see the mist yet?

1123
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,740
I have to know.

1124
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,600
The movie.

1125
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,360
The mist.

1126
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,280
Did you see it?

1127
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,760
Stang.

1128
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,060
Hello.

1129
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,780
Ivan, can you hear?

1130
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,580
Can you hear?

1131
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,340
He's not here.

1132
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,800
Oh, that's why he can't hear.

1133
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,440
He disappeared.

1134
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,080
He went up in a puff of smoke.

1135
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,420


1136
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,720
No, the mist got him.

1137
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,480
That's right.

1138
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,620
The mist got him again.

1139
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,860
Well, they nearly missed him.

1140
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,560
It was a near miss.

1141
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,260
It was a near miss.

1142
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,320
It was a near mist.

1143
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,120
It was a near mist.

1144
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,240
It was a close call.

1145
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,820
It was a near mist.

1146
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,460
But we need closure now.

1147
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,960
You know, the weird thing is that we're not in the middle of the world.

1148
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:01,960


1149
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:01,960


1150
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,440
The weird thing is that there's no, uh, Colonel Sphinx Drummond is not listening.

1151
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,300
Just, you know.

1152
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:06,840
Yeah.

1153
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:07,820
Just.

1154
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,380
Yeah, why?

1155
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,000
Why?

1156
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,580
A lot of people ask, why is Colonel Sphinx Drummond not listening to the show?

1157
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,120
He's watching the laptop.

1158
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,060
He's watching the home mail after me mail.

1159
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,500
People want to know.

1160
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,860
Yeah, what's the deal with that anyway, they say.

1161
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,900
Why is he not?

1162
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,240
It's his job to listen.

1163
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,200
Why is it always the same music?

1164
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,840
Well, out here in the hinterlands, mister, this is the kind of music we like.

1165
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,760
Can't see him.

1166
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:31,960
Can't see him.

1167
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,060
Can't see him.

1168
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,820
He has a lean and hungry look.

1169
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,320
Now that's the show I remember.

1170
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:40,820
Yeah.

1171
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,840
Let's march out of here now.

1172
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,220
Bold, adventurous, big, brawny and beautiful.

1173
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:45,700
Somebody in Stockton is listening.

1174
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,540
A huge, brawling, brawny, quiet.

1175
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:49,980
Army.

1176
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,820
It's an army and they're all running with scissors.

1177
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,360
Oh, I see.

1178
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:53,760
Yeah, yeah.

1179
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,940
Out on Shattuck Avenue, trying to move the show down four blocks to the new studio.

1180
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,660
Yep, the good old days.

1181
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:01,960
Yeah, yeah.

1182
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1183
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1184
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1185
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1186
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1187
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1188
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1189
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1190
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1191
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1192
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1193
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:01,960


1194
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,780
And then on to Tokyo.

1195
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,660
Off to Godfudd for a delicious snack.

1196
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,920
Is that place still in business?

1197
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,960
Yeah, just like the comic book store.

1198
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,240
Gone.

1199
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,500
Run by the same enthusiastic cadre of diehards and hold-ons.

1200
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,600
Yes, a family of moonies who sold pornography for a living.

1201
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,680
Boy, I gotta hand it to you, good beau-fram.

1202
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,340
You know where all the bodies are buried.

1203
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,280
How deep they are.

1204
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,880
Yes, and how they taste.

1205
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,140
I mean, excuse me.

1206
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,520
He spent too much ghoulish time gooming in the graveyard.

1207
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,480
He's gommed.

1208
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,240
He's gomming.

1209
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,360
Ah, he's a gore-blimey gummed them all.

1210
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,220
Ever since his gobsnappers.

1211
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,220
Gummed down on him.

1212
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,980
Ground down.

1213
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,740
Now, did you do any milking?

1214
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,060
Get any butter while you were there?

1215
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:50,460
Ghost butter?

1216
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,240
Hey, could you give me a hand for a gummy ghouls while you were at the market?

1217
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:53,840
I don't know.

1218
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,380
Nay, thank ye.

1219
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,640
Maybe there's something wrong with my telephone.

1220
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,560
Gummy ghosts?

1221
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,600
No, we hear you now.

1222
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,200
We hear you.

1223
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,200
Yes, we hear you.

1224
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,860
Well, I think...

1225
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,460
I'm just going to ask.

1226
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,780
There's a listener in Brooklyn.

1227
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,640
Yeah.

1228
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,020
Maybe...

1229
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,740
Yes.

1230
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,740
If they're really bored and they don't have anything else to do...

1231
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,000
Tired.

1232
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:16,160
They can go to 4608 10th Avenue and throw eggs at the house.

1233
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,200
That's a great idea.

1234
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,740
But in Brooklyn right now, it's a quarter to eight.

1235
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,860
That's a great idea.

1236
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:23,340
This is a lot better than cash.

1237
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,980
An egg store is actually open in 15 minutes.

1238
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,540
So we've got remote egg products.

1239
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,020
Here we go.

1240
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,260
Are you sure you're free?

1241
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,660
It's wise to egg them on that way.

1242
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:31,860
If they were going to 46 10th Avenue...

1243
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:31,860


1244
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:31,860


1245
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:31,860


1246
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,040
Now, what was that address again?

1247
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:33,860
4608.

1248
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,120
4608 10th Avenue.

1249
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,380
What's going on over there?

1250
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,760
Pelt it with eggs right now.

1251
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,800
Google it.

1252
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:39,960
Google it.

1253
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,360
Google it.

1254
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,060
Google it.

1255
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,080


1256
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,160
Make sure it's good and pelt it.

1257
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,840
Would that work, caller?

1258
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:45,720
That's silly.

1259
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,960
You can't do that.

1260
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,980
She's gone again.

1261
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,300
On the northern center of California.

1262
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:49,880
Oh, I see.

1263
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,260
I see.

1264
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,200
She's not here anymore.

1265
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,940
She's left.

1266
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,500
Dang.

1267
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,740
I really like that caller.

1268
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,340
Yeah.

1269
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:54,620
Yeah.

1270
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,220
Really, really like her a lot.

1271
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,760
We like you.

1272
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,180
Call back.

1273
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,640
Or send one of your eggs here.

1274
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,780
And other time.

1275
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,440
Sit on it until it's hatched.

1276
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,800
Speaking of events...

1277
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,420
I can do that.

1278
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,760
Is there something that we're supposed to...

1279
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,300
See, I've been trying to talk about Mon-Loyne...

1280
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,720
Due tomorrow?

1281
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah.

1282
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,400
Yeah, it's breakfast at the Brogue-France house at 830.

1283
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,120
Some of us are just going to watch the show, but some of us are going to be in the show.

1284
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:23,900
It's the big rumpus and wampus at 12 Galaxies, which is near Mission...

1285
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,460
I mean, it's on Mission, actually, but it's near 22nd in San Francisco.

1286
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,540
Isn't that some kind of a hideous matrix?

1287
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:30,620
Yeah.

1288
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:30,620


1289
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,680
Is there a marketing of Devo and Subgenius?

1290
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,960
Even so.

1291
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,300
Something like that.

1292
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,420
That's the advanced publicity.

1293
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:42,200
But many people who are so distracted that they can't even read, but only skim emails,

1294
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,420
think it actually is a Devo concert, and so you can expect the place to be mobbed.

1295
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:47,920
Oh, really?

1296
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,880
I've received inquiries about it.

1297
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,860
All these people will be there hoping to see the Devos.

1298
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,680
Hey, is Mother's Ball going to be at that Devo thing?

1299
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,140
You know.

1300
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,640
Yes.

1301
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,180
Why don't you read the email that I send you instead of spending a second to...

1302
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,520
cast your lazy eye over it before you call me, but...

1303
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,500
I will be gossiping about Mark Mother's Ball on the stage.

1304
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,160
Even John Shirley thought it was a Devo concert from his cursory glimpse at...

1305
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,480
Yeah, their new name is Mongoloid.

1306
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,960
So how is Mark Mother's Ball these days, anyway?

1307
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,620
Actually, I haven't talked to him much.

1308
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,740
Only a mother could love.

1309
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:27,440
At the last devotional in Akron, I had dinner with Jerry Casale, and I asked him if his

1310
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,160
Jihad Jerry thing was getting him much hateful.

1311
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,540
And he said, yes!

1312
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,800
From all angles.

1313
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,660
Oh, bless his heart.

1314
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,780
From the PC and the un-PC alike.

1315
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,580
Bob Dobbs will cut him a lot of slack for that.

1316
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,020
No, Bob actually has taken Devo for everything they were worth.

1317
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:52,620
Devo was originally an experiment by J.R. Bob Dobbs, like the Monkees were another of

1318
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,200
his experimental bands.

1319
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,880
Jimi Hendrix, too, right?

1320
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,700
Well, Hendrix was one that got away from it.

1321
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,880
The guy that opened the door.

1322
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,880
Oh, the Peaking Man.

1323
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,380
And fled to England.

1324
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,900
Heidelberg Man.

1325
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,560
Devo wasn't so lucky.

1326
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,340
Nebraska Man.

1327
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,000
No, Devo fell for Bob Hookline and Sinker.

1328
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,920
And Pilkda.

1329
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,760
You can't hear the show?

1330
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,760
Bob, in the end, he left Bob for everybody in about 16 minutes.

1331
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:17,860
That'll be true.

1332
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:17,860


1333
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,460
Well, that's cruel.

1334
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,860
They all had to get new jobs.

1335
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,720
Better get a replacement DJ in here fast.

1336
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,080
Is this happening to all the columns?

1337
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,240
Can you get the choral show?

1338
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,580
I want to hear the choral show.

1339
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,540
No, it's saved.

1340
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,580
Of thy bones are choral.

1341
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,700
Yeah, it's definitely happening to all the columns.

1342
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:29,860
He's back.

1343
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:29,860


1344
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:29,860


1345
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:29,860


1346
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:29,860


1347
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,960
You can just sit here until Sunday morning and he comes in.

1348
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,160
You can just sit here until you run.

1349
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:35,680
No, no.

1350
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,040
I just can't hear it.

1351
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,520
You can spall your Sunday pants messing around.

1352
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,420
I like that line.

1353
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,520
Is this what happens to all the callers?

1354
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,160
All the callers?

1355
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1356
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,600
Is this how it's going to be from now on?

1357
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,280
Yeah, honey.

1358
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:50,920
I'm afraid so.

1359
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,560
You made it with this.

1360
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,740
From now on.

1361
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,860
Failed to serve Bob in life.

1362
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,220
And now, here in the afterlife.

1363
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,300
You know, it's been honey and milk and milk and milk.

1364
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,840
Forever and ever.

1365
00:51:59,840 --> 00:51:59,840


1366
00:51:59,840 --> 00:51:59,840


1367
00:51:59,840 --> 00:51:59,840


1368
00:51:59,840 --> 00:51:59,840


1369
00:51:59,840 --> 00:51:59,840


1370
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,220
It's been a nice sweet creamery butter until now, but now it's going to be like pickles

1371
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,100
that have been picked up off the floor and mayonnaise that's been sitting in the refrigerator

1372
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,620
for over 21 years.

1373
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,820
The afterlife just got a lot more interesting.

1374
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,300
Yeah, really mushy avocados.

1375
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,560
Just completely disgusting.

1376
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:15,840
Ew.

1377
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,980
Pass the caller into the lake of show.

1378
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,160
But that's the way the show is.

1379
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,760
Alligator pear.

1380
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,100
What were you going to say?

1381
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,480
The pizza's the size of a penny.

1382
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,720
I was going to say...

1383
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:25,540
Yes.

1384
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,300
Yes.

1385
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,580
You were?

1386
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,400
But then he decided not to.

1387
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:29,820
Yeah.

1388
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:29,820


1389
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,580
He decided to pay for free a penny of poop.

1390
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,380
By Robert Williams.

1391
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,060
Yes.

1392
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,360
Yes.

1393
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,340
All right.

1394
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,780
Now, a trio, trio bite.

1395
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,200
Yes.

1396
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,720
Because they won't install a flash player.

1397
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,980
My favorite comic book character.

1398
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,460
Oh my God.

1399
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,460
I'm glad she's back.

1400
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,680
I'm just one of the ordinary ones here.

1401
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:44,780
Really?

1402
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,680
A new death experience?

1403
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,200
What happened?

1404
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,720
I just love it when she calls.

1405
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,340
Me too.

1406
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,760
So what was the new death experience?

1407
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,000
I just love it when she does this.

1408
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,800
I do too.

1409
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,080
Now, you're listening to the radio, see, and that's 12 minutes ago.

1410
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,780
Oh, oh, oh.

1411
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,840
I think I can barely hear the show.

1412
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,320
Barely.

1413
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,460
Yeah, the 12 minute delay is a key to tough on listeners.

1414
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,660
Better put something on, sweetheart, or I'm going to have a heart attack.

1415
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,120
The show is sneaking up behind you.

1416
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,160
Oh, maybe I can just hear something.

1417
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,460
Yeah.

1418
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,840
Remember, it's a ghost show, so it'll be, it'll feel kind of cold on your back.

1419
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,480
Ghost show.

1420
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,960
And the little short hairs will raise up because the show is so ghostly.

1421
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,100
Are you allowed to half-dug?

1422
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,560
Yeah.

1423
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:16,500
Dugs?

1424
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:16,660
No.

1425
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,820
He's like a half-dug.

1426
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,260
Where's my golden microphone?

1427
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,260
I went skiing with half-dug last year.

1428
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:23,720
I'm calling from another country too.

1429
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:23,720


1430
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,440
Now you can go see the Dugs, but you can't have them.

1431
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm calling from a country far away.

1432
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:29,800
Yeah.

1433
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,600
I remember when the Dugs were popular, but-

1434
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,080
Are you in the far away country now?

1435
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,640
That was before she was born.

1436
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,180
She won't remember that time.

1437
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,440
Yeah, she's in Oakland.

1438
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,260
Far, far away.

1439
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,520
Whatever happened to Dug Girl?

1440
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,420
It's a nice country.

1441
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,280
Fresno.

1442
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,020
I like it here.

1443
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,240
Dug Girl.

1444
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,240
She dug her way up.

1445
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,080
People that listen to KPFA don't like it.

1446
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,280
Dug Girl died.

1447
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,580
Yeah, people that listen to KPFA don't.

1448
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,560
All the Dug Girls go away eventually.

1449
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,740
Because no Dug Girl was ever called by a drug on a cell phone.

1450
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,100
We don't talk about that country anymore because we don't want to draw their wrath.

1451
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,680
They died of sorrow and a broken heart.

1452
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,780
But there is, of course, a-

1453
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,880
Dug Girls can't have cell phones.

1454
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,540
Dug Girl on tape.

1455
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:01,880
I know.

1456
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,500
That's the problem.

1457
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,520
It's sort of a conundrum.

1458
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,560
The Dugs can't have cell phones and the Dug Girls die because they never called.

1459
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,320
How come you can't hear Bishop Joey anymore?

1460
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:09,320


1461
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,080
I'm blowing up my Dug Girl doll.

1462
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,600
What has happened to Bishop Joey?

1463
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,560
We haven't heard from him in over half an hour.

1464
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,960
He's blowing up his Dug Girl doll.

1465
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,520
I'm blowing up my Dug Girl doll.

1466
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,680
He's gone soft.

1467
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,960
We call him Bishop Joey.

1468
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,380
What about the ending of Bob himself?

1469
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,040
The ending?

1470
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,920
The death of Bob.

1471
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,320
Oh.

1472
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,060
Which one?

1473
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,080
He's died many times.

1474
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:29,680
That got me.

1475
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:29,780
That got me.

1476
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:29,780


1477
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:29,780


1478
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,100
I'm going to be-puzzling evidence here, of course, was the first person to take, that

1479
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,880
we know of, to take Bob at his command and kill him.

1480
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,000
And he did.

1481
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,780
And puzzling evidence.

1482
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,200
I was there.

1483
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,320
It happened a few feet away from me.

1484
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,780
I'll never forget it.

1485
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,300
I understand there were sightings of numerous gunmen.

1486
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,340
Yes.

1487
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:48,920
As always.

1488
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,500
That's right.

1489
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,460
But there was one that was clearly there.

1490
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:57,260
And then Bob Black smashed him over the head with a bottle.

1491
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,140
He was the Jack Ruby of the game.

1492
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,360
Yeah.

1493
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,040
It was all a terrible muddle and confusion.

1494
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,180
And then Jayner hit Bob Black over the head.

1495
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,160
And then Bucknacket hit Jayner over the head.

1496
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,440
And then so on and so on.

1497
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:07,740
Yes.

1498
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,360
Tales of vanished, vanquished subgeniuses.

1499
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,660
Looks like someone's calling in now.

1500
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,920
Let's go to that caller.

1501
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,940
Caller, you're on the air.

1502
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,420
I just turned on this radio program.

1503
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1504
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,260
I don't know what you guys are doing.

1505
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,960
You're the audience.

1506
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,900
We're the funny guys.

1507
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,340
You tell us what's going on.

1508
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:28,340


1509
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,860
We don't really have much of a clue.

1510
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,580
How does it seem to you?

1511
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,080
I just want to know what's happening.

1512
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,500
Okay, you play Pete Goldie.

1513
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,900
What's happening over there?

1514
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,560
Well, we did bring out the telescope earlier.

1515
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,780
We were just looking at the stars.

1516
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,780
We weren't doing anything else.

1517
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah.

1518
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,880
Now we're looking through the other end of the stars.

1519
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,160
Yeah.

1520
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,880
We are looking for a director of the program tonight.

1521
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,780
Could you help us out?

1522
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,740
Just give us some direction?

1523
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,360
I don't know why I'm here.

1524
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,340
I don't know why I'm here.

1525
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,340


1526
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,340


1527
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,340


1528
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,340


1529
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,340


1530
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,340


1531
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,360
Actually, you've won a prize tonight by calling in.

1532
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,840
Yeah, a brand new sigmoidoscope.

1533
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,500
Yeah, we're going to use it right now.

1534
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,340
And we're going to look for the money to send Mongoloid out of the state.

1535
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,180
I need a new outlet.

1536
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:19,820
Well, let's facilitate your inward turning by asking you, since I have a feeling you

1537
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,740
were at the concert, what your impression was.

1538
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,920
I just turned the radio program on.

1539
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

1540
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,600
The really good part of the concert.

1541
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,320
Oh, my God.

1542
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,320


1543
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,100
Oh, come on.

1544
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,500
Well, then tell us the best part of the best concert you were at.

1545
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,460
It was the Mongoloid concert.

1546
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,240
Of course, we know that.

1547
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,500
But what was the best part?

1548
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,680
And the very last set was the best part.

1549
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,060
Last set was the best?

1550
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,020
Absolutely.

1551
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,160
Yeah.

1552
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,720
After the guy stang, stop talking.

1553
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,860
Yeah, after the...

1554
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,640
That made me stop talking.

1555
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,340
That guy stang.

1556
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,060
The big hook came out and grabbed him.

1557
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:49,700
Yeah.

1558
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,020
Yeah.

1559
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,840
We weren't going to wait until...

1560
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,920
But we just decided to go ahead on and prove to be a providential...

1561
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,300
Yeah.

1562
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1563
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1564
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1565
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1566
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1567
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1568
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1569
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1570
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1571
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,300


1572
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:58,580
...provision.

1573
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,920
I think every act should rush the stage and push away the prior act like history itself.

1574
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,180
I agree.

1575
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,840
Caller, can you...

1576
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,480
That should be part of show business.

1577
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,620
Please, caller, please, caller, turn up your radio.

1578
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,860
Caller, please, we don't...

1579
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,400
We need your radio louder, please.

1580
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,740
No, no, it's not...

1581
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,640
It's a...

1582
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,300
No.

1583
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,160
It hurts.

1584
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,680
I know, I know, but it's a good thing.

1585
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,100
We need the feedback, please, caller.

1586
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:19,700
We need a loop.

1587
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,120
We need an endless loop, please.

1588
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,380
No, no, no.

1589
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,920
I'm not going to help you.

1590
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,980
This is like the opening shot of a apocalypse now.

1591
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,300
No, no, no.

1592
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:28,300


1593
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:28,300


1594
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:28,300


1595
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,440
In your mind, though.

1596
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:30,800
No, no, no.

1597
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,300
Leave me out of your little game you play.

1598
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,300
Or as Dobbs is reputed to have said, believe me out of it.

1599
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,680
I'm not going to go there.

1600
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,240
I'm not going to come with you.

1601
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,080
You are there.

1602
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,780
We are there.

1603
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,360
Yeah, exactly.

1604
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,480
We are already there.

1605
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,500
I'm counting on an updraft to make me taller.

1606
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,140
I don't think we have a choice.

1607
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,660
That's all I need in this world.

1608
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,480
That's all I want, is to be taller.

1609
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,360
Hey, Michael.

1610
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,060
That booboo...

1611
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,140
That booboo...

1612
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:58,240
That booboo...

1613
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,260
That booboo...

1614
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,260


1615
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,260


1616
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,260


1617
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,260


1618
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,260


1619
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,180
Michael, you're on the internet now, right?

1620
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,060
This show is messing with my head, Matt.

1621
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,420
What kind of show is this?

1622
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,100
What kind of show is this?

1623
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,500
Ask him if he's on the internet, Matt.

1624
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,400
Exactly what kind of sound effects were you recording?

1625
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,320
Are you on the internet now, Matt?

1626
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,640
I was telling somebody about that the other day.

1627
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,960
Michael, you're on the internet now.

1628
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:15,280
Yeah.

1629
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:15,860
Yeah.

1630
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,640
Just what sort of types were you?

1631
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,700
You can hear me asking you, Mr. Whistle Radio.

1632
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:20,820
Well, I'm listening to your radio.

1633
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,740
I'm talking to your radio.

1634
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,020
It's just show, officer.

1635
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,660
But let me try to turn up my computer.

1636
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,600
It's all right, officer.

1637
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,800
It's supposed to be orange.

1638
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,280
No, you don't turn up your nose at me, officer.

1639
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:28,560
You're on the internet now, young man.

1640
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,120
No, when you're on the internet...

1641
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,180
And Earth has sent the force over.

1642
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,940
No, I mean, he's not...

1643
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,100
When I say, is he on the internet, he's off the air.

1644
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,920
Is he on the internet to show you something?

1645
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,320
Of course he's on the internet.

1646
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,200
He's got an iMac.

1647
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,880
He's got a little camera on there, and he wants to talk to all the girls that...

1648
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,360
I like calling them talking head girls.

1649
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,300
I've reached out to them.

1650
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,020
I've reached out to them all, too.

1651
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,980
The endless talking head girls.

1652
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,980
You know talking head girls?

1653
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,180
Yes.

1654
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,800
They'll take you the rest of your life to talk to all the girls.

1655
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,020
Didn't talking head girls do a song about you?

1656
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,260
My favorite is one that does the...

1657
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:58,680
She doesn't talk at all.

1658
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,820
Okay, be careful.

1659
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,080
And she pretends to be Japanese.

1660
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,700
It looks like she's in Utah.

1661
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,020
She's turning Japanese.

1662
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,880
She is.

1663
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,380
Bye-bye.

1664
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,380
Michael Pepe, say goodbye.

1665
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,180
Michael Pepe is going?

1666
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:08,560
No.

1667
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,620
And there are other Japanese women who pretend to be real, but they're...

1668
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,020
No.

1669
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,360
Michael Pepe in our land.

1670
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,180
It's a sad day.

1671
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,320
Another Michael Pepe gone.

1672
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,000
Michael, we hardly knew you.

1673
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,700
We'll miss you when you're gone.

1674
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,640
We'll miss you when you're awake.

1675
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,340
No, no.

1676
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,020
We'll miss you when you're good and bad.

1677
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,220
I'm just going into the box.

1678
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:25,760
Oh.

1679
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,600
Oh, okay.

1680
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,840
All right, let me turn down everything.

1681
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,260
Okay, yeah.

1682
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1683
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1684
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,260
You gotta turn down that box.

1685
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,260
All right, here, you turn down that duty box, Mike.

1686
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,780
The box is...

1687
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,420
So, um, wait, can you see by any chance the...

1688
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,480
Wait, what, Baron Von Traveler?

1689
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,980
Wait, now they're saying-

1690
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,200
Okay.

1691
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,900
They have special subgenius names.

1692
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,860
You know what?

1693
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,520
I have...

1694
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,340
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Shane.

1695
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,520
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1696
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,080
Hey, hey, oh, I know them bittersweet.

1697
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:49,240
