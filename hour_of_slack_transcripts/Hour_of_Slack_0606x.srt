Ego Plum Music once again.

17
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,520
And friends, I have such a wonderful amount of show ready to go.

18
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,860
And for once, I'm not in a rip and hurry to get it done.

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,580
I can take my time putting this show together.

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,220
I can take all day long and feel like I'm actually doing my job.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,800
We've got some KPFA Hal and possibly even Jane are on that show.

22
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,000
That Dr. John Casual Media Barrage.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,620
We've got Dr. Legume coming up.

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,440
Of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,900
More from Cleveland.

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,780
The lovely Friday Jones.

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,760
The lovely Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,300
The lovely Chris Peterman.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,920
And the lovely Princess Wiardo.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
Everything is just so lovely.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,900
The universe is a beautiful place if you just let it be.

32
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,420
And that brings us...

33
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,160
to the news.

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,300
Dear friends, I do have...

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,480
Speaking of copyright violations,

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,500
we do have a newspaper that we steal from.

37
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,240
It's called The Onion from Madison, Wisconsin.

38
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,880
I believe that's where The Onion's from.

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,920
It's certainly my favorite newspaper.

40
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,600
Yes.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,420
Let's see if they've got a...

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,720
TheOnion.com

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,300
That ought to tell you what you need to know.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
TheOnion.com

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,100
Well, anyway, according to The Onion here,

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
the ACLU...

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,300
And now for the news.

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,000
The ACLU defends Nazis' right to burn down ACLU headquarters.

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,740
New York.

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,160
At a press conference Monday,

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,420
American Civil Liberties Union officials announced

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,140
that the organization will go to court

53
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,320
to defend a neo-Nazis group's right

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,600
to burn down the ACLU headquarters.

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,860
ACLU president,

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,380
ACLU president,

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,260
Nadine Strossen,

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,960
told reporters that her organization

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,920
intends to vigorously and passionately defend

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,420
the Georgia chapter of the American Nazi Party's

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,440
First Amendment right to freely express

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,500
its hatred of the ACLU

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,160
by setting its New York office ablaze

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,000
on November 25th,

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,020
which is coming up in just a few days, friends.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Quote,

67
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,160
I am reminded of the words of Voltaire.

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,600
I may disagree with what you say,

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,500
but I will defend to the death

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,280
your right to say it.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,820
Strossen said.

72
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,740
While the ACLU vehemently disagrees

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,660
with the idea of Nazis torching this building,

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,820
the principle of freedom of expression

75
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,580
must be supported in all cases.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,780
If we take away these Nazis' right

77
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,480
to burn down our headquarters,

78
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,600
we take away everyone's right

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,940
to burn down our headquarters.

80
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,800
Buddy Carver, president of the Georgia chapter

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,320
of the American Nazi Party,

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,440
praised the ACLU for taking on his case.

83
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,360
I would like to thank Ms. Strossen

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
and all the other

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,780
Negro-loving, bleeding-heart liberals

86
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,560
at the ACLU

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,940
for defending my constitutional right

88
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,800
to express my loathing of them

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,900
with hundred-foot-high flames,

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,240
said Carver,

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,580
sporting a tan uniform

92
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,140
and swastika armband.

93
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
We must finish the job

94
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,580
Hitler was unable to.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
ACLU associate director

96
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,900
Mel Rosenblatt agreed.

97
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
The real danger here is not the American people,

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,140
the real danger here is not the American Nazi Party,

99
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,700
he said.

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
The real danger here is what would happen

101
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,360
to the rest of us

102
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,380
if the Buddy Carvers of this world

103
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,080
were not allowed to commit arson

104
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,200
against Negro-loving, bleeding-heart liberal Jew attorneys.

105
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,660
Making the case all the more controversial

106
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,360
is the neo-Nazis' demand

107
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,680
that the ACLU's entire 315-person staff

108
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,860
be in the building at the time of the blaze.

109
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,520
Strongly opposing the request

110
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,260
are New York City Police Commissioner

111
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,300
William Bratton,

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
Fire Chief Ed Holm,

113
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,200
and the ACLU's entire staff.

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,200


115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,340
and the ACLU's entire staff

116
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,340


117
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,340


118
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,340


119
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,340


120
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,480
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,680
who said that all 315 will die

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,240
if trapped in the 14-story office building

123
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,340
during the blaze.

124
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,160
ACLU attorneys responded

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,320
that they will request a federal appeals hearing

126
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,620
if New York City attempts to stop them

127
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,820
or their fellow employees

128
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
from perishing in the November 25th blaze.

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
Yes, my loving wife Linda

130
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
and three wonderful children,

131
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,080
Ben, Robbie, and Stephanie

132
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,980
will be devastated

133
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,700
when I am killed next month.

134
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,320
ACLU attorney Ben Bratton

135
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,840
said,

136
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
but I recognize that in a very real sense

137
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
it would be a victory for Mr. Carver

138
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,820
and his fellow hate mongers

139
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,480
if I did not burn to death

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,020
because their terrible message

141
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,520
of bigotry and intolerance

142
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,960
would be all the more effective

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
if suppressed.

144
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,120
The Carver case is one of several

145
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,620
controversial legal battles

146
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,560
with which the ACLU has been involved

147
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,620
this judicial year.

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,260
In State of California vs. Tubbs,

149
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,000
the organization defended the right

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,520
of a San Francisco art gallery

151
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,140
to display

152
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,520
a piece of performance art

153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,960
in which innocent passersby

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,900
are shot to death by gunmen.

155
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
In February, the ACLU went to

156
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,020
U.S. Appeals Court

157
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,500
to defend the grand wizard

158
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,340
of the Oklahoma County, Mississippi

159
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,180
chapter of the Ku Klux Klan's right

160
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,380
to beat a black man to death

161
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,360
and spray paint

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
quote, white pride

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,500
unquote, across his chest.

164
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
We can have no arbitrary setting of limits

165
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,760
when it comes to the Bill of Rights,

166
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,820
Strossen said.

167
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,000
The Constitution does not say,

168
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,240
you have the right to express

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,400
these opinions, but not those opinions,

170
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,800
nor does it say,

171
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,460
you can express these opinions

172
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,900
by word, but not by violence.

173
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,200
For a free society to work,

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,880
hatred in all its forms

175
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,260
must be encouraged.

176
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,780
Isn't that wonderful, friends?

177
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
And also in the news here

178
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,700
from The Onion,

179
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,720
lifestyle news.

180
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,700
Hot, sexy girls

181
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,940
waiting to talk to guys

182
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,080
just like you.

183
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,360
Van Nuys, California.

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
According to an announcement broadcast

185
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,420
on late night cable television Saturday,

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
hot, sexy girls are at this very moment

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,640
waiting to talk to guys

188
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,120
just like you.

189
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,640
The broadcast, sponsored by

190
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,240
the Van Nuys-based telecommunication company

191
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
Chat Time Entertainment,

192
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,960
urged all guys just like you

193
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
to call these hot, sexy girls

194
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
without delay in order to minimize

195
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
the amount of time the girls

196
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,420
would have to wait.

197
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,120
While the precise number of girls

198
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,800
in question was unspecified,

199
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,700
James Hegel, a spokesperson

200
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,900
for Chat Time Entertainment,

201
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,040
stressed that they are specifically interested

202
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,820
in hearing from guys just like yourself.

203
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,260
These girls aren't looking

204
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,840
for just any guy, Hegel said.

205
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,320
They are interested in a certain type of guy.

206
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,580
Namely, guys who have

207
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,160
working touch-tone telephones

208
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,820
and possess the motor skills necessary

209
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,700
to dial a phone number off their television screen

210
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,380
into the aforementioned telephone

211
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,580
without error.

212
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,660
You know,

213
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,920
guys just like you.

214
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,580
That's the type of guy they're talking to.

215
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,520
Chat Time employee and hot, sexy girl

216
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,280
Candy Lux agreed with Hegel's assessment.

217
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,200
I just love talking to guys

218
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
who have cable TV

219
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,520
and watch it late at night,

220
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,580
she said, reclining in a bubble bath.

221
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,640
I just find it so attractive

222
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,560
that when they watch a phone number

223
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,220
come up on the bottom of their screen

224
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,200
and then dial it,

225
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,920
well, it sounds like somebody's just now

226
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,040
dialing in our office.

227
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,980
Sorry, I'm busy.

228
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
Fellow hot, sexy girl,

229
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
Brianna Kisses.

230
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,460
You know what I really like?

231
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,120
When a guy has a working credit card

232
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,140
and knows how to operate a telephone.

233
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,100
Running her hands over her body,

234
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,620
she added,

235
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,460
when guys like that enter their credit card number

236
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,640
on a touch-tone phone,

237
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,300
it just drives me wild.

238
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,980
Though no specific timetable was given

239
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,080
regarding how long the hot, sexy girls would wait,

240
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,900
Hegel said they very much want

241
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,380
to talk to guys like you.

242
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,820
As soon as possible.

243
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,480
One of these girls' biggest turn-offs

244
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,220
is guys who are indecisive

245
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,420
or slow to take action,

246
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,260
who take a lot of time trying to decide

247
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,500
whether or not they should make a phone call.

248
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,920
These girls want to talk to the kind of guy

249
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,880
who calls right away.

250
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,060
That kind of guy.

251
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,260
What are you waiting for,

252
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,100
said hot, sexy girl, Sandra Pett,

253
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,640
reclining backwards into a pile of soft, lacy pillows

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,880
while arching her back

255
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,660
and thrusting her breasts forward.

256
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,420
Aren't you the type of guy

257
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,360
who likes to talk to hot, sexy girls?

258
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,740
Please, don't keep me waiting.

259
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,860
Call now.

260
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,920
Pett added that a nominal fee

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,080
will be included in the cost of the call.

262
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,920
And friends, I think,

263
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,400
you know, on that note,

264
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,860
I really should cut over to this

265
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,320
Reverend Friday Jones live.

266
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,840
This is not entirely queued up.

267
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,880
I'm going to mix the music on the fly

268
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,300
and we'll just see how it works.

269
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,060
Say you're new in town

270
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,000
or perhaps just very weird

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,340
and you're having difficulty

272
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
finding friends and or lovers.

273
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
How do you know who to pursue?

274
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,140
Well, to begin with,

275
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,620
if you're a creep,

276
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,220
an ever-whining scumbag

277
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,020
who hates everybody

278
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
yet demands attention,

279
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,660
you can forget it.

280
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,620
Otherwise, no matter how shy

281
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,040
and nerdly you might be,

282
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,440
no matter how awkward at meeting people,

283
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,520
there are specific clues to look for

284
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,240
that will tell you whether someone is

285
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
worth the embarrassment of being a nerd.

286
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


287
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


288
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


289
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


290
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


291
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,280
or the embarrassment of getting to know.

292
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,340
Men,

293
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,600
mount a dog's head on a wall

294
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,540
and watch its eyes when a girl walks by.

295
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,580
If they move to follow her,

296
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,220
she's a subgenius.

297
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,320
Ladies,

298
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,640
you can judge a guy by his boobs.

299
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,580
Eyeball his knockers.

300
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,000
That's the secret.

301
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,000
While searching for a true subgenius friend,

302
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,640
you might kill time by using a pink or two.

303
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,680
They're easy to make friends with,

304
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,220
at least for the short term,

305
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,860
if you're that desperate.

306
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,340
They have little or no control

307
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,480
or critical faculties

308
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,340
except those dictated by the con.

309
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,480
And you can quickly go through a long line of normals,

310
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,620
first enticing them,

311
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,680
then burning them out and dropping them.

312
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,860
Having being molded into the me generation system

313
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,740
by the con,

314
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,800
you should be able to so thoroughly out-me them

315
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,340
that they'll eagerly let your me

316
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,780
replace their me.

317
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,900
But be careful.

318
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,580
If you overdo it and become the biggest me around,

319
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,540
you'll end up believing it yourself.

320
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,660
And the next thing you know,

321
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,920
you're just another tool.

322
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,120
Sometimes,

323
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,660
it takes years to find your subgenius mates.

324
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,840
While waiting,

325
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,960
you can always develop an imaginary friend

326
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,420
just like you did in childhood.

327
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,840
Or for that matter,

328
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,080
you can just buy an inflatable one.

329
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,920
A hint,

330
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,020
the ones with simulated hair are worth the extra price.

331
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,720
On the other hand,

332
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,460
maybe you don't want anybody anyway.

333
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,440
19 out of 20 relationships end up being disasters.

334
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,060
But get this,

335
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,780
the ones that do work usually come right after

336
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,000
you've given up looking

337
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,560
and accepted the isness of the now.

338
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,120
Give up and you'll get sex.

339
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,740
There's something else you can do on the pleasure ships

340
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,240
that I forgot to tell you about.

341
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,060
You get to have sex

342
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,180
with the alien sex goddesses.

343
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,520
Yes!

344
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,880
And this is a song just about that.

345
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,200

¶¶ Well, now that you know the meaning of fallen sex,

362
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,740
you'll quite often want to get one.

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
Just take aPRINCY instead

364
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:12,880


365
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,400
Now, how are sex and entendence related?

366
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,180
It's key to love it.

367
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,640
Plan out when the sex will start.

368
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:18,640


369
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,680
but it couldn't always lead all the way,

370
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,380
but what do you do

371
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,380


372
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,820
. . .

373
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,640
Ah, sex!

374
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,020
Well, I have no intention of sex.

375
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,340
Now, with the bloody girl.

376
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,560
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.

377
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,080
Oh.

378
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,240
Oh.

379
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,520
Oh.

380
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,880
No time.

381
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,080
Oh, stop this crazy thing.

382
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,240
No time

383
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Oh, stop it, bout what?

384
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,340
It's too much

385
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,460
Or have you lost your Citizenship?

386
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,860
If so, even that's R.I.P.

387
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:37,900
We RB JONAH

388
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:37,900


389
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,760
With the bloody girl.

390
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,060
Have I lost my Princessänglist?

391
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,060


392
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,140
White woman, save me, please.

393
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,200
There's her.

394
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,200


395
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,520
Yea, stupid.

396
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,520


397
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,680
A little bit.

398
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Whoaaaaa!

399
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,000
But, that's a face.

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000


401
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000


402
00:15:51,020 --> 00:16:17,020
I'm a sax

403
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,280
Well, I have no reflection

404
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,540
Sax in another dimension

405
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,060
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

406
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,540
So long

407
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,460
Adieu

408
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,140
Bye-bye

409
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,140
Ah, sax!

410
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,400
Yes, you'll all be having sex in another dimension

411
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
When you bore the pleasure

412
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:09,860
Yeah, if things work out, friends

413
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,600
If things work out just right

414
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,600
Yeah, preaching

415
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, friends, I'll tell you what

416
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,260
I'm a sax

417
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,500
Ah, Einstein's Secret Orchestra

418
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,600
Talking about the great promise of X-Day

419
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,540
Sure, the escape vessels of the sex goddesses and so forth

420
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,320
But I think we need a sobering reminder here

421
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,860
From Dr. Legume's sermon

422
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,960
At the Cleveland Devival recently

423
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
At Euclid Tavern

424
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,340
This is where these recordings come from

425
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,000
Pardon me

426
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,720
I'm going to probably have to do an inordinate amount of cuss word editing

427
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,860
For most of the American stations

428
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,660
Because

429
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,060
Ah

430
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,340
There was this fat, drunken, skinhead, blonde guy

431
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,260
That wrecked

432
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,420
He wrecked the videos

433
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,380
He wrecked the sound

434
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,600
And he actually even wrecked the tripod

435
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,640
Um

436
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,220
He wrecked the vibes

437
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,060
And the whole time

438
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,500
He thought he was just the coolest subgenius there

439
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,020
In fact, he was a shameful

440
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,580
Bobby-like pink boy

441
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,880
Who really is the kind of person

442
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,040
That kind of makes the church an embarrassment

443
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,480
Sometimes

444
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,380
And I'm sure that many of you know what we mean

445
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,340
But let us forget the fat, blonde, skinhead

446
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,440
That everyone who was at that Devival remembers

447
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,380
In a very negative sense

448
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,000
And let us stop being vindictive and bitter

449
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
About these amateurs that

450
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,060
Sully the clean and true word of Bob

451
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,160
And go straight to Dr. Kitadon

452
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,280
Legume, thank you

453
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,100
Yeah, actually the guy

454
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,360
Um

455
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,100
Wasn't a skinhead

456
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,800
He told me he was a skinhead

457
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,460
He had a

458
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
He had some hair

459
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,240
And he had a little blonde beard

460
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,200
But he proudly told me

461
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,840
That he used to be a skinhead

462
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,460
Oh, God

463
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,020
When X-Day comes

464
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,040
They will all die

465
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,020
He's gone 47 miles above water

466
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,960
He's gone 47 miles above water

467
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,300
He's gone 47 miles above water

468
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,920
Harry Potter

469
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,700
One fine orthogard

470
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,940
He still need a

471
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,720
Knit to take a cut

472
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:24,720


473
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,380
I know, bros

474
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,460
We want a little more

475
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,920
R traveler

476
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:25,960
For a snack

477
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,020
Do you want us

478
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,020


479
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,020


480
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
So listen

481
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,340
Look at this

482
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,360
Look at this

483
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,360


484
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,360


485
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,360


486
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,360


487
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,360


488
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,400
I say

489
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,700
We courage and

490
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,400
относ

491
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,840
To, hey

492
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,380

To, hey

497
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,180
Oh yeah, brothers and sisters, I'm back here in Cleveland once again.

498
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,620
Yeah, I've preached here for several Halloweens here in Cleveland.

499
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,800
This is the third or fourth Halloween I've been out here.

500
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:17,020
Yeah, Halloween's a good time. I imagine come Friday there'll be lots of little kids out trick-or-treating,

501
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,000
running around in their little costumes, going door-to-door, asking for their little treats.

502
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,500
Well, tonight I want to tell you the story about a little boy who's not going to be going out trick-or-treating this year.

503
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,680
It's a little boy, a little retarded.

504
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,340
It's a little boy. His name's Arthur. He's my nephew.

505
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:45,340
And a week ago, he was in the bathtub taking a bath,

506
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,680
and my brother-in-law, he went in the bathroom and looked in on him

507
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,980
because he's retarded and he can't take care of himself.

508
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,000
And they found him face down in the tub, and he was blue.

509
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,700
You think that's funny? This is a true story.

510
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,780
This is a true story.

511
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,200
It's a true story.

512
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,540
Yes, it's a true story.

513
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,640
Well, they found him face down in the tub, and he was blue, and he was dead.

514
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,780
And my brother-in-law took him out of the bathtub, and they performed CPR on him,

515
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,400
and they brought him back, and they put him in the intensive care unit at the hospital.

516
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,880
And they managed to get the water pumped out of his lungs,

517
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,860
but it turns out that he had epileptic seizure in the tub, and he had lost control of his bowels.

518
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,660
And some of the water.

519
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,300
So they found out that he had inhaled into his lungs.

520
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,840
Well, it had shit in it.

521
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,400
Well, the doctors didn't know what to do.

522
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:51,640
He had gotten a terrible blood infection from the shit in his lungs getting mixed around in there.

523
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,020
And they said that he had maybe two days to live.

524
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,460
Well, they gave him antibiotics and everything,

525
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,140
and I guess the doctors were wrong,

526
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,600
because he's starting to pull through.

527
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,180
Well, brothers and sisters,

528
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,120
you know, I could get all morose about this,

529
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,340
but instead I decided to use this

530
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,820
to send a message to you all.

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,260
Because when I look out at the group of you

532
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,820
unsaved out there tonight,

533
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,960
I see the face of a bunch of little retarded children

534
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,340
who are being slowly poisoned by their own shit.

535
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,020
Yes, brothers and sisters,

536
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,440
you're all being poisoned by your own shit.

537
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,840
And you're dying.

538
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,540
And you don't know it.

539
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,000
You're dying because you're just too retarded

540
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,060
to know that you're dying.

541
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,500
But brothers and sisters, we're here tonight.

542
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,140
We subgenius doctors are here

543
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,700
to give you an antibiotic

544
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,080
in the form of J.R. Bob Dobbs

545
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,780
to help you clean the poison out of your system,

546
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,940
to help you clean the poison out of your blood,

547
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,620
to keep you from being poisoned by your own shit.

548
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,000
Because, brothers and sisters,

549
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,720
if you don't take that pill,

550
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,820
that Bob pill, that antibiotic

551
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,080
that we're offering you tonight,

552
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,880
well, come July 5th, 1998,

553
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,240
you're all going to be pushing up the daisies.

554
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,740
And it doesn't have to happen.

555
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,000
It does not have to happen,

556
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,940
brothers and sisters.

557
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,800
You do not have to die.

558
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,780
You're damn right I'm scaring you.

559
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,360
If you don't have your membership

560
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,760
in the Church of the Subgenius,

561
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,540
you better goddamn well be scared

562
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,780
because you're going to burn.

563
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,200
That's right.

564
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,000
You're going to burn.

565
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,000


566
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,920
You're going to be burned up in the fires.

567
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,940
The fires.

568
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,120
Not the fires of hell,

569
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,540
but fires a thousand times hotter.

570
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,540
Oh, yeah, because we're one up on the devil.

571
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,240
The devil, well, hell.

572
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,920
The devil's like fucking Mr. Rogers

573
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,820
compared to subgeniuses.

574
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,960
Because we're some sadistic cocksuckers.

575
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,960
And we like to protect our own.

576
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,620
Is there any of our own here tonight

577
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,880
who know that Bob's going to protect them on X day?

578
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,780
Can I get it?

579
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:01,880
Can I get an amen?

580
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,740
Amen.

581
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,680
Can I get a praise Bob?

582
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,100
Praise Bob.

583
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,680
Praise Bob.

584
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,540
Oh, these, these saved are the ones

585
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,920
who recognize that they were being poisoned

586
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,900
by their own shit.

587
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,200
Oh, yeah.

588
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,540
And Bob helped them flush out the pipes,

589
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,460
brothers and sisters.

590
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,440
Oh, yeah.

591
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,660
He flushed out the pipes for the saved.

592
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,340
That's right, brothers and sisters.

593
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,100
And they'll be trick or treating.

594
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,520
But they won't be trick or treating this Halloween.

595
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,860
They'll be trick or treating on July 5th.

596
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,760
Except for the next one.

597
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,920
Except for all the treats are ours.

598
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,740
And all the tricks are on y'all.

599
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,040
Oh, yeah.

600
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,000
And there won't be egging nobody.

601
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,260
We won't be pitching eggs.

602
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,260
We'll be pitching fucking nukes.

603
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,200
Oh, yeah.

604
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,900
We'll be pitching your fucking skulls around

605
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,380
in the backyard for sport.

606
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,900
We'll be bowling with your severed fucking heads.

607
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,580
Yes, brothers and sisters.

608
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,580
And there's only one thing you can do about it,

609
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,300
brothers and sisters.

610
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,060
You've got to get right with Bob tonight.

611
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,740
You've got to get right with Bob tonight.

612
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,140
You've got to get down on your knees,

613
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,400
stick out your tongue,

614
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,880
and take that pill.

615
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,980
That's right.

616
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,260
You've got to take that pill that we're offering you tonight.

617
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,020
You've got to get right.

618
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,020
You've got to get...

619
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,040
You all need to get yourselves some head tonight.

620
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,240
Can I get an amen?

621
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,060
Can I get a praise Bob?

622
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Can I get a praise head?

623
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,360
Hell yes, brothers and sisters.

624
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,600
Praise the head.

625
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,480
Hey, this is what your head's going to look like

626
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,540
after X day, brothers and sisters.

627
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
If you're saved.

628
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,560
But if you're not saved after X day,

629
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,300
your head's going to look kind of like this.

630
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,520
Oh, yeah.

631
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,500
That's right, brothers and sisters.

632
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,520
Your poor little mushed head is going to be all over

633
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,580
the steel-tipped boots of the subgenius.

634
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,920
We're not asking for much.

635
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,100
We don't care about your soul.

636
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,160
All we care about is a measly small $30 donation

637
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,720
to the church of the subgenius.

638
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,560
Now, you can take that money,

639
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,320
and you can go see the Indians lose that last game of the series

640
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,580
if you want to go to Florida.

641
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,300
Yeah, you can spend your money on that.

642
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,720
But, hey, all that's up to you.

643
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:31,720


644
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,100
It's over now.

645
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,200
And, well, this will be the last World Series.

646
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,560
Yes, it's the last series.

647
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,680
You know why it's the last World Series?

648
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,940
Because it's the last year, and it's the last world.

649
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,020
And the only series you all are going to see who are unsaved

650
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,480
is a series of terrible events happening to you.

651
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,140
Yeah!

652
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh, yeah.

653
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,380
Oh, and we're going to laugh.

654
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,660
We're going to laugh at you.

655
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,140
We're going to be laughing at you

656
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,260
as we watch the invisible hands of your own dead saints

657
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,280
drag you deeper and deeper to the bottom of an ocean of poison shit.

658
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:11,820
Yeah!

659
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,880
And you will drown.

660
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,300
You will drown in your own shit.

661
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,420
Even more than you are now.

662
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,700
Even more than you are drowning in the shit

663
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,060
that the conspiracy dunks you under in.

664
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,620
Oh, yeah.

665
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,180
Oh, get rid of your stress.

666
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,600
Oh, yeah.

667
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
We'll get rid of your stress.

668
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You won't have anything to worry about.

669
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,080
The only...

670
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,780
Oh, yeah.

671
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,220
You won't have to worry about going to work.

672
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,140
You won't have to worry about whether your children are watching

673
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,580
dirty TV shows on Fox.

674
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,260
Oh, yeah.

675
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,260
Well, let me tell you.

676
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,260
There's somebody else who won't be worrying that night.

677
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,600
The worms.

678
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,020
Because they won't be worrying about what they're having for dinner.

679
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,480
Yeah!

680
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,400
But will the con be destroyed?

681
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
Yes, the con will be destroyed.

682
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,480
We will grind the conspiracy under our boot heels.

683
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,180
Yes, we will grind the conspiracy.

684
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,360
We'll grind the conspiracy sheep under our boot heels, too.

685
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,680
Oh, yes.

686
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,880
Yes, fuck the clones.

687
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,360
Fuck all the clones.

688
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,580
Oh, yeah.

689
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,260
Fuck the pink boys.

690
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,800
Fuck the pink boys.

691
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,520
Hell, yes, brothers and sisters.

692
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,460
Oh, yeah.

693
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,220
And they're really all clones.

694
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,140
Walk out into the street.

695
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,840
Can you tell the face of one man from the face of another?

696
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,980
No, they're all just faceless sheep.

697
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,360
Just sitting out there, factory bred fucking chickens.

698
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,360
That's right, brothers.

699
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,900
Crammed into little boxes like veal.

700
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,640
Crammed into little boxes like veal.

701
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,380
Covered with your own shit and waiting to be slaughtered.

702
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,720
Well, brothers and sisters, I have one thing to say if you're waiting to be slaughtered.

703
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,220
You don't have long to wait.

704
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,620
Yes, brothers and sisters.

705
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,520
The river's rising and you're all going to drown.

706
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,700
Tonight we're offering you a personal flotation device.

707
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,300
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters, the supermarket's out of food.

708
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,260
The road's closed.

709
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,720
The roads are closed.

710
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,240
The supermarket's out of food.

711
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Your lawn's on fire.

712
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,220
Your front yard's on fire.

713
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,400
Your backyard's on fire.

714
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,300
You can't get out.

715
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,840
Oh, yeah.

716
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:44,080
And brothers and sisters, the only chance you have is to hop on that last train out of town.

717
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,840
And J.R. Bob Dobbs will be driving that train.

718
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,440
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

719
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,060
Can I get an amen?

720
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,420
Can I get an hallelujah?

721
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,900
Hallelujah.

722
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,740
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

723
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,700
Well, I'm going to end my sermon now with three simple words.

724
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,140
Three simple words that could change your life tonight.

725
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,120
Don't fuck up.

726
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,240
Amen.

727
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,120
Hail Dr. Legume.

728
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,560
Don't fuck up.

729
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:24,240
Friends, Bob Dobbs promised you that if you spent that $30, you would never, when the escape vessels came on,

730
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,360
on July 5th, 1998, you would never have to worry about the pinks and the normals, the conspiracy again.

731
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:36,600
But nobody said who was going to protect you from Dr. Legume after X Day.

732
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,940
What happens if he wants to put you on his planet of broken glass?

733
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,120
Now, friends, earlier, you know I mentioned that.

734
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,040
.

735
00:30:48,520 --> 00:31:00,900
This is Dr. Onan Canobite, a new piece of music from the great Dr. Onan Canobite of Dr. Onan's Wotan Band fame.

736
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,180
.

737
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,180


738
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,560
.

739
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,760
.

740
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,180
.

741
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,940
.

742
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,660
.

743
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,320
.

744
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,780
so

745
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,800
and in more proof of de-evolution dear friends

746
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,880
the Lundarelli family in Udine, Italy said in July

747
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,360
that it would not bow to pressure and would thus leave its Führer wine on the market

748
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,940
joining its Wavara, Lenin and Marx brands

749
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,080
Führer's label has a photo of Adolf Hitler and comes in two varieties

750
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,060
Sieg Heil and Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer

751
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,100
one people, one empire, one ruler

752
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,420
and in June the Liquor Control Board of Ontario

753
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,780
cleared local shops

754
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,440
and shelves of a smuggled Chinese wine

755
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,980
that purportedly enhances libido

756
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,860
three-penised wine

757
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,360
deer, dolphin and dog

758
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,580
has such foul ingredients

759
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,800
that authorities wouldn't even dump it in sewers

760
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,420
that was sent in, as was this music

761
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,960
by internet, by Onan Canobite

762
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,460
who was celebrating Guy Fawkes Day in England

763
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,620
at the time, thank y'all

764
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:25,360
Lee An Normal

765
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,900
was hoping one of you would stop saying

766
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:29,900


767
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:29,900


768
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:29,900


769
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:29,900


770
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,180
drritis

771
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,900
how could you

772
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:30,900


773
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:30,900


774
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,660
unlawful

775
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:31,660


776
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,780
you know

777
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,160
enough in vain

778
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,340
of that time I reckon

779
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,100
Mark Lambert?

780
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,000
I got him some slack, okay?

781
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,560
Thanks, Bob.

782
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,240
Thanks, Bob.

783
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:57,340
You know, Chaz, I was talking to a young person just the other day.

784
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,140
A young person here in Dallas, Texas.

785
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:09,980
They didn't even know that we had had an interplanetary war at the turn of the century in the year 1900.

786
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:17,620
They thought that was a funny science fiction story that had been made into a radio show.

787
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,960
Just like declaring war on the planet a couple of weeks back.

788
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,440
Nobody believed it.

789
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,100
They don't take this kind of seriously.

790
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,880
And the reason they don't is they don't know any history.

791
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,680
You talk to a modern-day...

792
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,840
High school student or college student, and, well, sure, they know about the Gulf War.

793
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,480
You know, they remember the Gulf War, but they don't know about the war in Vietnam.

794
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,440
World War II, they don't know about...

795
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,140
They don't even know we landed on the moon.

796
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:50,340
No, they don't know that we walked on the moon, and they don't know that we had a war with the Martians at the turn of the century.

797
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,140
It just kills me.

798
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,820
It's like there's these giant Martian tripod museums in Baltimore.

799
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,020
And I think there's one.

800
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,580
It's in Akron.

801
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,640
They've got one of the damn Martian tripods in Akron.

802
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,600
And the people in Cleveland don't even know that we had a war with Mars.

803
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,920
It was...

804
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,900
Admittedly, it was 90 years ago.

805
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,540
90...

806
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,020
Exactly, 97 years ago, praise Bob, that we defeated...

807
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:23,360
And there's a crashed pyramidal spaceship in Mississippi, and nobody talks about that either.

808
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,220
Oh, they don't pay any damn attention to it at all.

809
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,380
Oops, and unfortunately...

810
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:36,740
Kaz and I weren't paying any attention at all to the tapes that we were making, and our tape ran out.

811
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,780
But friends, I wanted to...

812
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:49,600
Speaking of the war against Mars, I ran into some wonderful reading material, memoirs of the war of the worlds, in a book.

813
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
New book called...

814
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,260
You'll find in the history section of stores, a cheap paperback called War of the Worlds Global Dispatches.

815
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,240
The Martian Invasion of Earth, as witnessed by various famous people.

816
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:14,580
Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, Teddy Roosevelt, Pablo Picasso, Joseph Conrad.

817
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,320
And I'm going to read to you from a short section from Jack London.

818
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,060
The author, Jack London, who wrote Call of the Wild, I guess is his most famous book,

819
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,160
was in...

820
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,500
Far north at the time.

821
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,360
After the Martians had died out over most of the United States,

822
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,620
there were still a lot of them surviving up in the north.

823
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,860
And he describes...

824
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,200
It's kind of gross.

825
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,800
There was a...

826
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,560
They had captured a Martian.

827
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,260
Not one of the machines, just the Martian itself.

828
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,420
And had put it into a pit for a dog fight.

829
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,860
And this is what Jack London witnessed.

830
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,080
Doctors for Bob in the background.

831
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,360
It feels like this would be as good as anything else.

832
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,320
What happened next...

833
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,060
Oh, the Martian turned its monstrously intelligent eyes on me and gazed, it seemed, into my soul.

834
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,400
For once there was no hunger in that gaze, no disconcerting look of malevolence.

835
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,800
What happened next, I cannot explain, for words alone are inadequate to describe the sensation I received.

836
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,180
There are those...

837
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,040
Who...

838
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,180
Assume...

839
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,340
That the Martians communicated through clicking sounds of their beaks,

840
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,200
or through the waving of tentacles.

841
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,240
But the many witnesses who observed the monsters in life

842
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,940
all agreed that no such sounds or motions were evident.

843
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,960
Um, indeed, one reporter in London went so far as to suggest

844
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,460
that they may have shared thoughts across space,

845
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,500
from one mind to another.

846
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,280
Such suggestions have met with ridicule in critical circles,

847
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,440
but I can only tell what happened to me.

848
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,200
I...

849
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,980
Was gazing into the pit, at the Martian,

850
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,860
and suddenly it seemed as if a vast intelligence was pouring into my mind.

851
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,940
For one brief moment, my thoughts seemed to expand and my intellect seemed to fill the universe,

852
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,620
and I beheld a world with a red, glowing desert sand,

853
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,560
so strikingly cold that the sensation assaulted me like a physical blow,

854
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,440
crumpling me, so that I fell down into the snow, curling into a ball.

855
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,760
And as I beheld this world, I looked through eyes,

856
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,060
that were not my own.

857
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,340
All the light was tremendously magnified and shifted toward the red spectrum,

858
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,420
so that I beheld the landscape as if on a strange summer evening,

859
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,100
when the sky shone more redly than normal.

860
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,620
I looked out across a horizon that was peculiarly concave,

861
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,320
as if I were staring at a world much smaller than ours.

862
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,020
A few red plants sprouted in this frigid waste,

863
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,440
but they were stunted things.

864
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,240
Martian cities,

865
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,280
walking things that traveled through great maze-like canyons

866
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,360
as they followed the sun from season to season,

867
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,100
were marching in the distance, tantalizing, gleaming.

868
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,920
I craved their warmth, the company of my Martian companions.

869
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,720
I hungered for warmth as a starving man might hunger for food in the last moments of life,

870
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,000
and above me, floating like a mote of dust in the sea of space,

871
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,540
was the shining planet Earth.

872
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,260
One

873
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,980
We are one,

874
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,860
the voice seemed to whisper in my head,

875
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,040
and I knew that the Martian, with its superior intellect,

876
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,540
had deigned to speak to me.

877
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
You understand me.

878
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,860
We are one.

879
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,880
Then, a rifle cracked,

880
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,640
the sound of it reverberating from the cabin in the low hills.

881
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,500
Klondike Pete cocked the gun and fired three more times,

882
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,760
and the stinging scent of gunpowder and burnt oil

883
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,400
from the barrel of his gun filled the air.

884
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,800
I got up and looked into the pit at the Martian.

885
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,220
It was wriggling in its own death throes,

886
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,480
twisting and heaving on the ground in its inhuman way.

887
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,300
The Martian

888
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,760
The Martian

889
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,440
The Martian

890
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,040
The Martian

891
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,720
The Martian

892
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,280
The Martian

893
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,000
The gunlled,

894
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,960
to estimate its further shrug,

895
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:44,100
get a class right.

896
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,360
it all depends now

897
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,040
either years down the line

898
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,420
well it's years down the line

899
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,140
I don't know which way it goes

900
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,480
but

901
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,820
one day

902
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,980
after everybody's been

903
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,740
more or less judged

904
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,440
and everybody's ready for hell

905
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,740
or ready for heaven

906
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,060
after all that's been said

907
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,320
and after all that's been done

908
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,100
these angels

909
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,920
which are up there at that church

910
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,720
they will be given

911
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,820
they will be shown

912
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,860
how to become giants

913
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:21,940
okay

914
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,540
and once those angels

915
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,800
are shown how to become giants

916
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,100
what are they going to start doing then

917
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,980
they're going to start

918
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,960
stomping this earth

919
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,720
okay

920
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,380
they're going to start

921
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,960
stomping it just like a wine press

922
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,200
just like it says in the bible

923
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,260
hey everything I say

924
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,160
is from the bible

925
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,000
it ain't just me

926
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,180
they're going to stomp this plant

927
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,180
just like a wine press

928
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,080
and kill everybody

929
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,840
and crush everything

930
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,540
smash up everything

931
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,480
make it worse

932
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,760
just

933
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:48,800
just

934
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,200
just trash

935
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,420
it looks just like a war man

936
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,880
watch more war

937
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,580
war happening in Sarajevo

938
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,620
and places like that

939
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,440
look at the way war looks

940
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,100
and that's the way planet earth is going to look

941
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,900
people are going to be running for their lives

942
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,460
shoot

943
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,880
it's going to be a lot more critical than that

944
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,160
but

945
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,100
just help me man

946
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,720
I need help

947
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,700
I'm getting sick of doing this

948
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,520
I'm getting sick of talking like this

949
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,100
and now

950
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,480
for the news

951
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,580
Bob spoke to me using mental telepathy

952
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,580
Hector Brea told Colombian government investigators

953
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,760
he told me he was a male of his species

954
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,280
just as I am a male of the human species

955
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,480
but Bob didn't act like any male

956
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,580
that's for sure

957
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,980
he acted like a pansy from another planet

958
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,280
the father of three told authorities

959
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,860
the limp wristed pipe smoking visitor

960
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,800
showed up at his home on the night of the day

961
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,960
the night of July 2nd

962
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,860
awakening him and his wife with a knock at the door

963
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,800
he said he thought the subgenius was a human

964
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,040
until he let him in and the light revealed

965
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,440
the shocking truth

966
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,580
a blister on his thigh

967
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,760
Brea described the salesman as at least seven feet tall

968
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,120
with pale green skin

969
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,400
huge eyes

970
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,440
a large mouth

971
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,340
and a long protruding pipe

972
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,840
he had a human-like nose and ears

973
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,800
and wore a thick layer of makeup

974
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,860
his limbs were thin and rubbery

975
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,800
and he wore shiny pointy-toed boots

976
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,400
a blister on the moon

977
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,040
when he walked he sort of minced along and fluttered his hands

978
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,360
Brea said he was clutching a bunch of flowers from my wife's garden

979
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,040
all he did at first was smell the flowers

980
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,220
and spout poetry at us telepathically

981
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,180
he wore a kind of silver jumpsuit over silver and red striped tights

982
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,600
he seemed kind of harmless

983
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,040
but my wife was so terrified

984
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,780
she ran from the room and ran away from the house

985
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:48,800
and I was in the room

986
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,120
while I just stood there staring

987
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,760
Brea believes the strange visit lasted about 20 minutes

988
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,100
during which the cosmic queen

989
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,940
sashayed around his home trying on his wife's jewelry

990
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,660
using telepathy

991
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,460
the Dobbs told Brea about his long lonely days and nights

992
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,860
aboard a spaceship from a distant galaxy

993
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,660
he told the stunned Colombian

994
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,640
that he and his stoned fellow crewman

995
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,380
had come here merely to see what Earth was like

996
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,020
finally tiring of the small talk

997
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,300
the intergalactic gay salesman approached Brea

998
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,940
grabbed him and kissed him passionately on the neck

999
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,220
I was just about sick to my stomach Brea recalled

1000
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,420
I pushed him away and he started to cry

1001
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,040
then before I knew it he flounced out the door

1002
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,960
and was gone

1003
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,540
Brea said he has not heard from his swishy salesman visitor since that night

1004
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,500
this Bob thing was a fairy and nutty as a fruitcake

1005
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,160
the farmer said I hope he never comes back

1006
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,740
friends this is the sad fate that befalls the homophobic

1007
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,700
and those who are afraid of the weird the different

1008
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:03,260
the insane and the swishy fairy sissy limp wristed Bob Dobbs

1009
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,140
because that was Bob that visited that man testing him

1010
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,240
and when he kissed him on his neck

1011
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,540
he implanted the device right there

1012
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,360
that's all that kiss was

1013
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,240
was just a chance to push it one step further

1014
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,040
push the envelope

1015
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,780
and get a famous article in weekly world news

1016
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,300
Bob will push all the way in

1017
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,380
he will find an opening

1018
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,620
and he will push

1019
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,700
he wants your mind now

1020
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,120
he will find a crease somewhere

1021
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,500
he will moisten it up

1022
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,660
he will slobber on it

1023
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,220
and slick it up

1024
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,920
then he will punch in

1025
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,960
he will push and push until he punches in

1026
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,760
and then when he is in

1027
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,380
you are his

1028
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,340
your DNA is about to be injected

1029
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,600
with the new viral spiral code

1030
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,000
of Bob Dobbs

1031
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,660
the spermaceti

1032
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,220
of the word sperm

1033
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,220
the seed code of Bob

1034
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,800
has entered your mind

1035
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,320
just now just now

1036
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,840
over the radio airwaves

1037
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,320
it wasn't what we were saying

1038
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,960
it was the hiss in between the words

1039
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,020
it is too late now for you to pack out

1040
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,620
the sickle will fall

1041
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,100
the sacrifice will be made

1042
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,120
and that stupid looking head

1043
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,420
will rise above the crease

1044
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,580
screaming where lies

1045
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,020
yes the head

1046
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,120
the stupid looking head

1047
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,060
floats higher and higher over the gulf green

1048
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,280
muttering and singing to itself

1049
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,200
dripping blood from a thousand wounds

1050
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,060
ever

1051
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,960
ever bleeding

1052
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,040
and ever flying higher over the gulf greens of earth

1053
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,360
the green green greens of earth

1054
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,840
and the gulf greens of the moon

1055
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,160
where a man can hit a golf ball

1056
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,800
or a decapitated golfer head for that matter

1057
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
five miles

1058
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,800
for a hole in one

1059
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,740
friends

1060
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,640
a hole in one

1061
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,400
just like your soul rattling around inside that gas canister of Bob's after

1062
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,940
he's gone

1063
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,600
got your

1064
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,500
whiff read your signature off that thirty dollar check

1065
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,700
what I've always dreamed of

1066
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,360
ah yeah friends

1067
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,760
it's what I've always dreamed

1068
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,960
it feels so good good good

1069
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,880
when you just let go

1070
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,200
and let it all just ooze out

1071
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,240
like a forced evacuation

1072
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,720
onto that check

1073
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,140
just let that signature

1074
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,460
ooze out

1075
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,280
right out onto that

1076
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,920
smooth

1077
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,380
unbesmirched check

1078
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,680
splashing onto the check

1079
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,400
oh you're so good with a riot

1080
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,180
that signature

1081
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,560
and Bob whiffs that signature

1082
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,840
he swishes it around

1083
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,000
in his mouth

1084
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,420
gets a good taste of it

1085
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,420
and then

1086
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,260
that is when he has

1087
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,540
it's not your money that he cares about friends

1088
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,120
it's that one thing

1089
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,440
that he wants to whiff off of your soul

1090
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,440
he wants to know the real you

1091
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,460
the you that you cannot know

1092
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,060
because you are inside and he is outside

1093
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,600
punching his way in

1094
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,460
ooh

1095
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,160
ah

1096
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,380
oh

1097
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,440
ooh

1098
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,800
I say Bob

1099
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,700
oh

1100
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,440
I say Bob

1101
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,040
oh you're so rough

1102
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,160
oh Bob

1103
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,300

00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,500
