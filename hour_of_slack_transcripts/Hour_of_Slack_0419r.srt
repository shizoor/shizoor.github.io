1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
And we'll walk the streets of Lickersby.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:19,980
It's K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,600
Wait, did I say 90.9?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,660
It's 89.3, friends.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,500
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,720
You're going to have to forgive us.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,440
And we'll explain why in just a second here.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,200
Did you see any experiments?

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,500
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,740
Those doctors, they like to hurt people.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:11,680
They're part of God and should be tried more often than they are.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,580
I believe in the man in the sky.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,300
The man in the sky.

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,040
I believe with his head.

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,700
I believe in the man in the sky.

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:27,700


18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,660
He's not walking.

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,220
Oh, yes, it's so true, friends.

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,720
Even Elvis, even the dead Elvis believes in that man in the sky, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,000
And, friends, you're listening to the radio ministry of the Church of the Subgenius,

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,860
the Hour of Slack, with your host, Reverend Ivan Stang, and...

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,540
The Will of Dobbs.

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,700
And you're going to have to...

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,580
You're going to have to forgive us our trespasses tonight.

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,640
We just got back about three hours ago from New Orleans,

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,300
where we and the Doctors for Bob, the complete Doctors for Bob,

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,040
and Pope David N. Meyer II...

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,620
And Cat.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,560
Don't forget Cat.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,540
Yes.

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,360
I won't.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,060
Under the...

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,960
We had too good of a time.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,480
We did a big revival at the World Science Fiction Convention down there in New Orleans,

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,300
and we...

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,600
It was a great show.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,160
We're going to play some of that.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,200
A lot of the best stuff has to be edited down very, very carefully.

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,220
Oh, yes.

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,180
The problem is that Will and I just had too good of a time.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,880
We haven't had much sleep.

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,560
No, it was an ecstatic weekend, if you know what I mean.

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,840
It really was, and...

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,320
We're not hung over or anything.

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,020
Oh, no.

47
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,380
We're clean-living boys, actually, as subgeniuses go.

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:56,660
Yeah.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm a bit...

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm apathetic right now, myself.

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,960
But I tell you, and on top of that, I got a bad case of terista from drinking the water,

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,860
so if you see...

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,340
If I suddenly have to disappear, it'll be Will's show.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,120
There was the water in those Cajun potato chips that you can only get in New Orleans, man.

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,260
They're great.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,460
But we...

57
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,640
You know, it was great walking around with a bunch of subgeniuses at a World Science Fiction Convention

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,860
feeling so superior to those bespectacled nerds.

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,240
Not that...

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
We don't look slightly the same way, but...

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,480
No, no, no.

62
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,720
But we talk a lot dirtier, you know?

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,240
And we did panel discussions and so forth that were...

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,260
Well, it had to do with face-raping bats and...

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,820
And their antidote puddings.

66
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,440
Yeah.

67
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,760
Yeah, you understand.

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,620
You've been there.

69
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:44,860
No.

70
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,020
Most of you, I hope.

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,900
If you don't, well, we're not...

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,160
Just look for those three little notches down in your neck.

73
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,080
You know.

74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,140
When the bones retract, if you know how to get the bones to retract...

75
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,560
Just tickle them just right.

76
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,280
This thing, we don't want you playing around.

77
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,640
Don't try these stunts at home, kids, until we've done the face-raping bat show,

78
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,720
which we're not prepared to do yet.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,780
Coming tapes to follow.

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,060
In the meantime...

82
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,340
Oh, and also, at the same time, U.S. News and World Report

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
started getting interested in the Church of the Subgenius.

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,440
They want to have a tape of this revival, too.

85
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,960
Did you read your Newsweeks this week, friends?

86
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,960
Well, anyway, we're going to go into that live revival.

87
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,360
This was the easiest one to dub in an hour for tonight

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,380
because it was Pope David N. Meyer II,

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,380
Pope of all New York, the Great Pacific Northwest, and Idaho,

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,880
BBS, DDS, PPP, PPOY, and so forth.

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,620
I never can remember his...

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,800
Yeah, I never can remember his full title, but...

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,540
This is he preaching...

94
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
No, that's not he.

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,820
Wait a minute.

96
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,600
I'm going to get he in there.

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,940
So, like I said, just forgive us.

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,480
We've been praising Bob until our heads like to pop.

99
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,200
So, here we go.

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,200
Now, children, let's talk about what makes you so genius, shall we?

101
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,120
But before we do, children, let's get down.

102
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Yeah!

103
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,300
Yeah!

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,100
Oh.

105
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,700
Oh.

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,560
Usually, children, the Pope of all New York preaches in a suit,

107
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,820
but he believes that Southerners know what a preacher looks like,

108
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,820
and I don't have to wear a costume to convince you that I can preach a word of God.

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,900
A subgenius, children, is obviously someone who follows Bob.

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,420
He's obviously someone who needs slack.

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,760
He or she is obviously someone who fights a conspiracy.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,840
But what else is a subgenius?

113
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,460
Well, I've been studying on this matter, children.

114
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
The first thing you can do is to...

115
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,840
The first thing you can say about a subgenius is that subgeniuses are shy egomaniacs, children.

116
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,940
The next thing I think you can safely say about subgeniuses,

117
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,520
and the Pope of all New York is a subgenius,

118
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,420
is that subgeniuses can dish it out, but they can't take it.

119
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
Children, you can be a subgenius in public,

120
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,980
and subgeniuses will be uniformly misanthropic, like this subgenius here.

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,260
Or they'll be uniformly withdrawn and apoclyphic, like this subgenius here.

122
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,340
They don't like their fellow man or woman, and they're extremely discriminating.

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,300
But at the same time, if you went to one of these subgeniuses and you said,

124
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,040
you're an a**hole,

125
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,340
well, that subgenius would go home and sob into his or her pillow.

126
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,940
His feelings would be so hurt.

127
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,720
Subgeniuses have very thin skin, children, and believe me,

128
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,480
the Pope of all New York knows where I speak.

129
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,800
There it is.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,540
There it is.

131
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,480
There is one place where we do not have thin-skinned children.

132
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:57,980
That's right.

133
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,480
There is one place where we have the skin of an armadillo,

134
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
on top of the skin of an alligator,

135
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,740
on top of the skin of a hippo,

136
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,200
on top of the skin of the elephant.

137
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,940
And do you know where that is, children?

138
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,200
That's when we confront the conspiracy.

139
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,940
When the conspiracy comes, children,

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,700
a subgenius is clad in that Bob armor.

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,280
Now, children, children, children,

142
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,220
a lot of people, they say to me, Dave,

143
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,340
they say to me, Rob, Dad,

144
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,460
Dave, Dave, Dave,

145
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,140
he's going to be Pope of all New York City, Dave.

146
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,940
All New York City, Dave.

147
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,440
What is the most efficient and direct method

148
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,000
by which I can confront the conspiracy on one hand

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,440
and become a true subgenius on the other?

150
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,920
Children, children, children,

151
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,600
the answer is deceptively simple.

152
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,380
The answer is in front of you, children.

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,760
The answer is as near as a P-dog or a crotch of Brentano's, children.

154
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,860
Of course, I'm talking about the Macabre, the subgenius!

157
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,400
I guarantee you, you will never read every word in it, children.

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,020
Now, children, I think you all know

159
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,940
what happens on July 5th, 1998.

160
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,860
I think you all know that that's the day the X-Men come down.

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,020
And you know, children, the X-Men,

162
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,840
they're businessmen.

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,060
They're simple businessmen, just like Bob is a businessman.

164
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,420
And all they want, children,

165
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,560
is real estate.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,620
They want real estate, children.

167
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,920
And they have a contract for the planet Earth, the X-Men.

168
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
And they have a means to repossess it.

169
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,620
Do you know who stands in their way?

170
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,860
Who?

171
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,180
Who?

172
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,560
Bob!

173
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,460
Do you know who stands in their way?

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,920
Who?

175
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,440
Who?

176
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,900
Say Bob, children.

177
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,500
Bob!

178
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,440
Who is it that stands in their way?

179
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:44,960
Bob!

180
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,560
Who stands in their way?

181
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:46,980
Bob!

182
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,980
Who is it that stands in their way?

183
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,520
Bob!

184
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,000
But Bob only stands in their way with your health, children.

185
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,520
Bob only stands in their way...

186
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,520


187
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,080
when you tithe to Bob that which is Bob.

188
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,560
Bob only stands in their way when...

189
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,640
you buy the Macabre!

190
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,480
The So Genius!

191
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,620
$9.95!

192
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,500
You better get started, everyone!

193
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,120
Hold on!

194
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,780
You go to the table, where's my will-o-law?

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,960
I didn't buy t-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons, badges, and the new Arise video tape.

196
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,100
Video!

197
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,340
Now, children, a long time ago, when the Church of the So Genius began,

198
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,340
1998 seemed as far away as your day.

199
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,660
But now, children, it's only ten years hence.

200
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Ten years hence, children.

201
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,220
Ten little years.

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,220
And you may, those of you who like to read Nostradamus,

203
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,440
think that plagues are going to be visiting us in those ten years, children.

204
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,060
Drought, fire, war.

205
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,220
But children, the plagues of the next ten years will not be externally derived, children.

206
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,420
They will be internally derived.

207
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,680
They'll be the plague of sitting at home and watching your tape

208
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,180
when you should be making Bob art!

209
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,500
When you should be corresponding with others, and...

210
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:54,960
When you should be making Bob geniuses!

211
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,980
When you should be buying from Bob and tithing to the sacred P.O. box!

212
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,960
The conspiracy, children, wants to break us apart,

213
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,180
make us function as that all-important consumer unit individual,

214
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,960
and get rid of us.

215
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,940
But there's a man, children, a man with a pipe.

216
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,960
And he's waiting, children.

217
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,860
He's waiting to save you.

218
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,900
But it's up to you, children, to open your heart to Bob.

219
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,020
It's up to you, children, to let Bob come in.

220
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,440
It's up to you to see the value in Bob.

221
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,500
And now, children, in closing,

222
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,020
I'm gonna quote from the great subgenius saint, Lester Bayes.

223
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,700
I'm gonna read you something, children.

224
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,440
This was written upon Elvis' death, children.

225
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,460
So be patient with me and listen to this.

226
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,320
If love is truly going out of fashion forever,

227
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,940
then along with our nurtured indifference to each other

228
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,240
will be a more even contemptuous indifference to each other's objects of worship,

229
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,260
like Bob.

230
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,260
We will continue to fragment this matter

231
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,160
because solipsism holds all the cards at present.

232
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,800
It is a king whose domain engulfs even Elvis.

233
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,660
But I can guarantee you one thing, children.

234
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,420
We will never agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis.

235
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,160
But, children, the fact is

236
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,820
that just as this church has an infallible pope,

237
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
it has a fallible saint.

238
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
And in that regard, Lester Bayes was mistaken.

239
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Because there is one thing, one man, one entity

240
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,460
we will agree on as we agreed on Elvis.

241
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,760
And who is that man?

242
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,300
Bob!

243
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,460
Who is that man?

244
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,820
Bob!

245
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,740
Who is that man?

246
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,220
Bob!

247
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,080
Who is that man?

248
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:28,680
Bob!

249
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,580
Who is that man?

250
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,240
Bob!

251
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Who is that man?

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,360


253
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,800
So that man is Bob.

254
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,140
And Bob is there for you.

255
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,300
Bob loves you.

256
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,580
Bob needs you.

257
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
Bob wants to help you.

258
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,680
Bob wants to fight the conspiracies.

259
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,540
Bob wants to bring you glory.

260
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,120
Bob wants to grant you life.

261
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,860
That's right.

262
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,000
With the help of the Reverend Ivan Stam,

263
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,740
with the assistance of the Reverend John waking up,

264
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


265
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


266
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


267
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


268
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


269
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


270
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,740


271
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,360
With the help of Court Holland, I'm forward Court.

272
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,300
With the help of the Redwood Sternodocs,

273
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
you're gonna help me help the Cali Lodge Crescent City

274
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,420
first climbers, only for Bob Corral.

275
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,040
Sing about Bob.

276
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,700
Are you ready?

277
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,200
Are you ready?

278
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,300
Now children, you're gonna sing back

279
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,540
to the Pope of all New York.

280
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,460
Are you ready? Say yes.

281
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,800
Are you ready to take Bob into your heart?

282
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,940
Are you ready to take Bob into your mind?

283
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,080
Are you ready to take Bob into your watch?

284
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,340
All right children, here we go.

285
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,800
You ready?

286
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,000
There once was a man.

287
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,420
There once was a man.

288
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,760
A mighty salesman.

289
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,240
A mighty salesman.

290
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,680
And he had to find a way to get the

291
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
Once was a man.

292
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,420
Once was a man.

293
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
The world's greatest salesman.

294
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,020
The world's greatest salesman.

295
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,240
And he had to find a plan

296
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,500
to keep the shackles from all teeth.

297
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,920
I know.

298
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,420
I know.

299
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,300
I know.

300
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,980
He's gone.

301
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,580
A martyr on the coast.

302
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,420
Bob is my own.

303
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,000
And he's coming again.

304
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:10,020
Who knew that the first shot was gonna be the last shot.

305
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,940
But he's got a heart that's white.

306
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,400
The gas smoke all through the night.

307
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
There's no hope.

308
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
He made me hurt.

309
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,040
The universe is full of squirtin' Bob is my own.

310
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,680
And he's coming again.

311
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah.

312
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,320
Ho!

313
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,100
Oh!

314
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,420


315
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,460
Oh!

316
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,340
.

317
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:55,600
.

318
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,420
.

319
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm a man!

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
I'm a man.

321
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,300
He's coming.

322
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,260
I'm a man.

323
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,180
We're just a shot from his mighty side

324
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,920
If only he could make it sound

325
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,700
From the land of the dead

326
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,980
Father, till the happy day

327
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,600
We can only drink and say

328
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,460
Father, follow

329
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,380
And it's coming again

330
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,360
I know he can make it

331
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,340
Without him we can't take it

332
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,660
We'll lose the pieces of our hearts

333
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,220
To the big boys and the whims

334
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,840
Until the day that he goes back

335
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,440
It'll be a world with no slack

336
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,280
Father, follow

337
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,800
And it's coming again

338
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,220
Father, follow

339
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,400
Father, follow

340
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,620
Father, follow

341
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,220
Father, follow

342
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,020
And it's coming again

343
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,580
Coming again

344
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,400
We don't want the end to come

345
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,600
As we wait for it to be

346
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,980
Father, follow

347
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,940
Father, follow

348
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,360
Father, follow

349
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,040
Father, follow

350
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,440
And it's coming again

351
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
And it's coming again

352
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,660
And it's coming again

353
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,760
Again

354
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,200
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right.

355
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,880
That was actually Slackmaster Cleave and the Spurious Jive.

356
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,040
I could not play the rendition we tried to do live without Cleave.

357
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,400
And then Cleave never finished the song.

358
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,500
Dude, I'm crushed.

359
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,400
No, I would put Cleave on the Denis trabajar a completely different scale

360
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,580
and put Cleave on the Jersey태

361
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:06,580


362
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,380
That was the preaching that preceded that song was again,

363
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
Polt David N migrant.

364
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,740
Thank you very much.

365
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,860
And then.

366
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Thank you very much for watching.

367
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
Greetings, friends. Don't be afraid. Be very grateful. 144 00 firing której

368
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,520
such a bad time now.

369
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,180
It hurts, it hurts so good.

370
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,560
It did hurt, it did hurt good.

371
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,580
We just stayed up too late, that's all there is to it.

372
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,100
That's all.

373
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,660
But anyway, yeah, yeah, PSA, oh Bob is coming again,

374
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,860
I should mention.

375
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,820
Bob Wilson, Pope Bob, Robert Anton Wilson,

376
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,800
is coming back to, not to Dallas actually,

377
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,540
but to Denton on Friday, October 7th

378
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,660
at 8 o'clock p.m. and October 8th, Saturday,

379
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,440
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for a workshop.

380
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,300
This will be at the Aaron Horn School in Denton.

381
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,220
Also something called Creations by Trish

382
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,000
from 6 to 7.30 p.m. on Friday night.

383
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,400
Did I say 8 to 10 a.m. on Friday night?

384
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,500
I should have said, I don't know what I'm saying,

385
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,520
and you don't know.

386
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,560
I don't understand why I'm saying it,

387
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,720
but believe me, it's important somewhere.

388
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,920
When we get, get out your decoder rings, kids.

389
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,100
Have some happy.

390
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,220
So we're, yeah, yeah, right.

391
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,360
Next week we will play the unplayable parts of that revival

392
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,660
and they're a lot of fun.

393
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,600
You'll hear all the clicks and beeps

394
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,640
where I have to cut things out, but in the meantime,

395
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,960
here we go.

396
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,500
By age six, he had made his first, first, first, first, first,

397
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,120
million almost by accident.

398
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,960
In college, he met and married his first

399
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,160
and still his primary wife, Connie,

400
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,480
who is now revered by female subgeni

401
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,180
as the blessed anti-virgin.

402
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,140
With Connie's encouragement,

403
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,960
the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary

404
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,760
and almost frightening abilities,

405
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,000
known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

406
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,640
He worked his way up to the very top

407
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,020
of the conspiracy ladder and might have saved him.

408
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,040
But late one night in 1953,

409
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,980
while working on an amateur television of his own design,

410
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,200
an event occurred which was to become a milestone

411
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,020
in man's mind path to slack.

412
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,700
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit

413
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,020
by the hand of Jehovah One itself,

414
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,220
the cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament,

415
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,680
the wrathful alien space god

416
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,180
from some corporate sin galaxy.

417
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,240
In this timeless moment,

418
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,380
which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob,

419
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,100
Dobbs received the first of countless grain

420
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,180
curdling pronouncements which formed

421
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,020
the sacred prescriptures of the church.

422
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,360
He was shown a vision,

423
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,440
a world where all humanity was equally wealthy,

424
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,840
rich beyond imagining, but without working.

425
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,780
This experience combined with his UFO given sales magic

426
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,480
led him inevitably to the world of the human.

427
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,580
He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied

428
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,960
in his classic saying,

429
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,380
they'll pay to know what they really think.

430
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,000
The true sub genius can learn to think for himself,

431
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,400
but only Bob can show him how.

432
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,300
And so Bob Dobbs founded his church

433
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,940
upon a sandy beach of common sense,

434
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,080
sense of humor and dollars and cents.

435
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, I would say that Bob Dobbs

436
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,000


437
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,280
A likely story, you say.

438
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,860
But it's simple, really.

439
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,280
Bob is lucky, not smart.

440
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,480
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

441
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,180
he's gifted with incredible stupidity.

442
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,740
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

443
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,000
This enables him to act without thinking,

444
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,160
to effortlessly surf the luck plane,

445
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,520
to float down the fabled path of least resistance,

446
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,640
to, in fact, make a million dollars each time he screws up.

447
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,820
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies,

448
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,740
his holy blunders which we emulate.

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,800
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you,

450
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,800
but in what he allows you to do to yourself.

451
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,560
He brings the student to the realization that

452
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,340
everything you know is true.

453
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,580
Pull the wool over your own eyes, he admonishes,

454
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,500
and you may...

455
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,060
finally relax in the safety of your own delusions.

456
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,040
Votan, we've had this morning.

457
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,220
Let's go over that again.

458
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,980
You say this photograph was taken by one of our secret operatives.

459
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,020
It shows Ivan Stang in a rather compromising position.

460
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,280
I think you'll admit...

461
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,540
Yes, that's right. I think you will admit that...

462
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,180
Oops, wrong one.

463
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,460
Wait, let me see that one again.

464
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Yeah, this should be submitted for your approval.

465
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,360
Aha, yes, this is Reverend Ivan Stang

466
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,480
in a very compromising position with a goat...

467
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,940
In a very indiscreet position, wouldn't you say?

468
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,500
...wearing a...

469
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,560
a Ronald Reagan mask.

470
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,920
Not Mr. Stang.

471
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,040
Not Mr. Stang, but the goat.

472
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,020
And not his member.

473
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,640
I believe it's a calf, a bull calf.

474
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,120
But the goat.

475
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,260
It is a calf.

476
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,220
It's a calf, a golden calf,

477
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,280
wearing a Ronald Reagan mask.

478
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
There's Ivan Stang...

479
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,360
Now, you see something that is obviously illicit drugs

480
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,140
in a bull placed below the calf's mouth.

481
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,700
The female calf.

482
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,260
I'm shocked.

483
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,180
And there, Ivan Stang,

484
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,800
in an act of some type of degraded and depraved...

485
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,340
In an act of degraded...

486
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,720
...propitiation to some hideous god...

487
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,020
...being used as the captain of the...

488
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,780
...god, some elder god of ancient lore.

489
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,380
You heard it here first on the subgenius show.

490
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,180
Reams.

491
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,540
Yes, can I say it?

492
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,640
You can.

493
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,380
It's late enough.

494
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,980
That's what he's doing.

495
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,960
You can until six o'clock.

496
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,580
Viciously.

497
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,180
He's committing animal husbandry.

498
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
Animal husbandry without the husband.

499
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,740
Yes, or maybe on the husband, for all we know.

500
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,980
It's a disgusting sight,

501
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,000
and this is going to rip the church wide open,

502
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,680
just like the Swaggart revelations,

503
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,560
just like the...

504
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,260
Years ago.

505
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:23,940
...backers.

506
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,460
And baker.

507
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,720
When the churches were fun,

508
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,680
and there were scandals and revelations.

509
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,860
And the sun...

510
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,200
It was a different world then.

511
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,480
...and the clouds.

512
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,240
And the forests...

513
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,640
We enjoyed the show, and hope you do too.

514
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Fitting the show into the show hole,

515
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,300
scrubbing gently.

516
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,720
Millions of years ago,

517
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,160
giant reptiles...

518
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
You can't see me.

519
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,760
Ha, ha, ha.

520
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,980
He can't see me.

521
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,300
...as a show hole.

522
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,800
He, he.

523
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
As a show hole.

524
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,020
Does that show get a little higher?

525
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,080
Long as a collar.

526
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,220
Well, we'll find out.

527
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,960
Any way to crank that little show up there,

528
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,300
and make it, make it tall?

529
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,200
Make it big and strong.

530
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,080
Make it strong and tall, for what I believe.

531
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,940
Like you, little collar.

532
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,680
Well, no, this is me.

533
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,280
His tips are still growing.

534
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,200
Still?

535
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,220
Some tips, eh?

536
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,860
You've got some good tips on the show, eh?

537
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,720
Soon they will fill the road with shoulders.

538
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
About the only slack that I get anymore

539
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,980
is worshiping at the Holy Temple of Ioni.

540
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,240
And...

541
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,180
Ha, ha, ha.

542
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,280
Ha, ha, ha.

543
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,580
Ha, ha, ha.

544
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,120
Ha, ha, ha.

545
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,740
Ha, ha, ha.

546
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,000
Ha, ha, ha.

547
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,000


548
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,000


549
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,000


550
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,500
Oh, my.

551
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,000
For Bob, my friend,

552
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,020
Bob is a sex god.

553
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,060
Ain't a bigger abomination in the world

554
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,120
than women wearing men's clothes

555
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,900
and men wearing women's clothes

556
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,000
and people being sexy.

557
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,420
perverts. That's the two of the greatest sins in the world is idolatry, witchcraft, homosexuality,

558
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:12,700
and men and women wearing the clothes of the opposite sex. It's abomination. And whosoever

559
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,200
do it is abomination. And there's more people today. Their minds are perverted. Their life

560
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,860
is perverted. And they've been given over to a reprobate mind. So many people today,

561
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,960
even people that aren't homosexual, their minds are perverted. It's filled with filth

562
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,620
and it's filled with all the ungodliness and wickedness that comes from the pit of hell.

563
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,080
And you see it on television. You see it in the movie houses. And you see it on the market

564
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:39,940
stand.

565
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,780
Hey, and how about pornography? Shucks, all you have to do is look around you. Female

566
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,180
body parts are available just about anywhere. Or pick up some picture books with a free

567
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,100
orifice included.

568
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,720
Miracles of Engineering.

569
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,140
Yours for the plugging.

570
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,900
If you don't mind the smell of vinyl.

571
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,980
Now mama's on the bottom and papa's on the top. Baby's in the crib a-hollin', pour it

572
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,760
to her pop job.

573
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,960
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

574
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,240
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

575
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,440
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

576
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,640
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

577
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,800
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

578
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,840
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

579
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,640
Yes, my baby knows.

580
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Now sea is sea and land is land. Can't get my boogie, I can get it by hand.

581
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,220
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

582
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

583
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,780
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

584
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

585
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,840
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

586
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,000
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

587
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,800
Yes, my baby knows.

588
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
Bob, in fact, is sex.

589
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,640
An all-encompassing sex that is the very in-ness.

590
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,960
And surround-ing-ness of the union of both the imam and the uni.

591
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Get the hell off my back and stop adding to that bullshit.

592
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,460
3, 3, & 3, 3.

593
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,020
Tin Tстро Tootin'...

594
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,120
1, 2, 3, 4...

595
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,180
With Tisto...

596
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Head которая...

597
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,940
Storowa...

598
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,080
Storowa...

599
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,160
Storowa...

600
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,560
You got gold in your mouth

601
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,600
We ain't seen no gold since the priest left

602
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,720
You got silver on your wrist

603
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,880
We ain't seen no silver since the airplane crashed last year

604
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,800
You got blue shining skies

605
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,560
We got the sun in our eyes and we're going blind

606
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,920
We don't want your money

607
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,820
We want mine

608
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,500
You got shoes on your feet

609
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,800
We ain't seen no shoes since the soldiers came

610
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,800
You got gold in your mouth

611
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,600
And that ain't really funny

612
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,900
You got blue shining skies

613
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,560
We got the sun in our eyes and we're going blind

614
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,880
We don't want your money

615
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,660
We want mine

616
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,900
If we subscribe, we know we're wasting our time

617
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,560
If we appear, we know we're wasting our time

618
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,140
So if we ask you, baby, like we did before

619
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,540
We don't want your money

620
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:43,540


621
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,580
We want mine

622
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,740
Ooh, yeah, yeah

623
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,040
We don't want your money

624
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,360
We want mine

625
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:28,680
We want mine

626
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,820
We want mine

627
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:40,680
We got lies in your mouth

628
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,720
We're liars

629
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,440
We don't need no truth

630
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
Till the kids cry

631
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,920
You got smiles to your lips

632
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,940
Light up

633
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,540
We don't like your smile

634
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,840
You got blue shining skies

635
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,540
We got the sun in our eyes

636
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,480
And we're going blind

637
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,820
We don't want your money

638
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,960
We don't want your money

639
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,960
We don't want your money

640
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,740
We want mine

641
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,860
We want mine

642
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,300
Aah!

643
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,660
We want mine

644
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,200
Yeah!

645
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,080
We want our home

646
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,780
We want our home

647
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,560
Yeah.

648
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


649
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


650
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


651
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


652
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


653
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


654
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


655
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,400


656
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,960
So, don't you worry

657
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,100
We're mine

658
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,160
We're mine

659
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,040
We're mine

660
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,240
We're mine

661
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,420
We're mine

662
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,340
We're mine

663
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,000
We're mine

664
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,020
We're mine

665
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,340
We're mine

666
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,700
We're mine

667
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,400
We're mine

668
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,140
We're mine

669
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,420
We're mine

670
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,700
We're mine

671
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,880
We're mine

672
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,420
We're mine

673
00:38:43,440 --> 00:39:13,380
We're mine

674
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,760
We're mine

675
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,520
We're mine

676
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,560
We're mine

677
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,420
We're mine

678
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:43,420
We're mine

679
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:52,620
Joke! Joke! Joke! Joke! A lot of them can't. The nature of the Church of the Subgenius,

680
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,120
also text a little explaining, the nature of the Church of the Subgenius is that the

681
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:02,620
Church of the Subgenius will help you pull the wool over your own eyes. That's right,

682
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,100
children. Pull the wool. What do I mean by this, children? Well, ever since you were

683
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,880
a little bitty baby, ever since you were a little girl or a little boy, you've been sold

684
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,820
your family's wool, your church's wool, your school's wool, your government's wool, your

685
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:22,180
foster's wool. Delusion. And children, when you do, wait, wait, children, when you do,

686
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,360
in five minutes you'll be so bored, you'll do what Bob needs you to do, you'll start

687
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,600
thinking for yourself. That's right. And children, the nature of the Church of the Subgenius,

688
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,720
in this context, in this hall, in this convention, in this hotel, seems absurd, I grant

689
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,720
you, but it's a rule, children. Every great movement, every time mankind has tried to

690
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,760
go forward, there have been the pioneers who spearheaded that movement, children. Pioneers.

691
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,660
And they suffered, children, they suffered. And then behind them, children, like a vast

692
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,080
armada of slugs, have come those who were not smart enough to lead. No, no, they lacked

693
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,340
the brain, but they had a glimmer of intelligence and they could see that something like really

694
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,700
cool was going on here, man. It was like, it was like, it was like, it was like, it was

695
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,460
really cool. So, you know, I just joined up. I just joined up. I'm just a parasitic,

696
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:22,940
conspiracy, mind-dead dude. We don't need these people, children. We don't want them.

697
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:33,100
And that's why, in the Church of the Subgenius, we say, no hip whips! No what? No what? No

698
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,700
what? No what? No hip whips!

699
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,360
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is very simple and self-explanatory, children.

700
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:52,840
And that rule is, anybody you see driving a Porsche doesn't deserve it. You deserve it,

701
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,100
children. And you deserve it. And you deserve it. But, children, they don't deserve it.

702
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,680
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius also takes a little bit of explaining. And

703
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,540
I've been searching for an example, children, and I think I've found it. The Church of the

704
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,700
Subgenius knows, as you do not yet, that the Constitution of the United States is a law

705
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:27,820
of law. That's, you know, it's a law that you have to allow you to harm any person or

706
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:27,840
anyone in the world who transgresses your will. It's nothing but, it's a score-for-life

707
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:27,940
rule that you have to are a煎 winds. Sp vin up against each other. It's a crime that

708
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:27,940


709
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:34,460

711
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:34,960


712
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,700
Burng.

713
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,580
なるne.

714
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:46,620
killed me. Let me explain this joke. I was in a store. I was in a store one day. I was

715
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:54,900
purchasing a few objects, or as you say in New Orleans, objays. And I stacked my objays

716
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,720
by the cash register, and something caught my eye on the counter, and I went over to

717
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,700
look at it. Wasn't that interesting? I turned back, and some pink-wimped conspiracy mind

718
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:12,540
death dude had taken my line, my spotting line, at the cash register. Children, this

719
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:20,040
was not a minor event. This was the conspiracy incarnate. And I said to him, excuse me, but

720
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:28,240
I was here first. This was implied. Then, and he said to me, no, you weren't. I was

721
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,040
here first. You may mistake this for a meaningless confrontation, children, but it was the conspiracy

722
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,640
incarnate.

723
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,180
I was here first.

724
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:34,680
And that's why I was here.

725
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,600
I turned to that man, and I said, I was here first, or kill me!

726
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,480
The next row of the Church of the Subgenius is an intro into the next part of this section

727
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,160
of my preaching, where I'm going to tell you what a subgenius is and what makes a subgenius.

728
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,580
One thing you can always say about subgeniuses is that they pick fields where it takes your

729
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,680
entire life to find them.

730
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,640
And so I want you to praying pray, Done, and listen up.

731
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:07,640


732
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,880
Children, subgenices are artists, they are writers, they're musicians. They labor in

733
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,660
obscurity, children. They work hard. They work alone. Children, they work alone.

734
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,860
And this is key, children, because the conspiracy wants you to believe that if you are a creative

735
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,960
person, you have to be out there alone. Shut off from the world. In touch with your muse.

736
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,660
Because the conspiracy wants you to believe that you cannot unite people.

737
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:34,660


738
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:34,660


739
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,560
children but even the people who have to be alone to work need a community children a collaborative

740
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:47,280
network and that's why in the church of the subgenius we say individuals get lonely too

741
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,900
but i'm going to tell you that may shock some of you but it's the truth you gave your word that

742
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:01,340
you were going to send knom that love offering when you made your pledge but some of you ain't

743
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:08,060
done it yet open your heart close your mind unzip your lips and bend over to pull out that wallet

744
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,560
but i'll meet any of you pink punks with your 20 that you haven't sent in

745
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,700
you bookworms in any dark alley for a match with your choice of weapons

746
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:28,500
dear friends we need that money i believe that you know how little money this station has to run on

747
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,740
i know because i've seen it

748
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,200
i

749
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,320
i

750
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:39,020
I've been in the temple i i i took the thing that bob made me drink and i saw i saw you in the spirit

751
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:45,200
in the vision i saw it coming and your check coming in the mail oh yes then you don't have

752
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,380
to think about it anymore then you won't feel the guilt the annoying and tickling incessant

753
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:57,460
horror that eats away at your guts every time you listen to mail that money in now if you want

754
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,320
that's k-n-o-n box 710909

755
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,440
dallas 75371 and i'll be right here

756
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:04,780
today

757
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:13,040
oh this is timothy larry reminding you that just as you need slack k-n-o-n needs your help

758
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,520
send in those pledges and praise bob i believe you can make this world a better place to live in

759
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,960
people really don't listen without pain do they they must be bad people

760
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,980
see the problem with the believers is they think we're loaded already

761
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,300
you're not going to be able to make it to the top of the world

762
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,080
and we are but we don't have any money so few are ready to put their beliefs on the line

763
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:43,860
the line where you sign your name on that check oh i don't i just as soon get k-n-o-n for free

764
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:50,980
i don't have a spare ten dollars because i'm going to spend it on cigarettes and liquor or even worse

765
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:57,960
by pretending to be a subgenius and pledging but never even actually sending the check

766
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,720
huh

767
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:11,040
get on the stick man promising ain't enough faith is not enough but your paid up pledge is enough

768
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:19,020
so reach down deep into that most sacred organ of your body your wallet so send that financial

769
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:29,160
blessing to k-n-o-n p.o box 710909 in mighty dallas texas

770
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,240
753

771
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,020
371

772
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,940
and let there be slack

773
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:49,760
oh yes friends and this is uh coming up here is an old old lenny bruce tape uh from the lenny bruce

774
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:56,440

775
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,160
great lenny bruce but he really did die for our sins and more than

776
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:01,700
one wire

777
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,560
change okay i weigh 150 pounds today this is correct

778
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,840
good taste today but 20 years ago i was in the back of the magazine on the beach

779
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:21,960
i was kicking sand in my face yeah yeah i can that was it this 20 is forgetting why don't you put

780
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,540

781
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,260

782
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,280
concentration fuck right there dude now stop it stop it man stop it

783
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,200
He's had it.

784
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,300
But he may come back.

785
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,860
Of course he will.

786
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,880
I'm a definite conformist.

787
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,900
Yeah, otherwise I would have thrown that tie away with a horse on it.

788
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,180
Why'd I throw it away, man?

789
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,540
Still good.

790
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,560
Because I was out of step.

791
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,300
Had to throw it away, man.

792
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
Those kind of schlubs say,

793
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,520
I'm not going to be your slave to fashion.

794
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,560
You sure will, man.

795
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,180
You'll hold on to that brown and white shoe seen with the double-breasted suit.

796
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,120
And when that single breast came in in 1950,

797
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,240
you know, I'm going to wear the one-button roll.

798
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm not going to...

799
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,820
I got five suits and Buddy Lee's and that's all I'm going to wear.

800
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,360
I'm not going to change.

801
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,720
And yeah, all of a sudden you're ridiculous with that suit.

802
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,220
When it gets to bonds, you've had it.

803
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,460
When Ripley starts to cook with it, then it's for following.

804
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,340
And anyone is definitely rationalizing and says,

805
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,760
all beauty is either beholder.

806
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,160
Not so.

807
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,480
You have, from motion picture, been brainwashed.

808
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:25,980
I've been.

809
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,700
I assume you've been.

810
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,960
A certain...

811
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,000
Interesting face you'll buy.

812
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,940
And any chick who comes out with an ear growing out here,

813
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,680
you're not going to tell me she's beautiful, man.

814
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,460
Interesting face, yeah.

815
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,540
But as far as being horny looking, forget it then.

816
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:41,940
No.

817
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,140
Conversation piece.

818
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,040
Can do jokes with her.

819
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,140
Have headaches.

820
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,720
I'm deaf now.

821
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,020
Okay.

822
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,800
But as far as really being...

823
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,860
So I figure, what could you do to get a good composite?

824
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,900
What is beauty to you?

825
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,440
To build a girl singer.

826
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,580
A chick that would come out the most jaded column

827
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,320
off a guild from the New York Times.

828
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,040
Anyway.

829
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,520
Alex Freeman from the Enquirer.

830
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,880
How was your week?

831
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,380
What's with it?

832
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,520
And they've seen everything.

833
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,420
Dick Chapp, Newsweek.

834
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,820
Now a chick comes out that makes you all go,

835
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,200
look at that.

836
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,240
What could you do?

837
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,000
A gown, they've done.

838
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,360
Hairstyle, they've done.

839
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,200
Voice, they've done.

840
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,420
What kind of a chick?

841
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,380
Any kind.

842
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,300
Even the Grey Line tours,

843
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,100
the chicks were all dressed up with a high-necked,

844
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,440
and a broken-out backs, man.

845
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,920
Chicks who come out who have those wrist corsages.

846
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,120
Yeah, the dial is gone, man.

847
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,740
That's when you know you're really rich, boy,

848
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,540
when you can throw away that red velvet box

849
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,400
that the Longine Wittenauer comes in, yeah.

850
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,180
Just throw it away, man.

851
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,300
Because cufflinks and collistays are out,

852
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:49,900
so what's it gonna do?

853
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,060
You can sleep in the button basket.

854
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:51,860
Yeah.

855
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
What would I do

856
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,740
that would really make you all look up?

857
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,540
Chick comes out,

858
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,400
and a gimmick,

859
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,860
hair under her arms.

860
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,400
Think about it.

861
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,260
Hair under her arms, man.

862
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,420
But you don't give it away right away.

863
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,280
No.

864
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,080
There's a couple of ballads.

865
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,660
Guess who I saw today, my dear?

866
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,600
Grabbing their eating.

867
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,960
Mama, Freddie!

868
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:24,800
What?

869
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,840
Did you see?

870
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,520
Did you see?

871
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:28,520


872
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:28,520


873
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,300
Uh...

874
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,520
I don't know.

875
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,380
Uh, the lights, I think, in here.

876
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:34,880
Oh, no.

877
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,600
Now she really got this guy pinned.

878
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,780
So the owner sees,

879
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,240
look at that.

880
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:39,980
Look who's looking.

881
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,820
He never looks at anything.

882
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,060
Pops Whitaker's really pinned.

883
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,840
He's really looking now, right?

884
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,160
But now he's waiting for the flash again,

885
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,460
but no.

886
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,320
A couple of ballads and walks.

887
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,300
Now all the columnists start talking to her.

888
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,880
But they talk to her this way.

889
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,680
Gee, you're very good.

890
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,760
And they try real trick ways.

891
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:57,980
He's like,

892
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,880
where's the dressing room?

893
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,380
It's over there.

894
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,360
Uh, um...

895
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,200
And the owner,

896
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,780
what's with it?

897
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,600
They're always after her.

898
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,660
And they're talking to her.

899
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,880
Their heads are always like this.

900
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,240
Now they come back every night.

901
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,780
She does it once or twice a week.

902
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,740
I think, like, um...

903
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,440
Cut your arms over.

904
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:12,860
There it is.

905
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,360
There's what?

906
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,940
That chick's got hair under her arms.

907
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,380
Ah, you're out of your mind, man.

908
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,820
That's disgusting.

909
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,600
It's a terrible taste.

910
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,240
Well, I thought that

911
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,740
the first time I thought I saw it.

912
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,620
And I went home and I just, uh...

913
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,520
I've been back here six times this weekend.

914
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,520
You don't know what a release it was

915
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,640
to see her do that, man.

916
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,220
I just never thought she'd do it again there.

917
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,000
But she's really got a bush under there, man.

918
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,680
It's kind of...

919
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,560
Now, when I first went home, I said,

920
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,960
that, I can't believe that a contemporary woman

921
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,820
is disgusting.

922
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,100
It's a horrendous taste.

923
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,480
But then I started to think.

924
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,380
Is it in bad taste from a theological concept?

925
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Is it blasphemous?

926
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,840
Is it against...

927
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,000
Is it against God?

928
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:58,560
No.

929
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,320
Is it hygiene?

930
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,320
Certainly not.

931
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,180
No, it doesn't relate to hygiene at all.

932
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,120
If it related to hygiene,

933
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,620
then you would have to be consistent

934
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,820
and shave the eyebrows, the head,

935
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,720
the schmushky, the whole bit.

936
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,660
So it does not relate to hygiene at all.

937
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,300
What does it relate to?

938
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,000
Style.

939
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,540
That's all custom.

940
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,140
Style.

941
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:17,800
Fashionable.

942
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,220
That's all.

943
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,720
It only relates to fashion.

944
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,100
That's all.

945
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,400
Has no other...

946
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,560
That's the validity in a fashion.

947
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:23,740
All right.

948
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,780
Now, but to have the chick come out

949
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,720
with just hair under her arms,

950
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,900
the viewer would not buy it

951
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,440
because they would say,

952
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,260
anybody can do that.

953
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,540
It has to be a wish I could.

954
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,180
Maybe I...

955
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,100
But this is what you can do.

956
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,300
So you have to give it some style.

957
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,080
Cut it a little.

958
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,280
Close.

959
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,160
Keep it low in the back.

960
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,300
And give it some form.

961
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,840
Maybe shave it.

962
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,420
Give it like a pyramid.

963
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,860
Like that.

964
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,740
Some chickens,

965
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,200
I think I go,

966
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,560
hey, there's a chicken with hair under her arms.

967
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,540
Yeah, but it's different.

968
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,180
It's...

969
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,180
She takes care of herself.

970
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:54,780
Yeah.

971
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:54,840
That's it.

972
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,560
Yep.

973
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,020
Yep.

974
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:57,720
It's different.

975
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,240
Probably can't let him get to the punchline on that one.

976
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,620
I'm afraid.

977
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,820
Because I don't know where it comes up.

978
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,620
And we have to leave

979
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,960
because Robert Wisdom's American Music Party

980
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,860
is about to start up.

981
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,920
In fact, we're getting off late here.

982
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,000
Can't believe he's not breathing down my neck.

983
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,320
Stay tuned for Slack

984
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,800
in the form of American Music Party.

985
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,040
You are listening to...

986
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,240

987

1005
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,900
And this is an instrumental show, I think number 25 or so, somewhere around there.

1006
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,640
Anyway, tonight's gonna be mostly a tribute to Roy Buchanan playing a whole

1007
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,840
bunch of instrumentals by Roy Buchanan, the late guitar player.
