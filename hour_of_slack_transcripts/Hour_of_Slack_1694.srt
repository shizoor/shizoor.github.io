1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
And now, a power well calculated to keep you in

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,100
SWAT

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,620
In a moment, the subgenius of

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,740
Sit still. Sit still or I'll have to shoot you.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,820
Starring cigarettes, and written especially by cigarettes, and brought to you by cigarettes.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,220
Rob

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,220
You're so small

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,200
And I'm so in there

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,540
You

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,640
I know you can't stand the taste of what you like to drink

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,700
The pain of a kiss

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,780
Please stop

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,160
I know that there is a taste of what you like to drink

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,960
And I've heard it all

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,640
I know that that drink that it is a lie

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,500
You can't have it

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,320
Please stop

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,840
You can't have it

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,020
You can't have it

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,200
You can't have it

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Yeah

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


27
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:02,880


30
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,000
You can't have it

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,360
Yes

32
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,120
When these

33
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,720
Our

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,940

Our

00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,580
Our

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,580


45
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,580
Fatal masochism

46
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:21,860
Our

47
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,260

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,880


50
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,880


51
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,880


52
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:22,880


53
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,860
cure

54
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes

55
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,680
Yes

56
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
Use the Force

57
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,900
Use the Force

58
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,200
Use the Force

59
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


60
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


61
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,100
Systematic. Great.

62
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,940
Rob.

63
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,720
Force.

64
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,920
Systematic. Great.

65
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,800
Job.

66
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,100
It's just too taboo to talk pleasure in this arena.

67
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,100
Slag.

68
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,340
Slag.

69
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
Slag.

70
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,740
Slag.

71
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,520
Please stop.

72
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,900
Can I try?

73
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,840
Come on.

74
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,340
Come on.

75
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,240
Come on.

76
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,940
Come on.

77
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,420
Come on.

78
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,540
Come on.

79
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,820
Let's go.

80
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Come on.

81
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,360
Come on.

82
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,600
Come on, Bohamqu.

83
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,840
To my head.

84
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,300
정도

85
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,780
정도

86
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,520
Right.

87
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,160


88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,420
It's OK.

89
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
Subgenus

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,860

00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,420
Sex

93
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,320
Oh, come on, got it

94
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,460
Pop

95
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,580

Pop

97
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh, come on, got it

98
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,620
Oh, yeah

99
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,660
Oh, yeah

100
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,780
Oh, yeah

101
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,060
Oh, yeah

102
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,420
Oh, yeah

103
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,580
Oh, yeah

104
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,180
Hey, praise Bob!

105
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,140
Thanks to Cool Hand Crisp

106
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,540
And now, this

107
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,900
From PR News in Washington

108
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm continuing sexual treatment

109
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,100
For an aggressive 55-year-old woman

110
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,700
Unable to cum in Brussels

111
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,760
Today, the Trump says

112
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,660
Senator John McCain and

113
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,420
Attorney General

114
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,640
John McCain

115
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:45,640


116
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,340
And Jeff Sessions

117
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,520
Will fleet their country

118
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,200
Saying, quote

119
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
Russian collusion, quote

120
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,140
The Irish Prime Minister says

121
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
I think

122
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,080
But not

123
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,380
He says he's glad

124
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,580
This is PR News

125
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,160
I do

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,040
a lot of life

127
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,420
I'm ready to

128
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,660
Don't I

129
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,340
I'll take

130
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,680
What I didn't

131
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,960
Want

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


137
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


138
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


139
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,960


140
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,380
On the

141
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,380


142
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,720
It, so

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,860
It's the key change

144
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,480
It happens all the time

145
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,460
I hope you enjoyed this video.

146
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:44,680
Thank you for watching.

147
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,380
Make a real good sandwich, bottle of beer.

148
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,960
Yeah.

149
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,560
Head cheese and bologna on garlic bread, little mayonnaise, horseradish, mustard.

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,000
How's that sound to you, Joe?

151
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,840
By the Rudy Schwartz Project from the new album Postal Code for Ham.

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,740
Look it up.

153
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,760
I tend to wear diapers sometimes because of daddy.

154
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,400
Fledged.

155
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,600
Fledged.

156
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,160
And his problem with drinking liquor on Tuesday, you know.

157
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,740
Is he still doing that?

158
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,620
Because I'm not.

159
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,220
I had to quit.

160
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,360
I was referring to you, but he, our other friend, he is definitely still doing that.

161
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,560
And I tried to stop him, too.

162
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,280
And he threw me out of his house.

163
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,860
He said, get the hell out and don't come back.

164
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,500
So, man, you just invited me over for some pizza and some frappin' and some beer and stuff.

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,620
Next thing you know, I made one small comment.

166
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Maybe the size of a pinhead on a needle or something.

167
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,440
Now there's enough to send him flying into inner tube langsoria.

168
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,160
How dare you come over here and tell me you don't want to watch me kill myself.

169
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,540
I invited you over here to watch me drink myself to death.

170
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,920
And you're just taking it lightly.

171
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,120
Yeah, and then the next thing you know, we're talking about Irish Revolution going back to day one.

172
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,620
You know.

173
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,800
And he's suddenly, he's an academic.

174
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,120
He knows all about all that stuff the rest of his life.

175
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,000
He doesn't know the singlest thing about anything.

176
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,540
Except for Kibosh.

177
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,620
He does like Kibosh.

178
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,040
That's a foreign sounding name, but.

179
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,660
My very best friend turned into my very worst friend and died young.

180
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,880
He never got to see any of these great new superhero movies that have come out.

181
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,280
Actually, he probably wouldn't have liked them.

182
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,760
Anyway.

183
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,600
Yeah.

184
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,100
He's hanging on.

185
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,460
There's too much diversity.

186
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Actually, that was his one of his many problems.

187
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,160
Oh, well, well, let's not talk about the dead.

188
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,820
Although there sure are plenty that I could talk about.

189
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,960
God, we've lost a lot of friends in the last year or two.

190
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,440
Yeah, definitely.

191
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,700
And they're not here around us.

192
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,640
Well, necessarily loud enough to be able to make say, Hey, shut the beep up.

193
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,340
You know, like when we say things, we can even make up things.

194
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,740
I mean, I don't know what else to say about people that aren't that either enlarge their

195
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,860
fame or diminish it.

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:28,340
A long time ago, Dave, it was actually after our friend Chaz died and we kind of regretted

197
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,020
not trying to take better care of him or something.

198
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,680
Pay more attention.

199
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,720
He wouldn't say he never said what was wrong.

200
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,560
He never would.

201
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,360
He never said that he had a chronic debilitating hopeless disease.

202
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,780
But he never knew that that.

203
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,240
But we you said afterwards, you said we should we should try to treat our friends like they're

204
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,000
already dead.

205
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,520
Well, I heard that from a very from psychopath finder.

206
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,980
Oh, but but he doesn't believe that anymore.

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,540
He's the opposite of his pronouncements.

208
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,300
He like doesn't show up a lot of times at many calling hours and stuff like that.

209
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,200
He refuses to refund my laundry tickets.

210
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,700
And I won't like last week I had $300 put in some kind of false fund in Argentina or

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:21,960
someplace.

212
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,620
Well, at least you have subgeniuses to talk to.

213
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,940
I'm most of the time.

214
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,380
I mean, I if I actually do have have several subgenius friends that live not far from this

215
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,120
little tiny town and I got all my relatives around me.

216
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,680
But but, you know, I'm most of the time I'm in this.

217
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,220
It's not.

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,620
It's not a big old empty house.

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
It's a medium sized house, but with one big, huge empty room.

220
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,620
It's like the living room and dining room and everything is all one piece and the upstairs

221
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,100
is all just a giant hollow room.

222
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,700
And I turn into my dad.

223
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm all by myself here with these two dogs because Princess Wee has to stay in Ohio.

224
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,040
She's taking care of her old ma and other things.

225
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,460
And I have to be here.

226
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,560
I have to be here to take care of things here.

227
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,320
And so I found myself talking to the dogs, Dave.

228
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,020
I mean, having long conversations.

229
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,940
So it begins now.

230
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,800
Now you understand where I was feeling a little strange a few years ago with my dog.

231
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,100
Yeah, yeah, I do.

232
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,020
I was I often think about you because, yeah, I haven't my wife hadn't been around.

233
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,160
I'm used to being spoiled.

234
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,740
And baby.

235
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,560
And I have to do everything for myself now.

236
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,060
And and and I even have to to to tell my wife's cracks to somebody.

237
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,940
And it's just the dogs get to hear me talk a lot.

238
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,380
But they look at me as if they don't understand a word I'm saying.

239
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,080
They don't really mind me doing it.

240
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,820
But, you know, it's it beats talking to myself because probably the dogs are better listeners.

241
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,560
They are.

242
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,780
And they probably understand.

243
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Not as much.

244
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
They probably understand as little as you think.

245
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,240
They probably understand a great deal more than many of us.

246
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,020
I hope not.

247
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,800
I hope not.

248
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,620
Because my dog, I could finally ask my dog questions.

249
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,280
I could say, where's so and so?

250
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,520
I went if I would lose something, I would say, where's so and so?

251
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,480
And he would point it where it was.

252
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,560
I wish I were.

253
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,260
We go over to where it was point like dog style with his nose.

254
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,620
I asked them.

255
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,780
I do ask them.

256
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,280
I try to get them to find lost objects for me.

257
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,940
But if it's not a furry little varmint, they're just they don't just give me a blank look.

258
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,580
Today.

259
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,080
Okay.

260
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,140
I took him to the city park because we had a brief respite from the rain and it was cool

261
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,580
outside.

262
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,120
And we went to the park.

263
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,280
I figured they might meet some other dogs.

264
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,200
Well, there was a bunch of people there doing elaborate remote control miniature trucks.

265
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,040
They're like monster trucks about a foot and a half long.

266
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,240
And they're run by remote control.

267
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:28,500
And out this park has these big smooth lumpy rocks that are perfect for these these little baby monster trucks to go, you know, rumbling up steep slopes and stuff.

268
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,280
It's really fun.

269
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,100
Plus, they they fall over and nobody gets hurt because they're just robots.

270
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,960
Well, anyway, the dog song from a distance and went nuts went completely.

271
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
I've never seen him so desperate to get their teeth around the neck of something.

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,840
In this case, it's a little plastic and metal thing, you know, it's a little motorized thing.

273
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:59,900
And these the good old boys that were running these things were really tickled to watch the dogs frantic.

274
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,400
So both hunting dogs, they don't never get to really hunt.

275
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,360
And they were going to whatever these aliens were, they were going to tear them to pieces.

276
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,440
Almost broke my neck having to hold on to them.

277
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:28,580
I want to carry three 7 ins lady.

278
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,540
Yeah.

279
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,140
And hopefully you like that.

280
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,160
Solungen is watching this.

281
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,260
Now, these are the ins and chicleteers and they are sometimes they zoom in and get stuck in there and fall off the edge and all of a sudden make this.

282
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,760
No put it on where somebody else is going to.

283
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,140
Just, just escaped out of the food from the catch.

284
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,060
Check.

285
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,500
OK, I thought.

286
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,100
Okay, wait a minute.

287
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,200
So you're going to.

288
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,900
I'll get the wrong result, if you know what I mean.

289
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,680
And then that's a whole 20-minute cleanup job.

290
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:58,020
Anyway, the rednecks, the redneck miniature monster truck hobbyist allowed his house.

291
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,800
Okay, if I let the dog sniff him.

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,060
And so I just, like Hercules holding on to oxen, I managed it.

293
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,800
Once they smelled it and realized it was just a robot, they totally lost interest immediately.

294
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,980
And thought we were all idiots to waste our time with them.

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,100
And, you know, went off looking for something to roll in.

296
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,000
Something really stinky.

297
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,100
Dead.

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,280
They didn't find it.

299
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,460
Actually, they did, but I'm pretty sharp-eyed about that.

300
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,280
I can catch them usually before they throw that shoulder down on the ground suddenly.

301
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,540
They have little tails, you know, they're little.

302
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,980
We're getting to know each other better.

303
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,920
It's harder dealing with two.

304
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,480
It really is.

305
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,920
It's not nearly as much fun.

306
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,640
I need my wife.

307
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,860
You should see these instructions I got from Reverend Stang.

308
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,800
They're so awesome.

309
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,500
Written out in minute detail.

310
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:55,960
Maybe I should.

311
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,720
I'll just read them.

312
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,460
Sure.

313
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,520
They're probably more entertaining than anything we have to say.

314
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,460
Instructions for Tarzan's radio station.

315
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,220
I can't.

316
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,800
Wait for this.

317
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,900
In the box is a lot of stuff.

318
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,500
And it looks confusing.

319
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,120
Because there are lots of extraneous, miscellaneous cords and connections.

320
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,360
Just in case they're needed.

321
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,840
Mostly in a clear plastic Ziploc bag.

322
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,080
And a little blue cardboard box.

323
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,800
Also an HDMI cable for videos if needed.

324
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,140
These can be left in the box.

325
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,040
I think it's supposed to be Hidme.

326
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,500
Hidme?

327
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,160
Hidme, yeah.

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,100
Hidme.

329
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,840
Yeah, Hidme.

330
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,120
Hidme cable.

331
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,120
Hidme again.

332
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,720
Yes.

333
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,060
Three main, the main components.

334
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,500
Three mics and two stands.

335
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,300
Use a Wisteria mic stand for mic three.

336
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,060
So guess which one is mic three?

337
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,660
I can't tell as long as the music is overwhelming the...

338
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,520
I did that.

339
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,720
And why did you do that?

340
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,300
And turned up a swelling...

341
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,940
He asked me if he'd made me.

342
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
You know, I had to follow these instructions.

343
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,900
I did.

344
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,340
Yeah, but nobody's going to hear the instructions.

345
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,560
Thanks to Craig Mitchell.

346
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,080
Craig Mitchell helped me last night.

347
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,620
Potter Nostril?

348
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah.

349
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,980
Well, Potter Nostril.

350
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,380
He's somewhere around here.

351
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,640
I don't know any Craig Mitchells.

352
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,300
I don't either.

353
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,760
I don't know what made me say that.

354
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,080
I was suddenly lost my mind for a minute.

355
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,520
Boy, here it is.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay, I'm all right now.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,180
Is that from Mitchell's ice cream?

358
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,280
The nostrils have gone twice.

359
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,180
Oh, they're buying pancake supplies.

360
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,520
That's a good, good mission.

361
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,200
Well, Reverend Lucy and I brought some pancake supplies.

362
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,180
You got pancakes?

363
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,040
Yeah, we do.

364
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:43,320
You know, pancakes is the form of currency in several ancient countries.

365
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,020
Like ancient countries now?

366
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,640
Civilizations.

367
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,940
They weren't really countries.

368
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,740
They were more like civilizations.

369
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,760
City-states.

370
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,360
You could trade in them.

371
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,940
You know, they were like you could count them out, make them consistent.

372
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,340
In a sea of barbarism.

373
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,620
If you had salt pancakes, that'd be even better.

374
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,780
The polis of Athens.

375
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Salt pancakes were one of the best.

376
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,840
Oh, yeah.

377
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,120
Well, because you have salt.

378
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,300
Which you can use as currency.

379
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,720
And lick.

380
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,860
Yeah.

381
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,680
Or gold pancakes.

382
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,740
Or you can use salt to pay the Roman army.

383
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,540
Celerium, they called it.

384
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,820
Nowadays, we use sugar, dough, and grease.

385
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,660
For doughnuts.

386
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,460
You say there's some more of those left over?

387
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,700
Hot damn.

388
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,800
Hey, uh, Bert!

389
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,420
Old mixer with separate power supply cord.

390
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:33,640
A very long mess of two long cords which together stretch from the mixer output to the sound booth.

391
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,120
The flaming sword that cuts the fiery cords.

392
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,280
Input at Caffeina's.

393
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,860
Okay, listen.

394
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,420
See, that was the one that we hijacked a minute ago and ripped apart.

395
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:40,800
The flaming sword that cuts the fiery cords.

396
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,580
It's very possible.

397
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,860
I think you should...

398
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,540
So you're gonna have to put those back together, I think.

399
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,600
Yeah, I don't remember any of that.

400
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,120
You were the one that did it, so I mean, you're gonna have to...

401
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,000
A weight of cords.

402
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,180
It's all in your body memory.

403
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,260
You have to remember your body remembers that.

404
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,080
Think about it.

405
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,440
Too much you can't have done.

406
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,640
You gotta do it on the subconscious level.

407
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,740
Put the cords in your hands and then just let your hands remember.

408
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,880
Huh?

409
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,940
The memory in your fingers.

410
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,120
Yeah, I know which one this is.

411
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,900
The memory in your fingers.

412
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,160
The memory in your fingers.

413
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,740
Wow.

414
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,360
What now?

415
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,000
For that four-way headphone jack, which otherwise isn't loud enough.

416
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,640
Wow, look.

417
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,580
We got the burgers and the slaw right here.

418
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,620
And you got the donuts.

419
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,940
You see, you just talk about them.

420
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,220
Wow.

421
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,660
There's a donut?

422
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,300
There are.

423
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,760
Look at this.

424
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,660
See, that's what it's all about.

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,840
Look at the outlandish donuts they give you around here, Philo.

426
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,080
I'm gonna eat my greens.

427
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,540
I'll start with them.

428
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,880
I was just gonna tell you that the two local libraries have put my books in the back.

429
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,880


430
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,880


431
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,880


432
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,880


433
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,880


434
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,880


435
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,820
They did?

436
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,560
I mean, our book comes out.

437
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,640
Well, it's your book.

438
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,820
I'm just a publisher.

439
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,320
I was recently told that there should probably be a glossary.

440
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,840
They said they liked the two up and two down.

441
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,700
Oh, you get that too.

442
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,220
I get that a lot from people that read the subgenius books.

443
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,180
But it's like, but it's defined in context.

444
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,800
And in fact, we usually, when we throw out a new word, we're describing what it means.

445
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,880
I mean, well, in the subgenius books, it's like that, because it's like, well, it's

446
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:03,880


447
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:03,880


448
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,760
because they're nonfiction.

449
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,320
They're like textbooks, science books.

450
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,240
But your novel is flighty work of imaginative fiction.

451
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,000
So yeah, it's got all kinds of crazy sounding stuff.

452
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,980
But you pick it up in context.

453
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,760
I didn't have any trouble.

454
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,300
You just have to read it closely.

455
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,380
It's not a thriller you can skim on an airplane ride.

456
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,820
It's something you really have to concentrate on.

457
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,400
That's what some people like.

458
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,220
In fact, my-

459
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,820
I'll take you away a little bit.

460
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:41,920
Most discerning science fiction fan friends, scholars of science fiction, such as the great

461
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:49,720
G. Gordon Gordon, who turned me on to all my favorite authors practically, he loves

462
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,040
it.

463
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,840
He thought it was a real, just like I did, he thought it was a real classic, instant,

464
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,040
I mean, really original and really fun to read.

465
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,860
And a strange kind of novel.

466
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,240
It's kind of a page turner.

467
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,300
And it sticks with you.

468
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,100
You know, you put the book down after you're finished doing your business in the bathroom

469
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,800
reading or extra meditating on it or whatever.

470
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:23,900
And then, but your mind keeps thinking in the same future vocabularies of the out of

471
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,400
control internet that's in your face.

472
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,360
That's cool to hear.

473
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,020
That's very lovely to hear because I was hoping that that would happen once in a while because

474
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,080
I noticed, I saw it as a vision rather than as a reality.

475
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,060
Some people actually kind of escape in this world.

476
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,040
I mean, escape into this world by reading it and stuff like that there.

477
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,920
Anyway, never mind.

478
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,320
I don't want to sound so highfalutin and-

479
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,600
Well, you know, the problem is, Dave, you don't have an agent and neither do I.

480
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,000
I can't be your agent because I don't know how to be an agent.

481
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,820
You know how you be an agent?

482
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,900
You have to know everybody.

483
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,340
Well, it's a little late for that.

484
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't have the right haircut anyway and I'm not going to change it.

485
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,160
Yeah, plus all the people we know are all dead.

486
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,200
Well, that's not, I had an agent who was really good, Jane Jordan Brown in Chicago

487
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,560
and she died.

488
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,220
She'll show you.

489
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,120
And then later I had an agent and you did too, but he was a subgenius.

490
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,540
So he didn't stay an agent for long and he didn't really know everybody.

491
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,680
Because he wasn't as old and sophisticated as her.

492
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,200
In fact, he was just a subgenius from Houston.

493
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,280
He has a great band.

494
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:52,480
But anyway, yeah, we're not famous enough is the problem.

495
00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:02,340
If you go to subgenius.com, the first thing it says in the first paragraph you read on

496
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,240
the homepage says we're publishing again and we have a book out called Neighbor World

497
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,700
and you click on that and you're buying it, you know, or even reading a sample of it on

498
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,640
the Amazon or whatever, because you can do that.

499
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,660
You can read the first few pages, I think.

500
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,300
That is so exciting.

501
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,600
It's wild and crazy.

502
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,540
It's like Clockwork Orange, but how come Stanley Kubrick's not making a movie of it?

503
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,200
Or actually maybe it'd be Zack Snyder would make the movie now.

504
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,880
Yeah.

505
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,840
Or Terry Gilliam.

506
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,640
That would be the loveliest of all to have an ex-python, which is once again, you said

507
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,900
it's not a reptile.

508
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Right.

509
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,300
It's not a four-foot-tall panda.

510
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,780
No, it is.

511
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,340
A python is a reptile.

512
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,620
But a Monty Python is some sort of metaphor or something.

513
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,820
Well, metaphors and snakes are often confused.

514
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
Well, anyway, Terry Gilliam.

515
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,980
I mean, they don't know what's going on, so we assume they're confused.

516
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,860
Actually, they have a metaphor.

517
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,920
They have a higher sense of direction than we do.

518
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,680
Terry Gilliam would be the ideal director of the movie of Neighborworld, but that also

519
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,340
risks being cursed.

520
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,340
A lot of his movies have been cursed.

521
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,260
Although I understand he's finally getting to make his Don Quixote movie.

522
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,560
But who else would be a good director for Neighborworld?

523
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,260
Jim Jarmusch.

524
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,220
Jim Jarmusch from Cleveland.

525
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,080
Right.

526
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,440
Yeah.

527
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,860
He might even do it in black and white, just like Dead Man and the Beast.

528
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


529
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


530
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


531
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


532
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


533
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


534
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


535
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


536
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


537
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


538
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,860


539
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,580
Did you see Dead Man?

540
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,240
Oh, yeah.

541
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,000
Several times.

542
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,160
We showed it.

543
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,320
It was the last movie shown by Dr. Dark at X Day before he died.

544
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,760
Yep.

545
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,500
That left me with a strange, strange feeling.

546
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,000
And the funny thing was—

547
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,640
You know Iggy dressed up like a woman and all that?

548
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,700
I enjoyed that.

549
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,040
That movie was shown by popular demand.

550
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,200
There was a vote.

551
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,840
Dr. Dark, you see, of course, has done Dr. Dark's drive-in at Fox.

552
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,100
X Day drills for 20 years.

553
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:12,800
He's the only guy who is at every single 7 a.m. besides me up until last year.

554
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,000
He's quite a funny fellow.

555
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,540
Yeah.

556
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,760
And he would—his main drive-in fare was great, bad films.

557
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:29,460
Not the same old ones that you've seen a million times like Plan 9, but really unusual great,

558
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,440
bad films.

559
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:30,900
Yeah.

560
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:40,620
And the last X Day he was at, I think he suspected it might be, and he brought a copy

561
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,760
of every movie he had ever shown in those 20 years of X Days, which is always like two

562
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,500
or three a night.

563
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,560
And out of all those bad films and different movies, what the crowd really most wanted

564
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:00,220
to see was the one really good movie in the stack, which was Dead Man by Jim Jarmusch.

565
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,840
It's one of the most amazing Westerns I've ever seen.

566
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,400
And it's just bull-dada as hell.

567
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,220
Yeah.

568
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,320
All of the characters in it are great.

569
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,700
Johnny Depp is great, and Crispin Glover is in it.

570
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,460
It's just a creepy thing.

571
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:28,460
Billy Bob Thornton plays a transvestite bandit that just kills.

572
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
It could possibly—

573
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,460
Iggy Poppinsen.

574
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Iggy's in there too as a weird woman.

575
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,340
Yeah, as the other transvestite.

576
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,760
And I guess it was Robert Mitchum's last movie.

577
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,760
Right.

578
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,300
It's really an amazing movie.

579
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,260
I lost my true love.

580
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,560
I lost my true love.

581
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,260
And you never know why.

582
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,720
And you never know why.

583
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,580
That's fantastic!

584
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,320
That was fantastic.

585
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:20,760
Yeah.

586
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,380
I would've come over here, but I was stuck in traffic.

587
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,880
Oh man!

588
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,760
How was it?

589
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,140
How was that traffic animal?

590
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,000
It was great.

591
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,100


592
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,980
why was it great?

593
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,540
it was great, I mean we have the best traffic

594
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,940
everybody complains about it

595
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,320
they're like, you know, I noticed this

596
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,980
running theme of people being

597
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,420
able to show animosity

598
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,380
towards other drivers because of

599
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,020
their shortcomings

600
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,780
even though they're probably being

601
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,420
judged by the drivers in other cars

602
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,700
at the same time

603
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,380
you know

604
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,180
I always think of

605
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,340
when it comes to honking the horn

606
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,620
if not me, then who?

607
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,240
hoot hoot

608
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,940
who would honk

609
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,560
the horn in traffic if it weren't

610
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,860
if I don't

611
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,100
very Gandhi quote

612
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm into

613
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,020
conservative use of horn

614
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,640
only when they really

615
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,440
deserve it

616
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,380
and you have a car

617
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
when you have a car

618
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,640
very conservative use of horn

619
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,420
I do yell at drivers

620
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,160
in the place of a horn

621
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,660
yeah, and that's the thing

622
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
wow, wow

623
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,020
traffic

624
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,420
that's happening

625
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,680
you know, but

626
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,900
that's actually more dangerous

627
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,240
because you don't have the false

628
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,080
sense of security that

629
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,580
very thin aluminum walls

630
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,620
or whatever it was that we drive around in

631
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,620
it's like paper thin walls

632
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,480
of cars that they now make

633
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,880
fiberglass

634
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,060
and

635
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,080
plastic

636
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
and the tears

637
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,080
of foreign children

638
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,860
yeah, there's some of those in there

639
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,860
that's why my headliner doesn't stick

640
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,640
because the kids aren't sad enough

641
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,020
in foreign countries these days

642
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,080
it's not as depressing as it used to be

643
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,180
is like the weather nice there or something?

644
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,880
probably

645
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
well, we should just leave it like that

646
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,980
not like it is here in Texas, that's for sure

647
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,700
but anyway, I was like

648
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,880
the traffic here is few

649
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
everybody complains

650
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,680
about how awful the traffic is

651
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,920
and we're like, the traffic is great

652
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,740
it's the best traffic there is

653
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,600
compare our traffic to anybody else's

654
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,740
maybe LA has better traffic than we do

655
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,140
but I mean, like the nature

656
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,000
New York's got some pretty great traffic

657
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,060
right, that's like the nature of traffic

658
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,740
it's traffic

659
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,800
it's like, look at it be in traffic

660
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,260
it's doing a great job

661
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,420
bumper to bumper, stop and go

662
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,060
really?

663
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,600
even just gridlocked

664
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,080
that is amazing

665
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,480
gridlock

666
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,900
that's beautiful traffic

667
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,620
one time I was in traffic with my friend

668
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,320
and I couldn't read her weird map

669
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,420
what's the point if you're not moving anywhere?

670
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,720
well, it was stop and go on like a highway

671
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,260
but it was in New York

672
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,640
so it was a lot of stop and go

673
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
so what we did

674
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,440
was I steered the car

675
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,480
from the passenger seat

676
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,080
she operated the brake

677
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,020
and looked at the map

678
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,800
and I basically told her when to stop

679
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,540
see, and it's so much safer that way

680
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,020
than the way I did it

681
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,900
when there was nobody else on the road

682
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,940
so zero traffic

683
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,260
which was horrible

684
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,840
yeah, because then you drive 90 miles

685
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,780
I'm going like 80 miles an hour

686
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,360
down the highways in Kansas

687
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,280
granted, they're all straight lines

688
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,300
you know

689
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,920
and well paid

690
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,800
because they're papers

691
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,960
and I'm sitting there reading

692
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,380
I think it was a

693
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,220
Thomas Pynchon

694
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,300
paperback or something

695
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,700
and my friend's steering the wheel

696
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
he's like, this will be hilarious

697
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,000
just, you know, kick your feet up

698
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,980
if you feel like it

699
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,940
and so he's basically driving the van

700
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,080
from the passenger seat

701
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,860
and I'm sitting there reading a book

702
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,840
and then I realized how stupid that was

703
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,360
but we didn't die

704
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,940
and neither did the people that passed us

705
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,600
that had the looks of horror

706
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,580
on their faces

707
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,240
when we saw what we were doing

708
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,780
I was in a

709
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,520
yeah, one time

710
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,040
who's to judge?

711
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,400
my friend got out of the driver's seat

712
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,420
in like his big rig driving

713
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,020
I mean, no, seriously though

714
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,760
in Kansas

715
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,020
who's to judge?

716
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,080
he just had on cruise control

717
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,820
he just stood up

718
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,240
and did some jumping jacks

719
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,020
because if you don't get caught

720
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,240
there is no judge

721
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
yeah, who is judging?

722
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,520
I thought it was fun

723
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,100
yeah

724
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,960
I didn't feel

725
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,460
jumping jacks in a big rig

726
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,600
I mean, where

727
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,220
you don't hear about that every day

728
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,200
what are you going to do

729
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,760
if you go off the road in Kansas

730
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,320
crash into a car?

731
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,020
cornfield?

732
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,460
yeah

733
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,720
you're going to gently graze

734
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,420
some like fields of grain

735
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,940
yeah, it's going to be so epically

736
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,000
flat

737
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,120
slightly rambunctious, I guess

738
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,660
you might be like

739
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,220
bump, bump

740
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,840
not really

741
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,380
bump, bump, bump

742
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,840
the sound of corn hitting the side of the car

743
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,500
and you eventually

744
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,620
the sound of corn hitting

745
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,140
you eventually come to a stop

746
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,080
and you know

747
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,460
your friend is going to be out of a job

748
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,260
but I just had a great adventure

749
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,820
so

750
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,240
maybe

751
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,360
maybe

752
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,360


753
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
they're going to be out of a job

754
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,500
who can tell

755
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,040
there's no damage to the vehicle

756
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,960
you just got to get that back on the road

757
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,320
yeah

758
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,540
right

759
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,780
I mean, there's probably some mud

760
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,760
you know, sprayed off

761
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,340
yeah, that's why they have truck washes

762
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,760
yeah

763
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,480
all this good

764
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,000
I mean, I don't even think

765
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,040
yeah, it's Kansas

766
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,780
yeah, traffic

767
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,200
so traffic is good

768
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,040
traffic is

769
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,060
it operates the way it's supposed to operate

770
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,140
absolutely perfect traffic in this town

771
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,780
I am totally impressed

772
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,460
impressed

773
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,280

yeah

794
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,840
it's practically done

795
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,700
from what I heard

796
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,820
the theme song is unbelievable

797
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,640
so Pease

798
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,760
who was your first guest on the show?

799
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:58,760


800
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:58,760


801
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:58,960
and what was your first interview?

802
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,240
well

803
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,220
we're gonna do a dry run

804
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
because you're a dry man

805
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,540
I know

806
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,180
we've gone over it

807
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,560
exactly

808
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
oh look at you

809
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,480
pre-seeing my jokes

810
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,840
before I even say them

811
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,520
that's great

812
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,700
well it's because I have a wet sense of humor

813
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,500
I was ready

814
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,480
but

815
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,400
well it's true

816
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,600
but I thought

817
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,120
I thought during the pre-production meeting of the pre-production show

818
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,180
that we were gonna come out of this break right into Blind Eye

819
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,460
so I had my blind eye ready to go

820
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,520
no I think they said

821
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,760
I wasn't prepared to talk about my blind eye

822
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,740
I sent viewer mail

823
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,020
but what you're not prepared to talk about your show

824
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,140
but the show's ready

825
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,980
we said we would do something

826
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,680
the show's ready right?

827
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,660
right I'm ready

828
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm ready

829
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,420
I'm ready to do my blind eye

830
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,040
I mean didn't you release the theme song today?

831
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,560
it's fabulous dude

832
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:44,880
it is

833
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,060
here's the thing

834
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,700
I tell Fid

835
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,480
like oh

836
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
I wanna do this thing

837
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,500
and Fid goes

838
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't know who any of those people or shows are

839
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,280
and so I'm like well just google it

840
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,980
then he comes back to me

841
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,280
with this like

842
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,200
perfect

843
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,380
I mean it's like

844
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,380
wow I wish I was this talented

845
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,500
because this is exactly what was in my head

846
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,240
and I don't know if uh

847
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,420
all of our Patreon users got to hear it today

848
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,480
but it is a fabulous

849
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,380
if you know the concept of this show

850
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,800
which is kind of like a tease

851
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,080
uh

852
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,260
um

853
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,960
the concept of your show

854
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,440
the concept of my show

855
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,780
this show has no concept

856
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,560
as we all know

857
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,260
but my show is kind of like an intro

858
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,260
it's an interview based format

859
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,820
kind of like on a Mike Douglas or Merv Griffin

860
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,580
um

861
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,120
variety show thing

862
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,700
so we needed that type of music

863
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,460
Fid really stepped up and made some great stuff

864
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,360
um

865
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,540
we're

866
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,260
we're gonna have some bits that we do

867
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm gonna interview some people

868
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,360

869
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,660

00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,720
and he's been bitter ever since really

933
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,900
but uh

934
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,640
he's agreed to put that aside

935
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,940
and be on the show

936
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,600
we're gonna do a great interview with him

937
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,160
there'll be some musical guests

938
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,180
and of course

939
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,100
Fid's great uh

940
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,820
theme song

941
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,600
and there'll be

942
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,300
it's gonna be

943
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,560
a fabulous show

944
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,680
and we're only probably

945
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,360
24 to 36 months out

946
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,540
from the first episode

947
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,320
so

948
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,320


949
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,320


950
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,320


951
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,560
okay

952
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,940
so at least it's a realistic production schedule

953
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,660
that's right everybody

954
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,340
so uh

955
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,480
it's a real schedule

956
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,840
Disney makes four superhero movies a year

957
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,420
I mean

958
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,340
this is just a scale

959
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,360
well look at their budget dude

960
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,160
look at their budget

961
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,800
yeah

962
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,700
what

963
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,760
twenty forty dollars

964
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,180
so just tune your laptop to freethinkradio.com

965
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,000
put it on the other side of the room

966
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,660
and chain yourself to the radiator

967
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,620

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:54,320


983
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:24,320


984
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:54,320

00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:54,320


989
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:24,320


990
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:54,320


991
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:24,320


992
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:54,320


993
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:24,320


994
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:54,320

00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:24,320

00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,820
the next episode

997
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:25,820


998
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,460
Peas in a Pod

999
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,420
we're gonna be

1000
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:36,820
talking about

1001
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:36,840
the

1002
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,220
the

1003
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,680
the

1004
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,040
the

1005
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,040


1006
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,040


1007
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,040


1008
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,040


1009
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,100
the

1010
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,100


1011
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,100


1012
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,160
the

1013
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,160


1014
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,160


1015
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,160


1016
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,280
the

1017
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,280


1018
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,140
the

1019
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,140


1020
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,200
the

1021
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,580
the

1022
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:41,640
the

1023
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,940
the

1024
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:42,940


1025
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:42,940


1026
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:02,360
the the the the the the

1027
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,360

00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,360


1029
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,180
the the the the the world

1030
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,960
the time

1031
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,240
the title

1032
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,420
the dot

1033
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,020
letol

1034
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,820
uh

1035
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,340
why

1036
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,800
but

1037
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,580
Wide open shutter

1038
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,460
Wide open shutter

1039
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,800
Wide open shutter

1040
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,180
Shut up

1041
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,140
Shut up

1042
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,160
Shut up

1043
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Phases in

1044
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,560
Phases in

1045
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,780
Phases in

1046
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:16,780


1047
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,060
Phases in

1048
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:21,060


1049
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,680
Eyes that shudder like a wide open shutter

1050
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Eyes that flutter like a wide open shutter

1051
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,180
Shut up

1052
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,860
Shut up

1053
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,560
Shut up

1054
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:33,860
Shut up

1055
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,920
Come with me baby

1056
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,560
Come with me

1057
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,500
Cottage cottage cottage

1058
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,080
Cottage cottage cottage

1059
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,180
Cottage cottage cottage

1060
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,920
Going through

1061
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,840
Going through

1062
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,720
Going through

1063
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,540
Going through

1064
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,940
Going through

1065
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,800
Going through

1066
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,820
Good old Captain Beefheart

1067
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,740
He was crazy as a loon

1068
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,040
They were all

1069
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,600
magnetic pirates

1070
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,400
You know what I mean

1071
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,660
They could see the future

1072
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,900
Captain Beefheart

1073
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,400
What about King Crimson in the very early days? 21st century schizoid man

1074
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,320
What about King Crimson in the very early days? 21st century schizoid man

1075
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,380
21st century schizoid man

1076
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,380


1077
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,620
21st century schizoid man

1078
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:27,520
I think all of those guys

1079
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,260
Especially Beefheart

1080
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:37,360
Now you sound like Don VanVlein

1081
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,120
You sound like Don VanVlein

1082
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,120


1083
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,120


1084
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,660
Yeah, well I was listening to it today

1085
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,380
I memorized all of those in my youth

1086
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,460
I memorized all of those in my youth

1087
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,420
I know them by heart

1088
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,940
I know him by Beefheart.

1089
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,140
All his earlier albums.

1090
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,080
I didn't...

1091
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,160
After I became a dad,

1092
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,420
I didn't buy things anymore for me.

1093
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,740
A lot of times you're not allowed to

1094
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,580
unless you're an official dad

1095
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,440
and have all the data that you need

1096
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,660
to carry on your person.

1097
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,540
But now that Captain Beefheart's dead,

1098
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,360
we know about all his flaws.

1099
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,500
You can read about how crazy he was

1100
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,040
in all these biographies.

1101
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,180
He's a very, very demanding fellow.

1102
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:17,880
Yeah.

1103
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,280
I've known some of these creative types.

1104
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,260
They can be hard to live with.

1105
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,180
Present company excluded, of course.

1106
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,160
A friend of mine that you know also

1107
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,380
who died recently, a friend of mine,

1108
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,400
was invited to work with Frank Zappa

1109
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,560
for a couple weeks.

1110
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,220
And he said it was weird

1111
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,240
because Zappa's kids,

1112
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,720
I don't know whether it was his kids

1113
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,920
or he meant his grandkids

1114
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,780
or whatever they were,

1115
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,280
had cameras.

1116
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,080
Everybody filmed everything all the time.

1117
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,240
They'd walk right up to your face

1118
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,640
and take film of you.

1119
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,120
Like, say, Daddy Frank Zappa's talking away

1120
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,040
and stuff like that.

1121
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,420
And a little kid comes up

1122
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,660
and sticks a camera right in your face,

1123
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,720
a source right in your nose.

1124
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,620
I'm not real surprised.

1125
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,580
He thought it was fun.

1126
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,940
I can see that happening at certain times

1127
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,780
at my house in the old days.

1128
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,260
There was a time when my wife,

1129
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,400
my first wife and I used to let subgeniuses

1130
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,440
crash on our floor.

1131
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,360
I hadn't met any of the crazies yet.

1132
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,800
It was annoying was the worst we'd gotten

1133
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,260
for the first couple of years.

1134
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,220
And it was a real menagerie sometimes.

1135
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,980
If there was a devival in Dallas

1136
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,240
or Little Rock,

1137
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,980
there'd be a whole tribe of weirdos in my house.

1138
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,700
A messiah.

1139
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:46,760
A messiah.

1140
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:46,760


1141
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:46,760


1142
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,080
And a bunch of crazy,

1143
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,360
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy,

1144
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,920
My dad walked in one morning

1145
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,940
after a subgenius convention.

1146
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,720
He probably had seen something like it, actually.

1147
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,840
I later learned.

1148
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,200
Yeah, but see,

1149
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,640
we had to quit living like Frank Zappa

1150
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,640
because we never got famous, rich, and popular

1151
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,940
because we were subgeniuses.

1152
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,600
And flying under the radar.

1153
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,720
And all had jobs.

1154
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,120
That was the really tragic thing.

1155
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,200
Now, how can you say they were all a bunch of head jobs

1156
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,100
while they were flying on radiators?

1157
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,680
That doesn't make any sense.

1158
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,260
No, it was the only way we could get away with it.

1159
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,580
We had to keep a low profile.

1160
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,900
Why did you want to get away with it to begin with?

1161
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,360
Why wouldn't you want to be turned into

1162
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,660
a full-blooded Christian hero?

1163
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,060
Because it was there.

1164
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,160
You know, how could we not?

1165
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,640
How could Philo and I,

1166
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,340
having once realized the truth of Bob,

1167
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,640
just ever walk away from it?

1168
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,020
You'll notice, I mean,

1169
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,940
other subgeniuses have come and gone.

1170
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,400
A lot of them come and go and then come back.

1171
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,080
And then go and then come back.

1172
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,360
And come back and go and come back.

1173
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,140
And some just go.

1174
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,800
But I expect those to come back eventually.

1175
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,860
Some just come back.

1176
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:02,740
They always do.

1177
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,340
They have to.

1178
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,960
How else are they going to spawn?

1179
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,120
Anyway,

1180
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,320
yeah, they...

1181
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,220
But I guess where...

1182
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,060
There's too many crazy people out there.

1183
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,160
And also,

1184
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,740
I hate having to clean up after some of them.

1185
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,180
And get them out of jail.

1186
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,580
And, you know...

1187
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,960
The worst are the ones that would camp out

1188
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,140
by the post office

1189
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,520
hoping to see Bob show up to get the mail.

1190
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,480
I actually had to hide from them a couple of times.

1191
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,340
And a bunch of them thought you were actually Bob

1192
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,560
and you tried to explain it.

1193
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,840
And that one guy, well, he...

1194
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,260
He went a little too far, didn't he?

1195
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,000
Didn't they all?

1196
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,140
There were a bunch of them.

1197
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,700
Yeah, lots of them did.

1198
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Yeah, I've had to...

1199
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,640
There's been many a time

1200
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,080
so I had to cross my fingers behind my back and go,

1201
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,040
look, man, Bob's just a made-up character.

1202
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,140
And they'd go...

1203
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,180
They'd be really disappointed, but they'd go away.

1204
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,020
And then Bob would come out from the closet and go,

1205
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,100
great job, Stan.

1206
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,980
That was great.

1207
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:09,840
You did just right.

1208
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,260
I'll remember to have...

1209
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,500
Remember to ask me to take you out to lunch someday.

1210
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,580
I gotta go.

1211
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,700
Right, you'd hit him in the closet

1212
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,900
just like you used to have to do in England

1213
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,500
with the religious figures or the figurines.

1214
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,020
No, he'd hide.

1215
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,260
It's because he'd be in there, you know,

1216
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,500
doing number three.

1217
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,560
Bob was kind of really rude about just going,

1218
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,240
oh, I've got to do number three right now.

1219
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,420
And he'd run off in a closet

1220
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,540
and you'd hear all these weird noises.

1221
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,700
And he'd come out,

1222
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,300
I feel like a new man.

1223
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,880
But no one could ever figure out...

1224
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,000
They had to figure out...

1225
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1226
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1227
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,480
He had a machine at Dobstown

1228
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,740
that he could just walk up to and do number three,

1229
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,860
but right in front of you,

1230
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,600
but you couldn't figure out what was actually happening.

1231
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,180
Well, why did you need a personal history?

1232
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,580
You know, it was enough to know that he had done it

1233
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,020
and everybody was aware of it.

1234
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,160
Well, he acted like it.

1235
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,660
He acted like so many other things.

1236
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,260
Bob acted like that was normal.

1237
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,420
It's like everybody had to do number three all of a sudden.

1238
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,820
It was like most of us,

1239
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,340
we only made it as far as number two.

1240
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,140
We don't even know what number three is.

1241
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,100
I got to two and a half one time

1242
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,740
and it wasn't even the same experience

1243
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,980
that I started with, you know,

1244
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,140
number one or number two.

1245
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,660
And I wondered about the time,

1246
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,500
I was wondering if it was the same kind of experience

1247
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,000
Bob was indeed having on level number three.

1248
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,600
And I fell asleep.

1249
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,660
I couldn't...

1250
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,680
And I swore I was going to take notes

1251
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,560
and everything like that.

1252
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,140
And I had the notebook out

1253
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,700
and a little handheld keyboard.

1254
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,760
Maybe you did number three in your sleep.

1255
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,400
It's possible.

1256
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,340
All things are possible.

1257
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,360
A lot of people do number one in their sleep.

1258
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,940
Some people do number two in their sleep.

1259
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:06,620
I'm doing exercises to try to preserve

1260
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,820
my number two controlling glands

1261
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,340
and brain and muscles.

1262
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,700
Everybody.

1263
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,720
Everybody has to nowadays.

1264
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,700
Most of them don't.

1265
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,080
You know.

1266
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,260
Yeah, unfortunately.

1267
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,360
The only reason I do is because I have to.

1268
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,860
Yeah, it's small quarters there in the cantina.

1269
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,420
I guess if you left the other restrooms alone,

1270
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,460
you'd have to come back all the way

1271
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,600
from halfway around the world or something.

1272
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,120
I don't know.

1273
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,720
I don't know what Bob does when he's not,

1274
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,760
you know, like when he's just sort of out on the road

1275
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,480
and in public.

1276
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,180
Does he run into service, gas stations, I mean,

1277
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,760
and say, where could I do number three?

1278
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,600
Where's your second stage restroom or whatever?

1279
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,660
You know, I don't know what he...

1280
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,380
We just don't know.

1281
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,180
You're just saying you're not an expert.

1282
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,840
For all we know, it's a little time travel booth

1283
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,840
and he sends some organ of his body

1284
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,020
into some other time and place.

1285
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,820
I have no idea.

1286
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,800
That's what I was hoping.

1287
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,020
I was hoping that.

1288
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,020
For a long time now.

1289
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,460
You know, it could be anything.

1290
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,400
Literally anything.

1291
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,780
With Bob.

1292
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,960
Barkley like...

1293
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,280
Ugh.

1294
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,840
Call Bob.

1295
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,280
Yeah.

1296
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:26,840
Yeah.

1297
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,540
Yeah.

1298
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,420
Yeah.

1299
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,320
Yeah.

1300
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,540
Yeah.

1301
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,880
Yeah.

1302
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,400
Yeah.

1303
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:37,960
Yeah.

1304
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,060
Yeah.

1305
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:38,260
Yeah.

1306
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,580
Yeah.

1307
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,220
Yeah.

1308
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:39,220


1309
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,220
Thank you.

1310
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,860
Thank you.

1311
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,700
