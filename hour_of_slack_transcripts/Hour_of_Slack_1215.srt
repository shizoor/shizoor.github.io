1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
You hunting something?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,340
Something on your mind?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,660
Usual business.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,940
Make yourself at home.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:18,260
The thing that I mean to have you know is, is that I ain't no god damn preacher.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,140
That's okay son, mama don't mind if you ain't no preacher, as long as you got four dollars.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,400
Bob.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,680
Bob.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,640
But Bob is not real.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,100
The subgenius power of sweat.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,920
Bob is real.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,140
He's been having me since I was twelve.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,060
My name is Mario Cuomo and here's the radio crack.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,700
Breaking news now, God is dead.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,160
Uh, go get Bob Dobbs.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
I guess he just wanted to listen.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,420
Are you a subgenius?

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,840
An army of goons looking for...

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,300
Slack.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,580
A lot of slack.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Plenty of slack.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,200
Listen dummy.

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,460
Bob Dobbs.

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,180
Bob.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,860
Dobbs has the answer.

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:18,120
If you want the best slack for the ultimate radio experience, you can easily go to the church of the subgenius.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,660
The slack also features music, creating the perfect mood for partying.

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,300
Bob Dobbs.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,760
The American way.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Please welcome to the podium, Bob Dobbs.

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,400
Uh, I do nothing, you do everything.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,080
Yet I get paid for it.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
Pure subgenius.

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,760
Dobbs.

35
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,320
Dobbs.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
This is going to be a tough nut to radio crack.

37
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,800
Herbert was chief executive.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,320
Herbert uses words.

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,160
Brother Herbert went to Hawaii and forgot to pack his hat.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,240
All the big programming decisions are made right through those doors.

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,380
God bless America's chickens.

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,800
Now I was accused of taking that out of context, Dr. Dobbs.

43
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,180
Could you smack Bob if you had to?

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,440
He's only three feet tall.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,480
Bob is, is very sensitive.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,620
Bob, I'm sorry.

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,960
Bob, I'm going to guarantee you free crack, or reduced crack for a year.

48
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,140
Bob, what does this do?

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,080
Bob.

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,240
Dobbs.

51
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,420
Uh, or Mrs. Dobbs.

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
Genius or a mouse trap?

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,720
Bob, running a battery company.

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,480
We look to, uh, the, uh, to the subgenius hour of slack.

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,940
It's an hour of fascism.

56
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,180
Radio slack.

57
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,200
No.

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,900
Radio crack.

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,600
Bob, uh, thanks Bob, appreciate it.

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,340
Convinced of, uh, this little country's bright future, Bob purchased everything he could find.

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,620
Building into an unbelievably large asset very quickly.

62
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,820
Yes.

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,320
Mr. Dobbs.

64
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,900
Dobbs purchased another radio station.

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,700
Assuming that radio would be in his future, Dobbs adds yet another laurel to his long list

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,100
of achievements.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,380
So you do take medicine for schizophrenia.

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,920
Hopefully.

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,300
I know you're not having an episode.

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,400
I hadn't heard this country before.

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,260
He does.

72
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,180
My symptom is...

73
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:19,880
In the last 20 years of his life, the most dynamic industrial individual with 41 hours

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,300
of tape has never been a man.

75
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


80
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


81
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


82
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


83
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


85
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,300


88
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,680
Much as 41 hours of tape.

89
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,180
Secret conversations recorded.

90
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,660
Therefore, simple mathematics dictated that in less than one minute of each hour, actually,

91
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,900
the show could penetrate the record population with little effort.

92
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,440
And so there were the first 20 years.

93
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,220
The first 20 years of this show.

94
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,340
The first 20 years of this show.

95
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,640
They're tumbling down the radio station stairs.

96
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,060
That was Dr. Philo Drummond, personal friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs, on the show itself, puzzling

97
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,560
evidence from KPFA.

98
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:09,860
Before that, the amazing collage was by somebody new, the subhegious army of goons of RadioCrack.com.

99
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,560
That's RadioCrack.com.

100
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,200
Our titles this episode, which is our slot number 1,215, were by the name of Dr. Philo

101
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,460
Dummond.

102
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,640
We are moving forward the in our numbers from the Maker Enortex X and 1,235 to 3,400, which

103
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:38,880
gives us this 검 suggesting that the only possible record being promised in theory from

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,120
next Disney takes place on the street under a base坊k of the Warner Brothers stereo

105
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
that on the screen to the right of the screen, there we are seeing a dozen of fact of each

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,040


107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
You might have undersell all full of different index on the report on the subgenio they

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
og QRberg-ordum Life Resource Custom, 아주 쉽o, fatally affect may take.

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:46,720


110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,180
Boologalam Sprung for Broadway on the continent is closely any other record being recorded

111
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,580
along with the подпис and newspapers, entering into kind of a photo and so forth.

112
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,180
So you can actually get best quality game record on Sony's X- submarines.

113
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,680
Dr. Howell of DrHowell.com, or that's AskDrHowell.com,

114
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,100
Grease Says Pisces, Reverend Susie the Flusie of WREK.org,

115
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,260
and Bob's Slack Time Funhouse there,

116
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,240
and later on, Reverend Angry Larry on TheAminoAcids.com.

117
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,460
Yes, we're back, and we're going to play some award-winning CDs for you

118
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,200
as part of our comprehensive program of subgenius music.

119
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Here on Subgenius Radio, the once and future hour of Slack

120
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,940
generated from our special Bobcasts here at X Day 12.

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,120
12.

122
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,300
So gather round, we're about to set forth on a fable voyage

123
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,920
into perilous seas and fairy lands forlorn.

124
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,640
What's the trouble around here?

125
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,000
I think Susie's breasts have this.

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,780
Sort of field?

127
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,880
They're interfering with the equipment.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
And the problem is, is between Susie's breasts...

129
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,460
Don't lean too near the interocitor, my dear.

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,640
And between... We've got... I think there's just too much breast.

131
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,580
Well, we might need someone to hold them back if you need a volunteer.

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
It does. It does.

133
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,160
And what do you do when the space-time continuum cleaves because of that problem?

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,840
The left one's usually larger.

135
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:13,940
Yeah.

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,500
Why is that true? Is that a universal concept?

137
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,180
No, it's not.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,420
It's not? I'm not... My right one's bigger?

139
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,220
Asymmetry.

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,480
When staying, the one that's left is larger.

141
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll tell you why, and I won't even accept the dollar.

142
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,040
The reason is that the left side is a copy of the right side,

143
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,060
and a copy is never identical to the original.

144
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,400
Ah.

145
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:42,240
We form by division, and, you know, each part is only as good as it can be

146
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,820
as a copy of the other part.

147
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,020
Within certain tolerances, bilateral symmetry,

148
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,100
but actually...

149
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,280
When you look close, as with everything else, the gremlins creep in,

150
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,560
and you recognize there are differences.

151
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,320
Well, I mean, they told me the other day, I was at the conspiracy doctors,

152
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,760
and they said, well, you know, your left eye is dominant.

153
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,680
And I said, well, that explains a lot.

154
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,060
It's like that two-headed little girl that you may have been following the adventures of.

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah.

156
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
Yeah, now she's a teenager.

157
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah.

158
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,860
Now there are two teenage heads on that back.

159
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,320
And then she's a teenager, and she's a little bit older, and she's a little bit older.

160
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,320


161
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,180
Wow.

162
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,780
There's a lot of things she could do twice as fast.

163
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,440
Yeah. Well, her parents were quoted on TV saying, well, it's time to start thinking about dating.

164
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,520
And I would say, yeah, it is, indeed.

165
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,440
She needs a giant lizard man with a hemipenny.

166
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,080
All those people.

167
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,020
A better dumbass boyfriend.

168
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,040
No, she doesn't need that, because she has one set of reproductive equipment.

169
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,080
Two legs, you know, two arms.

170
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,620
It's only...

171
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,260
So no lizards.

172
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,840
Um, but you see, even in the early stages of the human life,

173
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,920
even in this case, which nature has provided as special entertainment for subgeniuses,

174
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,320
one side dominates.

175
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,120
In all two-headed individuals, in all Siamese twins in general, one side must dominate.

176
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,620
Both cannot dominate, or there is some...

177
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,200
There can be only one.

178
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:15,500
But that being said, there is graceful surrender from the subordinate head to the dominant head.

179
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,740
Now this little girl runs around.

180
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:17,820


181
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,520
and plays as everybody remembers who saw her visit Oprah which she did twice back

182
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,820
when she was a kid and not a teenage two-headed girl but medically when she

183
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,860
runs around the left head controls the left leg and the right head controls the

184
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,800
right leg there's none of that reverse that you get from the human brain where

185
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,760
the right side would control the left leg. I can't even get Monster in. But they do it they are two

186
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,700
intelligences cooperating and the reason this cooperation is possible is

187
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,560
there is a dominant side in this case a dominant head. Most of us are only

188
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,800
fortunate enough to have a single head but still there are warring sides the

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,200
left side and the right side. The evangelicals and the Holocaust. Yes the

190
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,420
afficipation that we see through everything. The Tao symbol itself

191
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,740
through everything. The Tao symbol itself.

192
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,720
demonstrates this duality.

193
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,380
But you've got to realize

194
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,980
with perfect equal nature,

195
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,420
perfect equality between these opposites,

196
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,280
no motion is possible.

197
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,140
Everything is frozen into some bland ideal of perfection.

198
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,280
No fiery forward movement is possible.

199
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,780
We can either be pulled forward

200
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,600
by our desire for the divine

201
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,700
or forced forward by the fiery diabolical behind us.

202
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
Or they can fall off the bed from the movement.

203
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,660
Well, that can happen too

204
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,500
if the mattress is the wrong size.

205
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,220
Or like Japanese monsters,

206
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,380
the hemispheres can team up.

207
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,040
They fight at first and then they team up.

208
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,460
Well, that's because they like to show.

209
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,960
They live in a society

210
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,420
where cooperative behavior is essential.

211
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,060
We're not quite...

212
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,940
We're not quite yet so tightly packed in.

213
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,440
The child running is the monster steaming up.

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,920
That is the case

215
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,880
when these monsters have children.

216
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
And some of them do.

217
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,360
There are child-rearing issues

218
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,840
with Godzilla's child

219
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,820
who we were talking about the other day.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,400
I remember certain issues of abandonment.

221
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,120
But Godzilla did some parenting

222
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
in one of those movies.

223
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,900
Was it...

224
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,560
Oh, God.

225
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,660
Was it Destroy All Monsters

226
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,420
or Godzilla on Monster Island?

227
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,520
I don't accept Godzuki

228
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,820
as part of the Godzilla mythos.

229
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,160
Yeah.

230
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,020
I don't recall.

231
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm not so much a fan of these pictures.

232
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,560
But I do remember there is a scene

233
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,020
where the elder Godzilla

234
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,700
teaches the younger Godzilla

235
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,240
to throw fire.

236
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,560
Well, the younger one

237
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,400
only blows smoke rings.

238
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,380
But the old man gets him

239
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,020
to throw some fire after a while.

240
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,420
And that's the way it is.

241
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,900
You find out that your pop

242
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,020
is good for something.

243
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,680
After a while,

244
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,480
you just stick around long enough.

245
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,720
He's not such an idiot.

246
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,500
I remember when my daddy taught me

247
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,740
what a blanket party was.

248
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,140
You mean with pigs in a blanket?

249
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,420
No, no, no, no.

250
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,240
It's a little different.

251
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,080
Oh, I see.

252
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,300
Is that like the covered wagon?

253
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,200
Uh-huh.

254
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
Dad taught me about the covered wagon.

255
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,420
You see, it's different

256
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,900
when you're a little girl growing up

257
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,380
because sometimes daddy tells you

258
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,140
all the secret ways

259
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,920
of handling personal situations.

260
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

261
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,280
See, the girls are grinning

262
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,840
because they know.

263
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,540
Especially you see her next to him.

264
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,600
She's going, yeah,

265
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
my daddy would totally

266
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,120
beat your butt.

267
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,100
Bar of soap and a sock.

268
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,460
It works great in pantyhose.

269
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,560
It's like bolos.

270
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,520
Exactly.

271
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,000
If you get them working,

272
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,360
you can do nuthin' chucks with it.

273
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,780
And the daughters of Noah

274
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,960
looked upon the old man

275
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,980
as he slept.

276
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,760
And lo, he was aroused.

277
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,060
And lo, they too were aroused.

278
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,420
And they went in unto him.

279
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,040
And went to him.

280
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,280
And then his wife found out about it.

281
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,020
The wife always finds out?

282
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,200
The wife always finds out.

283
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,240
And if you're going to go all the way

284
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,960
to South America.

285
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,680
South America?

286
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,220
Oh, no, this was a...

287
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,560
They ended up on Mount Ararat,

288
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,980
according to some tradition.

289
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,660
They always take it up onto the mountains.

290
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,640
I always wondered why.

291
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,320
Especially when they were doing something bad,

292
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
they would go on the mountain?

293
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,640
Well, the mountains were high peaks.

294
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,400
And they had a unique experience

295
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,880
where one of the run-off

296
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,840
stranded the ark

297
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,920
at the end of the story ark.

298
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,400
But, if God was like your big dad,

299
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,960
he's like the big universal dad,

300
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,420
and he's in the sky,

301
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,360
why do I want to go all the way up higher

302
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,240
to do something?

303
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
So that my big, mean dad in the sky

304
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,380
can see me mess up?

305
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,440
I think we're going to be...

306
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,400
People actually believe

307
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,540
that God lurks in the sky.

308
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,940
The great sky God.

309
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,000
But then some

310
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:16,720
folks think that the divine presence is all around us and therefore also in the sky.

311
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,960
Bob is all around us. I see Bob and everyone here.

312
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,540
That's because there are so many of those faces everywhere you look, staring back at you.

313
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,960
So look, there's Bob in that one. And even in her. Yes, in her there's Bob.

314
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,620
In fact, I'm sure Bob has been in her, but I'm not really sure.

315
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,020
And then there's Bob over there and that one in the back.

316
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,880
He's so full of Bob he's about to explode!

317
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,880
Oh, my asshole!

318
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,820
Well, there you have it. Irrefutable proof of the Dobbsian Inherence.

319
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,260
Dobbsian In-where-ence?

320
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,380
That Dobbs inheres in us all.

321
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,120
Dobbs adheres to us all, too. He's very sticky.

322
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,280
Where you come from is gone.

323
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,600
Where you thought you were going to weren't never there.

324
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,000
And where you are...

325
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,080
ain't no good unless you can get away from it.

326
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Your conscience...

327
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,100
is a trick.

328
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,100
It don't exist.

329
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,640
And if you think it does...

330
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,300
then you had best get it out in the open...

331
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,960
hunt it down...

332
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,740
and kill it.

333
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,780
Friends, I want you to meet the new prophet, the true prophet here.

334
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,060
I want you to listen to what he says.

335
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,340
Listen here!

336
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,080
Listen to what he says, because I think he's going to make you as happy as he has made me.

337
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,420
The unredeemed are redeeming themselves.

338
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,040
And the new Jesus is at hand.

339
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
Watch for this miracle.

340
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,360
Help yourselves to salvation in the holy church of Christ.

341
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
Without Christ.

342
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,320
Amen! Amen! The prophet!

343
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,900
Amen!

344
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,200
Amen!

345
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,320
Amen!

346
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:05,980
Amen!

347
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,240
Well, I have interviewed Priestess Pisces about her X-Day experience.

348
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,940
And perhaps now that you're here, Susie, I should also inquire for the record...

349
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,020
how your X-Day has been up to now.

350
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,940
For those watching at home, she's removing her clothing.

351
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,720
Yes, she is.

352
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,420
What was the most delightful thing that you have done since coming to X-Day?

353
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,920
I just showed up.

354
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,680
That's the best thing I could have done, because you have no idea how therapeutic and purging an X-Day is.

355
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,600
And damn, I don't know how this year didn't kill me, but I'm feeling so badly.

356
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,800
I did mention the net of inimical forces tugging at us, trying to keep us from getting here this year, which was stronger than ever.

357
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,540
Negi has acted in our lives in such horrific ways.

358
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,420
The horror.

359
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,560
It's all gonna burn.

360
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,480
And it seems so reasonable, what is offered.

361
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:23,120
But then, if you can just persist and get away to the Brushwood campground, these objections, viewed from the other end, are seen as the satanic stratagems they actually are.

362
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,480
If Modamat could bring me that black bag in front of him...

363
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,360
Uh-oh.

364
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,020
No, not the black bag.

365
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,200
Yes, the black bag.

366
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,580
No!

367
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,500
The black bag has all the important things in it.

368
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,620
Ah, not the one with the red straps, too?

369
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Touch it that way. Right. Be careful. I believe it's still armed.

370
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,240
That bag will trim your nails for you.

371
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,620
It'll trim more in than nails.

372
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,980
What do you want?

373
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,160
If Jesus Christ cured blind men,

374
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,340
how come you don't get it?

375
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,600
I'll get him to cure you.

376
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,060
He blinded Paul.

377
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Anybody that blinded himself for justification, I'll be able to save you.

378
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Nobody with a good car needs to be justified.

379
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,480
From PR News in Washington, I'm continuing to talk about pre-existing medical conditions.

380
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,980
...P.R. News.

381
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,760
Spanish authorities say President Obama blew up a police barracks in Northern Virginia.

382
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,780
On Wall Street, 910-964. This is PR.

383
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,440
Health officials are worried about the coming on pregnant women.

384
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,140
Pregnant women will be held down later today.

385
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
Pregnant women were among previously healthy pregnant women.

386
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,700
PR News.

387
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,200
A report from Nigeria says as many as 4,000 people have run from PR News in Washington.

388
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,420
The conspiracy had me in its claws.

389
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,660
I looked for Bob, but without Thursday.

390
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,760
At 30 I was lost.

391
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,860
Because the conspiracy had me in its claws.

392
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,840
Because I was lost, but now I do see.

393
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,700
I was lost, but now I do see.

394
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,940
Because J.R. Bob Dobbs, he's the savior of me.

395
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,180
I was lost, and now I do see.

396
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,280
Actually, I don't think those were the words at all.

397
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,260
Amen. Well, it was well thought.

398
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,740
How about this one?

399
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,600
X day is here, the mountains fall.

400
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,440
I cringe and hide my head.

401
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:44,020
I never send in my 30 bucks.

402
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,320
My soul is filled with dread.

403
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,240
Oh, Bob, won't you let me in?

404
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,580
I'll be free to live.

405
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,760
And all that is mine, I, John, surely will give.

406
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,400
Oh, bear me away in your bright saucership.

407
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,800
To my subgenius home.

408
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,880
Oh, bear me away in your bright shining ship.

409
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,860
To my subgenius home.

410
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,320
I saw the pinks and normals flee.

411
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,600
The dreadful harvest from the sky.

412
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,060
They run and scream and die in pain.

413
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,980
And none of them knows why.

414
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,220
Oh, Bob, won't you let me live?

415
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,220
And all that is mine, I, John, surely will give.

416
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,700
Oh, bear me away in your bright saucership.

417
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,180
To my subgenius home.

418
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,380
Oh, bear me away in your bright shining ship.

419
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,220
To my subgenius home.

420
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,480
Oh, Dr. Hal.

421
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,120
Yes, yes.

422
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,520
Dr. Hal sings Ex-Day is Here from the Brushwood stage.

423
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,260
The John Shirley version, I noticed.

424
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,380
Before that, Priestess Pisces singing some P.R. News from Lee Marr.

425
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,180
And before that, some Wise Blood.

426
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,160
Now, back to some live hour of Slack reminders from Dr. Hal.

427
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,660
Well, don't forget that on Saturday, July 4th,

428
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,760
the day the pinks celebrate their idea of independence,

429
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,540
we will be about to celebrate ultimate independence.

430
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,320
And that night, we will hear the dulcet music of the amino acids

431
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,200
on this very stage at 10 p.m.

432
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
with their world premiere film,

433
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,920
I Was a Teenage Subgenius.

434
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,260
The military and service,

435
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,360
the government knows about them.

436
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,620
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world

437
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,160
that they could begin moving the population to now.

438
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,740
But they're not doing that.

439
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,900
They are not.

440
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,560
They want the major population centers wiped out

441
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,080
so that the few that are left will be more easily controllable.

442
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:09,820
Besides, there is not much to do here.

443
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,120
But it takes a lot of effort to do it.

444
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,960
Instead of trying to throw the attention to a few niceties,

445
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,000
we were able to use an Army soldier

446
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,200
that could protect indoctrinated families

447
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,200


448
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,220
the dynasty,

449
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,400
guitar solo

450
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,260
guitar solo

451
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,240
guitar solo

452
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,000
guitar solo

453
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,040
guitar solo

454
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,040


455
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,920
guitar solo

456
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,980
guitar solo

457
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,560
guitar solo

458
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:34,560


459
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:34,560


460
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,140
This guy knows

461
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,580
the amino acids.

462
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,560
He's one of my workers.

463
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,060
I work for him. They're really horrible

464
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,500
beings,

465
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,880
I guess you could say. What's the rate of pay?

466
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,760
Human being juice. What is what?

467
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,240
What?

468
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,940
What's the rate of pay?

469
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,760
Pay?

470
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,860
They believe that it's some kind of a privilege.

471
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,820
We believe that it's some kind of a privilege

472
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,000
to be so, to work for them.

473
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,340
Not a lot of pay.

474
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,460
No, not much.

475
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,540
No, that's no good.

476
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,940
Working conditions are?

477
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,000
Hard.

478
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,900
Broken bones.

479
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,320
Fractures.

480
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,580
One of the

481
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,780
people that worked for the aminos

482
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,060
bruised his liver.

483
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,200
Wow.

484
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,480
Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.

485
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,980
Was that from, you know, maybe a chemical spill or?

486
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,120
Oh, no, no, no.

487
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,560
It was from falling down.

488
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,420
Falling down.

489
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,020
Getting knocked down and whatnot.

490
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,700
The subgenius who was a member of GWAR,

491
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,520
the sex executioner had to quit because he had broken too many cartilages and bones from pratfalls.

492
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,460
Right.

493
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,460
From flopping, even covered with that foam rubber suit.

494
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:48,960
Oh, yeah.

495
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,440
They, those guys got too banged up.

496
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:57,140
The first time I saw GWAR, my first thought was, I want to know how their suits smell.

497
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,140
Do they wash them after each show?

498
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,180
And I got my answer.

499
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,240
They do not wash them after each show and they smell worse than you could imagine.

500
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,840
And luckily they must get used to it.

501
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,720
I have never washed my preaching bustier, ever.

502
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,640
Well, I will say that in the amino masks and whatnot, there has been,

503
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,380
well, of course, snot, spit, vomit, blood.

504
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,280
Probably a bit of pus.

505
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,700
I would imagine some pus.

506
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,780
The saddest thing I see at most amino acid shows is when some human walks up to one of the band members

507
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,260
and hands them a beer.

508
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,840
Like, here, sip this beer.

509
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,740
And you're like, you're looking at a thing that has no mouth.

510
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,680
Okay.

511
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,800
What the hell is it?

512
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,440
And each time, whichever way you look at it, it's like, oh, it's a beer.

513
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,440


514
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,600
Whatever amino acid it is, it just looks at it for a long time and looks at the human and looks back at the beer.

515
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,660
What am I supposed to do with that?

516
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,560
And looks at the human like, what the fuck?

517
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,560
And it's more like, okay, if you're stupid enough to give me your beer,

518
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:08,940
I will appease you by at least faking to drink it for you and wasting it.

519
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,480
So who's, you know.

520
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,520
Sure, I'll take your beer that you paid five bucks for.

521
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:14,920
Okay.

522
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,120
You're the Bob and they're the Bobbi.

523
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,320
That's the only.

524
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,480
Did you talk to your mother about this?

525
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,800
About Bobbi's?

526
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,020
No.

527
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,940
Heck no.

528
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,060
You know, I haven't talked to my mother about it, but.

529
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,280
And what does she say?

530
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,140
What feedback does she give you about this complaint?

531
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
She said the same thing.

532
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,960
What's that?

533
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,180
They cut the bracelet.

534
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,220
There's going to be an alarm that's generated.

535
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,320
That I have problems with my tone of voice.

536
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,220
Okay.

537
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,520
And it's not just your wife trying to manipulate you.

538
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,300
Uh-huh.

539
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,020
My tone is.

540
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,860
That tone doesn't help it get better.

541
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,440
This is Bob talking to Bobbi.

542
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,440


543
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,440


544
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,440


545
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,440


546
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,500
I thought the world.

547
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,100
Yeah.

548
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,280
You can stand up to yourself.

549
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,960
No, he can't.

550
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,560
He's just a head.

551
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,880
With all different tones.

552
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,760
It's just a little doc face.

553
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,960
Oh, no.

554
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,720
Docs.

555
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,220
Docs.

556
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,900
I'm aware that I'm doing it.

557
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,120
John Deere tractor beam.

558
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,860
John Deere tractor beam would be Friday night.

559
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,420
No.

560
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,420


561
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,540
That's Friday.

562
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,920
We're speaking of Saturday, July 4th.

563
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,840
Friday, July 3rd.

564
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
What day is it?

565
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,780
I should be counting since there are limited editions.

566
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:35,080
John Deere tractor beam is scheduled to perform at 815 in the main pavilion following the

567
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,620
Uncostume Ball at 730.

568
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,000
Man down.

569
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,040
Kepp it on Rabbi.

570
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,500
This deal just won and wave has not yet happened.

571
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,260
We'll never know.

572
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,480
Line up.

573
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,240
I'm excited to get this.

574
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,520
I think.

575
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Hey, this is a beach party.

576
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:04,440
Well, what about the other group that supposedly came, the Tractor Beam?

577
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,260
John Deere Tractor Beam.

578
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:15,580
They're actually, they're like farmers that were abducted by, well actually by aliens

579
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,080
that live in the desert.

580
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,840
Like the cows, you know, the, uh.

581
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,960
The cow people?

582
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,040
Well, no, the, uh.

583
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,860
Oh, the cow, cow mutilator.

584
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,120
There you go.

585
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,580
Right.

586
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,480
And they happen to have got.

587
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,620
Those guys are authentic hicks because they don't even spell John Deere right.

588
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,200
Well, no, it's, it's, yeah.

589
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,800
They figured out that there was an H in there.

590
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,560
It has three E's.

591
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,240
No, it has three E's in it.

592
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,880
Okay, is there?

593
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,420
God.

594
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,940
I mean, you would think that these hillbillies would at least spell the name of their inspiree

595
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,500
or inspirator right.

596
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,060
Well, they just.

597
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,720
They just finally figured out that it was J-O-H-N, not just J-N.

598
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,660
J-N-D-E-E-E-E.

599
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,380
I think there was five or six E's to begin with and then.

600
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,660
I'll have you know that the trap they build up here is really hard to get.

601
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,720
Look at what your tits do to the feedback.

602
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,420
I mean, look at what your bosom does to the feedback, Pisces.

603
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,380
Hold on.

604
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,640
What are you, what are you doing?

605
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,640
More experiments.

606
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,760
She was leaning over in an unusual way and has the mic tilted up and it's gathering.

607
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,900
Well, what I was doing was.

608
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,500
The sound.

609
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,440
The sound and feeding it back from this cup like cleavage.

610
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,360
What I was trying to do was to get loose.

611
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,520
My camera, where's my camera?

612
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,320
And so the science proceeds.

613
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,820
They're out there.

614
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,200
But when you have on a straight A-line skirt that goes down to your ankles and you're sitting

615
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,040
in the, under the table on the bench, I just had to pull the skirt up to my butt and then

616
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,580
I could get out.

617
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,620
You could have asked me to move.

618
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,140
I could have gotten up and moved.

619
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,940
But then I would have interrupted your thought.

620
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,660
Oh.

621
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,520
You know, we had a question.

622
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,160
I had a thought.

623
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,280
Are the amino acids here?

624
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
I know they're not here yet.

625
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,040
Yes.

626
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,320
The question was echoing from the audience, but.

627
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,500
You know, I've, I've, I've come to the realization that the aminos may be the only aliens that

628
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,680
you can really depend on showing up at X Day.

629
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,700
And they don't plan on taking anybody with them.

630
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,480
Well.

631
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,520
In what sense?

632
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,760
In what sense exactly?

633
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,840
I've seen the amino acids movie.

634
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,400
I've seen more of it than most of you have.

635
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,240
And how many stars would you rate it?

636
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,020
Don't want to miss it because you'll enjoy the nightmares that will come for weeks.

637
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
And it is for sale as well.

638
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,720
You get to see what's under their masks, sort of.

639
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,200
Yeah.

640
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:37,000
There's a scene where one of them lifts his, starts to lift his mask up and it's, I don't,

641
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,800
I wouldn't spoil it for you.

642
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,800
It's in 8D.

643
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,820
Of course, obviously no one can gaze upon the face of an amino acid.

644
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:43,820


645
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,780
And live.

646
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,760
Not to mention Rumble-rama, Sense Around.

647
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,220
And super high animation.

648
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,160
High animation?

649
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:57,740
Yeah.

650
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,120
Super high animation.

651
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,920
It's a stop motion animation done using only the buttocks to manipulate the stop motion

652
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,380
models.

653
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,660
It's art from what we call the backside of the brain.

654
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,300
The two lobes of the hemisphere viewed.

655
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,200
Viewed from the posterior angle.

656
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:16,780
Yeah.

657
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,480
Salvador Dali and Curly from the Three Stooges collaborated on a stop motion film.

658
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,320
Oh really?

659
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,920
It was a remake of King Kong.

660
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,960
It was done by Heine Mention.

661
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,080
And he did those covers from the Jackie Gleason Lonesome Echo.

662
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,820
Jackie Gleason Lonesome Echo?

663
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,220
Yeah.

664
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,100
Jackie Gleason and Salvador Dali shaking hands.

665
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,860
Where is my camera?

666
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,900
My still camera?

667
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,740
Oh, you have it.

668
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,120
Oh.

669
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,580
I hope you're catching all this cleavage, Princess Wee.

670
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,280
She's a good wife.

671
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,920
She helps me girl watch.

672
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,560
You just want to zoom in, I think.

673
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,680
Is it my boobs?

674
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,640
It might be.

675
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,280
It was my boobs a minute ago.

676
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,040
Well, but yeah, you were smothering your microphone.

677
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,540
They're like radar domes causing this feedback.

678
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,600
Deer Tractor Beam, Deer Tractor Beam, Deer Tractor Beam, Deer Tractor Beam will be followed

679
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,440
by the concert from the dulcet warbling of Fat Mandy.

680
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,620
The sensation of Pittsburgh.

681
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,820
That's easy to remember in all the gay time.

682
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:29,820
If you were here last evening, you experienced an incredible show from this particular artist

683
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,080
who is just amazing.

684
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:40,020
So amazing that we brought her back for another even more special act.

685
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,420
So, we're going to do a little bit of a dance.

686
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,420


687
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,680
We have Fat Mandy.

688
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,740
Thank you, Pisces.

689
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,600
Give it up for Pisces who's putting this all together.

690
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,500
Isn't she beautiful, ladies and gentlemen?

691
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,780
You know, without all y'all coming out this evening, none of this would be necessary.

692
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,800
So, I thank y'all so much for coming out here to X Day.

693
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,580
I'm looking forward to celebrating.

694
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,600
And experiencing the end of the world with each and every one of you.

695
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,240
Thank you so much.

696
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,340
My name is Fat Mandy.

697
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,740
I'm going to rewind my band.

698
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,420
Here we go.

699
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,820
This song is called Dreamland.

700
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,860
Oh, that I met you in dreamland.

701
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,800
There I could have said the thoughts spinning round and round.

702
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,560
Like bees inside my mind.

703
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,960
Sweet honey thoughts and sweet honey dreams.

704
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,660
Warmest summer wine.

705
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,180
Kissing your beautiful lips.

706
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,100
Like the dreams inside not mine.

707
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,880
No one knows how our story goes.

708
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,360
When I keep it inside of me.

709
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,380
Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to pretend that we are free.

710
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,000
Free of the rules.

711
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,660
Free of the plans.

712
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,180
Made by pink folk.

713
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,060
Is it so wrong to love you?

714
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,440
I swear this is no joke.

715
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,400
I wish I'd met you in dreamland.

716
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,320
There we'd always know.

717
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,460
How much I really could love you.

718
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm awake, it's time to go.

719
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,400
Cause I'm no lotus eater.

720
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,840
I can't sleep awake.

721
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,980
My dreams they come true.

722
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,040
They come at night.

723
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,980
But when I'm kissing my pillow.

724
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,040
It's you I'm holding so tight.

725
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,680
Try to meet me in dreamland.

726
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,400
That'd be super fun.

727
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,240
If I could meet you in dreamland.

728
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,180
I'd dream you were mine.

729
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,500
Praise Bob ladies and gentlemen and everybody in between.

730
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,620
We have come here to Brushwood.

731
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,040
To Brushwood Folklore Center to await the aliens.

732
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,020
Which will be joining us this evening.

733
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,060
To take us away from all of this pink insanity.

734
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,160
I don't know about your pleasure Dom.

735
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,320
But on mine each and every one of you is gonna be there.

736
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,160
You try to meet me in dreamland.

737
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,000
There our love is pure.

738
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,080
I'll be the one with the roses.

739
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,220
And every.

740
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,180
One of them is yours.

741
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh.

742
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,640
Woo!

743
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,580
Woo!

744
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,800
Thank you so much.

745
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,360
It is absolutely a pleasure to sing for you.

746
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,320
Fat Man D.

747
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,120
We had her twice at X Day and then at Starwood.

748
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,440
But only once there.

749
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,220
You might have her at www.fatmand.com.

750
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,660
That's P-H-A-T-M-A-N-D-E-E.com.

751
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,300
Incidentally at subgenius.com you can find numerous photo galleries showing all these X Day peoples and events.

752
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,360
Just go to the events section off the homepage and start poking around.

753
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,100
Now another tradition at X Days is the burning of the Dobbs head.

754
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,220
And the other sacred things like our integrity and our morals.

755
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,120
Atop a big bonfire in the mysterious Brushwood Roundhouse.

756
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,600
Led by yours truly Reverend Stang as recorded on location and heavily edited here.

757
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,340
It's cold.

758
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,980
It's cold and it's dark.

759
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,780
This is the way the future's gonna be friends.

760
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
For those who are left on earth.

761
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
Cold and dark.

762
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,960
Oh I hear that gasp.

763
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,760
Hey!

764
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,580
Praise Jason!

765
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,320
Fire Master of the Gods!

766
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,100
Yes this is the man who stole the secret of fire from the gods.

767
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Boy is he in trouble.

768
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,420
Ooh la la.

769
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,860
Look at that thing go.

770
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:24,540
And now we see lit up the fabulous Dobbs head icon representing in simplified form the face of our guru.

771
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,760
Who we sacrifice every year in hopes that maybe this will be the year.

772
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,080
Friends you'll notice in the front here is a replica of Dobbs.

773
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,880
Bob's pipe.

774
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,980
And I don't mean the one up there.

775
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,300
I mean this one down here.

776
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,100
It's full of magnesium.

777
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,360
And if you stick your face in there it will burn forever.

778
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,160
But who cares.

779
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,640
In fact it would probably make a good picture.

780
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,820
Now if any young ladies want to take all of their clothes off.

781
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,120
I'm sure that the fire is now warm enough that you won't catch cold or anything.

782
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,640
Just a suggestion.

783
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,560
Any obese men who want to take their clothes off are welcome too.

784
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,360
Any titties are better than none.

785
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,460
Oh yes.

786
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:28,020
Friends I want you to know that this round house is a sacred and holy place to the religious pagans who frequent this campground.

787
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,200
And the defiling that we're doing will last at least two or three weeks.

788
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,260
It's going to take a lot of holiness to re-holify this spot.

789
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,220
Music is being provided by rival cult leader Dennis Murphy.

790
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,360
Leader of the cult of the living bull.

791
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,640
Bull!

792
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,140
Bull!

793
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,940
Any other bull shitters want to join me in a chant of bull?

794
00:40:59,340 --> 00:40:59,840
I do!

795
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,720
On three.

796
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,600
One, two, three.

797
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,180
Bull!

798
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,720
Bull!

799
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,140
You are now members of the cult of the living bull congratulations.

800
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,580
That's actually the secretly the coolest cult of them all.

801
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:23,260
Thank god I'm deaf and can't hear the comments from the peanut gallery.

802
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,320
It's wonderful having a loud horn and deafness.

803
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,380
Everything is so much funnier that way.

804
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,020
Yes it is.

805
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:40,240
It's amazing how humans will stand around staring at a bright light flickering for no reason.

806
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:51,940
Now friends, while you're dancing around this big fire, remember that for the last 150,000 years, this was television.

807
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,440
This is what people did instead of watching ER.

808
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,500
I don't know how they did it.

809
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh, the Bible, friends, the Bible is about to go in apparently.

810
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:14,260
This Bible was taken from a Motel 8 last year and replaced with pamphlet number one.

811
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,600
Okay, well when we're finished burning the Bible, we have to burn pamphlet number one.

812
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,620
Yeah, burn it! It's a shit product!

813
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
It's funny when you put your glasses on.

814
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,440
It's funny when you put your glasses on.

815
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,880
It's funny when you put your glasses on.

816
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,320
It's funny when you put your glasses on.

817
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,440
Large, large, large, large heads though.

818
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,900
Yes.

819
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,040
Well, and they're all wearing glasses too.

820
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,260
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

821
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,620
Yes, that pretty much describes the subgeniuses of X-Day Drill 12 in that tiny collage by The Large.

822
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,580
And now we'll take a short break from X-Day for a little excerpt from an audiobook by Terry Pratchett.

823
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,460
A man-at-arms in which the great, if unsaved and unknowing subgenius,

824
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,760
describes a character who embodies...

825
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,240
to me anyway, a not uncommon type of subgenius,

826
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,200
albeit, in this case, a Discworld subgenius.

827
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,960
Foul old Ron was a Beggar's Guild member in good standing.

828
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,060
He was a mutterer, and a good one.

829
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,760
He would walk behind people muttering in his own private language until they gave him money not to.

830
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,140
People thought he was mad, but this was not technically the case.

831
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,160
It was just that he was in touch with reality on the cosmic level,

832
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,760
and had a bit of trouble focusing on things smaller, like other people, walls, and soap.

833
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,780
Although on very small things, such as coins, his eyesight was Grade A.

834
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,760
Therefore, he was not surprised when a handsome young woman streaked past him and removed all her clothes.

835
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,240
This sort of thing happened all the time, although up until now only on the inner side of his head.

836
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,880
Then he saw what happened next.

837
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,120
He watched as the sleek golden shape streaked away.

838
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,080
I told him... I told him... I told him...

839
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,860
He said, I'll give him the wrong end of a ragman's trumpet, so I shall.

840
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,780
I told him... I told him... I told him...

841
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,480
Bugger him, bugger him, millennium-handed shrimp, I told him...

842
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,220
I told him... I told him...

843
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,520
I told him... I told him...

844
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,660
He says he thinks it is mixed up with the murder of Mr. Hammerhock.

845
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,580
He says, talk to the fools.

846
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,440
He says, do it.

847
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,020
Also, please find attached piece of paper.

848
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,940
Captain Vimes says, try it out on the alchemists.

849
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,920
Sergeant Colon stopped reading for a while to curse all alchemists.

850
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,300
Because it is puzzling evidence.

851
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,840
Hoping this fun...

852
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,720
Finds you in good health.

853
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,200
Yours faithfully, Carrot Iron Founderson, CPL.

854
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,020
The sergeant scratched his head.

855
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,280
What the hell did that all mean?

856
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,840
Just after breakfast, a couple of senior jesters from the Fool's Guild had come in to pick up the corpse.

857
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,140
And the whole point was just to talk about X-Day.

858
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,680
Somehow we got off on this, uh, who's dead this week thing, you know, because there were lots of famous people died.

859
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,100
Carl Marldon died the other day.

860
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:58,580
Marldon.

861
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,280
Yes, Carl Marldon.

862
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:00,860
Marldon.

863
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,840
Yeah, the, uh...

864
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,180
The coolest nose in the biz.

865
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,120
Don't leave home without it.

866
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,360
Oh, right, right, right.

867
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,860
I won't.

868
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,580
Phineas and Puzzling.

869
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:19,040
On the pre-X-Day Puzzling Evidence Special, you can acquire those KPFA Berkeley shows from quiveringbrain.com, if you look carefully.

870
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,860
Or from nationalcynical.com.

871
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,360
Likewise, you may have preferred the following from subgenius.com.

872
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,800
I typed this myself, and yet I don't really understand it.

873
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,220
Uh...

874
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,180
Automatic writing.

875
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:41,400
Five o'clock, uh, no, seven o'clock, lost finale viewing and gang war.

876
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,080
It's written as if those were the same event.

877
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,680
That's...

878
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:51,180
I took it to mean that the wimps who were lost fanatics, which actually includes me,

879
00:45:51,460 --> 00:46:01,840
uh, would be at Cuigibow Station, uh, arguing while the more, uh, manly, strong, bold, uh,

880
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:01,840


881
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,180
ballsy characters like Pisces here would be, uh, actually physically duking it out.

882
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,640
I was thinking...

883
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,600
Or whatever.

884
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,720
You know, in subgenius land, gang war could mean a group orgy.

885
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,860
It being, sex being the eternal battle.

886
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,380
Love is a battlefield.

887
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,840
Whatever that means.

888
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,100
So this is starting right now, your, this moment as we speak.

889
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,220
No, that's at seven o'clock.

890
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,580
Oh.

891
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,840
What's starting right now is supposed to be open mic preaching.

892
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,820
Now, I'm not...

893
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,140
I'm having trouble finding replacements just for sitting on your ass preaching.

894
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,440
Uh, every time I...

895
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,500
Even, even Susie gets tired of sitting up here rattling.

896
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:53,400
But I know that Dr. Howell could talk literally forever if he had an audience.

897
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,140
And I probably could too.

898
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,220
So to prevent that, we need the volunteers.

899
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,260
Well, this, this is the funny thing.

900
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,060
Is that every, every, all the time I hear people swear they're going to rant.

901
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,580
There was a guy named Jim Jones who swore he had a rant one time.

902
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,220
That's right.

903
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,300
Crazy Jim Jones.

904
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,780
That is crazy Jim Jones.

905
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,980
Dude, I can turn the mic on in that pulpit any time.

906
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,300
That's what people told me a number of times.

907
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:17,980
No, no, no.

908
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,760
Crazy, crazy, crazy Jim Jones.

909
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:27,040
Friends, you've all heard of Jonestown, the amazing massacre or self-massacre that we've

910
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
all been, we're working our way up to.

911
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,640
Bunch of pussies.

912
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,240
We only know that we're going to be there for a few days.

913
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,240


914
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,240


915
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,240


916
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,880
We need about five, 10 times as many people as we're getting at these things and we'll

917
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,080
be.

918
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,340
Anyway, friends, crazy Reverend Jim Jones.

919
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,720
Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages.

920
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,940
Now, there's some people that heard me talk that say that I sound just a little bit like

921
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,700
Terrence McKenna.

922
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,760
So I think I'm going to have to give you this preface right now so that there aren't any

923
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,940
unrealistic expectations.

924
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:58,920
Number one.

925
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,280
I will not be telling you that DMT will make you enlightened.

926
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,960
We will not be discussing self-transforming machine elves.

927
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,220
We're not going to be talking about catapulting your mind to somewhere else.

928
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:11,720
No.

929
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:16,360
Well, actually, you know, we're probably going to be talking about that, but not with DMT.

930
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,000
No, it's easier for us because all we've got to do is have Bob.

931
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,220
All we need to do is pay our $30 and there you go.

932
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,200
Which speaking of our $30 and since we're here in Brushwood, Starwood's coming soon.

933
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,940
I'll tell you a little story.

934
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,780
I went to Brushwood a couple of years ago and for some reason people thought, you know

935
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:35,980
what?

936
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,820
I'm just going to tell you what I'm thinking.

937
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,880
I'm just going to walk up to you and tell you exactly what I think.

938
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,580
And so I was sitting there hanging up and this guy walked up to me and he was a dude

939
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,200
with dreadlocks.

940
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,840
And one of the things I've noticed about a dude with dreadlocks is they always seem to

941
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,100
have three pounds of frops and common street marijuana.

942
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,180
And they also seem to be, have women like oozing out of their pockets.

943
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,180


944
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,360
And they're like, oh, that's a horse.

945
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,380
It's kind of nasty, but that seems to be their thing.

946
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:07,700
So these guys would walk up to me and say, the hair flip by the way is really important.

947
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,760
That shows that that's the way if you didn't doubt their long flowing dreadlocks, sort

948
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,280
of like an antenna to hipness, you know, you'd see them and they'd say, yeah, brother, I

949
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,900
was sitting there smoking like three pounds of hash while this girl was giving me three

950
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,420
blow jobs at once.

951
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,600
And, and.

952
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,940
Oh my God.

953
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,140
And I'd say, you know what, sir, that's nice.

954
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,200
And then somebody else would come and say, yeah, I just had this great spiritual experience

955
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,060
where like my ego dissolved and it was amazing.

956
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,900
And I said, well, and I would say, you know, that's cool.

957
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,540
That's cool.

958
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,260
But I know something better.

959
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,040
I know something much better than that.

960
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,140
And they'd say, no, well, you know, after that I had two pounds of marijuana.

961
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,360
And then.

962
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:57,580
Oh, my God.

963
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,960
And like I realized that everything's the same brother.

964
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,740
And I said, wow, that's cool.

965
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,100
But I know something better.

966
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,620
And they say, what do you know, son?

967
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,760
And I'd say, yeah, you know, you know, Jr. Bob Dobbs.

968
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,400
That's what I know.

969
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,660
Yes.

970
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,600
Praise Bob.

971
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,340
Praise Bob.

972
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,880
And I said that, you know, I don't need fro.

973
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,360
But it's nice.

974
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,620
I don't need the idea of the pinks burning in an eternal flame.

975
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,560
That will go on for years.

976
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:27,760
I don't need the

977
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:27,880
beyonds.

978
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,860
But it's nice.

979
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,340
All I need is that face that.

980
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:34,800
Yeah.

981
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,560
That face.

982
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,580
That face that's right behind me.

983
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,480
That's beaming on us all right now.

984
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,020
That face that is there with you every day.

985
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,080
It's in your mind now.

986
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,040
It's deep in your mind.

987
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,900
And this gentleman looked at me and said, so you're one of those people.

988
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,820
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I am one of those people.

989
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,620
I'm one of those people that got right with Bob.

990
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,780
And come 1998, July 15th.

991
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:04,780


992
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,880
7 a.m.

993
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,720
I'm going to be one of those people in the pleasure saucers.

994
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,820
Oh, yes.

995
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,440
Thank you.

996
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:21,600
Now, I heard that they're not done setting up the shwags, the slack, shwag shack.

997
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:29,040
Which is fine because that just means people might fight even harder than they would before.

998
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,980
That means that all the Bobbies, which as someone who is a Bobbie.

999
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,880
A professional creepy Bobbie.

1000
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,760
I know all about that.

1001
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,960
We come from Princeton, New Jersey.

1002
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,340
A fine school producing creepy Bobbies for decades by now.

1003
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:45,860
Oh, yes.

1004
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,020
Yes, I'm getting the thumbs up from Reverend Stang.

1005
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,280
He knows about the creepy Bobbies.

1006
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,740
He probably gets emails from the creepy Bobbies.

1007
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,800
Oh, yes.

1008
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,460
From Princeton.

1009
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:55,760
See?

1010
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,620
There you go.

1011
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,960
The creepiest.

1012
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,860
I mean, it's like something straight out of the Mercs of New Orleans.

1013
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,360
Probably creepy Bobbies going.

1014
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,240
Give me slack.

1015
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,300
Slack.

1016
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,080
Is that about right?

1017
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,740
I'm guessing so.

1018
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,740
That's probably how they sound.

1019
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,440
Oh, yeah.

1020
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,960
Well, you know, they're thinking, you know, maybe if I just get somebody else's slack.

1021
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,260
Maybe if I just get a little closer.

1022
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:25,300
Yes.

1023
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,880
And then they try and steal your slack.

1024
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,540
But there is a way out.

1025
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, yes.

1026
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:33,800
Oh, yes.

1027
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,340
Oh, yes.

1028
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,300
I will show you the way.

1029
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,680
Oh, yeah.

1030
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,680
The way is first to stare at that Dobbs head.

1031
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,320
Feel the Dobbs head.

1032
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,460
Now, there are some people say that you should get a tattoo of the Dobbs head like on the

1033
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,860
inside of your mouth if you're having problems.

1034
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:53,340
That way you know Bob is inside of you, which I've heard the rumors.

1035
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,000
Some people, it's their thing.

1036
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,860
I myself just prefer to, you know.

1037
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,200
I know.

1038
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,080
Eyelid porn.

1039
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,860
Eyelid under the tongue.

1040
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,580
Oh, yeah.

1041
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,880
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,440
I've heard maybe you might be able to get like, you know, Bob tattooed on the back of

1043
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,160
your eyeballs.

1044
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,480
Then you see Bob forever.

1045
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,180
Oh, that's fantastic.

1046
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,820
Oh, yes.

1047
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,260
Preach on, preach on.

1048
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,860
Preach on.

1049
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,880
Want to hear it?

1050
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,400
Here it goes.

1051
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,580
Testify.

1052
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,600
Testify.

1053
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,860
I will tell you about how I found Bob.

1054
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,280
Yes.

1055
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,380
Yes.

1056
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,860
There was a time when the Reverend Jim Jones hated Bob.

1057
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,380
He looked about Bob and he spat on Bob.

1058
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:33,860
He was like, oh, Bob.

1059
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1060
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1061
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1062
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1063
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1064
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1065
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860


1066
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,600
Yes, I was one of them men.

1067
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Oh, it was true.

1068
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,140
I testify.

1069
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,880
I was one of those men that looked back on Bob and said he was one of those people.

1070
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,520
I looked at the subgenius and they said they were some of those people.

1071
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,500
I know.

1072
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,260
I know.

1073
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,780
You might want to think that I came screaming out of that womb saying praise Bob with a

1074
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,380
Bob t-shirt, but it ain't so.

1075
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,900
And I'll tell you, that's a good thing.

1076
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,920
A good thing.

1077
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,660
Because that means that there are those people, those people that hate Bob.

1078
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:03,860
They hate Bob.

1079
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:03,860


1080
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,420
Those people that ain't straight with the way.

1081
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,940
Those people that ain't paid their $30.

1082
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,620
Those people that don't understand that it's being cool to be a Bobby.

1083
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,140
Oh, yeah, I know you're thinking no, but I'll tell you what happened.

1084
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,760
I know that, hey, maybe they will as long as they didn't pay their $30.

1085
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,200
But we know the pinks are going to burn.

1086
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,840
Oh, yeah, we know the pinks are going to burn.

1087
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,060
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,500
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

1089
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,960
I got a story about the pinks.

1090
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,840
I got a story about those chemicals.

1091
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:33,840


1092
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,840
I got a story about those camouflage pinks.

1093
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,580
Those people that you look at, you think, oh, my God, you're the Yeti.

1094
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,680
I think I can smell it.

1095
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,580
But then when you get talking to them, they open their mouth and they say, Bob, isn't he one of those people?

1096
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,740
And if I pay my $30, won't I become one of those people?

1097
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,840
And you know what?

1098
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:02,080
They say that and you think, man, maybe if I just hit you in the face enough, maybe if I do that, then you'll see.

1099
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,640
And then all they see is blunt force trauma.

1100
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,280
And that means they won't give their $30.

1101
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,640
But anyhow, in this story, I was sitting there hanging up.

1102
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,400
There were these people who were supposed to be the Rastafarians.

1103
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,120
And I thought, okay, sure, sure.

1104
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,400
You know, I understand that if I stay with subgeniuses too much, then, you know, the crazy will get worse.

1105
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,220
Things will start getting weird.

1106
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,180
I know.

1107
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,840
I know.

1108
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,740
And I thought, maybe I'm out.

1109
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:31,800
Maybe I'm out.

1110
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,420
Even when I preach the gospel, although the last time I did that, people's heads exploded.

1111
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,240
It got real nasty.

1112
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:55,140
Well, you know, when you start getting used to start feeling the presence of Bob, when you start feeling it, when you start feeling it in your spleen, in your soul, when you feel it in your wallet, when you feel it in your wallet and you want to give, the thing is not everybody can handle that.

1113
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,720
They're thinking, I need this money for this or this.

1114
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,280
Or if I get this, then I'll be happy.

1115
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,300
If I get a Porsche, then I'll be happy.

1116
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:09,060
When all they need to do is spend that 30 bucks and get straight with Bob, and then they will be happy.

1117
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,280
Oh, yeah.

1118
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:12,820
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,620
Praise Bob, indeed.

1120
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,760
Praise Bob.

1121
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,020
Praise Bob.

1122
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:19,580
But back to the original story, which was how I became a subgenius.

1123
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:23,280
You see, I had gone far off the path, and I had gone crazy.

1124
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,760
Hence the first part of my name, Crazy Reverend Jim Jones.

1125
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,760
It is a testament to when I was a pink myself.

1126
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,080
Oh, yes.

1127
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,180
When I hadn't awakened to my Yeti potential.

1128
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,760
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,400
Wake it up.

1130
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,760
Well, wake it up, and then I'll be walking it off.

1131
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,300
Now, I was sitting there, and they put me in a bad place.

1132
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,080
They put me in a mental home, and I was in the crazy house.

1133
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:53,040
And I was sitting there, and I was praying, and I was praying to Shiva or Tara, whoever, and I was sitting there praying away.

1134
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,120
And who should come?

1135
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,560
Who should come but Bob.

1136
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,360
And I say, Bob, dude, what are you doing here?

1137
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,780
I said, Tara.

1138
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,380
I didn't say Bob.

1139
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,000
I said, Tara.

1140
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,600
You ain't got two tits.

1141
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,720
You ain't got nine arms.

1142
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,140
And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1143
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,260
No, seriously.

1144
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,780
Seriously, seriously, seriously.

1145
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:17,240
She ain't coming, but I can help you out for the low, low rate of $30.

1146
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,480
He helped me out, and he can help you out, and then everything will be okay.

1147
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,000
And that is my rant.

1148
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,900
Thank you very much.

1149
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,420
Good night.

1150
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:27,580
Woo!

1151
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,620
Yeah!

1152
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,780
Praise Reverend Jim Jones.

1153
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,080
That's what we need.

1154
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,400
More useful Hour of Slack material.

1155
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,060
It's nice they didn't have too much cussing.

1156
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,540
That saves me a lot of work.

1157
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,500
I wish I could remember to do that.

1158
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,520
.

1159
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,020
What do you call the number on your phone?

1160
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,260
.

1161
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:01,500
You.

1162
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,780
.

1163
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,700
.

1164
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:02,920
You.

1165
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:02,920


1166
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:02,920


1167
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,420

1168

.

1169
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:03,780
.

1170
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,180
You.

1171
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,340
.

1172
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:12,780
.

1173
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:12,780


1174
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,480
Got it.

1175
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,440
15 from subgenius.com

1176
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,040

1180
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,400
Bob from whom all messings

1181
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,520
flow. The last thing you will hear

1182
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,180
is by the large, and remember

1183
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,840
it's never too late.

1184
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,420
Well, yes, it is getting rather late

1185
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,160
in the day here for some of us.

1186
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,480
Alright, well, perhaps it's time for us to sign

1187
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,400
off then and bear the

1188
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,960
beef fondue to our

1189
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,320
subgenius audience.

1190
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,120
Well,

1191
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,240
I'm not

1192
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,920
certain that I was suggesting it, but

1193
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,840
merely echoing the possibility

1194
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,860
that we might discontinue our

1195
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,520
award-winning broadcast and

1196
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,800
resume at the next conveniently

1197
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,720
available time.

1198
