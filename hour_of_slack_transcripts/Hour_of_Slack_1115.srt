1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Yes, no, I'd say you're in a good spot right now to really enjoy more pleasure in your favorite easy chair.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,340
More pleasure.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,200
More pleasure.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,580
On behalf of the Honolulu Police Department,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,480
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,640
as K-Boy proudly presents

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,120
The So Genius Hour of Swatches.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,180
Liz Martin.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
Why would I bite into a mouse?

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,500
No, yes.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
Yeah, but Bob's going to be there.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,840
Even if Bob did accidentally appropriate some of the silverware, I don't see why that's so serious.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,820
Well, gee, it's Bob.

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,300
Yes.

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,720
Bob is cute, and I'm going to dance to this.

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,340
Bob's a man that girls forget.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,620
I know, but he hasn't paid me yet.

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,200
Something stinks in Washington.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,980
The rotten stench comes from

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,680
President Bush.

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,600
And more specifically,

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,560
President Bush.

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,460
Rotting meat.

25
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,680
Lowered expectations.

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,920
President Bush.

27
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,840
Wearing a diaper.

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,520
Except that.

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,940
Far low.

30
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,620
Jam.

31
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,840
Jammed the Cold War.

32
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,780
Bush's idea.

33
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,800
Bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk.

34
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,640
I almost gagged.

35
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,220
Bush's impeachment.

36
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,780
Use a diaper for entertainment purposes.

37
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,640
Require more patience.

38
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,760
We've lost.

39
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,140
We've lost.

40
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,520
We've lost.

41
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,760
We've lost.

42
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,200
We've lost.

43
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,120
Remember the fall.

44
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,900
The grieving families we have lived.

45
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,000
And we've lost it, right?

46
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,960
Bathroom.

47
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,380
Manure.

48
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:17,660
Pit.

49
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:17,980
Manure.

50
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,300
Pit.

51
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,820
Cow manure.

52
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,740
Cow manure.

53
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:19,960
Manure.

54
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,620
Require more patience.

55
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,440
They want to sleep in manure pit.

56
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,260
They woke up in heaven.

57
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,440
They want to sleep in manure pit.

58
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,740
They woke up in heaven.

59
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,160
They woke up in heaven.

60
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,760
If we've lost I'm done.

61
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,680
If we've lost.

62
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm done.

63
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,840
If we've lost.

64
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm done.

65
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,480
I'm ê¿ˆ.

66
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,820
Shit.

67
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,000
Shit.

68
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,400
Manure.

69
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,620
Pit.

70
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,140
We've lost.

71
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,520
We've lost.

72
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,880
We've lost.

73
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,120
We've lost.

74
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,560
We've lost.

75
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,100
Manure.

76
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,400
Pit.

77
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,660
Shit.

78
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:33,940
Shit.

79
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,080
Shit.

80
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,220
Shit.

81
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,440
They want to sleep in manure pit.

82
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,700
They woke up in heaven Victory.

83
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,200
I would like to think everyone who keeps their mouth shut.

84
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,540
o

85
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,200
I would like to think everyone who keeps their mouth shut.

86
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,140
Sh.

87
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,360
I think that's a very good thing.

88
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,660
Do you believe that our culture is going to undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living?

89
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,160
Do you believe that our culture is going to undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living?

90
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:32,120
The messiness, the nastiness of the crash will come almost exclusively by those whose lifestyles are destroying the planet attempting to maintain that lifestyle.

91
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,020
The sooner civilization comes down, whether or not we help a crash, the more life will remain afterwards to support both humans and non-humans.

92
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,300
The sooner civilization comes down, whether or not we help a crash, the more life will remain afterwards to support both humans and non-humans.

93
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,760
We have no alternative. We must use all our nuclear weapons. May I suggest we join in prayer?

94
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,640
I can't see how prayers will help.

95
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,020
Oh yes, we can at least save our souls. We must either attack them now or surrender to them.

96
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
Some more trouble.

97
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,560
The military men want to use all our nuclear weapons and then resist them to the bitter end.

98
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
We'll be wiped out by the radioactivity.

99
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,340
We have a tiger at the front door and a wolf at the back.

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,700
What is that supposed to mean?

101
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,840
But there is another way of thinking about it. Perhaps we are clearly at a time of great potential crisis.

102
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,800
I mean, we have the news of destroying the planet, which we've never had in the history of man.

103
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,800
The plan that will destroy King Ghidorah.

104
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,520
We wish to borrow from you on Earth the monsters Godzilla and Rodan.

105
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,860
Are you serious?

106
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,060
Of course. Deadly serious.

107
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,880
Will you help us?

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,840
Well, your request is unusual. We don't know how to answer that.

109
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,720
First place, we don't even know what Godzilla and Rodan are.

110
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,460
Please, cut me some slack here, will you? I'll give you anything you want.

111
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,460
Excellent.

112
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,020
Meanwhile...

113
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,920
My God.

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,180
What is that?

115
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,140
What?

116
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,460
Can you be specific? There's not much time.

117
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,640
Yes, we know. What do the tests indicate?

118
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,100
The tape recorder here...

119
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,340
is being moved by magnetic waves.

120
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,320
The waves generated over there.

121
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,300
If we can shield it...

122
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,920
If we can intercept the waves...

123
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,860
It'll stop.

124
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,300
Can you solve the problem in such a short time?

125
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
The odds are long.

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,860
But we're making our final tests.

127
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:34,640
Woo-hoo!

128
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,340
Woo-hoo!

129
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
A submarine bomb exploded in a harbor might affect the city.

130
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,440
The affected area would be a poor picnic site.

131
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,120
But might be entered briefly with a varying degree of risk.

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,100
Rips is part of the pattern of daily routine.

133
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,840
Occupational hazards are accepted in a matter-of-fact manner in civilian life.

134
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,360
Here's Tom with the weather.

135
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,320
Hi, Susie. It's 420 degrees Fahrenheit here in South Central L.A. right now.

136
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,480
Probably a good time to get out of the f***ing city, Susie.

137
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,880
There's gust of lead coming up sunset.

138
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,420
Oh, God. I've been misinformed.

139
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,580
Increasing.

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,280
Captain?

141
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,860
Yes?

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,180
What is it?

143
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,600
Radioactivity's stronger.

144
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Uh-oh.

145
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,100
What?

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,700
I don't know.

147
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,020
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

148
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,540
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

149
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:32,940
Ah, feel that radioactivity wafting off of Reverend Susie the Floozy who cut that collage

150
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,760
from her show Bob's Slacktime Funhouse on WREK Atlanta, Prey Wreck.

151
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,060
This show, however, is the hour of Slack number 1115 from the Church of the Subgenius,

152
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,920
and this episode is focused on the conspiracy.

153
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,900
The conspiracy of all the normal people.

154
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,560
Uh, this show started with Le Mar's opening, and then there were two collages by the great

155
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,160
Reverend Norrell Preff, and DerekJensen.org did the musical interlude just before Susie's.

156
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,100
And we'll be hearing more unique Devo covers and some recordings from the devotional itself

157
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,080
at Fine Fan Con in Cleveland.

158
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,900
But first, we'd like to thank our sponsors.

159
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,380
And we'd like to thank the people who wrote the subtitles.

160
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,700
And we're going to ask you to pray and march forward to get your own arm load of subgenius

161
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,380
memorabilia.

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
There's no better time than now.

163
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,180
I think we've got ModaMac and other helpful sorts at the, um, Swag Shack.

164
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,900
But they are patients, let alone the Swag Shack, right across from the pool, where you'll

165
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,660
be able to buy the subgenius crap that you've always dreamed of owning.

166
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
Well, uh, y'know.

167
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
You're listening to the broadcast from Brushwood.

168
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,460
I hear the thing creeping up on us in the background.

169
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,520
As always, twas ever thus.

170
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,140
Oh, yeah, I guess.

171
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,980
Turned on is such an evocative phrase.

172
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,200
And so now we have video as well as audio documentation.

173
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,140
Folks, these tapes or whatever form of recording they may ultimately assume

174
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,020
might prove to be the most valuable documents of our time,

175
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,200
perhaps projected on clouds in the future of the dwindling days of the human race.

176
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,760
One can never tell.

177
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,540
Dobbs prophesied that the moon would be used as a gigantic drive-in movie screen, so to speak.

178
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,180
They might do that to disguise all their evil doings

179
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,280
and to put them in the dark.

180
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,580
I think it's a great idea to have that kind of a thing up there

181
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,580
because now we've got George W. Bush with his eye on the moon.

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,920
And he knows why he wants to be there and build a super-militarized moon base at the pole of the moon.

183
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,940
Of course, the pole is a good place to do it because you avoid the greatest extremes of temperature.

184
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,800
But critics have pointed out it's going to cost a vast fortune to keep these guys supplied with the necessities of life.

185
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,860
Why do they need to be on the moon anyway?

186
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,840
Didn't we go there?

187
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,360
But there is a reason.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,140
The golfing, for one thing.

189
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,700
Oh, yes.

190
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:28,380
The astronauts who went already hit a famous line drive on the lunar regolith.

191
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,360
But what Mr. Bush and his friends are actually angling for

192
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,600
is essentially the gas or oil of the future

193
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,680
because the petro-products from biological development on the planet Earth

194
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,500
will ultimately run dry, as everyone has known for some time.

195
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,080
But it turns out that the moon contains a strange and novel new source of power.

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,880
You can read all about it if you just type in a search to helium-3.

197
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Helium-3, only found on the moon.

198
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,060
A perfect source of clean nuclear reaction and the source of infinite energy.

199
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,780
An ironic aspect of that is that,

200
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,660
another chemical or mineral that can only be found on the moon is cavorite.

201
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,020
And you need cavorite to get to the moon.

202
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,660
No, they don't have cavorite.

203
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm sorry to correct you.

204
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,080
They were unable to create cavorite on the moon out of lunar elements.

205
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,460
Oh, I didn't know they had tried.

206
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,160
They tried.

207
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,300
They tried to create cavorite both in the movie and in the book.

208
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,140
In the book it was suggested.

209
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,780
He discourses on the difficulty of creating cavorite.

210
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,660
Otherwise he would try to leave.

211
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,780
His selenite friends would have helped him build another sphere.

212
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,360
But one reason that cavorite didn't work on the moon,

213
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,480
or it couldn't be composed on the moon,

214
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,060
was they didn't have any helium there.

215
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,840
Because the moon, being so light,

216
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,940
wouldn't allow the light gas helium to stay on its surface.

217
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,280
There's a large spider on my microphone which is inhibiting my broadcast.

218
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,780
I'm afraid it may jump on my face if I keep my silence.

219
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm afraid I'll get myself close enough.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,420
Zoom in.

221
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,680
Camera one, zoom in on that.

222
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,840
I'd rather just get him off here.

223
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,540
What's that thing inside your nose, Al?

224
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,400
Shadow.

225
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,880
Give him a blow.

226
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,740
They hate being blown on anyway, let alone being blown off something.

227
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
That is the sound of Dr.

228
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,980
You can hear the tiny footsteps of the spider as he crawls.

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,580
It's a hideous leaping spider.

230
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,840
All right, enough.

231
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,540
The spiders may try to stop us, folks.

232
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,780
But we're going to continue to keep our broadcast going no matter what.

233
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,780
Not only the arachnid forces, but certain of the insects are against our cause.

234
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,180
And they comprise a mightier army than one might suppose.

235
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm reminded of that wonderful Philip K. Dick story.

236
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,500
Did you read it about the guy who somehow makes an alliance

237
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,880
with some of the insects against some of the others?

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,120
Or maybe it's with the spiders.

239
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,400
And they say, well, we're glad you got in touch with us

240
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,180
because the insects are really planning something.

241
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,080
They're planning to wipe you out.

242
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,860
But now that we're on your side, we think that you can be saved.

243
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,100
And the guy says, oh, thank God.

244
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,300
I was really worried as I started to discover this.

245
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,940
What could be more horrible than being eaten by a million insects?

246
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,280
And the spiders say, well, it seems I'm sorry.

247
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,120
You didn't quite understand what we were saying.

248
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,700
You can't be saved.

249
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,860
We think your species can be saved.

250
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,080
You are about to be devoured.

251
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,540
You are about to be eaten by 10 million angry insects.

252
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,180
And the door bulges in ominously under the weight

253
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,740
of 10 zillion stridulating insects.

254
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,220
Yes, that Philip K. Dick was really quite a character.

255
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,100
He knew his elements, didn't he?

256
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,980
America's most beloved mentally ill science fiction author.

257
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,460
Now how Dick Cheney created Dick Cheney.

258
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,060
Door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door.

259
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,580
Dick Cheney.

260
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,880
Tax, tax.

261
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,420
I'd like to get him on the tax.

262
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,240
Vice, vice.

263
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,460
The package.

264
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,640
Congressman Dick.

265
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,560
Congressman Dick.

266
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,180
Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick.

267
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,340
Thank you for undertaking.

268
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,720
Thank you for undertaking.

269
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,660
Halliburton.

270
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,740
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

271
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,760
United States, a safe haven for terror.

272
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,560
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

273
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Guantanamo Bay.

274
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,800
Guantanamo Bay.

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,660
Shocks the conscience.

276
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,520
Shocks the conscience.

277
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,160
Cruel, cruel.

278
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,120
Did you find out, what did you find out?

279
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,900
Did you find out, what did you find out?

280
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,840
Expand on one.

281
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,600
Provide checks.

282
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,520
Halliburton.

283
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,260
Provide checks.

284
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,720
It is a real threat.

285
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
And the biggest threat.

286
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,640
Reckless.

287
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,160
Funch, funch, funch, funch.

288
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,340
Well, I think...

289
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,380
Number two.

290
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,380


291
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,740
I just wanted to mention a point that was shared with me by a friend once.

292
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,600
He said, rationalization is more important than food.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,340
Because you can go all day without eating.

294
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
That's for sure.

295
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,400
And there's no way you can go through a day without reassuring yourself some pleasant

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,760
bullshit that makes you feel better about your pathetic failure.

297
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,380
Dr. Howell, you won Tony.

298
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,380


299
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:27,120
Can you watch Mr.

300
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,220
Ruby today?

301
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,780
Well, I did see his pseudo reveal when they recorded

302
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,740
him on the calle portion of the ustedes...

303
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,500
Mm-hmmm.

304
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,380
... and even though I was like, smooth as mad, and we took too long tape

305
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,540
that

306
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,980
you really didn't do that dumbass thing.

307
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,500
And yet the incessant pummeling can ultimately cause the little clown

308
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,060
to lose the hot air with which it is filled.

309
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,100
But you don't have to worry about that with Dr. Howell or me.

310
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,800
That's quite true, but you don't want to end up the little clown

311
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,980
in the final tertiary stage, a mostly deflated sack

312
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,120
that is incapable of standing without any assistance.

313
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,860
So you only have a certain amount of bounce-backs.

314
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,200
However, the good news is the natural tendency is the bounce-back.

315
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,360
Thank you.

316
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,460
Thank you.

317
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,500
Thank you.

318
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,320
Thank you.

319
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,320


320
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,320


321
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,320


322
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,320


323
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,320


324
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,480
I don't know, Jack.

325
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,520
The tests are all right.

326
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,400
As a matter of fact, I think I got the figures right here.

327
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Yeah, you see, the oxygen content is...

328
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,580
What?

329
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,720
I don't care about the figures.

330
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,560
Why have I got a headache?

331
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,760
They're using magnetic waves.

332
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
That's where we have a chance.

333
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,840
If we are able to sever those waves, we can save the Earth.

334
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,880
Is there some electricity in the air?

335
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,900
Oh, no.

336
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,760
Is this...

337
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,820
Is this gonna...

338
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,840
Is this gonna set off the doomsday machine?

339
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,600
Say, George, that was quick thinking.

340
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,260
You crazy bitch.

341
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,340
Time is getting short. I better get on my speech.

342
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,040
...and putting them into camps.

343
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,260
All American citizens are to report to one of these death camps right away.

344
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,680
Did I say death camps? I meant happy camps,

345
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,960
where you will eat the finest...

346
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,360
meals...

347
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,660
have access to fabulous doctors

348
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,940
and be able to exercise regularly.

349
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,660
And that's the truth.

350
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,520
Police are investigating this man as a possible serial killer.

351
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,120
We reinforced our military efforts with more troops.

352
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,020
We also reinforced our military efforts with more troops.

353
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,460
We also reinforced our military efforts with more...

354
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,880
Killings.

355
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,400
Police are investigating this man as a possible serial killer.

356
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,900
Help.

357
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,860
Your arm is working perfectly, but there's a part that's not screwed on.

358
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,060
Let's have a look.

359
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,520
Let's have a look.

360
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,700
Excuse me.

361
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,260
Coming.

362
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,380
Coming.

363
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,600
Hang on.

364
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:11,860
Hang on.

365
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,860
I want you at the coke convention back in 1965.

366
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,320
You're the best red red executive I see heavily advertised.

367
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,240
You're the great red man whose daughter lips really brings buttons clean.

368
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,620
You're the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine.

369
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,780
Come now, gentlemen.

370
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,340
Your love is all I crave.

371
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,820
You're still in the circus when I'm laughing.

372
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,320
Laughing in my grave.

373
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,180
You were going to let us...

374
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,220
You can't escape from Bob.

375
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,020
That's the point.

376
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,240
You cannot escape.

377
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,100
They'll start growing on you when you want to get...

378
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
You decide, okay, I've had enough.

379
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,940
This subgenius thing is stupid.

380
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,420
And, well, that may be so.

381
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,260
But that doesn't mean that that tattoo of the Dobbs head...

382
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,940
Is going to go away.

383
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,760
In fact, it might form another one.

384
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,540
You might check your moles and warts to see if they've grown a little pipe-shaped extension.

385
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,460
You can't escape.

386
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,320
It gets in you.

387
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,200
Oh, this would be a good time for the sermon on the rubbers.

388
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,980
If I still have one, I could demonstrate it.

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,460
The Bob or the Connie rubber?

390
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,140
I do.

391
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah, here.

392
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,060
I kept this because, friends, this company, Condomania,

393
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,240
wrote to us about three or four months ago.

394
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,160
And said, actually, they contacted me on my MySpace page, of all things,

395
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,680
and said, we do condoms, and we're doing art condoms by cartoonists like Coop

396
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:59,300
and various other studly artists, and we wanted to put Bob on a condom.

397
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,780
And I said, oh, great.

398
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,540
You know, they'll pay us some little royalty.

399
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,720
And I said, there should also be a Connie-dom as well.

400
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,540
And I was real excited about that.

401
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,180
But when we finally got samples of them, really, just before X-Day,

402
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,680
I was really disappointed.

403
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,920
My heart was broken.

404
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Because although the Connie looks really nice on here, on the packaging,

405
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,020
you open it up, and it's just a plain, ordinary rubber.

406
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,740
The Connie is not printed on the rubber.

407
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,620
It's printed on the packaging.

408
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,640
That is pinkness, my friend.

409
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:38,940
Yeah.

410
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,220
Because, obviously, the whole thing is pink.

411
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,220


412
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,660
The whole thrill of a Bob condom is to see that distorted, swollen Bob head

413
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:52,360
and whatever kind of weird mutations it'll take on,

414
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,520
depending on what kind of knob it slid over.

415
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,960
And, you know, or a funny-looking Connie, depending on which one.

416
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,600
And then I got to thinking about it.

417
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,980
Of course the conspiracy would pink out on that.

418
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,220
Because, say, you were using a Connie, and you were printing a Connie,

419
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,000
and you were using...

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,400
Say you were lucky enough to have another person to use the thing with.

421
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,620
Yeah, you would have to have that.

422
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,360
Or if, like the old saw goes, you could actually fuck yourself.

423
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,480
At any rate, what if you, to be vulgar, pulled out,

424
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,520
and the Dobbs head was all runny, or maybe even completely washed off?

425
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,580
That would imply that you had left a Dobbs head inside of that orifice that you were using,

426
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
be it armpits.

427
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,080
Or whatever.

428
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,340
So, is that good or bad?

429
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,240
The problem is, what's the ink made of?

430
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,180
Of course you want to have a Dobbs head inside of you,

431
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,940
but what if it's made of toxic ink?

432
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,540
Prairie... Right.

433
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,540
Now, that would be the answer.

434
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,040
Dr. Howell suggested prairie squid ink.

435
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,220
If that were used...

436
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,640
I mean, nobody's going to object to that.

437
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,440
So I guess we need to write this company and go,

438
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,600
look, you're just...

439
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,800
As long as the Bob is only on the packaging and not the product,

440
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,300
it's not a Bob product.

441
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,080
It's a lie.

442
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,380
It's a conspiracy lie.

443
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:25,940
Anybody can stick a damn pipe-faced smiling square on their product,

444
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,740
but it ain't for real unless you can take it all the way up you

445
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,920
and still have that Dobbs head.

446
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,740
Yes, and how typical of the conspiracy and its productions

447
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,740
that it causes you to experience hope and anticipation,

448
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,120
and then you simply end up with something boring.

449
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,640
Right.

450
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
You think you're going to get...

451
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,180
It's not even a good balloon at this point.

452
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,140
No, it's just a plain old Coney Island whitefish.

453
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,200
But that's the conspiracy for you.

454
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,740
It lives, it advances by these increments of unhappiness that it produces,

455
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,520
like some gluttonous being that subsists upon sorrow.

456
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,420
Friends, we can't let X-Day be like this condom.

457
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,260
With Bob just on the outside.

458
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,940
Actually, I don't blame him for not showing up.

459
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,480
I mean, look what we do to that replica of him.

460
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,000
You're going to...

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,140
That is a replica, by the way, if anybody was confused.

462
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,700
That's not J.R. Bob Dobbs, but a cleverly constructed,

463
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,680
fabulously realistic mannequin or dummy.

464
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:37,420
It's necessary to have such an eidolon to concentrate the thoughts upon.

465
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,200
Thanks to Dr. Howell.

466
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,100
Thanks to Dr. Howell for the thought concentrations.

467
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,600
And you can also hear Dr. Howell weekly if you look at askdrhowell.com,

468
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:55,060
since he's on Pirate Cat Radio and the subgenius Puzzling Evidence sub-show

469
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,340
on kpfa.org every week.

470
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,020
Thanks also to Suzy the Floozy and Noro Pref for the collages.

471
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,600
But now, back to Thickhead with this new Devo cover

472
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,380
from the Cleveland band at myspace.com slash baditude.

473
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,100
We'll be right back.

474
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
I'd like to steal and I'd like to kill.

475
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

476
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,340
Go, go, go Speed Racer.

477
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,360
Go, go, go Speed Racer.

478
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,320
Go, go, go Speed Racer.

479
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,400
Go, go, go Speed Racer.

480
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm a Barbie doll, but I've got dreams

481
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
She's a Barbie doll, but she's got dreams

482
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,320
I've got dreams and I like to fuck

483
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,260
That's a fake, she likes to fuck

484
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
I'm your doctor and here's the bill

485
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,160
Please call the doctor and here's the bill

486
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,280
I like to steal and my name is Phil

487
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,320
That asshole steals and his name is Phil

488
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,340
I'm a speed racer and I drive real fast

489
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,380
I'm a big player and I like to steal

490
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,380
I'm a Barbie doll, but I've got dreams

491
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,280
I'm your doctor and here's the bill

492
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,380
I drive real fast, I'm gonna laugh

493
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,380
I like to drink and I like to kill

494
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,280
I've got dreams and I like to fuck

495
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,340
I like to steal and my name is Phil

496
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,640
I like to fuck

497
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm your doctor and here's the bill

498
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:51,180
Thanks for watching.

499
00:25:52,540 --> 00:26:08,140
See you next time.

500
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,260
Nazis and other eugenicists were stopped cold, they should have realized that you

501
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,520
can breed the biggest beefiest specimen but this is not necessarily going to be

502
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,640
the mover and shaker who causes history to happen, who gets things done. Rather, as

503
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:33,760
in R. Crumb's eloquent comic strip about cave people, Cave Wimp, it's often the

504
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,640
weird, bizarre, twisted nerd caveman who is actually making the Venus of Willendorf

505
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:47,160
statues just for masturbation objects but actually advancing human civilization and

506
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,720
art while the beefy, brawny mammoth hunters are out whooping it up around the tar pit.

507
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,400
We've often said that the first religion was created by the first near-sighted caveman,

508
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,600
the one who couldn't hunt.

509
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:03,740


510
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,340
They had the odd-nosed rabbit as an example.

511
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,380
The first human being was a sacrifice for the other cavemen but instead had the gift

512
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,440
of tricking and lying to the other cavemen to get them to bring him food.

513
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,580
Macular degeneration is a kind of large crossed bear in the Pleistocene.

514
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,300
It's a gift to our elderly people, macular degeneration, and it proves that it's

515
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,220
not the scariest monkey or the hairiest monkey, but the lairiest monkey that conceives and

516
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,740
begets.

517
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,740
Well, propaganda tells you that you'll be a lovable animal, that you'll have a

518
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:33,740


519
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:43,000
bumbling, nearsighted Mr. Magoo miraculously avoiding hideous embarrassment and extensive bodily injury.

520
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,340
But in real life, you head directly toward each embarrassment and painful wound.

521
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,720
There is no cartoon fate preventing you from stepping off the end of the swinging girder in space.

522
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,800
One must be ever more vigilant, even as the strength fades and the powers fail.

523
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,980
You may think it won't happen to you, but the flesh is weak. Only the spirit remains strong.

524
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,760
And weak.

525
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,460
And it's a good thing too, because if your self, if your sensorium were to last,

526
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,540
if you were to be immortal as the angels, then you could complain

527
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,700
as such.

528
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,240
As some of the fallen angels do.

529
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:36,060
That eternal strength and eternal being only help you feel eternal punishment.

530
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:46,020
Yes, death will let you off this wheel of ouches and pains, indignities.

531
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:53,620
There's nothing but that long, dreamless sleep in the ground to look forward to.

532
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,700
What about the subgenius?

533
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:56,700


534
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,980
The subgenius heaven with that pamphlet promise.

535
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,720
Well, are we going to take our sweating pimply bodies up to this subgenius heaven,

536
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:11,380
or are we going to have hyperbodies with perfumed sweat and jeweled pimples?

537
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,940
It all depends on which one of the mystics that you read.

538
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,520
And some of them mystic by a mile, I'm sure.

539
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,960
Well, Margaret, we've been gone for three days now.

540
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,840
My pimples have turned to diamonds.

541
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,260
And look, this scrofulous on the back of my neck is a fine gold dust.

542
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,740
Stang was right.

543
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,600
Of course, he was wrong, too, unfortunately.

544
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,820
But the other parts, the missing limbs and so forth, look, everything has become bejeweled.

545
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,580
Ticks, fleas, mosquitoes.

546
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,400
In revolt.

547
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,120
And active.

548
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,640
Revenge.

549
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,460
Shopping malls.

550
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,940
Not far away.

551
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,160
The churches.

552
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,780
Gang rape last month.

553
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,700
We've been doing this.

554
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,480
Yes, yes.

555
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,820
It's been really hot lately.

556
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,180
Go.

557
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,680
Heatwave.

558
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Other kinds of torture.

559
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,620
Circumcise them again.

560
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,460
I will do that.

561
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,160
Horrible crime.

562
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,860
Sexually assault.

563
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,400
Hitchhiking.

564
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,040
Pit bulls.

565
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,940
Held at gunpoint.

566
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,320
Drowning, hanging or electrocution.

567
00:29:59,460 --> 00:29:59,660
Scat.

568
00:29:59,680 --> 00:29:59,960
Clink.

569
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,200
Scat.

570
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,700
Crime.

571
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,100
Probe.

572
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,740
Participate.

573
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,580
Things are looking up.

574
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,200
It's not clear.

575
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,400
Debris is everywhere.

576
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,180
Pick up the pieces.

577
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,500
Public.

578
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,180
Remains in shock.

579
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,180
Private internet site.

580
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,120
Have a U.S. connection.

581
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,940
Distressed.

582
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,700
Do participate.

583
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,840
Nineteen.

584
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,340
Nineteen.

585
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,640
Okay.

586
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:12,860
Nineteen.

587
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,340
Nineteen.

588
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,740
I do not understand.

589
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,260
I saw the best minds of my generation.

590
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,380
The Ayatollah Khomeini.

591
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:27,740
Beep.

592
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:27,920
Beep.

593
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,280
Beep.

594
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,560
Beep.

595
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:28,780
Beep.

596
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:28,980
Beep.

597
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
Walk in space.

598
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,580
Simpson.

599
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,040
Simpson.

600
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,760
Guilty.

601
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,200
Walk in space.

602
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,960
Hostage crisis.

603
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,820
Nineteen.

604
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,320
Nineteen.

605
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,960
Oh push push.

606
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,500
Oh 81.

607
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,760
Nineteen.

608
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,280
Nineteen.

609
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,620
Revolution.

610
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,060
It happens, it happens.

611
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,760
It happens.

612
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,380
Nineteen.

613
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,660
Nineteen.

614
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,160
Destroyed.

615
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,940
Destroyed by madness.

616
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,200
1919 the Dancer.

617
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

618
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,860
1919.

619
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,120
He was 37.

620
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,740
Okay.

621
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,380
Of course, to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me.

622
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,340
It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any.

623
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,840
If that is so, then long life must be even more pointless.

624
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,280
No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.

625
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,600
We have reason.

626
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,260
It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La.

627
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,140
It came to me in a vision.

628
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,280
Long, long ago.

629
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,040
I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom,

630
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,820
but in the vulgar passions and the will to the world.

631
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:49,380
I saw the machine power multiplying until a single weapon man might match a whole army.

632
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,040
I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder,

633
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:06,580
would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure would be doomed to destruction.

634
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,820
I saw the power of the machine.

635
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,860
This vision was so vivid and so moving

636
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:20,540
that I determined to gather together all things of beauty and of culture that I could

637
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,420
and preserve them here,

638
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,440
against the doom toward which the world is rushing.

639
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,220
Look at the world today.

640
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,880
Is there anything more pitiful?

641
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,260
What madness there is.

642
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,460
What blindness.

643
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,440
What unintelligent leadership.

644
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,980
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity,

645
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,680
crashing headlong against each other,

646
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,220
propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.

647
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,900
The time must come, my friend,

648
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,480
when this orgy will spend itself.

649
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,820
When brutality and violence will be the same.

650
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,600
And the lust for power must perish by its own sword.

651
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,860
That con-

652
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,560
against that time,

653
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,580
the con-

654
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,340
is why I avoided death and am here.

655
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,240
And why you were brought here.

656
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,140
For when that day comes,

657
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,440
the world must begin to look for a new life.

658
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,220
And it is our hope that they may find it here.

659
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,100
For here we shall be,

660
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,400
with their books and their music,

661
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:01,040
and a way of life based on one simple rule.

662
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,220
Be kind.

663
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,780
When that day comes,

664
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,320
it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La

665
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,980
will spread throughout the world.

666
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,220
The End

667
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That was from the 1930s film by Frank Capra called Lost Horizon.

668
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:38,140
Only that was the part of the High Llamas rant that was cut by the conspiracy from the movie,

669
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:45,940
and tucked away for 70 years until the restored version, which I downloaded.

670
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,480
The music in the background, by the way, dear friends, is by Speed Cave.

671
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,020
This was handed to me at the devotional, and I love it.

672
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,200
Speed Cave.

673
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,100
Before all of that, friends, we heard two Norell Pref collages from norellpref.com.

674
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,160
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave with Dr. Howell at 10X Day.

675
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,840
Now let's go back to the devotional on August 25th, 2007 in Cleveland,

676
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,540
with some excerpts from the devotional sermon.

677
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,780
It's always been the crazy people,

678
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,660
the so-called losers, the weirdos, the fringe,

679
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,880
that have had the insanity and the ovaries,

680
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,420
to stand up against City Hall.

681
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,720
You'd have to be crazy to think you could beat City Hall.

682
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,820
And yet, every now and then, some crazy person,

683
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,040
or some crazy band,

684
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,760
does that very thing!

685
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,640
You have the freedom, my friend, to repent of your sinlessness,

686
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,240
to grab slack by the collar and scream in its face,

687
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,540
and say, this is my life!

688
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,040
And I will, you may make me take that pee test,

689
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,440
you may make me clock in at 8, 8.30 in the morning,

690
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:27,980
but you can never have what's inside my perverted, sick, de-demented head!

691
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,280
I can't believe why it seems like a cancer,

692
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,600
my love, that I'm badly hurt,

693
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:55,680
and I just want to reimagine what happened to you.

694
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,240
It's all because, of grey and anger and race,

695
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,240


696
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
I give you all through violence,

697
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,240


698
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:16,660
Thank you.

699
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,440
Thank you.

700
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,160
Thank you.

701
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,580
Thank you.

702
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,140
Thank you.

703
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,660
Thank you.

704
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:11,920
Thank you.

705
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,720
Thank you.

706
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,400
Thank you.

707
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,640
Thank you.

708
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,560
Thank you.

709
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,540
Thank you.

710
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,540
Thank you.

711
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,140
Thank you.

712
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,540
Thank you.

713
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


714
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


715
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


716
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


717
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


718
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


719
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


720
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


721
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,540


722
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,960
So, friends, the reason you all are here because of Slack.

723
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,460
You have enough Slack to get away from your job,

724
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,140
or your panhandling or whatever you do to come here and

725
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,840
hang out.

726
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,700
And, you know, the normal human,

727
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,240
the average ordinary garden variety Earth man,

728
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,340
The pink boy, we call them.

729
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,320
They have a lot of nasty words for us, and we have just as many for them.

730
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,200
The mediocratons, the Barbies and Kens, the cage dwellers, the pink boys.

731
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,900
The pink boys don't believe in slap, my friend.

732
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,900
They can only get satisfaction from taking away somebody else's slap,

733
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,760
from power over others, and from having lots of things.

734
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
It's all me, me, me, me.

735
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,820
We call them meanderthals.

736
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,840
Are you a youanderthal, my friend?

737
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,800
I'm a Bobanderthal.

738
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,060
I just decided that.

739
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,140
We made that up this very morning.

740
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,000
And really, as far as the belief thing goes,

741
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,780
we believe in everything, but we don't believe in anything.

742
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,760
Question authority.

743
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,700
Somebody's been reading their pre-scriptures.

744
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,740
We don't believe in magic or science.

745
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,100
You know.

746
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,580
People go, well, you're reverend saying,

747
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,600
you sound kind of like a secular humanist rationalist or something.

748
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,500
Don't you hate any religions?

749
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,520
Actually, I wasn't raised under any religion.

750
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,060
I don't have, no nuns hit me on the knuckles,

751
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:25,060
or I wasn't forced to handle snakes and then fail to do it properly.

752
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,920
I don't really have, I just always found it really interesting.

753
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,980
You know, at first, like everybody else,

754
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,760
we all remember that first walk at age 11,

755
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,100
or whatever, down the occult aisle of the used bookstore.

756
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,560
And coming upon these paperbacks that were full of,

757
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,420
it's like, if this stuff is true,

758
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,140
this is the most important thing in the world.

759
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,740
This is much more important than that economics degree in college.

760
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,780
And man, I believed.

761
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,820
I joined so many belief systems.

762
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,460
It was great.

763
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,340
It was a lot of fun.

764
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,280
And, but ultimately, you know,

765
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,440
eventually the UFO photos,

766
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,980
they find the model in the guy's attic.

767
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,720
The Bigfoot tracks, they find the big wooden foot.

768
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,820
You know, the old lady wearing the suit admits who she was wearing.

769
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,300
All this kind, and they never can make it work in the lab worth a hoot.

770
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,180
But, we don't know whose aquarium we're in.

771
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,840
You know, when you feed your fish,

772
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,480
they don't know that it's you feeding them.

773
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,500
They don't know where that food comes from.

774
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,400
To you, to them, you're just a cloud.

775
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,980
It comes by and stuff drops in.

776
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,760
We don't know what aquarium we're in.

777
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:49,000
I used to sit with my little son watching Beavis and Butthead on MTV.

778
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,620
And Beavis and Butthead would be watching these music videos

779
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,000
and mocking them, you know, putting them down.

780
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,500
Praise Beavis!

781
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,940
Praise Cornholio.

782
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,380
We, and my son,

783
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,800
my son and I would sit there critiquing Beavis and Butthead critiquing MTV.

784
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,780
And at a certain point, I kind of had to go...

785
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,200
How far up?

786
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,280
You know, we're all puppets, I guess.

787
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:30,720
And, you know, there could be any number of layers of puppeteers, you know.

788
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,600
There's a puppet that can work a puppet.

789
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,360
And some other puppets working that puppet.

790
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,440
Now, I don't see any of us with strings on our fingers,

791
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,040
so that indicates to me that we're kind of at the bottom of the line on the stage.

792
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,340
We're the ones way down...

793
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,600
We're the expendable puppets, I suppose.

794
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,500
So, I gave up on even rationalizing.

795
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,660
Although that is...

796
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,700
As Carter LeBlanc, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, quoted to me the other day,

797
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,060
rationalizing is more important than food.

798
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,720
Because you can go for an hour without food.

799
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,740
So, we now believe in irrationalizing, which works better.

800
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,420
It's kind of like the term subgenius.

801
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,320
It's very all-inclusive.

802
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,860
True, we won't allow geniuses in, but almost everybody else qualifies.

803
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,100
And you can...

804
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,520
There's ways to make yourself less of a genius.

805
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,480
We have ways to get rid of those excess brain cells.

806
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,940
See me after the show and I can set up a demonstration of FROP inaction.

807
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,140
That is the inaction of FROP.

808
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,980
Listen, I hear a story a long time ago about you and some prairie dogs.

809
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,280
Yeah, I do understand.

810
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,340
As long as he and what he represents remains alive in this country,

811
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,860
we've got the greatest nation in the world.

812
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,260
Wait, who is he?

813
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,860
The Loneger.

814
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,840
Endless!

815
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:05,960
FROP!

816
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,700
The Loneger realized he wore a hideous mask resembling a skull,

817
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,240
with curved horns protruding from a wig of dyed porcupines.

818
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,900
He was a white man.

819
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,500
Kind of worried about Indian trouble.

820
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,460
Indian trouble?

821
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,280
Look.

822
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,940
I knew those blood-thirsty devils, you know.

823
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,000
Do what I say.

824
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:27,600
What is it?

825
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,100
Break half.

826
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:28,820
Bang them.

827
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,780
Arm sides.

828
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,640
I'll do it.

829
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,660
Another thing.

830
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,560
A white horn.

831
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,800
What do you mean?

832
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,660
I told you.

833
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,660
A white horn.

834
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,400
How?

835
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,160
Here.

836
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,520
Yeah?

837
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,220
Yeah?

838
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,640
Yeah?

839
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,920
Where were you and your friend?

840
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,520
Selling a lot of whiskey to the Indians.

841
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,280
Come on, then.

842
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,400
The Loneger reached the camp.

843
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,140
Hold it tight.

844
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,120
You're right.

845
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,160
Who are you?

846
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,560
A path.

847
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,220
I remember I said, break on.

848
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:52,960
That's right.

849
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,520
Come on, then.

850
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,480
The Loneger told an ominous story.

851
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,560
From the bro-bodies of several dead Indians, the Loneger finally found the old's main camp.

852
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,000
He saw hundreds of flaming half-naked savages.

853
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,080
And they're really slacking soldiers.

854
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,800
Those sneaking Redskins were three to one.

855
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,640
What's to handle?

856
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,560
The best way to handle Indians is before they do.

857
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,240
Uh-huh.

858
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,540
The Loneger suddenly ceased.

859
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,400
He always was an ornery cuss.

860
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,900
The next hour, the Loneger huddled close to the shallow Indian.

861
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,140
I know how these sneaking Indians figure.

862
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:27,560
I know how these sneaking Indians figure.

863
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,340
Tango fool.

864
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,040
You're not a panacea, are you?

865
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,220
Yes, the little girl in the corner there.

866
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,100
No.

867
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,500
Or either one of the little girls.

868
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,420
No, you first.

869
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,120
Left first.

870
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,920
I have a really weird question.

871
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,460
Okay?

872
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,580
They all say that.

873
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,140
What do you think is a fellow participant of spec, if Tony Danza were president in

874
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,900
2000, do you think that Tony Danza would make a good president?

875
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,880
You'll have to see.

876
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,780
I'm kind of deaf.

877
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,160
Tony Danza was-

878
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,340
I kind of lost the question.

879
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:54,660
Oh.

880
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,820
What do you think of Tony Danza as president?

881
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,800
Tony Danza?

882
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,840
What do I think of Tony Danza as president?

883
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,080
What is the difference?

884
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,360
And here's the thing.

885
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,480
I'm not even sure who Tony Danza is.

886
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,380
Is he an actor that was on a sitcom, or am I thinking of somebody else?

887
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,760
Right, okay.

888
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:23,340
Why your Earth sitcoms I don't really know much about.

889
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,900
His slogan would be great, though.

890
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,240
It would be like, who's your boss?

891
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,120
Danza.

892
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:27,600
Oh, wait.

893
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,120
Who cares?

894
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:36,500
At this point, you know, I mean, God, I might as well elect Bob.

895
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,540
The nice thing about Bob is he's never around.

896
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,120
He has no opinions.

897
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:48,160
And by the way, the reason it's called Church of the Subgenius is not because we worship a guy who's a genius.

898
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,260
Bob is not smart.

899
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,380
He's brainless.

900
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,540
He's just lucky.

901
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,500
And that's all that matters.

902
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,580
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good.

903
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,200
I'd rather be good any day.

904
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,800
Okay, now what was your question?

905
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,980
My unthinking Bob is great.

906
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,880
But I was wondering, I heard a rumor that Bob had changed sex an infinite number of times

907
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
so he could have intercourse with Jehovah-1.

908
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,000
Yes.

909
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:16,180
Bob changes sex, has changed sex an infinite number of times, and he's always doing that.

910
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,640
But it's like persistence of vision that allows a motion picture to look like a moving thing

911
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,720
when it's really a series of stills.

912
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,420
Bob flickers back and forth between.

913
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:34,440
Sex is so fast that he just appears to be this sort of half-tone dot pattern.

914
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,700
You don't even see a body.

915
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,180
So you don't know what sex he is for sure.

916
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,920
For all we know, he might just be a head with dots.

917
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,020
The dots are the important part.

918
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,580
Okay, who were, what's back there?

919
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,160
Another question here.

920
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,220
Oh, yeah.

921
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,580
Do you think Bob gave you your power to move small buildings with the power of God?

922
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:04,200
Oh, this poor individual had to sleep in the same building as me the other night

923
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:10,080
and was asking if Bob gave me the power to move buildings with the power of my snores.

924
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,220
And that's kind of getting to be an inside joke.

925
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,300
It wasn't too bad last night, was it?

926
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,640
I didn't even go to bed until six in the morning.

927
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,680
How could you have heard me snoring?

928
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,880
They quarantined me into the one room in the trailer that has a door.

929
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:33,160
And I didn't take the, what, some kind of sleeping pills I took the first night to make me snore.

930
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,880
Stay off those false drugs, kids.

931
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,840
The red pill.

932
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,960
Oh, subgeniuses take the red and the blue pill.

933
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,100
And then their pee is purple.

934
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,940
Okay, and what back there?

935
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,600
What's that you do with your throat?

936
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:48,920
Huh?

937
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,200
The aye-aye-aye-aye.

938
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,560
Oh, the aye-aye-aye-aye.

939
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,660
Well, that's called the subgenius salute.

940
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,380
And we...

941
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,720
Adapted that from Warner Brothers cartoons.

942
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:09,800
You'll notice whenever, like, say, Wile E. Coyote or Pepe Le Pew or some hapless character runs off the edge of a cliff,

943
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,940
about the moment they realize they're hovering over thin air,

944
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:18,460
they look down and there's this very brief second where you hear this aye-aye-aye-aye.

945
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,260
That's where that comes from.

946
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,600
Actually, just as a real inside thing,

947
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,760
I think it's called the end-sighted spokesman.

948
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,140
Oh, there it is.

949
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,080
Fuck-tard!

950
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,000
Fuck-tard, he's thinking.

951
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, these are good.

952
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,360
This goes with a Lonesome Cowboy Dave song called War is Good.

953
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,700
Yeah, what?

954
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,580
You still got your hand up.

955
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,800
Has Bob been moonlighting as Bob the end-sighted spokesman?

956
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,440
Oh, the end-sighted spokesman?

957
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,000
No, that's a false Bob trying to rip us off.

958
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,360
They were raided by the...

959
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,600
The FDA and the Treasury Department last year

960
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,320
and are being pursued for billions of dollars worth of fraud.

961
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:14,220
But, damn it, the government got their case by reading the end-sighted emails

962
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,760
and now end-sighted has won a case against the government for privacy issues.

963
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,920
So, punishing the false Bob,

964
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,960
he's talking about the commercials for Smiling Bob.

965
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,480
They try to sell you.

966
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,680
These pills that make men last longer.

967
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,200
I'm not sure what that means.

968
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,340
I never did get that.

969
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,800
They don't work and it's a lie

970
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,880
and the Bob doesn't even have a damn pipe!

971
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,820
So, that's why we can't sue him, if that's your question.

972
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,580
But the government's working on that for other sins of theirs.

973
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,660
You can PR wherever you are.

974
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,860
PR, PR, PR.

975
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:53,720
This is PR.

976
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,300
From PR News in Washington,

977
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:57,880
I'm hurt.

978
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,280
Seriously hurt.

979
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,960
Ass blown up in downtown Dallas.

980
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:06,860
President Bush is threatening to kill a second South Korean hostage in Afghanistan,

981
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,800
citing executive privilege.

982
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,340
Kill, kill, kill another South Korean.

983
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,040
Mr. Bush created a special treatment at a squalid Washington hospital.

984
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,480
That's weaker than expected.

985
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
On Wall Street, 4722,

986
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,520
President Bush says this is PR.

987
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,160
He says PR News is just a low-end sub-fluke.

988
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,580
A business realtor,

989
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,260
a

990
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,420
PR comes from com.com.

991
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,140
Oh, and praise Leimur for the loan-ger and PR News.

992
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,760
And now, friends, for our internet listeners only,

993
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,060
but also viewable on YouTube,

994
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,560
a truly unique,

995
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,200
unique recording,

996
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,600
Gerald Casale of Devo,

997
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,840
performing at the devotional with the Spud Boys,

998
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,160
greatest Devo recombinational band,

999
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,700
with an excerpt from the song Beautiful World,

1000
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,960
as delivered by Jihad Jerry.

1001
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,460
Beautiful World for you.

1002
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,520
Beautiful World for you.

1003
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,580
Beautiful World for you.

1004
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:25,820
Beautiful World for you.

1005
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,540
Beautiful World for you.

1006
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:27,540


1007
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:46,580
Beautiful World for you.

1008
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,380
Beautiful World for you.

1009
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,200
Murray 8 Man Very good.

1010
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,740
Can you sing to that?

1011
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,100
If another raising your hand is not wrong,

1012
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,540
here is a new generation which may find the world wacky.

1013
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,100
Do it!

1014
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,440
Don't you wish it was a beautiful world?

1015
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,920
It's sad.

1016
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,240
Because it could be.

1017
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,160
If 99% of people weren't big fucking assholes...

1018
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,440
See, that's what we like about the evolution.

1019
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,080
And that's what I like about everybody here.

1020
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,060
Because we know...

1021
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,680
We don't know what the fuck is going on.

1022
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,960
And that's a good thing!

1023
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,020
Because if you just admit it...

1024
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,980
We have no fucking idea...

1025
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,000
You can relax.

1026
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,860
And have a good time.

1027
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,740
Because you'll stop looking for answers and start living.

1028
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,080
And you won't take a shit in your neighbor's yard.

1029
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,680
You'll keep your shit in your own yard.

1030
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,360
And you'll have a good time.

1031
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,100
It's like...

1032
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,460
Just because you're having a party...

1033
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,300
You're not going to walk next door and make them have a party.

1034
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,980
But that's what the assholes do.

1035
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,020
They make you do what they're doing because they're doing it.

1036
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,600
And that is fucked up.

1037
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,180
Woo!

1038
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:48,960
Yeah!

1039
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,800
Yeah!

1040
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,160
Yeah!

1041
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:55,900
Don't worry.

1042
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,120
Unfortunately, while we'll go down with the rest of them...

1043
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,500
Because they'll take a shit everywhere.

1044
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,880
And then there'll be nothing but shit.

1045
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,540
It will be a beautiful world again someday.

1046
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,700
When we're all gone.

1047
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,640
And we quit fucking up the planet.

1048
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,360
Hey.

1049
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,120
We're here to party.

1050
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,840
And we do love you.

1051
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,360
From Devo, we love you.

1052
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,340
And...

1053
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,360
It's a beautiful fucking world!

1054
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:28,900
.

1055
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,040
For you.

1056
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,740
.

1057
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,960
For you.

1058
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,140


1059
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,160
For you.

1060
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:38,420
.

1061
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:38,680
For you.

1062
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,240
.

1063
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,000
For you.

1064
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:41,540
.

1065
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:41,720
For you.

1066
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:50,800
.

1067
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,480
a interviewing bar in music!

1068
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:12,520
But Not Pour Me expect the attitude product

1069
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:12,520


1070
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:12,520


1071
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:18,540
