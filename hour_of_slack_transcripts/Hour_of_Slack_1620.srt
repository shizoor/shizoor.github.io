1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,800
Do you want more from life?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,040
Are you struggling to find your place in the world?

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,600
Maybe your place isn't in the world at all.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,000
Long ago, people thought the stars determined our fates.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,540
What if you could choose your star?

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,820
A faraway sun.

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,040
And orbiting that sun, a new world.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,060
And on that world, a new life.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,640
A fresh start.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,820
Room to grow.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,940
We are the Homestead Company.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,880
And your future is our business.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,020
Say yes now.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,400
To book passage.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,100
And to be a part of science.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,540
Someone on our home planet?

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,160
Your future back.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,540
One to perfect.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,460
This universe.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,140
One to finish.

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:21,180
Year 2 dispersed Shaftesbury fingers!

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,420
We don't have no time for that

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,760
All we want is an hour of slack

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,040
Do you know where it's at?

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,440
All you need is an hour of slack

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,980
Everyone needs a straight jacket

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,400
Hold it tight, let's all slack it

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,620
Everyone needs a straight jacket

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,080
Hold on tight, let's all slack it

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,520
We're collecting, typing it in

31
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,220
We're selecting, we're tapped in

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,940
We brainstorm, we uplink

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,740
We're on the platform, we're in sync

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,540
We're doing what we're told

35
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,900
We're on system overload

36
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,160
We're doing what we're told

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,700
We're on system overload

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,820
We're online, we've got the stats

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,600
We're on time, we're fixing facts

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,620
Feel the drive, we do what it takes

41
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,060
We're saving lives, deleting mistakes

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,940
We're doing what we're told

43
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,420
We're on system overload

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,800
We're doing what we're told

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,180
We're on system overload

46
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,640
We're feeding the crowd

47
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,040
We're feeding the crowd

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,460
We're feeding the crowd

49
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,360
We work for you

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,860
We're feeding the crowd

51
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,740
It's what we do

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,160
We're on system overload

53
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,140
We analyze this, we analyze that

54
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,580
Compliance matters, data dispatch

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Behind the curtain, you are not needed

56
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,240
When we are certain, you are deleted

57
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
We're doing what we're told

58
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
We're on system overload

59
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,980
We're doing what we're told

60
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,560
We're on system overload

61
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,100
We're doing what we're told

62
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,100


63
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,100


64
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,100


65
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,100


66
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,100


67
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,540
The distance between the stars is beyond imagination.

68
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,020
A space too vast to cross.

69
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,740
Until now.

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,060
Today's starships, powered by ion drives to half the speed of light, make the journey

71
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,600
possible.

72
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,020
The new barrier is the space.

73
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,840
The future is not space, but time.

74
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,380
How do you reach the stars when the voyage is longer than a lifetime?

75
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,480
The answer is sleep.

76
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,620
The HSI-709 is the state of the art in hibernation.

77
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,700
No chemical bath, no traumatic freezing process.

78
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,980
Just complete metabolic suspension.

79
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,980
Our proprietary technology doesn't just pause your life processes, it arrests all biological

80
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,000
activity down to the microbial system.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000


82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,720
Another آپous introspection lies beyond the beat.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,640
You are

84
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,680
I teach

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,920
Fresh

86
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:35,920


87
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:35,920


88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:35,920


89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,420
Master the

90
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,420


91
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,960
Arrange

92
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:37,960


93
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:37,960


94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:37,960


95
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:37,960


96
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,580
No chemical bathroom

97
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,260
No natural disturbance

98
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,920
Heaven

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,660
One minute

101
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:46,660


102
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:46,940
cuál

103
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,000
Western

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,920
between heaven and earth and hell

105
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,940
You live in great vanity

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,480
of the love that you need to feel

107
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,940
J.R. the Bats

108
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,080
J.R. the Bats

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,160
was killed so many times

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,360
But by the love he had

111
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
the life that he now cannot die

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,260
J.R. the Bats

113
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,160
J.R. the Bats

114
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,100
J.R. the Bats

115
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,080
J.R. the Bats

116
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,500
J.R. the Bats

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:55,860
J.R. the Bats

118
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:55,860


119
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,700
Bob speaks about conspiracy

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,140
and the false that they sell us

121
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,440
To join a false society

122
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,600
The church of some genius

123
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,100
J.R. the Bats

124
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,460
J.R. the Bats

125
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:17,660
J.R. the Bats

126
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,480
J.R. the Bats

127
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,960
J.R. the Bats

128
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,460
J.R. the Bats

129
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,300
J.R. the Bats

130
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,960
J.R. the Bats

131
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,620
J.R. the Bats

132
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,160
J.R. the Bats

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,560
J.R. the Bats

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,300
J.R. the Bats

135
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,460
J.R. the Bats

136
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,980
J.R. the Bats

137
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:33,980


138
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:33,980


139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:33,980


140
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:33,980


141
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:33,980


142
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,900
J.R. the Bats

143
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,080
J.R. the Bats

144
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,460
J.R. the Bats

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,940
J.R. the Bats

146
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,680
J.R. the Bats

147
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,340
J.R. the Bats

148
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,420
Whether he was pounding his way through a Girl Scout cookie eating contest or meandering

149
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,860
through the back roads in search of a pancake breakfast, we'll always remember Doug Smith

150
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:04,820
as an original, the one and only cheap gourmet and the fun ranger who with his wife Polly

151
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,160
showed us the lighter, luscious and less costly side of living in western New York back in

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,980
the 80s.

153
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,860
Doug Smith, St. Joseph's Festival is a happy occasion to be sure, although maybe it's just

154
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,720
a little bit more solemn than what we perceive as the tip of the iceberg of the St. Patrick's

155
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,300
Day Festival.

156
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,960
Doug was a former Courier Express newsman from the old school, the go-to guy in the

157
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,060
newsroom when we had a question about grammar or style.

158
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,400
He was a gifted writer who often used his considerable talents to write about baseball,

159
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,900
the game he loved.

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,960
And he was doing that right up until his last.

161
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,840
A year ago, Doug and Polly invited many of us to share a farewell hot dog.

162
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,760
That's where Doug passed away surrounded by loved ones and leaving all of us with fond,

163
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,820
lasting hot dog memories.

164
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:07,920
On the Starship Avalon, we believe your voyage should be as extraordinary as your destination.

165
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,940
That's why we're offering our elite passengers a special gift.

166
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:11,940


167
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:11,940


168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,220
A new level of luxury.

169
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,860
1,200 thread count sheets of the finest hydroponic cotton.

170
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,620
300 cubic meters of personal space.

171
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,760
An unlimited water allowance.

172
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,940
Speakerless surround sound.

173
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,220
A library of over a million movies, series and self-casts.

174
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,140
If you can take your eyes off the best view in the universe.

175
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,940
The best view in the universe.

176
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,820
Elite Suites.

177
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,320
Only on the Starship Avalon.

178
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,280
.

179
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:41,960


180
00:11:41,960 --> 00:12:11,960


181
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:41,960


182
00:12:41,960 --> 00:13:11,960


183
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:41,960


184
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Tango Lessons in a Fascist Whorehouse.

185
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,580
A beautiful thing.

186
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,660
Before that little news report.

187
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh, the song about J.R. Bob Dobbs was by Reverend Burn Bridges.

188
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,560
And I can't really hear the lyrics to that.

189
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,480
So I hope they weren't too offensive.

190
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,380
It seems like a catchy little tune.

191
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,700
And System Overload there at the very beginning, as well as the Slack It titles.

192
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,460
Are by Exposed Four Heads from their new album Push Me.

193
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:24,500
And of course, some commercials from our sponsor.

194
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,060
Now, we're going to be calling Lonesome Cowboy Dave tonight.

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,700
And we'll also be reading from Lonesome Cowboy Dave's novel Neighbor World, which we're proofreading.

196
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,200
But first I wanted to read from...

197
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,100
Dr. Onan Kanabite's book, OVO 21.

198
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:56,980
Actually, it looks like a book, but it's an issue of his zine that he's been doing for about 40 years now.

199
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:06,000
This one is called OVO 21 Terminalia, and it's a collection of rants that he publishes these.

200
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,700
He is a publisher, just as we have become publishers.

201
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:20,180
Using the print-on-demand and e-book way of doing it, where you don't have to spend any money, but you can publish books.

202
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,580
He led the way. He showed me the way, personally.

203
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,180
He wrote me a very clear, concise letter that said, here's how you publish books.

204
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:38,380
And he announced to me that he has actually paid his rent sometimes, using the income from these books.

205
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,780
But in this particular...

206
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,360
rant...

207
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,220
called Sophistication.

208
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,060
Oh, it's got a great quote at the beginning.

209
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,960
From a friend of ours, Odorous Orungus of Gwar.

210
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,640
The late Odorous Orungus, who said,

211
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,020
Virtual reality satisfies man's need to stick his head in a box.

212
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,580
I'm not going to read the whole rant here, but it's great.

213
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,060
There's just a little section.

214
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:19,280
The sophisticated world of today is taking away ever more of our ability to discern what is true.

215
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,540
The mob courts of public opinion are weaponized with social media.

216
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,920
Video and still image documents can be manipulated beyond anyone's ability to identify.

217
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:39,840
Graduation rates from public education have never been higher, and the quality of public education has never been lower.

218
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,260
College degrees are easier to get and worth less.

219
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:53,600
Our leaders can make the most self-evidently false statements, and yet our nations lap it up as divine ordinance.

220
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,020
The United States has never been dumber.

221
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,460
How are things in your country?

222
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:09,820
In the sophisticated world of today, good guys and bad guys are not recognized by what they do, but by what others do.

223
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,080
What others say of them.

224
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:22,120
Plagiarism and publishing fiction as fact is what bad guys do, but when a good guy does it, say Alex Haley's book, Roots, all is forgiven and quickly forgotten.

225
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:35,420
Quoting from the white nationalist website American Resistance is what bad guys do, but when Slavoj Zizek does it, the incident is not to be a concern.

226
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,500
Pardon me if I pronounced that wrong.

227
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:46,240
And when the marching morons get it stuck in their melons that some guy is a bad guy, they're a bad guy and there's no redemption.

228
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:54,960
It's clear that Saudi Arabia had a hand in 9-11 and so the United States attacked Iraq, because by gum they're the bad guys.

229
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:07,480
It's true that the United Kingdom has a problem with Muslims doing what Muslims do, and so the United Kingdom banned the most peaceable and articulate critics of Islam from entering the country.

230
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,920
Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller.

231
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,840
Because by gum they're the bad guys.

232
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:24,760
Women around the world are being subjected to genital mutilation, forced marriage, honor killings, stonings, being set on fire, acid attacks, second class citizen status and more by Muslims.

233
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,120
So feminists are criticizing video game authors because by gum they're the bad guys.

234
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,460
The Islamic State is abducting children who are then sold as sex slaves or criminals.

235
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,760
Or crucified or beheaded or buried alive.

236
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,440
And so the White House is hosting conferences about those who lack courtesy online because by gum they're the bad guys.

237
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:57,580
When the masses of asses, the democratic will of the people that is, get together with their torches and pitchforks, there's no stopping them with trivial evidence and objective fact.

238
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:05,700
Some men are crowned with halos, some with devil horns, and the world gets slightly more sophisticated.

239
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,140
For example, the American people are crowned with the mainstay of the human race, the blue-collar people.

240
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,140


241
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,140


242
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,200
It's not the American people who are the most sophisticated.

243
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,200


244
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,200


245
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:20,540
Well, that was a short excerpt from a longer rant by Dr. Onan Kanabight who actually, he writes under the name Trevor Blake sometimes.

246
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,300
Trevor Blake of Portland, Oregon.

247
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:33,700
And you can find him at Box 2321 Portland, Oregon 97221.

248
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:35,680


249
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:35,680


250
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,160
Or just Google around for Trevor Blake, Onan, Canabite.

251
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,420
OVO127.com

252
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,280
It is.

253
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,500
And that brings us to another wonderful book, a novel this time, not rants.

254
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,720
The novel Neighbor World by someone called Dave DeLuca,

255
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,780
who also goes by the name of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

256
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:13,400
And before I call Dave and put him on the air, I'm going to read from his book a little bit.

257
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:21,460
The main character, Standard Mazuk, that's his name, has just gotten into his car,

258
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,500
which they call an EMAG. It's not exactly a car.

259
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,860
The MAG's voice intoned,

260
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,700
13 minutes to...

261
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,320
destination.

262
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,160
Then the sound of music swelled through the MAG, a song called El Chimpy,

263
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,900
with surfy psychedelic guitars, a Latin edge, and screeching chimpanzees.

264
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,340
The MAG accelerated and leveled at 50 kilometers an hour.

265
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,020
When I was a kid, cars could go a hundred miles an hour.

266
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,580
You could go anywhere.

267
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,360
I'd rented cars in Car Town,

268
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,700
but the speed limit was 30 miles an hour.

269
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,480
I'd driven 25 miles per hour down there.

270
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,140
An EMAG was a servo, a computer car, riding the neural circuitry of an immense transport grid.

271
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,880
It could be driven manually, steered to the left or right of the path, slowed down and stopped,

272
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,380
but it was still part of a closed system, totally next in, like everything else, Neighbor World.

273
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:31,700
Rows of HABs fast-forwarded by, filled with neighbors who had never seen their neighbors.

274
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,140
They were in their homes from the outside.

275
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,740
Wet leaves were smeared all over the HAB windows, but that was okay.

276
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,480
No bored kids or horny teenagers ever peered out of them.

277
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,880
The neighbors' world was in the screen.

278
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,320
Images and sensations passed through neighbors at light speed,

279
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,480
and they traveled anywhere on light.

280
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,280
They didn't need to go outside.

281
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,540
The global neighborhood was their living room.

282
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,100
They were all dreaming in unison.

283
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,980
To me, though, gliding in a red, gold, and silver EMAG was nice.

284
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,820
It was like being in a big local where neighbors went outside sometimes,

285
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,820
to live spots, to plays, to full-saturation enviro-parks.

286
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,160
In big locals, they knew how to live, not like 838's Zoombies.

287
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,360
Wow.

288
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,520
Well, friends, yes, this novel is a little bit different.

289
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,260
This novel does take place in the future.

290
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,320
In fact, here's a clue in this paragraph.

291
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,980
What year was it, anyway? 2037?

292
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,520
But years weren't numbered in 2037.

293
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,300
It was just last season, or this season, or next season, or three seasons from now.

294
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
No numbers.

295
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:58,880
Seasons and years were merely green access markers that turned amber after you passed them.

296
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,360
Time was relative, wasn't it?

297
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,680
The past and future were one.

298
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,540
There was no common era.

299
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,580
Only then, now, and shaping up.

300
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:22,980
A nice quote there from Neighbor World by Dave DeLuca, soon to be published by the Subgenius Foundation.

301
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,880
In fact, I'm reading from an actual book that we're looking for technical mistakes in.

302
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:37,060
So, let's dare to call the Dave and see what happens.

303
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,480
Princess Wee has joined me for the important phone call.

304
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,580
It's calling somebody, but I don't know who.

305
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,480
That's not right.

306
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,840
It's not funny. You're laughing.

307
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,720
It's not funny.

308
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,420
I'm going to call his work phone, which is really his home phone.

309
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,840
But it is funny.

310
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,240
Do we hear it?

311
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,980
Yeah, we hear it.

312
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,360
And hopefully he can hear us if we yell into that and these.

313
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,960
Hello? I must adjust something. Wait a minute.

314
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,460
Oh, he's going to adjust something.

315
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,200
I think I know what that something is.

316
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,700
He must have to adjust something.

317
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,760
Something big and heavy and sweaty.

318
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,360
And he's been sitting on it all day.

319
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,400
It needs to be pulled around to the front so it can air out.

320
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,780
That's what I believe.

321
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,060
I believe what I need to believe.

322
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,080
That is what Pappy said.

323
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,040
And that's the human condition, folks.

324
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,560
We believe what we need to believe.

325
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,440
And I need to believe that this book, Neighbor World, will...

326
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,960
be a classic.

327
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,500
That will be taught in high schools.

328
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,340
Yes.

329
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,200
Junior high.

330
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,560
Yes.

331
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,780
Heck, elementary school.

332
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,400
Oh, yes.

333
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,180
You know, and the kids will be zooming the loom while they...

334
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,180
Well, they won't read the book because it will just be injected into their brain.

335
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,820
Right.

336
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,860
Directly into their brains.

337
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,040
It's like taking the red pill and the blue pill at the same time.

338
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,940
Why not both?

339
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,120
Why not both?

340
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,300
Hello?

341
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,420
Daveman.

342
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,540
Dave?

343
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:24,780
Dave?

344
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,580
I'm coming.

345
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,340
I'm here.

346
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,800
Oh, good.

347
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,580
We're so glad you're there.

348
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,760
Well, I'm only, you know, I'm hanging in here.

349
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,200
He's there for us.

350
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,560
We need you to be there.

351
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,020
We need you to be there?

352
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,580
Why do you need me to be there?

353
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,120
Jase.

354
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,160
Jase.

355
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:49,960
Because otherwise life is just grim and dim without any lonesome cowboy Dave.

356
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
Well, that's the most...

357
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,440
That's wonderful.

358
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,980
That's the biggest lie anyone's ever told me.

359
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,620
It's all true.

360
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,080
It's all pure, pure true.

361
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,240
Exactly.

362
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,420
That's what I mean.

363
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,000
It's not exactly true, but it's very...made me feel very warm inside and cool outside.

364
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,100
It's princess truth.

365
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,600
It's all true.

366
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,580
True through and through.

367
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,400
It's altruistic.

368
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,920
Well, what's going on in the line of bellybuttons and beans down there in southern...Yabioca?

369
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,900
We're in northern.

370
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,320
Northern Texas still, but we'll be back in Cleveland in about two and a half weeks.

371
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,060
Will you be wearing the Nordic American Bund uniform and have a mango haircut?

372
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,680
Oh, we have to just to get into Ohio to get through the, you know, the customs border

373
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,440
and the gates.

374
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:40,780
Don't blame it on us.

375
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,440
You know, between Kentucky and Ohio, they search your car, they search your pants, they

376
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,640
search your face.

377
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,640
They search your mind.

378
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,380
They do a pencil tucky too.

379
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,840
They like to look like a...what do we call those people with squirrels that wear squirrels

380
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,460
on their shoulders?

381
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,720
So one of the guy was trying to pass off one of these pet squirrels he had on his shoulder

382
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,500
as a parrot.

383
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,420
Dave Billies they call it.

384
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

385
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
The Dave Billies.

386
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,180
They're people from the, you know, way, way out in the really small locals.

387
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,620
Like nearby the border.

388
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:19,620


389
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,060
And they have a border here.

390
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,340
They call it pencil tucky.

391
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,980
Isn't that insulting?

392
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,380
Well, between Tennessee and Kentucky, you have to go through another border control

393
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,040
wall.

394
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,620
And then between Arkansas and Tennessee, there's a huge wall lined with border guards

395
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,000
and machine guns and trenches, draw bridges.

396
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,720
Yeah, but most of the part of...

397
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Alligators.

398
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,420
Yeah.

399
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,020
But most of it's old shoes, which is, you know, they're kind of easy to get over there,

400
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,060
especially if you've got a 22 foot ladder.

401
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,600
Yeah.

402
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,660
But a lot of people just plow their way through those shoes and say, hey, screw you, ICE,

403
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,640
which stands for International Customs and...

404
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,500
Just hold your nose and just charge on through that gauntlet of old shoes.

405
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
I heard that...

406
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Who needs a green card?

407
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,900
...old Presidente was going to try and put up a big barrier somewhere south of San Jacinto

408
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,300
of human underwear and rodent fur.

409
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,200
Now, who's going to do that?

410
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,460
The artist Christo?

411
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,720
Or the artist Trump?

412
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:27,920
I guess Trump was going to commission Christo to take his fag bag balloon or whatever it's

413
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,460
called in Norwegian, some strange name, just like he did in the hills of Northern California,

414
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,000
you know, and just create these walls, luminous like dingleberries that shine in the night

415
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,460
that keep on keeping on, you know?

416
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,640
That'll make America goat again.

417
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,060
Yeah.

418
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
And gulp.

419
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,440
Yeah, gulp.

420
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,740
That'll make America gulp again.

421
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,940
It sure will.

422
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,800
I felt sad just hearing about it the first time when I realized I talked to it.

423
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,240
It was a doctor from San Jacinto that said that they're closing up the plasma schools

424
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,000
and all the other important parts of the village were being destroyed.

425
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:18,440
Yeah, they're going to shut down everything that doesn't pay directly into the...

426
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,700
The private prison store, Trump's stock.

427
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,000


428
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,020
And we'll all have to have new salivary glands installed and stuff like that too so they

429
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,240
can...

430
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,720
Makes my mouth not water just thinking about it.

431
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,380
Yeah.

432
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,380
Yeah, I can't wait to get my salivary glands removed and replaced with those new chemical

433
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,980
processors.

434
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,460
Well, mine's been on order for three weeks now.

435
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,260
Yeah.

436
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,080
And I thought they were still going to deliver it through the hydro pack.

437
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:03,700
Well, no, I guess some people can get that injected with the hydro pack, but it kind

438
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,140
of depends on which state you're in.

439
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:13,320
You'd have to cross the wall into Indiana to be able to just sit on it and have it soak

440
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,220
in like that.

441
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,260
Yeah.

442
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,240
But wherever you go, you're going to have to be able to bring it in.

443
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,360
Yeah.

444
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,560
And you're going to have to drive some corrupt official or some kind of...

445
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,480
Right.

446
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,100
Using some member of the clergy.

447
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,480
The clergy.

448
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,240
Yeah, those are the police now.

449
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,200
Well...

450
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,660
But one...

451
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,100
Yep.

452
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,020
Same difference.

453
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,460
You know...

454
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,060
Yep.

455
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,660
Now that every officer is an ordained Christian minister, they can do anything they want.

456
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,800
My salivary glands are quivering in fear.

457
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,220
Well, you just take your salivary glands...

458
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,420
Is that what just sprayed me?

459
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:46,980
Yes.

460
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,280
Put some beans in the next tater from the side.

461
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,400
It's going to wipe in my face.

462
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,980
It's got spritzed.

463
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,380
It's their fault, dear.

464
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,220
It's not mine.

465
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,360
Those huge salivary glands.

466
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,040
Speaking of salivary glands, we ought to milk the dog.

467
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,740
If there was a way to sell dog drool, we'd be rich.

468
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,900
Oh, we sure would.

469
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,640
There's got to be some new age thing we can stick on, you know, homeopathic holographic

470
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,040
dog infusion.

471
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,560
And it'll be real.

472
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,680
We wouldn't trick them.

473
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,380
It wouldn't just be thickened water.

474
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,200
It would be real drool.

475
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,500
We wouldn't need to fake it.

476
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,480
There's plenty.

477
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,080
Yes.

478
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,840
On a hot day, we could gather buckets of dog drool and sell it...

479
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,640
Well, you know...

480
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,740
...to new age suckers and survivalists and just like gold and silver.

481
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,560
Dog slobber.

482
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,220
You know, they're marketing that gelled alcohol that you buy in a pump bottle.

483
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,620
What's the point?

484
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


485
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


486
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


487
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


488
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


489
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


490
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


491
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


492
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:45,620


493
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:51,240
with a label on it that says dog drool because it's like a gag gift are they really yes i didn't

494
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,140
know it's not like the celebrity snot hairs that they're they're marketing now today right yeah

495
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:05,320
sheriff's not really old celebrities well the drool is easier to collect from the really old

496
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:13,160
celebrities yeah share barbara streisand those are real big uh clint eastwood robert redford

497
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,340
they're drooling a breaking wind expensive but not hard to find

498
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:33,940
break wind break and crack cheeks crack hey get this dave our comrade reverend bleepo abernathy

499
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:41,160
who is the guy who actually says the hour of slack almost every week not this week but most weeks

500
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,820
bleepo just

501
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:50,560
worked with the what's left of the fire sign theater yeah yeah in los angeles um there was

502
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:56,240
a thing called something along the lines of looking for the fire sign theater or something

503
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:05,320
like him or them or something and phil proctor was in it um i i guess phil proctor may have been

504
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,840
the only one i didn't recognize i didn't see david osman pictures the other two are dead

505
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,060
i thought osman was still uh breathing he is

506
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:20,460
he he is but i don't think he was in the show this was proctor and uh and fire sign fans

507
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:29,240
such as reverend bleepo and you and me only we weren't you know there to do it oh we weren't

508
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:36,280
invited no well it was sure if we wanted to pay buy tickets we were invited listeners

509
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,920
uh many of you under the age of 180 wouldn't recognize the name

510
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:53,360
the fire sign theater but for everyone who does an old-timey subgenius show that's us and dave and

511
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,040
puzzling evidence philo hal suzy the floozy and ministry of slack well maybe not them and maybe

512
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,640
not thorazine you're in podcrest but but us old-timers to us the fire sign theater were like

513
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,880
the trance spouting comedy gods absolutely

514
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:19,300
although they actually wrote these elaborate scripts that were see that was quite an enlargement

515
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,100
for me to hear because i'd heard of the pacific radio tapes and stuff like that i thought

516
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,760
these guys just know they were jamming and then they would take the jams and they would turn them

517
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,240
into scripts i thought everything was fun when you listen to their old shows it's as if they

518
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,100
were recorded yesterday they might refer to nixon but it's still the same

519
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:51,240
name there is and they didn't do like us they tried to stay away from extremely dating uh current

520
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,200
events because they were looking for eternal events they were looking for the the truth in

521
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:05,180
the eternal recurrence of richard nixon over and over and over you got it bro

522
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:11,920
but they didn't have to say nixon's name it could be any president yes they were so great

523
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:21,160
we owe our lives to the fire sign theater our younger listeners out there to perhaps go and

524
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:30,240
find the cd or some you know find it on the net somewhere and just download as many

525
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:40,460
uh as you can the fire sign theater in turn were inspired by the the goon show

526
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,960
of

527
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,900
british radio the goon show with spike milligan and peter sellers and another what was the other

528
00:35:47,900 --> 00:36:00,180
guy another genius yeah right and their stuff sounds it has that way about it and many say

529
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:07,240
this is what was the beginning of both not only fire sign theater in america but monty python in

530
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,920
oh absolutely first there was goon show then fire sign theater then monty

531
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:22,300
python and of course a million other things came after yeah but there's nothing like a fire sign

532
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:30,340
theater album the first dave the first time i heard one of those i was 15 or 16 and i had

533
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:37,020
started hanging around with the theater kids in school because i was at a boys school and the

534
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,900
theater department ballet slippers had girls football helmet no this was it was i was hanging

535
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,140
out with the kids and i was hanging out with the kids and i was hanging out with the kids and i was

536
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:49,180
hanging out with the theater sissies because that was where the girls were in a private boy

537
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:58,540
school yeah so uh some older kid who was really hip or maybe an older brother had turned somebody

538
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:04,340
on to this fire sign theater thing and i remember laying in a dark room with a bunch of other

539
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:11,760
intellectual wimpy kids listening to this stuff in the dark and we weren't high on drugs because

540
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,000
we were only 50

541
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:21,260
teen and i remember thinking very specifically this must be what it's like to be stoned as i was

542
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:29,680
listening to the fire sign theater and i was quite right you were yeah this must be what it's like to

543
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:37,840
be stoned some people go through life without ever shutting their brain off like that i can't

544
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,080
some of them need to have their brain shut off they need the master calculator to

545
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,140
into the room and pick the off which oh i need the big rubber mallet every five minutes

546
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,060
well it's a big phallic dildo as far as most of us are concerned and you keep on arguing

547
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,060
no it's just a big rubber mallet that knocks you out why do you have to turn everything into sex

548
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:08,260
dr freud that's outdated thinking that's old school thinking it's very old school

549
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,880
old school hey now dave here's the part you don't know i read

550
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,140
you don't know i read you don't know i read you don't know i read you don't know i read you don't

551
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,360
know i read you don't know i read you don't know i read you don't know i read you don't know i read you

552
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,440
some of your book before we called you

553
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:24,660
out loud like like a story for the kids a bedtime story well that's that's wonderful

554
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,360
that's absolutely ridiculous i'm i'm so proud of yourself hey you want to hear some more of me

555
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,180
what did you what did you talk about um

556
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,200
how the well i found the part where it said the year was 2037

557
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,080
Oh, that's only 20 years from now.

558
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,500
I know.

559
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,480
And it was only one paragraph, but it's a great paragraph.

560
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,220
And I read the thing about neighbors who have never seen their own house from the outside.

561
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,100
It was wonderful.

562
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,280
That was wonderful.

563
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:07,320
And what I would like to read now, this is a description of Standard's job rival, Nogo.

564
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,300
Nogo is a gen-alt.

565
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,300
That means he's been genetically altered and stuff, so he's, you know, slicker.

566
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,640
And Standard is kind of like, well, the rest of us.

567
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,040
Yeah.

568
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,760
Standard.

569
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,340
A normal person.

570
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,500
Kind of a slob, kind of a mess, a little disorganized.

571
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,460
Nogo is Mr. Perfect, though.

572
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,920
Now, I'm going to read this.

573
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,640
Nogo was a good chef, sure, and a good artist, composer, director, whatever.

574
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,900
Everything he laid.

575
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,000
He laid his splice baby new lizard hands on, cued cred.

576
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,440
Naturally, or unnaturally.

577
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,800
He was genetically altered for art, for right brain dominance.

578
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,660
But a goofy glitch whispered in the opposite.

579
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,680
Imbalance and unexplainable left brain dominance flawed his work.

580
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,240
The past and future are one, Advo, Nogo said with a smile.

581
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,280
There's only then and now.

582
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,460
Shaping up.

583
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,880
Seize the moment.

584
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,140
And ride the Zoom.

585
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,720
It was like God superimposed a slapstick reminder on the artificial prodigy.

586
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,480
A memo from the executive producer to disregard all this gen-alt crap.

587
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,540
Meaningless patterns blasted through his all-systemic visual art, searching for significance.

588
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,540
He couldn't cook without pre-pros and measurements,

589
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,260
compose without tone and pulse standards,

590
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,720
or make art without matrices and interfaces.

591
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,200
That describes me.

592
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,380
I doubt that.

593
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,480
I have to have matrices and interfaces.

594
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,940
Well, we all do it.

595
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,520
It's just one of those things.

596
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,820
He's a slave to it, or something like that.

597
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,140
This Nogo guy, he's...

598
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,680
He's been genetically altered for art.

599
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,120
I mean, you know, to be a showbiz...

600
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,880
You know, Mel...

601
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,200
Melting, melted media guy.

602
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,720
You know, like when social media and the internet and television,

603
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,520
cable television or whatever,

604
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,160
all meld into one massive autocratic,

605
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,940
slain, haunted, pathetic,

606
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,220
scryed-ass, legend...

607
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,780
And he's made for that.

608
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,560
Well, he was...

609
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,780
We gotta change that.

610
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,880
Great.

611
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,520
Great Nogo...

612
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,480
30 years in the future.

613
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,100
Maybe.

614
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,180
Great.

615
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,140
Nogo snarled sarcastically.

616
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,220
That would give them something to remember.

617
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,940
But they can't remember anything.

618
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,640
Remember?

619
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,000
Nogo liked...

620
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,520
Nogo liked to make folks ooze sedition,

621
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,740
Malko, and InfoCrit.

622
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,560
And then, entrap them.

623
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,860
He was a provocateur who catalyzed trouble,

624
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,460
like someone who started a fire and then anonymously reported it.

625
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,300
You had to be careful what you said.

626
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,160
The only way to handle Nogo was to confront him directly,

627
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,620
like when dealing with our boss.

628
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,940
I looked right into his eyes, and he looked back for a second, then away.

629
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,240
He flinched.

630
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,580
Nogo was hiding something, and I saw it.

631
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,360
That made me alpha now.

632
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Mm-hmm.

633
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,160
Mm-hmm.

634
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,980
The plot...

635
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,260
So, see, friends, it's written in another language.

636
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,640
It's a Dave language.

637
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,800
But if you're listening to this show,

638
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,720
you must have kind of liked the Dave language to begin with.

639
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,100
Mm-hmm.

640
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,140
I mean, if you're still...

641
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,460
Well, if this isn't the first time you ever listen to this show...

642
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:43,720
Right.

643
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,880
We don't want to...

644
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,060
Because so many are like the fierce pigs of Norway.

645
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,040
Remember when the Tuskegons first barbecued the whole universe?

646
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,740
Starting with the...

647
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,020
I guess it was the Tompkins sisters, and...

648
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,600
They were the masters.

649
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,360
In those days, we were the bacon.

650
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,320
Yeah, that's it.

651
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,280
Like the Manhattan Project.

652
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,060
That was part of it, too, and Montauk,

653
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,080
and Harry Naval Week, and all that.

654
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,840
Stuff like that.

655
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,280
Yeah.

656
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,740
They drank too much.

657
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,520
Yeah.

658
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,820
Wait, you can drink too much?

659
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,020
Oh, no.

660
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,780
Well, you can...

661
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,280
Yeah.

662
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,300
Oh, man, that's bad news to me.

663
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,940
Well, I love proofreading Neighbor World

664
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,080
because I've had to pay real close attention

665
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,860
to every single letter

666
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,720
to make sure there's nothing misspelled.

667
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,140
And here's a word...

668
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,320
I didn't even know existed.

669
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,600
Amoebi.

670
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,420
I guess that's a plural of amoeba?

671
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,280
Yeah.

672
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,480
This is no-go talking again.

673
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,160
The point is that all those folks are just amoebi.

674
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,480
They're like some single-cell creature

675
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,000
feeding off some more complex creature,

676
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,000
never knowing what they're doing or why.

677
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,600
Most of them can't even remember their own names,

678
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,440
for Christ's sakes.

679
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
How can they retain all the info drizzle

680
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,980
they connect into daily?

681
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,320
It's meaningless to them.

682
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,960
It's like...

683
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,900
Psychic fiber.

684
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,700
It passes right through them, man.

685
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,460
Right through them.

686
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,320
Now, I'm probably using exactly the wrong voice for no-go, but...

687
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,920
Yeah, you may sound like he was a hairdresser

688
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
or a police pederast.

689
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,840
Well, I was thinking he was like a...

690
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,100
A provocateur.

691
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,260
A media art guy and a hipster.

692
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,140
They're incapable of assimilating new info, Stan,

693
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,780
he said as if announcing some important secret truth.

694
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,500
Neighbor World has fabricated a comfortable transition

695
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,940
century for a bunch of amoebi.

696
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,500
Our celebrated Nova century is nothing more than

697
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,960
a regurgitation of the past, attractively packaged

698
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,240
to keep a dead race thinking it's alive.

699
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,680
They're not asleep, Stan.

700
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,380
They're dead.

701
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,280
His eyes got really wide when he said dead.

702
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,000
Wow.

703
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,400
That's a pretty weird book, man.

704
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,520
And it's about the weirds.

705
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,580
It's about the search for the weirds

706
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,180
who are weirding out the system.

707
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,100
Which we'd all love to do if we all had the right haircuts

708
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,540
and everything.

709
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,000
Some of us are like...

710
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,380
We'd have to have hair to begin with to have the right haircuts.

711
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:24,120
Yeah, well, if we could muster a few snaggly-cragly two hairs...

712
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,220
Oh, I've got enough to wrap all around my body,

713
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,260
but they're just hanging from the back of my neck.

714
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,100
There's nothing else left.

715
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,060
The ones that are there are five feet long,

716
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,120
but there's only seven of them.

717
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,540
They'll look lice and chiggers, too.

718
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,580
Oh, yeah.

719
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,300
Oh, God.

720
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,940
The chiggers are worse now than they were last week.

721
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,660
Oh, they are.

722
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,220
Actually, they're not.

723
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,380
I think they're dying off, or they're growing up.

724
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,060
The chiggers are maturing.

725
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,640
They no longer need our blood.

726
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,340
They're not so insecure anymore.

727
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,260
Yeah, they're learning to drive.

728
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,620
Like our president.

729
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,520
They're learning.

730
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,560
Except that they can learn.

731
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,000
Chiggers can learn.

732
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,520
I don't know if we're...

733
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,400
Are we nuts?

734
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:09,680
Are we nuts?

735
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:09,680


736
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:09,680


737
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,240
Are we supposed to criticize?

738
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,580
Because I think old Mango Mussolini,

739
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,740
as some people like to call him and stuff,

740
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,460
has gone to new...

741
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,300
Did you see some of the...

742
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,580
Probably fake news on the Internet, of course,

743
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,500
but some of the pictures of those places

744
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,100
where he was speaking to standing-room-only crowds?

745
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,200
Yeah, they weren't standing-room-only.

746
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,940
There was a lot of empty seats.

747
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,460
Yeah, he's not selling out the crowds now.

748
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,180
He got a little bit, and there was a lot of empty space.

749
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,020
he's crazy.

750
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,080
Yeah, he's crazy.

751
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,520
Yeti's our president.

752
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,880
Way crazy.

753
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,840
President is a Yeti.

754
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,020
Yeti's our president.

755
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,840
That's an old Dr. Howell line

756
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,140
from another president

757
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,020
long, long ago.

758
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,160
I think it was Reagan.

759
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,360
Was Reagan a Yeti too?

760
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,420
Reagan was in a band

761
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,900
with Bob Dobbs and Philo Drummond.

762
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,300
He was in Doctors for Wotan

763
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,020
for a while.

764
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,980
They used to jam on the weekends.

765
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,000
He had to get away from Nancy,

766
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,980
you know, and he'd frop

767
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,920
and they'd jam and everything.

768
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,800
Actually, Reagan was nothing like...

769
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,920
And they'd have to rush her

770
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,660
to the hospital.

771
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,180
And that would be another party blown

772
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,940
because the Reagans came by

773
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,700
and had their weird drug paraphernalia.

774
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
Well, they were into downers.

775
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,220
Like the hat and the wombats

776
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,740
and all that stuff.

777
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,880
The Reagans were real into

778
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,760
barbiturate.

779
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,400
Then when Quaaludes came along

780
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,640
they were into that, of course.

781
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,920
Yeah, she was a soggy froggy

782
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,140
from the get-go.

783
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,040
And astrology.

784
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,560
Yeah.

785
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,740
Right, right.

786
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,240
The stars will...

787
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,980
Some people feel that the stars

788
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,160
guide our fate.

789
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,920
Come along with us, Dave,

790
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,840
on the starship Avalon

791
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,200
as we travel

792
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,420
to a better world.

793
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,200
Avalon.

794
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,680
All stars.

795
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,480
Not a reason not to include.

796
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,200
Well, I don't know.

797
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,560
I doubt if it's really going to ever

798
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,900
be a better world

799
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,280
even than Avalon and Caldonia

800
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,320
or Overtureland.

801
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,820
Oh, sure.

802
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,340
10,000 years from now

803
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,760
when the squibbons evolve

804
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,020
into tool-using creatures,

805
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,800
they'll create the utopia

806
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
that humans were never able to pull off

807
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,880
due to their glands.

808
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,200
What about the angry squid

809
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
you preach upon?

810
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,160
Every day of your sacred,

811
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,780
holy, miserable life.

812
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,620
When the squid evolves

813
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,920
into the tree squid,

814
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,200
when they leave the water

815
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,880
and evolve after people

816
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,360
into tree squids

817
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,300
or squibbin',

818
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,000
they will eventually start using tools

819
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
and evolve into,

820
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,800
well, not men,

821
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,140
but squim and squimmin'.

822
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,900
Land squids with hands.

823
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,160
You don't have to have feet.

824
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Well, cephalopod,

825
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,960
that kind of means head foot.

826
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,660
Pods are feet, aren't they?

827
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
They're head foot.

828
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,760
Oh, yeah.

829
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,620
Cerebropods.

830
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,020
Cerebropods.

831
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,480
Cephalopods.

832
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,340
I think that's what they're...

833
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,880
That's what squids and octopi are.

834
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,060
Mollusks.

835
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,200
They're a type of mollusk.

836
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,160
Mollusks in general are just...

837
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,340
They're kind of blobby.

838
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,720
They're...

839
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:33,880
They're...

840
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,400
Mouth and butt

841
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,540
and stomach and brain

842
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,440
and eyeball

843
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,500
are all usually

844
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,560
just one big mass organ.

845
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,240
And they taste so good.

846
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,860
Boiled, smoked, raw, pickled.

847
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,300
Mmm.

848
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,460
Mmm.

849
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,980
Up here on Lake Erie,

850
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,000
you know what I'm hearing now?

851
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,920
One of the first things

852
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,700
that the industries

853
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,740
that they polluted

854
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,100
was back in the 1890s,

855
00:49:59,100 --> 00:49:59,700
there was all these

856
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,540
Lake Erie quahogs

857
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,620
and these other mollusks

858
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,820
that people used to eat

859
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,040
just like a clam shot.

860
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:05,800
Yeah.

861
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,440
I've heard of those.

862
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,580
But you don't...

863
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,060
People don't eat a whole lot

864
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,760
from Lake Erie anymore, do they?

865
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,860
No.

866
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,740
I mean, you can.

867
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,560
Somehow...

868
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,640
Somehow Ontario is allowed

869
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,520
to have fishing fleets

870
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,400
and, you know,

871
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,540
you get your Lake Erie

872
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,260
perch sandwich

873
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,560
here on the shores of Lake Erie

874
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,260
and everybody thinks

875
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,880
it's from Ohio.

876
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,080
They don't know the difference

877
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,440
because we're not allowed

878
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,620
to fish anymore,

879
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,440
but they are

880
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,620
because somehow

881
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,800
the fish actually...

882
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,040
They actually know

883
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,820
where the boundary

884
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,980
between the United States

885
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,720
and Canada is.

886
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,220
Right, yeah.

887
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
Well, there's a line down there

888
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,140
under the lake.

889
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,440
Yeah.

890
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,500
Oh, big...

891
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,320
It looks small on a map,

892
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,740
but under the lake

893
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,400
in real life,

894
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,260
it's like, God,

895
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,980
100 yards wide.

896
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,700
It's huge.

897
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:48,980
Yeah.

898
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,600
Easy for fish to see.

899
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,900
The Philistines,

900
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,160
I guess the major one,

901
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,540
of course,

902
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,200
being the mango

903
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,320
Mussolini himself,

904
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,920
Comrade Trump,

905
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,440
have vowed

906
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,920
that they were going

907
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,340
to fix all the fissures

908
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,040
in the wall

909
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,220
between Canada

910
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,160
and the United States

911
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,800
and Lake Erie.

912
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,720
Right on.

913
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,480
That'll keep out

914
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,140
them people from Canada.

915
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,680
Yeah.

916
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,680
They talk English,

917
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,140
but not real good.

918
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,500
They don't talk good.

919
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,660
They don't write good.

920
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,300
They take strange

921
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,660
bowel movements, eh?

922
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,300
I'm quoting...

923
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,380
Bowel movements,

924
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,000
get it?

925
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,000
Like, you know...

926
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,460
I was quoting the Cheeto,

927
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:28,900
actually.

928
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,740
You stand on guard

929
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,440
for the Eden,

930
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:30,860
you know,

931
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,040
and, you know...

932
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,600
He can do that,

933
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,880
a lot better than I can.

934
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, because I used

935
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,080
to hear them sing it

936
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,860
every night before

937
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:39,600
they used to have,

938
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:39,920
you know,

939
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,800
when I would fall asleep

940
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,580
before they had

941
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,580
the other forms

942
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,240
of television.

943
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,380
And the Canadian radio

944
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,240
or the TV

945
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,360
would be blasting away

946
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,220
the Canadian National Anthem.

947
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,860
And you'd be the only kid

948
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,320
in school

949
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,180
that knew the Canadian

950
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,980
National Anthem

951
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,060
because you'd fall asleep

952
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,540
with your head

953
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,980
right by that TV speaker.

954
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,580
Reverend Angry Larry

955
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,720
has talked about that.

956
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,480
He grew up in Detroit,

957
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,400
which is right across

958
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,040
from Canada.

959
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,020
Right.

960
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,260
And they got all that

961
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,720
propaganda broadcast

962
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,720
into their heads

963
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,600
from the evil

964
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,440
Canadian socialist government

965
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,000
and stuff.

966
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,040
Well, at least

967
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,240
they can cook sugar pie

968
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,200
and they know how to make

969
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,020
a damn bleamy sandwich

970
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,780
there in Windsor

971
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,540
on the lake.

972
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,300
Whatever.

973
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
I went to Toronto once

974
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
to be on a lame

975
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,880
morning TV show.

976
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,380
It was ill-advised.

977
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,340
It was ill-conceived notion.

978
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,240
And the main thing

979
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,120
I remember is that

980
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,960
Marlborough's cost

981
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,420
an extra 75 cents there.

982
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,300
Yeah, smokes are

983
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,600
very expensive in Canada.

984
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,640
That was a long, long,

985
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,600
long, long, long, long,

986
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,740
long, long time ago.

987
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,420
Now you've got me

988
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,480
yearning for bleamy.

989
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,540
Well, everyone loves it.

990
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,840
What is this bleamy?

991
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,360
Put the little

992
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
blue black bar

993
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,180
on the bleamy.

994
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,500
Or if you want to have

995
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,760
a more savory style

996
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,360
with a piece of

997
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,720
Romanian egg spark.

998
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,540
Ah.

999
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,180
Which I just crazed

1000
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,160
in my mind.

1001
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,540
Well, I'm looking

1002
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,840
at the recording timer

1003
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,020
and I know that we've

1004
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,760
gone over

1005
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,860
what will be an hour.

1006
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,520
Seriously?

1007
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,380
Yeah, we've

1008
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:17,940
rambled on.

1009
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,040
Well, because I played

1010
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,300
some songs and stuff

1011
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:20,920
at first.

1012
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,120
It's like a regular

1013
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,140
hour slack where there's

1014
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,640
some music

1015
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,020
and some blabbering.

1016
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,700
Yes.

1017
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,180
We used to go back

1018
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,600
and forth,

1019
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,280
blabbering music,

1020
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,020
blabbering music,

1021
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,680
blabbering music,

1022
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,300
but now it's like

1023
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,020
music, music, music,

1024
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,000
then blabber, blabber,

1025
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,600
blabber, blabber.

1026
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,220
Yes.

1027
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,900
Because it's easy.

1028
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,960
My silly songs should

1029
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,860
be ready in a couple

1030
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:37,960
days to email these

1031
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,320
to you.

1032
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,200
Yeah, Dave is working

1033
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,320
on new Dave songs.

1034
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,600
It only has two verses,

1035
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,260
so I don't know

1036
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,820
if I should let it go.

1037
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,460
It sounds pretty

1038
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,180
unprofessional,

1039
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,260
but kind of Spike

1040
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,040
Jones silly.

1041
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,740
Or if I should try

1042
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,560
and sharpen it up

1043
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,380
so it sounds like

1044
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,620
Spike Jones on purpose.

1045
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,760
Why not both?

1046
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,920
We'd do the cheap

1047
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,720
one first and then

1048
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,920
the expensive one later.

1049
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,600
You might not ever

1050
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,920
get to the expensive one.

1051
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,540
Right.

1052
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:01,980
Yeah.

1053
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,720
Take one out, man.

1054
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,180
Well, that's what

1055
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,340
the guy said last night

1056
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,100
who's doing most

1057
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,720
of the recording.

1058
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,100
He's also going to

1059
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,720
send you some

1060
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,040
silly loops.

1061
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,900
He has some silly

1062
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,660
loops that you can

1063
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,680
use in the background

1064
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,180
of the show.

1065
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,220
Sure, man.

1066
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,000
Silly loops.

1067
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,720
Well, we'll be back

1068
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,120
at WCSB and we'll

1069
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,940
be able to use

1070
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,460
the equipment,

1071
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,680
the good equipment.

1072
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,780
I have to set

1073
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,420
these microphones

1074
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,860
on potholders

1075
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,440
and pillows

1076
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,720
in order to keep

1077
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,480
the vibration

1078
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,140
from the CD player

1079
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:28,940
from coming

1080
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,360
through the mic stand.

1081
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,100
Okay.

1082
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,860
That's the kind

1083
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,780
of setup we've got

1084
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:32,960
here.

1085
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,480
Tarzan's radio station,

1086
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,540
Ducks Dot Mountain,

1087
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,440
Fossil House,

1088
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,360
Stang Ranch,

1089
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,720
Stang County, Texas.

1090
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,080
Oh, Stang'sville.

1091
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,780
Stang'sville,

1092
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,080
not Stang County.

1093
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,580
Stang'sville in Stang...

1094
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,100
Well, it's in

1095
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,080
Stang County.

1096
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,560
What an ego.

1097
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,900
Sure, it's in

1098
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,640
Stang County,

1099
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,040
but you're not

1100
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,740
supposed to remind

1101
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,520
everyone, like,

1102
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,220
rub your nose.

1103
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,220
My family's been

1104
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,120
here for centuries.

1105
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,540
They're a bunch

1106
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,200
of Confederate

1107
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,120
ludicroids.

1108
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:57,900
No, they were here

1109
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,140
before the Spaniards.

1110
00:54:59,140 --> 00:54:59,780
They were here

1111
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,540
in the 1300s.

1112
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,160
They were a bunch

1113
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,120
of first Neanderthal

1114
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,240
colonists of Texas.

1115
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,200
Oh, and Dave,

1116
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,120
if you could be here.

1117
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,660
Well, that's where

1118
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,980
they did discover

1119
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,500
those people

1120
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,220
that were like,

1121
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,360
there's many, many,

1122
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,200
many more thousands

1123
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,660
of years.

1124
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,600
Yeah, no kidding.

1125
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,720
That blew my mind.

1126
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,820
They found evidence

1127
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,500
that there were

1128
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,080
hunters slaying mammoths

1129
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:21,940
in California

1130
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,680
130,000 years ago.

1131
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,000
That no one

1132
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,860
had ever placed

1133
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,140
humans in the new world

1134
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,680
before about

1135
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,000
10,000 years ago.

1136
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,220
11,000 years ago.

1137
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,380
This is a major thing.

1138
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,480
Old world, yeah.

1139
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,560
And maybe things

1140
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,160
are true,

1141
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,480
what the Indians,

1142
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,960
what the Native Americans

1143
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,740
would say,

1144
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,420
is true that they

1145
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,100
were the first

1146
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,660
modern humans.

1147
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:49,700
Right.

1148
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,340
There may have been

1149
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,440
prehistoric humans

1150
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,140
here first.

1151
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,580
How did they get here?

1152
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,540
Only alien transfer

1153
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,880
can explain it.

1154
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,540
Eric Von Donaghan's

1155
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,700
Chariots of the Gods

1156
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,520
on sale now.

1157
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,220
Chairman of the Geese.

1158
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:04,920
The Geese?

1159
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,380
Is that what his name was,

1160
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,000
Von Donaghan?

1161
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,580
Chairman of the Geese?

1162
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,300
Of spark plugs of the gods

1163
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,100
is what I call it.

1164
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,040
Spark plugs of the gods.

1165
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,200
These ancient spark plugs

1166
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,740
were found in 80 billion

1167
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,800
year old rock.

1168
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,160
Proving that man

1169
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,280
could not have built

1170
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,720
the pyramids himself

1171
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,520
because brown people

1172
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,440
are too dumb

1173
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,160
to build giant monuments.

1174
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,920
Only aliens can help them

1175
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,900
and that explains everything.

1176
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,580
That was what I hated

1177
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,420
about the whole blitz.

1178
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:31,500
You know,

1179
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1180
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1181
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1182
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1183
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1184
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1185
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,500


1186
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,760
it's totally baloney too.

1187
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,800
Yeah.

1188
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,260
They know how the pyramids

1189
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,720
and Stonehenge were built

1190
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,540
with a lot of clever,

1191
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,860
clever thought put into it.

1192
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,860
And actually,

1193
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,520
I think the people

1194
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:47,980
who built the pyramids

1195
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,660
were paid.

1196
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,800
Uh-huh.

1197
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,140
It wasn't even slated.

1198
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,760
They were paid pretty well

1199
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,600
and they were given

1200
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,120
family stipends too.

1201
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,920
So apparently there were

1202
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,340
a lot of people camping by.

1203
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,880
Their families were camping by

1204
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,420
near these monuments

1205
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,180
that they build them.

1206
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:01,820
There's many,

1207
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,220
you know,

1208
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,220
places where they would

1209
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,440
build an edifice like this

1210
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,660
in the current age and stuff.

1211
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,020
And they showed like

1212
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,760
what they were feeding

1213
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,700
these people along

1214
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,760
with their regular stipend

1215
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,520
of whatever was

1216
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
the equivalent of money.

1217
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,900
They had a lot of food

1218
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,180
Salt.

1219
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,840
One day.

1220
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,760
Probably salt, yeah.

1221
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,940
I am civilized, man.

1222
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,840
By harnessing the power

1223
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,520
of the weak,

1224
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,120
I built the pyramids.

1225
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,200
That's a Fireside Theater quote.

1226
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,460
Yes.

1227
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,940
From I think we're all bozos

1228
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,500
on this one.

1229
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,500


1230
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,500


1231
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,500


1232
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,500


1233
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,500


1234
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,500


1235
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,020
I think that was

1236
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,660
their fourth album.

1237
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,980
Man, that was such a classic.

1238
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,860
Uh huh.

1239
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,260
Okay, Dave,

1240
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,000
we have to go now.

1241
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,380
It's the Hour of Slack.

1242
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,540
That's the show this is.

1243
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,580
We're all bozos

1244
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,360
on this bus.

1245
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,640
Huh, huh.

1246
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,440
Huh, huh.

1247
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1248
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,540
has been here with us.

1249
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,720
We're about to publish

1250
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,100
his book Neighbor World

1251
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,040
in a matter of weeks,

1252
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:58,820
I hope.

1253
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,900
I'm going to try to do

1254
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,500
the next 50 minutes

1255
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1256
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1257
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1258
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1259
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1260
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1261
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1262
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1263
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,500


1264
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,320
of 50 pages tomorrow.

1265
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,880
You gotta make sure you do it

1266
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,820
when I'm still around,

1267
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:06,580
sonny boy,

1268
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,640
you never can tell.

1269
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,440
What are you,

1270
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:08,940
that's the,

1271
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,100
yeah, that's,

1272
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,120
why do you think I'm doing

1273
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,900
this e-publishing thing, man?

1274
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,380
I know, I know, I know.

1275
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,600
We don't have that much longer.

1276
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,460
Don't let it in already.

1277
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,220
We can't wait for somebody

1278
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,060
else to do it.

1279
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:18,900
We tried that.

1280
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,860
Well, I'm just going to have

1281
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,260
to keep stinking up a storm

1282
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:24,700
wherever I go.

1283
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah, man,

1284
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,940
write another book.

1285
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,960
We'll print another one.

1286
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,980
It doesn't cost anything.

1287
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,660
It's easy.

1288
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,220
Yeah, Dave,

1289
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,420
please write another book.

1290
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,420
I'd love it if you wrote another one.

1291
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,480
Okay, Dave,

1292
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:31,680
I don't know,

1293
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,480
this one is even sillier

1294
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,160
than that one,

1295
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,820
or less.

1296
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,020
Okay, man,

1297
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,480
it'll all be there

1298
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,360
at subgenius.com

1299
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,080
when the time comes.

1300
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,820
Praise Bob.

1301
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,580
When the time comes.

1302
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,620
Hail Connie.

1303
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,520
Hail Connie.

1304
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:48,980
Praise Bob.

1305
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,200
Praise Bob.

1306
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,360
Leaving Earth

1307
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,380
for a colony world

1308
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,640
is more than a life change.

1309
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,900
It's a leap of faith

1310
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,860
between the stars.

1311
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,500
Don't you want to travel

1312
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:00,960
in style?

1313
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,460
I'm not going to.

1314
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1315
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1316
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1317
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1318
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1319
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1320
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1321
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1322
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,280
Take flight

1323
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,860
on the starship Avalon,

1324
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,300
the Homestead Company's

1325
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,940
finest colonial starliner.

1326
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,640
Our state-of-the-art

1327
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,460
hibernation bay

1328
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,000
has room

1329
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,340
for 5,000

1330
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,180
sleeping passengers.

1331
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,580
You'll wake up

1332
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,060
in orbit

1333
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,360
around your colony world

1334
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,860
and meet your fellow passengers

1335
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,020
on a four-month

1336
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,320
orientation cruise.

1337
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,720
Dulge your senses

1338
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,400
at a dozen

1339
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,300
gourmet restaurants.

1340
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,520
Relax at the

1341
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,320
Concourse Bar,

1342
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,880
where the best bartender

1343
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,640
in the galaxy

1344
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,100
is always on duty.

1345
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,460
And if you're

1346
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,460


1347
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,460


1348
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,460


1349
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,460


1350
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,460


1351
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:31,460


1352
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,580
at your service,

1353
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,880
see the stars in style

1354
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,560
on the starship Avalon,

1355
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,940
a Homestead Company starship.

1356
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,180
All passengers enter

1357
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:40,880
a lifetime contract

1358
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,780
with the Homestead Company.

1359
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,480
The Homestead Company

1360
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,020
is not liable

1361
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:43,520
for financial

1362
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,320
or personal losses

1363
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,100
incurred by passengers.

1364
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,680
Make yours

1365
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,760
a flight to remember.

1366
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,540
Dave actually did hang up.

1367
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,460
I'm sorry.

1368
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1369
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1370
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1371
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1372
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1373
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1374
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1375
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1376
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1377
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1378
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1379
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1380
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1381
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,460


1382
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,840
I didn't fade him out

1383
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,160
or anything.

1384
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,460
Well, friends,

1385
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,280
that's my cue

1386
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,020
to tell you.

1387
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,480
Now, I know

1388
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,620
there's still some holdouts

1389
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,360
who don't think

1390
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,200
that joining

1391
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,940
the Church of the Subgenius

1392
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,580
is the cool thing to do

1393
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,640
because they're not joiners.

1394
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,080
Well, you're right

1395
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,120
and you're wrong

1396
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,740
because you're buying

1397
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,280
a really cool kit

1398
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,460
for your 35 bucks.

1399
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,460
A kit with 35 bucks

1400
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,400
and 30 different pieces

1401
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,800
of stuff in there,

1402
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,020
most of it printing matter,

1403
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,420
that will take you

1404
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:42,660
a month to really soak up.

1405
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,360
Just the two pamphlets

1406
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,360
take like a week to read

1407
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,580
and a magnifying glass.

1408
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,220
So, friends, think about it.

1409
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,320
Subgenius.com, 35 bucks.

1410
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,600
You become a minister.

1411
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,880
You get to meet

1412
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,480
the other subgeniuses.

1413
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,320
You may not want to do that.

1414
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,460
Can't say it's a good thing.

1415
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,140
I guess I blame you

1416
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:02,880
in some cases,

1417
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,180
but you also don't know

1418
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,040
what kind of hot stuff

1419
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,340
you might be missing out on.

1420
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,240
And mainly it is not slack.

1421
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,000
You have to make your own slack,

1422
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,260
but it is an ever-present

1423
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,260
encouragement to do so.

1424
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,900
Don't just accept

1425
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,560
the false slack of the conspiracy.

1426
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,100
Get off the stick

1427
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,060
and get on the stick

1428
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,940
and get some slack for yourself

1429
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,720
with a little boost,

1430
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,720
a little bootstrap up

1431
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,560
from subgenius.com

1432
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,820
and that great big thing

1433
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,100
we call the membership pack.

1434
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,420
I'll be writing your name

1435
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,600
and address on the outside

1436
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,400
of the pack myself.

1437
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,640
That's how it works.

1438
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,860
It's very personalized still

1439
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,460
because, let's face it,

1440
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,100
we're not Scientology.

1441
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,000
And you can thank me for that.

1442
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,640
Praise Bob.

1443
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,320
Praise Bob.
