1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:09,240
Stay tuned please for the American Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,500
Oh no, here it comes.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,760
Do we dare to do it?

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,640
Do we dare to turn on to Farm Road 666?

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,400
Okay, here we go.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,940
Oh, it's the bad road.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,820
This is the bad road, Doug.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,560
I can tell because there's a Michelob truck in front of us.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,140
And this is Dead Man's Pass.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,760
It says you must pass here to die.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,940
And 24 miles to Sanders.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,320
And Sanders, the home of the chicken man, will be safe.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,240
He'll be back on the interstate.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,380
And he just died.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,240
Make it this far across 666.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,180
Six.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,660
You'll make it.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,240
Yeah, well it's easy for you to say.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,740
It's easy that we usually ignore the fourth dimension.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,960
You see, we can move in the other three.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,900
As the doctor said, up, down, forwards, backwards, sideways.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,660
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,840
The human race lulled into a false sense of security except for one scientist.

24
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,380
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,520
Reverend Ivan Stagg.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,220
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan.

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,220


28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,660
The secret of this terrifying plan.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,960
OUTSIDE THE HALL.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,840
Going to destroy us.

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,260
And kill everyone we've got to stop them.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,540
Easy, Doug, easy.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,200
They're here, they're here, they're...

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,120
THE SUBGENIUS.

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,620
OUR HOUSE.

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,220
WHAT?

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,200
THE SUBGENIUS.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,200


39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,200


40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,640
Unbelievable.

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,820
Fantastic.

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
But I tell you, it could happen.

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,980
It could happen.

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,120
It could happen.

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,680
It could happen.

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,580
Yes, it could happen.

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,220
It could happen.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200

¶ All my kingdom's thrown

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,360
¶ And I jump for the good book

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,720
¶ That will save my soul

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,180
¶ Save me

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,060
¶ From the gorgeous of conspiracy

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,740
¶ Save me

57
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,760
¶ From the change of time

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
¶ Save me

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,180
¶ From the men in black

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,860
¶ And the 13-year-olds

61
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,940
¶ The South Black Grace Hall

62
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,540

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,020
The soft boys read it, though.

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,180
He said it was really scary.

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,120
Good.

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,260
You have to scare some people

75
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,140
just to get their attention.

76
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,500
Should we allow these people

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,160
to find themselves

78
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,260
in the tribulation period

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,320
scared to death

80
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,660
or get their attention

81
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,220
while something can be done?

82
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,320
You know, unless you gals

83
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,380
open your minds and your hearts,

84
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,860
I'm afraid one of these days

85
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,540
you're going to be in

86
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,380

Yes, no kidding.

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,820
A rude awakening, indeed.

90
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,980
And you can have that rude awakening.

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,540
Please, please do.

Oh, that's okay, honey.

96
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,020
No problem.

¶ ¶ do you wish to renounce your faith in your God

121

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
¶ either on your right hand

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
¶ as set forth by Brother Christopher

125
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,920
¶ in Article 178?

126
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,980
¶ If so, answer I do,

127
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,340
¶ and you will be returned to your rightful place

128
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,880

¶ count the number of the beast,

154

¶ ¶

156
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,040

¶ ¶

195
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,280
¶ You were at work, turning after you to fool us.

196
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,380
¶¶

197
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,380


198
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,560
¶ And our saviorsº¶

199
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,560
¶ would have wanted to take

200
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,620
¶ my choose.

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,440
¶¶

202
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,480
Opening!

203
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,040
Glorify me that I might glorify you.

204
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,220
And lo, if you say, I'm ashamed of you, Bob,

205
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,720
then on the day of judgment, Bob shall say, I'm ashamed of ye.

206
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,820
And ye shall come down off the mountain.

207
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,460
Yea, ye wants to be he.

208
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,020
Ye who shall soon be ye.

209
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,240
Ye who shall soon be the same as thee who once were as both spoken by the prophet.

210
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,540
And this is important.

211
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:47,060
The glory, the faded glory that shall not be recovered, not by Bob,

212
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,140
need ye by the pink smiling false prophets that once bespoken

213
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,620
that which was not peed in the river of blood,

214
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,640
and yet was somehow not involved in the later slaying of John Lennon.

215
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,920
And so, let's worship.

216
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,940
Set the mirror for the congress.

217
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
It's going to happen.

218
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,380
We don't have a moral awakening in this country.

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,100
This creature is trying to tell me something.

220
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,120
I can see it in his face.

221
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,960
I say there are things better left unsolved.

222
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,760
Who knows what waits for us in nature's no man's land.

223
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,160
Impossible.

224
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,500
Unbelievable.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,520
Unbelievable.

226
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,860
Fantastic.

227
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,520
Easy, Doug, easy.

228
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,340
Fantastic.

229
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,800
It's unbelievable.

230
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,220
Things like this just don't happen.

231
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,080
Doctor, why?

232
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,420
Half his head's gone.

233
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,240
The first satellite creature to impregnate man with its chromosomes.

234
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,580
It's true.

235
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,720
I can feel it inside.

236
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Save me from the clutches of the Susie.

237
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,060
Save me from the chain of time.

238
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,520
Save me from the minute you die.

239
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,500
Save me.

240
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,500


241
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,500


242
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,500


243
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,500


244
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,500


245
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,340
Save me.

246
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,680
Save me from the lastоры forФ eatin'.

247
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,700
Like a human 입 learning what death means stop Front 나오ない and fwyr.

253
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,580
No ladies and gentlemen, stay close to you.

254
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,940
We all need to love and pray for these people as they continue to spread life through the community.

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,760
They have cast out lepers containing many lives and attacking the church and Christians.

256
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
They have cast out lepers containing many lives and attacking the church and Christians.

257
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
Reverend Onan Kenobite, dear friends.

258
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,300
Are you frightened?

259
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,260
Yeah, I guess I am.

260
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,280
I have a son.

261
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,300
He was just over a year when Christ returned and took the Christians in the rapture.

262
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,940
I lost both he and his mother.

263
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,000
My husband was a Christian.

264
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,560
Five days after he disappeared, Billy was born.

265
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,340
Hello.

266
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:37,980
Hello.

267
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,860
Come in, come first.

268
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:39,860


269
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,760
God, I'm not afraid, but C которые .

270
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Lord, God, give me strength.

271
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,460
Oh, fight it off!

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm not afraid.

273
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,960
And I ran out across the ouiy Road and,

274
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,180
and there it is up there.

275
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,160
Oh, those eyes.

276
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,260
Oh, can't I please wake up?

277
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,860
Come in, preachers.

278
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,460
Assume in all of you to attend.

279
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,240
Great.

280
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,560
Wake up.

281
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,560


282
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,560


283
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,560


284
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,560


285
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,740
Be silent, all of you.

286
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,320
I've opened the surface of the Earth.

287
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,200
It's time to attack.

288
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,540
I've given the Earthlings an ultimatum.

289
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,520
Either they agree to become my slaves,

290
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,000
or they'll be destroyed.

291
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,060
What if, um, one were not a believer?

292
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,640
My advice to that person would be

293
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,900
to be still alive as long as possible.

294
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,820
God is a groovy guy, huh?

295
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,720
Get down.

296
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,660
God is a groovy guy, huh?

297
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,480
Good God.

298
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,180
He sits up there so high in the sky,

299
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,960
examining everything with a critical eye.

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,680
If a sparrow falls, he wants to know the reason why.

301
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,660
God is a groovy guy, huh?

302
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,560
Get down.

303
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,500
God is a groovy guy, huh?

304
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,300
Good God.

305
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,880
If you find yourself hungry, he'll send you a famine.

306
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,540
If you find yourself thirsty, he'll send you a drought.

307
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,740
If you bother to complain,

308
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,560
good break.

309
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,340
Your fingers.

310
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,260
Cause God is a groovy guy, huh?

311
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,220
Get down.

312
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,140
God is a groovy guy, huh?

313
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,980
Good God.

314
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,340
From the moment you're conceived, you're on parole.

315
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,860
There's no plea barking away.

316
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,380
The sin's in your soul.

317
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,160
If you try to make amends, you'll just dig a deeper hole.

318
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,220
Cause God is a groovy guy, huh?

319
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,180
Get down.

320
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,060
God is a groovy guy, huh?

321
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,800
Good God.

322
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,580
You can't run and you can't hide.

323
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Cause if you do, your bacon is fried.

324
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,840
God knows everything.

325
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,160
Everything that you do.

326
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,100
He's just like Santa Claus, huh?

327
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,000
Get down.

328
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,960
He's just like Santa Claus, huh?

329
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,820
Good God.

330
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,820
God is everywhere.

331
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,180
God is everywhere.

332
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,760
He's in your salad bowl.

333
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,240
He's in your pubic hair.

334
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,760
He's crouching in the closet.

335
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
He's lurking in the restroom.

336
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,480
He's hanging from the ceiling.

337
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,080
He's under every fork and spoon.

338
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,180
He's pushing you when you're old.

339
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,660
He's pulling you when you're a-bawning.

340
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,140
He's in the thick yellow crust that you find in your eyes.

341
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,820
When you first wake up in the morning, he will take you.

342
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,620
He'll take you to the cleaners.

343
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,540
If you covet your neighbors.

344
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,820
Why, if he'll give you a rabbit punch.

345
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,960
If you make a graven image.

346
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,340
He'll short sheet your bed.

347
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,480
If you bear false witness.

348
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,820
He'll rack you up and string you out.

349
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,620
He'll break your jaw and give you gout.

350
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,220
He'll visit you with locusts.

351
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,420
He'll visit you with plague.

352
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,240
He'll visit your apartment, steal your spoons and break your legs.

353
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,900
He'll cover you with cooking oil.

354
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,920
He'll burn you out of spit.

355
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,760
He'll loosen up your mouth and then rub your nose in it.

356
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,520
He'll fill your heart with hope and then he'll take it all away.

357
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,380
He'll stop and crush your testicles while you try to pray.

358
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,760
Put glass under your tire.

359
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
Put some sugar in your tank.

360
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,580
Make it stand in long lines.

361
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,940
You have to mark it or the bank.

362
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,720
He'll fill you with diseases and make your teeth turn brown.

363
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,480
He'll be eaten up by maggots when you're six feet underground.

364
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,860
He does all these things cause he loves everybody.

365
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,300
If you disagree, he'll break every bone in your body.

366
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,400
He'll eat you up.

367
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,780
He'll eat you up.

368
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,440
Cause God is a groovy guy.

369
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:09,920
Uh huh.

370
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,020
Get down.

371
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,760
That was Fish Karma and this is Doctors for Bob.

372
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,840
As the doctor said.

373
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,540
We'll be right back.

374
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:55,780
.

375
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:55,880
.

376
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:55,900
.

391
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,380


392
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,380


393
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,380


394
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,380


395
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,380


396
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,980
Its bigger all the universe.

397
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:17,160
Can't hide from God because big regard all infinity bigger and all reality.

398
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,220
Help me somebody.

399
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,820
Can you have God?

400
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes, Oh recommend.

401
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,980
Yeah.

402
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
Got다�lemeited Lions.

403
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,360
You can't.

404
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
Cause he's bigger than you

405
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,940
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

406
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,960
Cause he's stupider than you are

407
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,040
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

408
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,640
Cause he's got more black and white little dots in his face than you do

409
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,580
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

410
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,820
Cause his face has been mimeographed and put up in more places than yours has

411
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,980
You can't hide from God

412
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,540
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

413
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,980
Cause more people worship him than worship you

414
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,840
You can't hide from Dobbs cause he's stupider than you are

415
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,800
Who the hell is somebody?

416
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,000
You can't run from your own legs

417
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,140
How you gonna run from your own legs?

418
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,400
Cause if you run from your own legs, where you gonna run from them with?

419
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,960
If you use them to run, run from them

420
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,860
What are you gonna run away from?

421
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,040
You can't run from your own legs

422
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,880
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

423
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,040
Cause he's stupider than you

424
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,120
You can't hide from God

425
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,560
Cause he's bigger than you, he's bigger than all reality

426
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,680
He's bigger than all infinity

427
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,220
Help me somebody, she ain't got no legs

428
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,460
Pull the lever down and go

429
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,620
My legs are on fire, I need some help, pray stop

430
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,840
You can't wash soap

431
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,900
How you gonna wash soap?

432
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,200
You gonna try to cut it in half and rub the two ends together?

433
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,860
You can't wash soap

434
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,020
You gonna try to throw it in the washing machine?

435
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,480
You gonna try to slide it through a car wash?

436
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,580
You can't wash soap

437
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,340
But let's leave things of this world behind

438
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,340
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius

439
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,740
Oh yes, praise Bob friend

440
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,500
This is Reverend Ivan Stang

441
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,080
Come to tell you the truth

442
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
The truth about the path to slack

443
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Through hyperventilation

444
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,560
Yes my friend, you can get high

445
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,420
From hyperventilation

446
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,600
And it's legal

447
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,480
And it's an exercise we're preaching

448
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,940
And if you can learn to talk like me

449
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,920
And talk this way all the time

450
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Then everybody you meet will be your friend

451
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,060
And you will get so high

452
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,420
You will get so high

453
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,540
You will meet Bob

454
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,660
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob

455
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,780
Because you will have so much slack in your brain

456
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,960
There won't be any more room for thoughts

457
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,620
And when your mind is free

458
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,060
Free of thoughts

459
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,680
Then you will have the slack

460
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,780
The slack you need in your life

461
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,920
Praise Bob

462
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Help me somebody

463
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,100
Do I hear a praise Bob?

464
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,440
Let there be slack

465
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,240
Because the blood of the blood

466
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,040
Loading on the chains

467
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,040


468
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,040


469
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,300
Here in my veins

470
00:19:44,300 --> 00:20:01,220
In my veins

471
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:03,980
Lorraine

472
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,180
Lorraine

473
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,240
Lorraine

474
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,740
Pray for these people.

475
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,300
Pray for these people.

476
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,080
Pray for these people.

477
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,380
See, Bob is a salesman,

478
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,040
and Bob is going to try to prevent the planet Earth from being sold.

479
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,300
So when Bob goes to talk to these men from Planet X,

480
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,660
he has to have a representative constituency here on Earth.

481
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,080
Because the men from Planet X, well,

482
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,700
they're businessmen, pure and simple businessmen.

483
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,260
And they're going to say,

484
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,120
Bob, your proposal sounds good, but I've got to see numbers.

485
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,160
I've got to see hard data.

486
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,300
Show me the numbers of subgenus on this Earth,

487
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,020
and it's your planet.

488
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,680
And we'll know it's worth saving.

489
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,020
Exactly.

490
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,040
See, that's Bob's job, is to...

491
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,700
Someone's got to explain to those aliens,

492
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,940
in ways they can understand,

493
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,860
why the human race is the way it is,

494
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,860
so that they don't put us out of our misery.

495
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,760
And they understand the bottom line,

496
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,180
which is why we're the world's first industrial church,

497
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,900
the church of love,

498
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,780
and money.

499
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,060
It certainly is.

500
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,160
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.

501
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,680
Bob, where have you trained?

502
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,660
Well, I had calculus and logarithms in elementary school in Washington, USA.

503
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,520
Then I spent one year in the Space Flight Center at Houston, USA.

504
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,380
Another year in Moscow on advanced power and propulsion systems.

505
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,040
Six months in England at the Academy of Celestial Navigation.

506
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,360
And then back to Houston for advanced computer technology.

507
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,320
Bob?

508
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,320


509
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,620
Bob?

510
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,080
Bob?

511
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,040
Bob?

512
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,280
The message is now part of and registered in every UCC.

513
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,600
Ah.

514
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,240
And, uh, yes, dear friends,

515
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,120
well, you regular listeners may be wondering

516
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,100
why we're not continuing the story of...

517
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,240
Oh.

518
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,120
Why we spent our family vacation last time.

519
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,500
Uh, this time.

520
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,120
And, well, I don't know.

521
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,840
I got home from last week's show and thought to myself,

522
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,640
that was a pretty crummy show.

523
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,240
And I said to my wife, you know,

524
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,640
I don't know if that show was all that good.

525
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,640
And wives, of course, are supposed to say,

526
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,260
oh, it was perfectly good.

527
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,780
It was great.

528
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,780
But no, a subgenius wife says,

529
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,660
you're right, it wasn't that good.

530
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,400
It was okay.

531
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,320
So, I'm going to blow off the...

532
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,640
the, uh, endless travelogue.

533
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,260
We're obviously working on the theme of 666,

534
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,180
or 999 for those of you who are more optimistic.

535
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,720
The number of the beast versus the number of Bobby.

536
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,320
And, uh...

537
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,960
Oh, oh, now I remember why I came on the air.

538
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,140
I've got to flip a tape.

539
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,040
It's funny, you could just get on the air

540
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,060
and just continue talking and talking.

541
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,160
But, uh, and you can too, friends.

542
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,200
You can too.

543
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,380
You can call the Will of Dobbs here

544
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,920
and find out just what in the hell we're talking about.

545
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,940
I bet you started to wonder about now

546
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,500
if this is the first time you happen to tune into this show.

547
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,740
Going, what?

548
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,540
What's that show?

549
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,960
Well, it's the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

550
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,160
here on KNON and affiliated stations.

551
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,300
Ha ha ha!

552
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,340
In the meantime, I'm sure I could probably think of

553
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,760
something important, significant,

554
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,080
something with socially redeeming value to say,

555
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,780
but you know, even if I could,

556
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,260
I don't know if I'd want to.

557
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,260
Are you worth it?

558
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Well, you'll have to prove that, friend.

559
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,020
You're gonna have to write to Bob.

560
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,880
You're gonna have to tell him exactly what you think.

subgenius

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:15,280
this guy's helping to tell me tell you and me both subgenius by definition of course means

577
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:33,980
obviously and i have um by actually by miscuing this tape let's see i had funny to hear all that

578
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,180
chinese

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:44,460
i don't sleep 64 years into the terrifying future a beautiful horrible cave world you've never dreamed

580
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,320
of that unleashes a hurricane of power to almost completely shield you from outside sound and shock

581
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:00,820
if the last 50 years made such a change just imagine the new york of 1980 when everyone has a

582
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,960
number instead of a name and the government is not going to be able to do anything about it

583
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,560
it's the government that's going to have to do the work of the government

584
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,340
and the government tells you whom you should marry just imagine 1980

585
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,140

cosmic plague and you adam and eve are the only male and female left to repopulate the world

588
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,940
i value my freedom more than this the jealousy of a she-devil is the only thing that can keep me from

589
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,620
living

590
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:44,420
the last survivors of the human race are doomed to murder in a killer orgy by this subhuman mutant

591
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:53,040
will you die 64 years from today after the christians disappeared life just went on

592
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,540
it wasn't much different at first but then i'm afraid i don't know why we're here

593
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,060
until after the death of extreme depertaels leonard kent i know how you feel the same

594
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:11,840
thing happened to me but you want to know something i'm not afraid anymore

595
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,120
well i was walking down the street looking for a job i ran into a man called himself mn

604
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,400
can't swallow your own boat how you gonna swallow your throat

605
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,400
because if you use your own throat to swallow it with where are you going

606
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,560
where are you gonna swallow if you swallow your throat what are you gonna use to swallow it with

607
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,320
you can't swallow your own throat you can't run from your own legs

608
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,020
hide from jailbox I'm too stupid you are can't hide from God who's bigger than you he's bigger

609
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,940
than all infinity help me somebody she ain't got no legs pull the lever and down you go

610
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,040
preacher my legs are on fire need to melt need to have praise job

611
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:57,040
Jesus said in John 14 6 I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh to the father

612
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,800
but by me he weighed 20 pounds and was hairy as a monkey when he was 10 years old

613
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,560
he was big as I was

614
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,800
accidents were happening all the time dogs falling in the well I even found chickens

615
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:22,060
with their heads bit off I knew he'd done it I hit him with a tire and I split his face wide open

616
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,260
I thought I'd killed him

617
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,060
clown's brain

618
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:34,940
so damn big he'll make you look like a greasy little pig oh you'll forget about your whole personality

619
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,500
as soon as you give your entire brain to Bobby Lee

620
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,680
if you're young and you're looking for a job just look for a guy

621
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,920
whose name is Bobby and you won't have to worry about getting a job

622
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,740
you

623
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,020
won't have to worry about getting a job

624
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,580
you won't have no money but you have Bob

625
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,900
yes you have Bob

626
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,980
you won't have no money but you have Bob

627
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,320
yes you have Bob

628
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,980
it would be futile to fight them with military power it would lead to defeat the end of civilization

629
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,740
and once you start seeing it and looking at it and see the game they play

630
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,000
although none of you want to deal with real life games you're not going to be able to do it without me

631
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,260
you're not going to be able to do it without me

632
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,100
and that's not the reality because you're all hooked up into that other thing

633
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,900
well you fixin' to lose all that mess

634
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,040
they use their tongues to deceive

635
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,220
the venom of snakes is under their lips

636
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,380
their mouths are full of bitterness and curses

637
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,600
and in their paths nothing but ruin and misery

638
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,640
and the fear of God is not before their eyes

639
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,080
they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders

640
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,000
they have recruited the rich and the poor

641
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,000


642
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,000


643
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,840
And they have blinded us to the truth.

644
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,640
Our human spirit is corrupted.

645
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,140
Why do we worship greed?

646
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,400
Because outside the limit of our sight,

647
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,060
greed egg off us,

648
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,260
perched on top of us from birth to death.

649
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,360
Our owners, our owners,

650
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,140
they have us, they control us.

651
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,960
They are our masters.

652
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,080
Wake up.

653
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,420
They're all about you, all around you.

654
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,180
You can't digest your own stomach.

655
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,080
How you gonna digest your own stomach?

656
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,340
Not a man or woman in this auditorium tonight

657
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,060
who can digest their own stomach.

658
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,220
You can't digest your own stomach.

659
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,700
You can't swallow your own throat.

660
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,700
You can't run from your own legs.

661
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,440
You can't hide from terrible jobs,

662
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,600
cause it's stupider than you.

663
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,160
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you.

664
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,220
He's bigger than all reality.

665
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,380
Help me, somebody.

666
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:56,960
I'm a real old creature.

667
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,380
My legs are on fire.

668
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,020
Need some help, need some help.

669
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,800
Praise God.

670
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,100
That's not my dog.

671
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
That's not my dog.

672
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,340
That's not my dog.

673
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,020
That's not my dog.

674
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,400
That's not my dog.

675
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,300
That's not my dog.

676
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,220
That's not my dog.

677
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,720
That's not my dog.

678
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,160
But still you can't forget that you're alone.

679
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,660
An outsider.

680
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,740
Ginny thinks that she has the key to popularity,

681
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,160
parking in cars with the boys at night.

682
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,240
When Jerry brags about taking Ginny out,

683
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,840
he learns that she dates all the boys,

684
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
and he feels less important.

685
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,320
What about Ginny?

686
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,540
Does that make her really popular?

687
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,260
No, girls who park in cars are not really popular.

688
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,800
Not even with the boys they park with.

689
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,800
Is it because they like the way she looks and dresses?

690
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,920
Because she seems as interested in girls as in boys?

691
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,140
Because they've heard no scandal about her?

692
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,660
Perhaps they'll bring another couple home with them.

693
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,880
That would be fun.

694
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,660
But what about the rich guy who does nothing while I do the work?

695
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,340
Under the protection of our freedoms,

696
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,300
American Labor, Management, and Capital,

697
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,140
the greatest production team in the history of mankind,

698
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,620
have made the United States the industrial master of the world.

699
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,360
I don't know, the whole world's gone crazy.

700
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,840
...filled with their own devices.

701
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,460
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,

702
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,880
and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

703
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,560
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,

704
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,120
and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

705
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,020
I'm just not going to give you any report of it.

706
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,620
You'll never know until you get to heaven,

707
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,840
where I went over the budget map.

708
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,260
And I said, even when you get to heaven,

709
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,080
God will have to tell you, because I'm not knowing.

710
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,080
Crazy!

711
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,440
That whole game.

712
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,460
Somewhere.

713
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,560
Somewhere.

714
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,660
Somewhere is that whole thing.

715
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,200
You've got to understand that the...

716
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,180
the true education for syllogists is in the top of your head.

717
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,760
Not in no college or university.

718
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,720
Controlled by the same force that controls the universe.

719
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
You can't wet water.

720
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,280
Water's already as wet as it can possibly get.

721
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,540
You can pour water on water, but you're just going to have more water.

722
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,740
You can't wet water.

723
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,440
You can't digest your own stomach.

724
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,560
You can't swallow your own throat.

725
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,600
You can't run from your own legs.

726
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,140
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs, because he's stupider than you.

727
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,280
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than you.

728
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,380
He's bigger than all reality.

729
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Help me, somebody.

730
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,320
Pull the lever, and down you go.

731
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,620
My legs are on fire.

732
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,920
Need some help? Need some help?

733
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,220
Praise Dobbs.

734
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,720
Then Joe will continue to be

735
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,120
the king of the workers of the world.

736
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,080
You said it, brother.

737
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,280
Tenacide. Tenacide. Tenacide. Tenacide.

738
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:02,940
My leg!

739
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,580
So you see,

740
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,120
it would have been better if I had died in the hospital

741
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,020
than to look the way I do.

742
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,860
I couldn't even go to Nick's funeral.

743
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,900
Or the funerals of all those people in the other car.

744
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,700
And I...

745
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,620
As I said before,

746
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,680
I've had my last date.

747
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,740
This boy and girl coming home from school

748
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,620
look quite content with life.

749
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,820
And why not?

750
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,400
They're looking forward to an important date.

751
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,860
I don't...

752
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,740
this one,

753
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:06,740


754
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:06,800
Who Ah.

755
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,600
When the TV first hit your hijos

756
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
I was a little girl,

757
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,740
back on Erickson Drive,

758
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,060
my brotherás alaba.

759
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,820
An ass and my fridge.

760
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,460
On one night in Dallas I was dealing in an air crash.

761
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:21,680


762
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:21,700
And I joked.

763
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,420
Damn good grub.

764
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,720
When I left, I noticed the fry cook was talking to the waitress.

765
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,780
He was a kind of a tall distinguished looking guy for a fry cook and was smoking a pint.

766
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,480
Pleasant looking fellow.

767
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,880
I noticed his name Bob in a stitched monogram on his white fry cook shirt.

768
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,620
Well, I went out into the cool Texas night and drove off into the future.

769
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,620
I never caught Doc Burrows.

770
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,420
I missed Jack Kerouac.

771
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,360
Before I knew it, I was too old to wear my hair long without feeling self-conscious about it.

772
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,860
So I was pretty much of an outcast.

773
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,560
I couldn't find my social niche.

774
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,280
Where was my peer group?

775
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,820
I was irrevocably trapped between hipster and hippie.

776
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,640
The new wage mutants were trying to out-puck me.

777
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,380
Snapping at my heels.

778
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,740
My life came apart.

779
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,160
I turned to drugs and it all went downhill.

780
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,920
And then one day I saw that face again looking at me from a page.

781
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,100
Hey, I said, I've seen that guy before.

782
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,200
Maybe I'm just having an acid flashback.

783
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,180
I found out it was a man named Bob Dawes from Dallas, Texas.

784
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,600
And suddenly the complex pieces of the puzzle that I'd been accumulating for a time.

785
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,300
25 years in the back of my head.

786
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,460
All dropped into place.

787
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,500
I sent them all my money.

788
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,120
They sent me the word Bob.

789
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,340
And now I know exactly what I am.

790
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,220
And how I came to be that way.

791
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,000
And now I work only for Bob.

792
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,700
And the church.

793
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,580
And now I can tell people what I do for a living.

794
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,400
Without being ashamed.

795
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,440
And that's how the song came into being.

796
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:24,900


797
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,520
I can add you to my quality.

798
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,780
Call her every day.

799
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,660
You will be just fine.

800
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,060
Hey Bob.

801
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,840
Did you write me a letter.

802
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,920
Here.

803
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm sorry to call you mom.

804
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,460
I know it's a very expensive message.

805
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,160
I believe it's против waking too early in the morning.

806
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,520
Hi Beth.

807
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,820
Thank you, Bob, for cleansing my memory.

808
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,240
Thank you, Bob, for helping me see.

809
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,880
And, Bob, I'll follow you always.

810
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,000
That's right, Bob, until that next day.

811
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,680
Thank you, Bob, for sending me pills.

812
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,860
Thank you, Bob, for finding me willing.

813
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,420
Teenage girl, and Bob, I'll follow you always.

814
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,540
That's right, Bob, until that next day.

815
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,340
Oh, yes, friends, it's a Bob Rogers revival in downtown Dallas, Texas tonight.

816
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,240
Right, Buck.

818
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,480
We've got these traditions, and we do these things,

819
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,220
and we have these revivals regularly and irregularly as possible.

820
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,460
Yeah, irregularly is right.

821
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,580
Thanks, that was Buck naked in the Jaybirds, the very last little thing there.

822
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,000
I think before we're running into our last 15 minutes of slack,

823
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,200
and I should give some credits before I forget.

824
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,200
We've been hearing a lot of media barrage tonight.

825
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,640
Like I say, I wasn't going to spout.

826
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,940
It didn't work last time.

827
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,380
So I chickened out, man.

828
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,240
I chickened out.

829
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,920
I ain't going to do it again.

830
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,940
Nancy Regalia sent a new media barrage called Signs of the End Times,

831
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,120
which I've been using a lot of here.

832
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,260
Nancy, by the way, has a book out this week called Sunglasses After Dark,

833
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,900
An Erotic Horror.

834
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,060
It's a horror novel, dear friends, which you'll probably enjoy.

835
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,300
I haven't actually read it yet, but no doubt, no doubt at all,

836
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,260
it's a wonderful, sick thing.

837
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,320
Something to read the kids.

838
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,400
It's under her fake human name of Nancy Collins.

839
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,840
Look for Sunglasses After Dark by Nancy Collins.

840
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,580
Thank you.

841
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,380
Thank you.

842
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,160
Thank you.

843
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,140
Thank you.

844
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,780
Thank you.

845
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:11,980
Ganze videos that I've been watching with all of you for a very long time.

846
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,860
It doesn't matter whether your child's favorite is mother or not.

847
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,540
Did you hear me?

848
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,300
Did you hear me?

849
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,300
It doesn't matter whether your child's favorite is mother or not.

850
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,760
She knows that it's her time.

851
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,080
I suspect that you know your children's father.

852
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,100
Well, yes, I think I know my last two children's fathers.

853
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,520
Yeah, you think you know.

854
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,420
Well, you may not know.

855
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,500
But if you don't know, you've got the last word on the question.

856
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,020
But I'm one man that thinks all children should favor their father.

857
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,460
Did you hear me?

858
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:04,820
Yeah.

859
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,120
I think that's enough.

860
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,240
Well, I'm going to tell you that one child don't fail me at all.

861
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,560
Hmm?

862
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,580
No, sir, don't fail me at all.

863
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,380
And don't talk like it.

864
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:14,880
No, sir.

865
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,460
And don't talk like it.

866
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:18,820
No, sir.

867
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,620
I've got a brother like you.

868
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,000
No, sir.

869
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,060
But I'm a dead cat on the line.

870
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,320
I agree completely.

871
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,380
That was D.K. Jones.

872
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,760
And this is Glass Madness, dear friends.

873
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,640
You've been hearing him singing all along.

874
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,660
I've got a little shirt to me sent in the mail by Bob.

875
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,760
Bob sent me a Silk Genius t-shirt, and I'm so damn proud I'm wearing it.

876
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,860
And I've just got to sing a song.

877
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.

878
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,420
It came to me in the mail.

879
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,920
When I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.

880
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,100
Nothing I do is going to fail.

881
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,780
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.

882
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,240
It came to me in the mail.

883
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,480
Oh.

884
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,740
And when I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.

885
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,440
Oh, yes.

886
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,860
I know I'll never land in hell and I'll never be gone.

887
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,120
Don't you wish, Jimmy.

888
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,480
Oh, yeah.

889
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,820
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.

890
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,980
It came to me in the mail.

891
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,880
And you can get one too, dear friends.

892
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,760
When I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.

893
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,740
But you've got to know it.

894
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:05,740


895
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:05,740


896
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:05,740


897
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,780
What does that red button over there do?

898
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,280
Go ahead, please.

899
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,080
Kill me or kill me.

900
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,720
We don't care if you kill us or not kill us.

901
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,640
We can kill you or not kill you.

902
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,200
You can kill me.

903
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,760
You can kill me.

904
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,660
Sarge, and I just want you to know that that'll be damn fine.

905
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,300
See, we should like kill.

906
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,000
Tell us that song.

907
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,720
Kill, kill for the love of killing.

908
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,300
Kill for the love of Kali.

909
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,740
We kill to be free.

910
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,800
We kill for fun.

911
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,220
We kill to be men.

912
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,740
We make America free.

913
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,840
We kill for profit.

914
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,440
Well, that's a real nice sentimental story, but personally, I think it's a lie.

915
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,380
We kill.

916
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,920
Kill for the love of killing.

917
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,980
Kill for the love of Kali.

918
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,420
Kill for fun.

919
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,160
Kill to stay free.

920
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,600
We'll make America.

921
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:04,960
Right.

922
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,640
Are you still, you're still making them Doctors for Wotan tapes?

923
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,200
And they ain't killed you yet?

924
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,280
My God.

925
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:20,220
Have we strayed so far from the Bible that Doctors for Wotan can make tapes day in and day out without anybody killing them?

926
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,640
My God, to what depths have we sunk?

927
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,660
What depths have we sunk here in this nation?

928
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,280
No, sir.

929
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:33,260
As a matter of fact, in the Bible, it says that I come as a sword, not as a, uh, uh, a winky little flower.

930
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,700
And I'm going to kill the hell out of everybody.

931
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,680
I'm going to kill everybody I can get my hands on.

932
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,200
And I read it.

933
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,320
I'm going to pass some money changers out of the temple and, uh, tell them to the damn record album.

934
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,760
Billy Graham, Mr. Graham, you can see that Doctors for Wotan are still making tapes.

935
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,620
Oh, we're, we're Billy Graham.

936
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,020
Is Doctors for Wotan still making tapes?

937
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,200
If they are, how long?

938
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,760
Well, we can get our followers to do whatever we want anyway.

939
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,100
Well, I sent my money to Doctors for Wotan.

940
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,920
Good God, I'm so glad.

941
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,440
Should I still go to heaven?

942
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,000
You're still dead.

943
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,360
You're still dead.

944
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:03,360


945
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,320
This message has been brought to you.

946
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,280
You're still preaching at Dobbs.

947
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,500
Now we shall pray.

948
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,120
And they ain't killed yet.

949
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,940
Oh, my God.

950
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,720
Holy cow.

951
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,480
Oh, my God.

952
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:35,820
Oh, my God.

953
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,200
Oh, my God.

954
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,280
Oh, my God.

955
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,120
Oh, my God.

956
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:46,820
Oh, my God.

957
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,940
Oh, my God.

958
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,260
I just want to die

959
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,400
Oh, please kill me

960
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,720
I just want to feel the veil

961
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,040
Looking at the glass in my veins

962
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,820
Oh, I just want to die

963
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,780
For a new bitch

964
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,800
Oh, I just want to kill

965
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,880
For a new bitch

966
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,680
I don't want to hear

967
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,920
Another word about Bob

968
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,080
I just want to die

969
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,100
Oh, I just want to die

970
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,820
I just want to die

971
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,540
Die, die, die, die

972
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,600
I just want to die

973
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,520
I just want to die

974
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,960
I just want to be dead

975
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,400
like Joan Baez and Bobby Dylan.

976
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,360
I just want to die

977
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,420
like David Crosby.

978
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,720
I just want to die, yeah, yeah.

979
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,240
Just want to die and be cool one last time.

980
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,420
Just want to die, die, die.

981
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,380
And he says, no matter what you guys do,

982
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,920
no matter how many of you people

983
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,400
you get in the spaceship,

984
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,880
there ain't no way you're going to get rid of

985
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,460
the white man blues.

986
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,880
Thank you.

987
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:07,980

1005
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,080
My Sony's broken

1006
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,400
My kid pawned a video

1007
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,620
For drugs

1008
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,900
My wife passed out on Darbon

1009
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,460
And wrecked a new car

1010
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,720
I got the white man

1011
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,500
Blues again

1012
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,600
I got the white man

1013
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,360
Blues again

1014
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,780
Working on a chain gang for Bob

1015
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,260
Say we're working on that chain gang for Bob

1016
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,260
Bob don't pay but he'll let you stay

1017
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,500
You got him kneeling free

1018
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,420
Working on that chain gang for Bob

1019
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,060
Working, working, working

1020
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,320
Working on that chain gang for Bob

1021
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,260
What's the matter?

1022
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,340
Doesn't that sound exciting to you?

1023
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,820
They're dead, they're all messed up

1024
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,360
They're dead, they're all messed up

1025
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,120
They're dead, they're all messed up

1026
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,560
Genuinely glad to see him

1027
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,120
As though they had really missed being away from him during the day

1028
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,740
And are anxious to talk to him

1029
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,360
This is the time for pleasant discussion

1030
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,200
In a thoroughly relaxed mood

1031
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,760
They don't pick this time of the day

1032
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,020
To spring unpleasant surprises on Dad

1033
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,160
They're here, they're here

1034
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,720
They're going to destroy us

1035
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,380
Families throughout the country

1036
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,220
Observe the custom of saying grace at mealtime

1037
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,580
It is always treated as a gift

1038
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,580


1039
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,580


1040
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,580


1041
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,580


1042
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,580


1043
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,580


1044
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,260
They're treated with reverence and respect

1045
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,720
Converse pleasantly while Dad serves

1046
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,960
I said pleasantly for that is the keynote at dinnertime

1047
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,720
It is not only good manners but good sense

1048
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,940
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion

1049
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,760
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion

1050
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,060
Let father and mother guide the conversational trend if they desire

1051
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,580
After all, they made it.

1052
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,240
all this possible and may want to talk over their day with each other. Tell

1053
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:10,780
mother how good the food is. Maybe Cis rates a compliment too. It makes them

1054
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,120
want to continue pleasing you.

1055
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:20,380
Don't discuss unpleasant topics such as gruesome sights or sound.

1056
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,420
Charm and relaxation remember? The dinner table is no place for discontent.

1057
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,700
It makes dad and mother uncomfortable and unhappy. This does not mean you

1058
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:45,000
should be stiff or formal. With your own family you can relax. Be yourself. Just be

1059
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,540
sure it's your best self.

1060
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,360
Yeah, you sure you like to do that?

1061
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,160
I like to do things like this.

1062
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,620
Sure.

1063
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,380
I thought all girls wanted fellas to take them to fancy places, spend lots of money.

1064
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,560
Not this girl.

1065
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:06,780
You know, I sort of like things like this too. You won't laugh. I like to go on

1066
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,940
bicycle trips too. Do you?

1067
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,900
And miniature golf. Do you like that?

1068
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,280
Yeah, and weenie ropes and square dances.

1069
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,020
And baseball games and taffy poles. I think they're swell.

1070
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,340
Say, you like to do lots of things.

1071
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,880
Thanks, Georgia.

1072
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,220
Mother, would it be slick if we had an electric ironer like Sally's mother has?

1073
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,640
Of course it would. And I'm looking forward to having an electric dryer too.

1074
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,500
Sounds pretty good.

1075
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,500


1076
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,500


1077
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,500


1078
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,500


1079
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,500


1080
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,500


1081
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,780
Your dreaded eyes like smoking

1082
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,580
In his great TZ chair

1083
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,460
Your dreaded eyes like smoking

1084
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,320
Piss your money away

1085
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,760
There won't be no rainy day

1086
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,160
If I will sell you all the sun

1087
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,460
He's unlike with your old old one

1088
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,200
But he ain't no man

1089
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,940
He ain't no God

1090
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:50,380
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1091
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,980
He ain't no man

1092
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,660
He ain't no God

1093
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:59,900
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1094
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,240
At his desk in Dallas

1095
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,700
When dreaded eyes like smoking

1096
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,960
Behind his mirrored windows

1097
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:16,920
When dreaded eyes like smoking

1098
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,380
Dreaded eyes like smoking

1099
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,780
Let up your pipe

1100
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,460
Let go the smoke

1101
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,220
This is slack

1102
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,880
It ain't no joke

1103
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,520
Raise me to five

1104
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,280
Lift up your chain

1105
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,940
And you will pay

1106
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,720
To know what you think

1107
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,480
But he ain't no man

1108
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,200
He ain't no God

1109
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,660
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1110
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,380
He ain't no man

1111
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,080
He ain't no God

1112
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,580
I don't wanna walk the path

1113
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,260
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1114
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,200
And yet

1115
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,680
I still miss your summer

1116
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,480
Take my hand

1117
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,400
Make out

1118
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,440
I miss your body

1119
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,900
Cause the intimidated time

1120
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:16,900


1121
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,920
Things put them to use.

1122
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,960
Bob will be your best excuse.

1123
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,460
Bob for me and Bob for you.

1124
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,620
No matter what, a little Bob's a little buddy.

1125
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,440
He ain't no man, he ain't no God.

1126
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,760
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

1127
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,340
He ain't no man, he ain't no God.

1128
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:45,440
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

1129
00:57:46,900 --> 00:58:16,880
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

1130
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,120
He's the one who grins and smokes the pipe.

1131
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,440
For in a world of darkness, danger and despair,

1132
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:29,960
we can go on smiling because we know that Bob Dobbs is always there.

1133
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,320
And I know that Bob's on my side, I know it as sure as I'm born.

1134
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,500
He will make the proper deal with the exes' whore.

1135
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,900
Then we'll come to meet him and we'll greet him and rule forevermore.

1136
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,120
Bob is my one true savior, you can't keep all of the rest.

1137
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,100
Looking at his smiling face helps me when I'm depressed.

1138
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,800
For the pinks I sure feel sorry, for tomorrow they'll fry with all the rest.

1139
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:08,060
Bob has got no real brain to speak of, though his luck has seen him through the lack.

1140
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:13,320
For all the geniuses led us down the wrong track.

1141
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,740
Least we know a subgenius won't turn around.

1142
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:16,860
Least we know a subgenius won't turn around.

1143
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,720
And stab us in the back.

1144
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,800
The con thinks they have us suckered, but I know that that is a lie.

1145
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,180
They're due for a big surprise from demons from the sky.

1146
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,620
Makes me so glad I wised up, got it sized up.

1147
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,480
Hell, I'm a lucky guy.

1148
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,760
Bob brought me slack and that's lots more than I ever got from the con.

1149
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,060
Though I know it's only cause of all those pills he's on.

1150
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,420
Heck, I know he ain't too clever.

1151
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,700
But whatever he says I'll do or die.

1152
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,040
Gotta have slack.

1153
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:01,680
Gotta.

1154
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,220
You gotta have.

1155
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:02,900
Gotta have.

1156
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,940
Gotta have slack, friends.

1157
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:04,980
Yeah.

1158
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,560
I got a big ol' Bob.

1159
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,940
I got a big ol' Bob.

1160
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,860
He's right inside my pocket.

1161
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,580
Got my big ol' Bob.

1162
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,560
Just reach inside my pocket.

1163
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,260
I just washed him off.

1164
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
He ain't too stinky this time.

1165
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,800
You gotta try my Bob.

1166
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,120
He really wants to meet you.

1167
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,800
Boom!

1168
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:49,500
Boom!

1169
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,240
It will open up to Bob.

1170
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,540
You'll know that he's a love god.

1171
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:57,160
And once he gets inside, he's never gonna leave you.

1172
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,940
The burning seat of Bob is linking out my pocket.

1173
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,580
Just open under him.

1174
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,680
He'll crawl inside your socket.

1175
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,520
I got a big ol' Bob.

1176
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:15,540
He's waiting to baptize me.

1177
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,480
He's waiting to baptize me.

1178
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,060
And I got a big ol' Bob.

1179
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,060


1180
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:27,820
I got a big ol' Bob.

1181
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,060
He's waiting to baptize me.

1182
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,060


1183
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:30,040
