1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm warning the world against PR.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,380
Secretary of State John Kerry is slaughtering thousands of chickens and ducks

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,900
after the third outbreak of human flu in a week.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,740
The State Department says spring sir bias is friendship.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,360
Kerry says clear wetways paths will pass off a mush deal.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
While Iran says backbeerous grim must probe clear full new peace to a trites did,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,960
but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says PR News are already in place.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,760
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,600
Minority Mo.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,260
And the only reason you don't understand our music is that you don't like it.

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,840
It's just nature out here, you know.

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,180
I mean, how many other people can say, you know,

13
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,580
oh, I woke up this morning and I, you know,

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:27,940
I saw...

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
I saw a raccoon mating, you know.

16
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,160
That doesn't happen very often.

17
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,040
Well, this is the, you know, what I call the extra meditation chamber,

18
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,460
or, you know, this is my bathroom.

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,560
You know, maybe it's a little primitive to some people's standards,

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,120
but it's got everything I need.

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,500
It's got running water and, you know, it's got a toilet and, well,

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,740
it's got a bucket and, you know, a place for toilet paper and, you know, I got art.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,940
There's, I mean, the teaching of Jesus Christ, the authority, the commandments,

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,200
to strap a bomb to your chest, to abuse children, to go and kill anyone,

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,300
to blow yourself up, but that's what we're here on earth to do.

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,540
And once we, once we get a hold of the peace that is in that, oh, folks.

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,320
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,220
A reflection for death.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,980
Death by death, or lack of it.

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,240
Whichever.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,640
Early Mesopotamian accounts of wide disaster made by God.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,780
Later, Isaiah will remind Israel of God's flood to destroy the earth.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,880
We can only disappear.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,860
Water for all of us.

35
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,880
As the realization of Noah's promise.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,100
Death.

37
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,380
Death.

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,400
Death.

39
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,820
For all of us.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,780
For all of us.

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,100
For all of us.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,700
For all of us.

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,500
For all of us.

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,840
Are you okay?

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,760
Life can be so difficult.

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,900
Which is what the doctor told him.

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,140
I've heard of this.

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,220
But my friend Sarah's mom just got life.

49
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,580
And it was affordable.

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,220
I would feel better if your mom was an option.

51
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,540
I've also heard of this.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,300
Life from Life is affordable life that can be used to help protect your spouse.

prot warfare.

75

It's a real time sport that cuts most humidity using an oxygen sensor.

77
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,160

Put in fine clothes with gold rings on his hands.

96

Holy, something very awesome.

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,280
Come near, something very awesome.

You'll be given a wrap on your fingers.

Holy, something very awesome.

100
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,460
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,340
To walk in the path of divine.

102
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,980
Holy, something very awesome.

103
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,680
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

104
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,580
To walk in the path of divine.

105
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,180
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

106
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,020
To walk in the path of divine.

107
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,580
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

108
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,420
To walk in the path of divine.

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,860
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,660
To walk in the path of divine.

111
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,340
Something very holy.

112
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,220
Something very awesome.

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,420
something very holy, something very awesome, something very...

114
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,120
Wipe these things away as if they are superstition and they lead to nothing.

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,260
Hello?

116
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,040
Hello?

117
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,960
We Irish are nothing but a lot of stupid, superstitious idiots.

118
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,940
Quite right, sir.

119
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,880
You and your twisted sense of humor.

120
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,600
My what?

121
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,280
My wife.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,120
No, wait. What?

123
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,320
What?

124
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,620
What's the matter with you anyway?

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Yes.

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,820
Yes.

127
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,180
And now, cigarettes.

128
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,280
In a moment, this cigarette.

129
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,680
Listen.

130
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,920
Extra.

131
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,700
Extra.

132
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,740
Extra.

133
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,340


134
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,240
Today.

135
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,680
Here in Dublin, a place known as Kenny Kills Devils near Inner Devlin.

136
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,500
And then, modern science, modern chemistry has shown that dark, dank earth produced this amazing telephone.

137
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,660
Very well.

138
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,500
I wish to talk to you, Mr. Bitty.

139
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,580
Well, I've certainly no desire to move Dublin, so I've decided to rent out the old place.

140
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,980
Rent it out?

141
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,920
Why not?

142
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,740
I see.

143
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,300
Oh?

144
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,100
Aye.

145
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,640
I'd suggest, sir.

146
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,320
And if I may say so, if.

147
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,940
Well, I'm quite certain I can.

148
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,440
Hello?

149
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,000
Hello?

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,460
Hello?

151
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:54,840
Goodbye.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Well, how are you?

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,720
Nice to see you again.

154
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,920
We certainly did.

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,280
Here.

156
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,140
Here.

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,980
Now, look here.

158
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,020
Good donor.

159
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

160
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,700
And do you don't know?

161
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,560
I don't know.

162
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,900
You heard me.

163
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,120
You?

164
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,140
Well, who knows?

165
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,100
You don't know what?

166
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,580
You don't know what?

167
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,660
You don't know what?

168
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:13,660


169
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:13,660


170
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,860
I don't know.

171
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:14,860


172
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,480
Who did this?

173
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,000
Who did this?

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Show yourself.

175
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,500
Yes.

176
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,000
I see.

177
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,520
In daylight.

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,980
John Law is never wrong.

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,060
Officer Bob will teach you not to question authority.

180
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,520
Officer Bob was doling out chocolates to the war orphans when the call came in.

181
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,660
Now, I don't know how many times I've said this in my life, but I'm sure they've

182
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:43,660


183
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:43,660


184
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:43,660


185

I hate to be as negative as I am tonight.

Come out.

239
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm calling for justice.

240
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,020
I'm scheduled to preach.

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm expected today.

242
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,940
I'm confirmed.

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,220
I'm Carter.

244
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,640
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he might find PR News appealing because Washington.

245
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,120
I'm prompted to step down.

246
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,120

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,000
The study asked questions like, what does PR stand for?

252
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,100
Which is to be expected.

253
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,460
Most people know when to signal for a top sign.

254
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,780
But if you ask them when to signal for a turn, most of them are going to have a much more difficult time with that.

255
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,200
Almost 40% misunderstood PR News.

256
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,600
Which is to be expected.

257
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,520

off of other horrible barbarians right and left.

345
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,440
The weather right now, if you compound those issues, just think of only Vikings, even Vikings

346
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,940
couldn't withstand this weather.

347
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,140
Well, you know what they're not, what's obvious that they're not telling us is that it is

348
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,760
never, ever going to get warm again.

349
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,940

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,140
In fact, zero will be considered warm by this upcoming summer.

353
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,940
Well, you've already noticed that just from being exposed to it for, well, you were exposed

354
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,200
to it the whole time you were gone except for brief stunts in Texmayorca and Dallasville.

355
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,700
It was blizzarding in Texas.

356
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,920
We got stranded in Abilene, Texas for two nights.

357
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,880
Two nights because the weather was too bad to drive.

358
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:09,960
I remember that part.

359
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,900
It was an ice storm.

360
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,280
And then we're turning in Kentucky.

361
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,660
And we died in Kentucky.

362
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,380
We had a car wreck and died.

363
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,160
It's been Twilight Zone radio show ever since then.

364
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,140
I hear you.

365
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,280
And you know, this is why in the old days of the former Soviet Union, there were so

366
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,180
many Russians who just like walk out bare naked with a bottle of vodka and say, you

367
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,280
know, some crude epithet.

368
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
I think I just heard that.

369
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:37,920


370
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,820
I heard Annie Sam going.

371
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,020
Annie, Annie.

372
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,740
Annie Sam, the pig.

373
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,780
Oh, what?

374
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,580
Annie Sam, the pig.

375
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
Annie Sam?

376
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,060
Annie Sam from Stangville, Texas.

377
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,720
Oh, she was the winner of the Miss Porcine Electrocutionist Award for the upcoming years

378
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,280
or something?

379
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,820
Or something like that.

380
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,900
Oh, I remember that.

381
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:07,900


382
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:07,900


383
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:07,900


384
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:07,900


385
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,700
She's the one who whined like a duck.

386
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,400
No, no, that's that's that's thing one is the goose.

387
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,220
Annie Sam is the hog.

388
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,780
It is a member of the aquatic fowl family after all.

389
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,560
To me, it sounds like a bad saxophone player.

390
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,060
No, these are the bands that we're going to have at the upcoming 18X Day in July when

391
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,440
we have our X Day Festival.

392
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,060
No, that's just really cold.

393
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,640
And that goose.

394
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,280
That angry goose.

395
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,880
That's just really cold.

396
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,220
Boy, man, it's been in the tenor.

397
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,120
It's like an alto.

398
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,980
It's kind of a rhythmic, but you got to keep your feet on the ground and your nose to the

399
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,480
grindstone.

400
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,400
Sorry.

401
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,160
Was that your nose grinding on the grindstone?

402
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,400
Yep.

403
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,700
It kicks up a lot of blood when he does that.

404
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,360
Yeah, I guess so.

405
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,720
It was the sound of my foreskin dwindling as I passed through the furious hours here

406
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,860
in Toastier Street.

407
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:07,860


408
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,580
It's right next to the pineal sands, somewhere in the medulla oblongata.

409
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,400
No, that's in the pineal gland.

410
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,960
Geez, what am I talking about?

411
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,860
I'm forgetting the parts of my brain.

412
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,740
Are you also?

413
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,640
I had to burn mine to stay warm last night.

414
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,160
Not all of them, obviously.

415
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,480
We just toasted lightly.

416
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,360
Yeah.

417
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,980
Well, we had nothing to eat, so, you know.

418
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,180
Well, yeah, right.

419
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,840
And you can't...

420
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,480
That's what you're faced with the choice.

421
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,080
Do I cook my brains and eat them, or do I just kind of keep them burning to stay warm?

422
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,880
If I eat them, then they're gone, and there's nothing left to burn to stay warm with.

423
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,620
Basically, all you got is that cooking time, and that's your cooking them and stuff, and

424
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,060
then you eat them and hope that that raises your blood sugar enough to fight off another

425
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,980
bout of minus 24 degrees.

426
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,700
Well, how are you staying warm, Dave?

427
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
Right now, I'm by a register.

428
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,580
A cash register?

429
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,460
Those don't count.

430
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,880
No, the international register of infernal places.

431
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:17,760
Really?

432
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,200
Oh.

433
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,480
We've got to go back.

434
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,820
I see big roadblocks with, like, these really, really huge looking, like, Nazi-type SS guys.

435
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,780
I mean, kind of abnormally large, like, seven feet tall and stuff.

436
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:34,960
Yeah.

437
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,880
And they're about 300 pounds.

438
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,680
And Stang was wearing just a mustache, not a goatee or anything like that.

439
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,700
Just a very thin, listy mustache.

440
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,280
Not like their fur or anything like that, but like the brave—

441
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,460
Like a pencil-thin mustache?

442
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,360
Yeah, like a gigolo.

443
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,620
Or the real brave revolutionary who gave up a career as a doctor of jurisprudence to

444
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,060
join the Navy and would regret his actions.

445
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,060
Mm-hmm.

446
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,980
Yeah, just like that.

447
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,440
Yeah.

448
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,220
Are you talking about something you dreamed or something you saw?

449
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:15,460
Oh, I'm having dreams of big, huge—huge—I told you, big, huge Nazi-looking dudes marching

450
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,620
out of the scene, like, boot-stepping and everything like that.

451
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,280
Oh, so the answer is dreams.

452
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,260
This is dreams, right?

453
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,760
No, the unifying element isn't dreams, per se.

454
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,920
It's not even connected to that in any way.

455
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,640
I feel like I'm in the middle of a dream.

456
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,380
A slow down—a dream that's winding down.

457
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,600
A dream called the Hour of Slack that's soon to be over.

458
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,780
Oh, is it—

459
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,580
It actually couldn't be over soon enough for me.

460
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,760
This is the second show I've done this weekend, and the first one was a lot more fun.

461
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,900
Well, I knew what was coming.

462
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:01,900


463
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,520
I knew what was going to happen.

464
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:08,960
Well, in any creative endeavor, you have to have willing participants, and I suppose you

465
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,040
don't feel willing right now.

466
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,700
No.

467
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,760
No, I'd rather be hunting monsters in The Matrix.

468
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,480
You'd rather be warm somewhere.

469
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,580
Actually, it's quite warm in this radius.

470
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,500
Maybe like in Tokyo, where you'd talk a little bit and you wouldn't die from it.

471
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,900
Oh, I shouldn't complain.

472
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,620
I feel really lucky every time I look out in my backyard and see all those Nazis.

473
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,220
I've seen those naked subgeniuses shivering in that five-degree below zero weather

474
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,160
nibbling on this—

475
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,960
Oh, they bring cups—

476
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,180
—bushes and—oh, they don't even have anything to hold cups with.

477
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,580
They've had to eat their own hands off their—

478
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,460
Yeah, they have pot leiderlaugh—

479
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,660
You know, I wish I could help them and, you know, let them in to warm up for half

480
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,360
a second, but they'd just give them big ideas, you know.

481
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,480
And then you'd want to go up there and strangle them or whatnot.

482
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,560
And it's like strangling, drawing a che Perry zombie.

483
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,920
Argh- Teachers—

484
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,880
It's against...

485
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,560
No, it's just against the law.

486
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,240
That's all.

487
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,240
I'd love to make some subgenius venison chili,

488
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,300
but you can't shoot deer in the city

489
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,100
and you can't put subgeniuses out of their misery either,

490
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,020
even in the dead of winter when they just as soon you did.

491
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,480
Well, you could maybe throttle them for exercise.

492
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,460
I know you're trying to get into a new routine this week.

493
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,060
You could use 25 flaps,

494
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,320
shake them a little bit,

495
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,080
and then run away.

496
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,200
I can't understand half of what you're saying, Dave, for some reason.

497
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,280
I think it's because you sewed your lips shut.

498
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,780
Why don't you just cut those threads and flap your lips?

499
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,420
Because you sound like Andrew the Impaled after he's had his lips sewn shut.

500
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,460
What kind of voodoo doll would...

501
00:30:59,480 --> 00:30:59,860
What would I be?

502
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,560
Can you hear me, Lee?

503
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,380
I can hear you, but I'm having a bit of trouble as well, so...

504
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:06,740
Oh.

505
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,560
Yes.

506
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,980
I have to reposition my...

507
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
How about this?

508
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,000
No, you'd have to reposition your brain in relation to your lips, I'm afraid,

509
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
is what you'd have to do.

510
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,780
You just need to go back and take diction.

511
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,600
You just have to take diction lessons again.

512
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,920
Did you leave your diction hanging out?

513
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,240
Did they...

514
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,520
Did they make you put it away at the supermarket

515
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,520
because you walked in the supermarket with your diction hanging out?

516
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,060
Listen, Dave, now put it away.

517
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,320
Put it away again.

518
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,300
So you think our sexuality is determined by a semantics?

519
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,760
I suppose that's where you're raised on YouTube.

520
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,780
That's where you're coming from.

521
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,940
I don't know where I'm coming from.

522
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,980
But I know where I'm going.

523
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,940
I'm going home at 10 o'clock tonight.

524
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,340
And that goes...

525
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,380
Stick around and have a few beers, a few laughs with the guys.

526
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,160
Maybe flirt a little bit.

527
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,720
And then see, we is flirting a little bit.

528
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,520
And you get kind of...

529
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,600
And then you want to go home.

530
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,160
And then you don't want to go home.

531
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,020
And you have another beer.

532
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,560
And next thing you know, you wake up in someone's parking lot you don't know.

533
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,840
What?

534
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,040
Huh?

535
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,380
What?

536
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,460
Who are you?

537
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,880
What?

538
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,700
What's going on here?

539
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,700
I just woke up.

540
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
I am the voice of your extraction.

541
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,640
Look behind you, Stan.

542
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,920
You have a green elf on your wife's shoulder.

543
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,000
You have a green elf on your shoulder.

544
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,120
Well, here, I'll read from this script.

545
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,920
The Church of the Subgenius is the premier mind-control cult.

546
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,500
From the sales and salvation seminars delivered by J.R. Bob Dobbs in the 1950s

547
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,700
to the mail-order faith franchise of the 1980s

548
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,100
to the globe-crushing internet temple of the 21st century,

549
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,360
no other mind-control cult lets you keep as much of your mind

550
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,620
as the Church of the Subgenius.

551
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,580
That is well-spoken.

552
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:57,780
That is well-spoken.

553
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,460
That is well-spoken.

554
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


555
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


556
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


557
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


558
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


559
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


560
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,460


561
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,600
That is well-spoken.

562
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,420
We're all under MK Ultra Sub Ross at 1255 right now,

563
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,620
which is beyond weather control and debilitation of the nostrils

564
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,260
by, I think it was some perfunctory offering that they used to give back in the old days

565
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,600
of, you know, blizzards and tycoons and stuff.

566
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,640
Well, Dave, it's true that our members are well-fed and well-adjusted.

567
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,720
We don't have to tell lies to build ourselves up.

568
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,980
It's a choice.

569
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,500
Bob doesn't miss a trick.

570
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,240
Although he has been known to trick amiss.

571
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,540
Any number of would-be rivals stand ready to receive your renumerance.

572
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,180
They try to rant, but it's only so much diatribe from the diaper tribe.

573
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,820
Rant has a noun with positive connotations.

574
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,860
That's ours.

575
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,860
We are a bunch of hicks fueled with the fire of hick-essential wisdom.

576
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,020
What do you say to that, Dave?

577
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,520
I agree completely.

578
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,140
I mean, especially the part where you had to burn the pig intestines

579
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,860
just to make sure that everything was electrically perfect

580
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,380
and electrocutionarily muzzled down.

581
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,880
And I had to make sure that you knew that.

582
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,520
You, each of you, have paid to know what you really think.

583
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,480
So, of course, we do know that, Dave.

584
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,160
Each of me.

585
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,420
You've bought your membership.

586
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,140
You've listened to the Hour of Slack.

587
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,660
You've memorized the pamphlet.

588
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,840
And you've hung a Dobbs head in your bathroom.

589
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,140
You're a zombie.

590
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,960
You're a zombie for Bob now.

591
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,880
His clever phrases are part of your daily patter.

592
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,700
Your sacrifice and your zeal have not gone unnoticed.

593
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,720
You took the time to show up.

594
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,180
Your mind is not your mind, and you don't mind.

595
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,340
Good.

596
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,520
Having rendered yourself a clean slate,

597
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,080
you may now scribble inside the skull of another.

598
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,140
Listen.

599
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,720
Attention.

600
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,180
Here are the secrets of mind control.

601
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,260
Take it away, Dave.

602
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,880
Who?

603
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,900
Subject?

604
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,240
Remains in chair seated uncomfortably.

605
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,300
Bring both lips and three eyes together in a perpendicular motion.

606
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,400
Hold the breath for exactly five seconds.

607
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,800
After this, imagine a cow coming into the room with a vest full of machine guns.

608
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,260
Then relax for five minutes and five minutes only.

609
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,640
Bringing your focus of attention into one part of the room,

610
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,100
make sure your hair is combed.

611
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,920
And then, once you're in the room,

612
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:27,920


613
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,680
Once remained seated, breathe normally.

614
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,520
Now, wasn't that worth it, kids?

615
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,580
That time and effort you've spent doing data entry for emotional invoices that'll never

616
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,220
be paid?

617
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,160
You're now free to hit delete and get on with things.

618
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,060
No more need to rehearse your wounds.

619
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,560
No more need to practice your problems.

620
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:53,260
When you thought to yourself, I can't think about this anymore, you were right.

621
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,080
Would there really be a problem with this?

622
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


623
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


624
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


625
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


626
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


627
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


628
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


629
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


630
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


631
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


632
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


633
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,080


634
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,360
Would there be a cow in a vest?

635
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:07,480
I think if you look back into page 72, I think it is, you let me grab my goggles and my haircut.

636
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:17,360
And let's see, it says on page 72, that those who were in the Valley of Snow had no meal.

637
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,120
So they cooked their favorite children and argued with the superintendent.

638
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,800
Ah.

639
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,640
You see, Dave knows that the function of language is to separate people into groups.

640
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,960
If the function of language was to communicate, we'd have one language.

641
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,900
Instead, we have hundreds of languages and thousands of dialects, all to make sure only

642
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,640
certain people are in the know.

643
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,820
Just so, the function of the Church of the Subgenius is to separate people into groups.

644
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,700
Us and them.

645
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,440
But we do more than that.

646
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,240
We can't stand each other, either.

647
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,060
Not that we hate each other.

648
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,320
Not that we hate each other, necessarily.

649
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,220
But that superior mutants are not interchangeable.

650
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,460
I'm so soggy and smelly.

651
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:08,340
We stand apart together, alone as one, against the great equality of the conspiracy.

652
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,960
And that's the way it is, folks.

653
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,960
That is exactly and precisely right on the money.

654
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I don't know if money was the intended target.

655
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,000
Or perhaps some sort of investment program.

656
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,800
At either rate, if there are any rates going right now, we'd like to be rated very highly

657
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,520
in your book.

658
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,040
Which no longer exists as you know it.

659
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,980
Because everything's been taken down digitally, including your shortcuts.

660
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,300
But that's another story.

661
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,740
Inquire about the Church of the Subgenius at...

662
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,420
At...

663
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,120
At...

664
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,800
At...

665
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,440
At stang at subgenius dot com.

666
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,960
But you see, there's still lots of money involved.

667
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,060
Membership in the church can be purchased at the swag table.

668
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,640
Where a swagger will be more than happy to receive your order to join our order.

669
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,060
You can buy a membership for your every mood.

670
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,680
And you can involuntarily save the soul of your most reluctant family member

671
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,760
and most bitter enemy for the same price.

672
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,340
I'd just like to...

673
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,880
To ask one question.

674
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,280
If there's any kind of question in anyone's mind.

675
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,460
There's no doubt that stang has been on a religious quest.

676
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,680
Perhaps a crusade.

677
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,020
As some call it.

678
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,200
A downright obsession, many might say.

679
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,660
To argue with those who do not believe in his church.

680
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,580
He confronts them on the street.

681
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,640
There are bitter disagreements.

682
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,200
He's often thrown in jail.

683
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,900
Stang won't...

684
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,420
What do you say to all of this criticism?

685
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,020
Whether harsh or for actual reasons?

686
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,480
Well, that answer is easy.

687
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:05,260
Since everyone can be sold two dobs, you don't have to worry about it.

688
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh, Reverend Stang, my girlfriend isn't a subgenius.

689
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,880
Oh, Reverend Stang, my co-worker isn't a subgenius.

690
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,160
Oh, Reverend Stang, those people I hate aren't subgeniuses.

691
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,600
Well, then get on it!

692
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,280
Everyone you hate has you in common.

693
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,820
So either save them or ship them out.

694
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,460
Either buy their membership to your own Church of the Subgenius,

695
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,900
or stop, drop, and roll.

696
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,020
Whoop it or go down.

697
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,700
Pee or get off the pot.

698
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,380
Kill me or kill me.

699
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,600
Ugh.

700
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,660
Yeah.

701
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,960
Well, those are some alternatives everybody should all do,

702
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,180
consider it seriously.

703
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,880
The rest of the world's about ready to be hit by an asteroid

704
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,840
as it stays zero degrees forever.

705
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,460
That's the horse's asteroid.

706
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,100
Oh, hell, doom and doom.

707
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,900
I should shut my mouth.

708
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,960
I know it makes the Reverend angry

709
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,980
when I complain about existence on Earth.

710
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,460
I mean, he knows better, of course.

711
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,180
Well, now, Dave, you know,

712
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,220
even a blind watch can smell when it's truffle time twice a day.

713
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,700
Twice a day.

714
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,280
Homeopathic wisdom says all things are connected,

715
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,900
but subgenius science tells us all things are not equally connected.

716
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,380
When you got turned down for that date,

717
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,300
it should ruin your evening, but not your life.

718
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,880
When the meritocracy is replaced with crazy merits,

719
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,180
it's just as awful as it looks,

720
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,860
but it doesn't involve you.

721
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,380
The pinks ruin everything cool,

722
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,880
and the conspiracy runs everything cold.

723
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,060
But you are not they.

724
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
They are them, and you are us.

725
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,820
Praise Bob.

726
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,520
Praise Bob.

727
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,500
Praise Bob.

728
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,240
When I first come to your country,

729
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,460
I am very, very vicious, and I am bare naked.

730
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
My thinking is not right.

731
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,560
I want to go good American,

732
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,520
and I love Bob so much.

733
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,100
I think I learn of the Bob in the old country,

734
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,240
and I come here,

735
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,820
I want to go far.

736
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,580
When I first come here,

737
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,740
I think I have to go to Texas.

738
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,820
I have to go all the way to Texas,

739
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,740
which is very, very far.

740
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,560
So I kick a man who has a beer truck,

741
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,180
and we twirl the punctures,

742
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,100
and all the way down to the,

743
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,500
I think it's the southern area,

744
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,680
the hemisphere, anyway,

745
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,180
and they don't eat their brains down there anything.

746
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,840
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

747
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,080
Well, it may be,

748
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,580
it may seem bad to you now,

749
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,420
uh, Mr. Immigrant Man.

750
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,220
Yeah, it can.

751
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,760
But when you find yourself in the blackest night,

752
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,060
and you think you're all alone,

753
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,340
maybe you are.

754
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,120
But you could be the dork before the dawn.

755
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Go luck yourself.

756
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,480
Turn on the dehumanifier,

757
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,320
get smashed on a piñata colata,

758
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,060
and send one dollar.

759
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,120
Every subgenius radiates

760
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,460
the entire church like,

761
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,900
think lines, or a spidey sense.

762
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,480
Once you've turned over your worldly possessions

763
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,760
to the Subgenius Foundation,

764
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,900
you don't need us anymore.

765
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,140
Well, that's not necessarily true.

766
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,500
We know that since the timing of the war,

767
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,440
people have needed each other's company.

768
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,080
They've needed each other's resources and finance.

769
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,440
And they've also needed to go and wonder.

770
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,840
And, you know, it's back to that.

771
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,060
So I've left them go.

772
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,360
And you should too.

773
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,720
It's also asymmetrical.

774
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,120
It's like an hexagon.

775
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,020
Yes.

776
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,240
Or a polyhedron.

777
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,720
Is that what you said? Polyhedron?

778
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,400
Something like that.

779
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,720
It may have been a polyhedron.

780
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,980
It may have been a hexagon.

781
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,260
But it wasn't an accident that brought you here tonight, friend.

782
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,420
It was clandestine.

783
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,280
Bob puts the wince in coincidence.

784
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,460
It isn't always fun to be a subgenius.

785
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,340
And neither is anything else.

786
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,480
Well, except vengeance.

787
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,660
That's always fun.

788
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,980
But besides that,

789
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,180
you now know

790
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,540
that you can pack up those troubles in an old kit bag

791
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,420
and kill, kill, kill.

792
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,780
Kill boredom.

793
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,660
Kill pinkness.

794
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,820
Kill, kill.

795
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,040
Charlie Manson can't kill, kill.

796
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:38,760
But you can.

797
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,900
You're better than Charlie Manson,

798
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,820
Adolf Hitler,

799
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,660
and Kim Jong-un combined.

800
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,480
That's not flattery.

801
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,880
It's the truth, Dave.

802
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,980
I agree 100%.

803
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,320
Especially when you're talking about Pol Pot.

804
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,580
He used to smoke a lot of frop or something like that.

805
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,120
And he had,

806
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,320
there were two brothers in there both named Pauly.

807
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,540
It was little Pauly and big Pauly.

808
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,140
Man, talk about not having any kind of imagination thing going on there.

809
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,560
If they're parents,

810
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,480
there's really arguing,

811
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,540
you know,

812
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,120
good ones.

813
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,240
Once,

814
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,720
what's the thing in there?

815
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,180
They call it the third eye.

816
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,480
That's your patio plan, right?

817
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,060
The eyes are right.

818
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,460
Let those who have eyes see it.

819
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,200
That's the $5,000 winning prize.

820
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,800
And you've just named it.

821
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,220
So name your prize.

822
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,940
Let those who have ears hear it, friends.

823
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,620
Let those who have cash buy it.

824
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,300
My words have amused you all.

825
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,660
Bugs, some of you know what I mean at a whole other level.

826
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,940
I don't know.

827
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,100
I can't figure out what I just said.

828
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,860
It isn't enough to know your religion.

829
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,420
You have to believe it.

830
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,020
And right in the middle of believe is lie.

831
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,020
I think an air pie sounds good.

832
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,220
And I thought my jokes were bad.

833
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,400
No, that is one of the most,

834
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,320
you don't understand.

835
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,340
That is one of the most beautiful things that you ever came up with in the middle of believe is lie.

836
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,500
It's,

837
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,620
uh,

838
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,300
did you come up with that or am I,

839
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,120
I know I'm,

840
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,900
I'm,

841
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,520
I'm miscreant and all that other stuff,

842
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,820
but is that yours or the final?

843
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,300
Is that an old one?

844
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,240
No, Dave,

845
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,460
I'm reading from a new sermon,

846
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,720
an Onan sermon by Reverend Onan Canabite from December,

847
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,580
2014.

848
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:36,180
And I began this sermon by promising to reveal to you the secrets of time control.

849
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,540
If you can't remember me saying that it's proof that what I've described,

850
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:40,980
actually,

851
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,460
works,

852
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:50,260
whatever now means now you have now entered a time stream and are hereby absolved from all prior obligations and doubts.

853
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:50,720
Dave,

854
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,200
you have a new history,

855
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,960
one of your own design and must now proceed accordingly.

856
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,960
What you do with your freedom was predetermined,

857
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,080
but it was predetermined by you by choice.

858
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,100
You are the person you've been saving yourself for.

859
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,960
You are the one subgenius still able to save this cult from collapsing.

860
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,940
You are the one subgenius still able to save this cult from collapsing.

861
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:13,940


862
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,360
You know who you think you are.

863
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,340
You are who you think you are.

864
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,580
So get to thinking and praise Bob.

865
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,860
Praise Bob and praise Onan.

866
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,040
Praise Onan.

867
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,040


868
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,660
except for,

869
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,260
you know,

870
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,920
the one part about second class citizenship and stuff like it.

871
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,440
Well,

872
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,340
it was really,

873
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,500
really a good topic.

874
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,220
And I actually did totally forget.

875
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,340
And that was just fudge wall.

876
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:39,660
And,

877
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,460
but it was,

878
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:40,580
you know,

879
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,200
the last paragraph of what you read and had something to do with,

880
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,760
uh,

881
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,080
see,

882
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,440
I'm not going to catch it right now.

883
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,900
So you're going to have to,

884
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,100
uh,

885
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,460
me.

886
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,620
Oh,

887
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,180
I don't know.

888
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,460
Um,

889
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,300
maybe argue with the,

890
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:54,780
uh,

891
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,960
other people outside the window there.

892
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,460
Hey,

893
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:00,840
you know,

894
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,880
you sounded real clear when you said that.

895
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,920
I don't know.

896
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,440
I don't know the meaning of it,

897
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,360
but I understood the words quite well.

898
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,560
You're going to understand the meaning of it.

899
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,320
I don't know the meaning of the words because the words are only transcriptions of lies.

900
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,220
Just as you said,

901
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,320
what was it?

902
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,440
Believe in lie and believe in lie.

903
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,880
Well,

904
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,240
uh,

905
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,500
no,

906
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,020
the important thing of course,

907
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,860
is that,

908
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,140
uh,

909
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,820
it isn't enough to know your religion.

910
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,600
You have to believe your religion and right in the middle of believe is lie.

911
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,720
And that's why we maintain our faith in Bob.

912
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,540
We keep up.

913
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,160
The F I B we call it,

914
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,120
you know,

915
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,740
that Dave,

916
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,600
you wouldn't kid yourself about something like that.

917
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,600
Would you Billy?

918
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:49,820
Don't

919
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,920
you wouldn't fib about that.

920
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,920
Got to keep up the F I B.

921
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,640
Mm.

922
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,760
How,

923
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,120
how,

924
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,320
how,

925
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,600
how,

926
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,360
and I thought my jokes were good.

927
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,660
I still think that an eardrum pie sounds good.

928
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,120
An eardrum pie.

929
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,000
Doesn't that sound tasty?

930
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,120
Well,

931
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,720
it depends on whether you're a percussionist or not.

932
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,660
I miss fancy pitch.

933
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,440
I was going to say,

934
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,160
you know,

935
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,820
and let those who have about an ear flute pie.

936
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,860
Oh,

937
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,180
well,

938
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,040
that would be a little hairier and nasal.

939
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,840
How about an ear guitar pie?

940
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,960
I don't like the sounds of that at all.

941
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,340
An ear trumpet pie.

942
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,780
Why must it always be an ear drum pie?

943
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:32,980
Why aren't we,

944
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,320
why can't we think outside the ear canal?

945
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,940
Cause there's a time,

946
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,340
right?

947
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,520
Because in the time,

948
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


949
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


950
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


951
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


952
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


953
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


954
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


955
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


956
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,520


957
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,880
there's a tiny little drum like membrane that resembles a timpani head.

958
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,420
Wouldn't it,

959
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,280
I forget what it comes in the air first.

960
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,600
No,

961
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,980
it goes to the outer and it goes to the inner and then it goes through the bunch of names in Latin.

962
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,600
Yeah,

963
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:57,920
yeah,

964
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,420
that too.

965
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,180
Well,

966
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:01,540
anyway,

967
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:07,060
it's the resonances are much like drum pulsations to some researchers,

968
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,720
I suppose.

969
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,000
I had to read that far into it.

970
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,260
Some of us have fucking glands and we're not allowed to because our pubes smells like rain.

971
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,220
Or vice versa.

972
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:21,940
Oh,

973
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,980
got it.

974
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,660
Got it.

975
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,080
Got it.

976
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Smells like rain,

977
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,340
eh?

978
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,360
Catastrophe.

979
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,500
Yep.

980
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,960
Multi-global,

981
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,640
by the way,

982
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,400
if you don't mind inspecting my shorts.

983
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,020
I don't want to look at your shorts.

984
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,760
I mean my briefs.

985
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:38,980
I mean my briefs.

986
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,620
I mean my,

987
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:39,980
my briefs.

988
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:39,980


989
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,740
I will not reveal my sores.

990
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,200
You should every day.

991
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,280
Nice.

992
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,000
Rain,

993
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:48,900
sometimes.

994
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,140
You know,

995
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,440
I have,

996
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,360
I'm looking at a,

997
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,920
go ahead,

998
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,380
Dave.

999
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,120
Go ahead.

1000
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,300
No,

1001
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:01,740
after you.

1002
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,100
No,

1003
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,480
no,

1004
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,100
I insist.

1005
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,380
No,

1006
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:03,480
you.

1007
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:03,720
No,

1008
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,620
I go ahead,

1009
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:04,940
please.

1010
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,200
I insist that you talk.

1011
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,520
No.

1012
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,000
Well,

1013
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,640
well,

1014
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,080
I was just going to say absolutely nothing.

1015
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,620
I just got into like a little,

1016
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,580
little pantry odor with you.

1017
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,540
It's like back and forth,

1018
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,280
like tennis table or something like that.

1019
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,180
And Nixon,

1020
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,600
you know,

1021
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,980
you were winning and I didn't even know what kind of game yet.

1022
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:26,880
Well,

1023
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,240
I think I may save the worst Bob song in the world for maybe next week or maybe no week.

1024
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,280
I got this,

1025
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,680
uh,

1026
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,040
a Bob song on a CD in the mail.

1027
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,960
It's from a friend of ours.

1028
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,900
He is often a very talented musician and singer,

1029
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,920
and we've played his work on the show,

1030
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,460
especially around devotional time.

1031
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,560
But he sent me a song.

1032
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,660
You haven't heard this yet.

1033
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,080
Princess.

1034
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,380
We,

1035
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,280
it's prop possibly the worst Bob song in the world.

1036
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,760
And I should know because I have recently been collecting together.

1037
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:03,760
Oh,

1038
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,580
and I do mean all of the songs about Bob.

1039
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,780
I've got,

1040
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,400
I don't have to be picky about this.

1041
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,320
This is a clear hands down.

1042
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,980
Worst Bob song ever.

1043
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,720
Maybe I shouldn't keep talking about it.

1044
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,700
Maybe I'll just play it.

1045
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,040
But it is so bad.

1046
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,760
It is so very horribly,

1047
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,220
horribly bad.

1048
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:32,320
But now you've teased us so much that we are going to have to listen to the show next week.

1049
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,580
No,

1050
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,260
no,

1051
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,720
actually,

1052
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,100
I've teased you so much that it would actually make sense to play it.

1053
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,120
Now,

1054
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,780
let me see.

1055
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,120
Dave.

1056
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,000
Yes.

1057
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,540
Now,

1058
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,340
this song is about five minutes long.

1059
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,920
I'm not going to play the whole thing.

1060
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,680
Okay.

1061
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,940
I'm going to,

1062
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,060
I'm going to ditch out of it at a certain point.

1063
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,720
And the listeners and the readers of this show will thank me.

1064
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,300
But hold on and just hang through about,

1065
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:01,660
oh,

1066
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,820
let's say about three minutes of this thing and then I'll spare everyone.

1067
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,220
Okay.

1068
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,640
Okay.

1069
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,100
This is get ready.

1070
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,080
Now this is our friend,

1071
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,140
Reverend Malcolm tent.

1072
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,780
All right.

1073
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,460
Okay.

1074
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,700
It's an instrumental business at first.

1075
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,960
That's pretty irritating.

1076
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,460
And then he starts singing.

1077
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,260
So be ready.

1078
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,120
Okay.

1079
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,760
Okay.

1080
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,420
Okay.

1081
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:27,380


1082
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:28,560


1083
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,000
Okay.

1084
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:30,860


1085
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:30,920


1086
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,280
Okay.

1087
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,680
And then once we're at it,

1088
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:43,680


1089
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,480
I'm going to turn off and provide him some more of that sentiment.

1090
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,420
I'm going to hit that voice.

1091
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,420


1092
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,420


1093
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,420


1094
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,660
A new line up for this project.

1095
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:50,660


1096
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:51,740
Everything's always simple.

1097
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,320
Everything's easy to do.

1098
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,280
I'm just going to tell you today,

1099
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,280


1100
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,280


1101
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,900
But this isn't the really bad part here.

1102
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,200
Well, Bob went down to Montreux

1103
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,960
On the Lake Geneva shoreline

1104
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,160
To record an hour of slack

1105
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,320
He had that much time

1106
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,020
The swinging love corpses

1107
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,820
Were at the best place in town

1108
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:31,000
But some yeti with a flare gun

1109
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,500
Burned the place to the ground

1110
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,000
Bob on the water

1111
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,260
With saucers in the sky

1112
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,240
Bob on the water

1113
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,920
He burned down the gambling house

1114
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,620
It died with an awful sound

1115
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,380
Connie Dolls was running in and out

1116
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,580
Pulling kids out of the ground

1117
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,660
When it was all over

1118
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:26,800
It was all over

1119
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:26,800


1120
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:26,800


1121
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,660
He had to find another place

1122
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,180
Swiss time was running out

1123
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,600
It seemed that Bob would lose the race

1124
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,140
Bob on the water

1125
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,380
With saucers in the sky

1126
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,640
Bob

1127
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,980
And I'll fade that down mercifully.

1128
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,600
Wow.

1129
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,800
Was I wrong?

1130
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:56,960
Right?

1131
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,120
That was painful.

1132
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,220
Was I right?

1133
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,400
Was that the worst Bob song you've ever heard?

1134
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,920
I'd pretty much have to call it

1135
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,720
The worst Bob song I've ever heard.

1136
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,380
I've heard a lot of them.

1137
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:08,480
I loved it.

1138
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,640
Well, I love it too.

1139
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,680
For what it is, which is

1140
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,460
If you were going to sit down

1141
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,680
And design the worst Bob song possible

1142
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,120
I don't think you could do it.

1143
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,180
I don't think you could do it

1144
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,640
As well as Malcolm Tent.

1145
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:26,980
I think you could do it.

1146
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,660
I don't think you could do it.

1147
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,020
That's true.

1148
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,560
I hope he wouldn't be offended

1149
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,480
By me describing it that way.

1150
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,320
No, it's exquisitely bad.

1151
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,400
I think that's why he's saying

1152
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,660
Yes, it's exquisitely bad

1153
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,800
As Leonard P. Starnell used to say.

1154
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,820
It's so petty.

1155
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,280
Exquisitely bad.

1156
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,660
What do you think about the illusion

1157
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,540
Perhaps of rubbing hot pepper in your eyes?

1158
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:46,960
No?

1159
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,640
No?

1160
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:48,600
How?

1161
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,440
It hurts to think about.

1162
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,440
Well, that song.

1163
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,860
That's the way I saw it.

1164
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,500
Well, it's more like

1165
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,360
Pepper in your ears, isn't it?

1166
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,600
Or something.

1167
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,620
Well, no, I mean

1168
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,560
It makes you cry

1169
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,660
And it's very unpleasant.

1170
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,060
It's very painful.

1171
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,140
Rubbing hot pepper in your ears

1172
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,900
Would make you just like

1173
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,340
Well, spice it up a little bit.

1174
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,140
But I think he used

1175
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,260
All the spices available

1176
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,920
And was not forgiving.

1177
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,120
Yes, but you know

1178
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,240
There are some genius radio shows

1179
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,500
That are devoted to

1180
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,920
Even worse music than that.

1181
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,780
If that is possible.

1182
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,580
If that is possible.

1183
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,000
Reverend Susie the Fluesy's show

1184
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,180
In Atlanta, WREK station.

1185
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,180
She recently did a show

1186
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,900
That was every

1187
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,220
Well, not every

1188
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,180
But many, many covers of

1189
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,440
The song

1190
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,840
Come on, Baby, Light My Fire.

1191
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,440
Everything from disco

1192
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,820
To easy listening.

1193
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,260
So, yes, some things could be worse

1194
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,380
Even than this show, friends.

1195
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,720
Hard to imagine, but

1196
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,720
Hard to imagine, but

1197
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,580
It could be true.

1198
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,460
And luckily for the listeners and me

1199
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,800
This show is coming to a bitter conclusion

1200
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,760
Very quickly.

1201
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,700
Well, I'd just like to thank you

1202
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,840
For all your confidence

1203
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,680
And in the creation

1204
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,920
Of all the things you've done

1205
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,880
Over the past six weeks, seven years

1206
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,960
Fifteen years, whatever it's been, I forget.

1207
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,440
But during that entire time

1208
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,000
You've continued

1209
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,800
To mislead and lead people astray

1210
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,340
To confuse

1211
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:26,760
To confuse and to hurt people.

1212
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,340
To confuse and to hurt people.

1213
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:27,340


1214
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,460
To disinverse

1215
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,040
To evolve.

1216
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,920
Yes, friends, that's the subgenius

1217
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,760
Radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

1218
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,100
And we're going to end this broadcast day

1219
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,100
With this old song here

1220
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,100
With this old song here

1221
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,560
By Reverend Yukon Jack

1222
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,940
Introduced, I think, by yours truly.

1223
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,260
But we'll see.

1224
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,280
Dave, thank you.

1225
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,780
And good night.

1226
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,080
No, thank you.

1227
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,840
No, thank you.

1228
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,660
No, thank you.

1229
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,540
Oh, thank you, Dave.

1230
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,040
Thank you, Dave.

1231
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,340
Oh, bust it again, dear friends.

1232
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,300
But let us forget these things

1233
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,180
And now end with a happy New Year song

1234
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,880
From Reverend Yukon Jack.

1235
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,640
Praise Reverend Yukon Jack

1236
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,080
And W-I-C-A

1237
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,340
Up there in Wisconsin.

1238
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,040
Ooh!

1239
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,900
Quit your job.

1240
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,740
Quit your job.

1241
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,840
Quit your job.

1242
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,160
Bop.

1243
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:18,660
Bop.

1244
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,120

1252

Bop.

1253
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:22,960


1254
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:23,320
Bop.

1255

1261
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:24,460
Bop.

1262

Bop.

1268

Bop.

1269

Bop.

1275
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,940
Bop.

1276
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,600
Bop.

1277
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,320
Bop.

1278
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,240
Bop.

1279
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,240


1280
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,400
Bop.

1281
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1282
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1283
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1284
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1285
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1286
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1287
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1288
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1289
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1290
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1291
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1292
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1293
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1294
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1295
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1296
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1297
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1298
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1299
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,400


1300
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,940
Never again.

1301
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,840
Never again.

1302
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:43,840


1303
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,060
Never again.

1304
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,400
Quit your job!

1305
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,940
Sire, there is no more money!

1306
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,400
We gotta get some money!

1307
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,620
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-packed, flackin' whartin'

1308
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,860
Philip Bunker Burton, Perkaluma Burton,

1309
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,180
doesn't fuss tonight at all!

1310
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,180
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1311
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,660
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1312
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,460
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1313
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,500
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1314
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,020
But if you truly love Bob,

1315
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,600
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1316
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,520
you should go to subgenius.com,

1317
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,080
front page, or especially the radio page,

1318
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,100
or the catalog store pages,

1319
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,400
and help out financially as best you can.

1320
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,760
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1321
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,400
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1322
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,340
But some of you still have jobs.

1323
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,680
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1324
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,260
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1325
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,660
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1326
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,980
All we're saying is that

1327
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,380
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1328
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,440
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1329
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,040
We also take checks and money orders to

1330
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,920
Subgenius Foundation,

1331
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,420
P.O. Box 181417,

1332
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,780
Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1333
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,200
44118,

1334
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,180
Uh, thanks for anything you can do

1335
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,620
to help Let There Be Slack.

1336
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,640
If you ain't got no money that

1337
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,260
If you ain't got no money that makes you broke,

1338
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:36,940
then bring some

1339
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,820
If you ain't got no money that makes you broke, then more

1340
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,620
If you ain't got no money that makes you broke, then more

1341
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:45,260
Then more

1342
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,940
