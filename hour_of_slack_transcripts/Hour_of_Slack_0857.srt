1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
I've done far worse than kill you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I've hurt you.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,260
And I wish to go on hurting you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,520
What?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,040
Oh, uh...

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,560
Say, kids, what time?

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,620
What time is it?

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,940
I wonder exactly in a temporary way.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,620
Can we really understand time?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,100
Of course you can, kids.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,400
And here's the easiest way you can.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,340
Just pull those gentle, tender flaps apart

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,440
and sit down quietly between your own knees

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,320
and just begin.

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,800
That's right.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,940
Be brave and time to the music.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,460
Uh...

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:37,460


19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,440
Go!

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,260
Well, we've asked everybody here

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,000
if they've got a special request

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,640
for each and every one of you here.

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,040
I have a burden.

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,500
God has given Pastor a message for you.

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,240
God has given.

26
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,080
Bad, bad hit.

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,880
For you, the devil has gone far enough.

28
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,100
The devil has gone far enough.

29
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,160
Prayer warrior!

30
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,040
Prayer warrior!

31
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,160
Meet me on my knees.

32
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,340
On your knees, Friday night.

33
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,820
Prayer warrior!

34
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,700
At 7.30.

35
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,560
And listen now, my friends,

36
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,900
the prayer tower is open.

37
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,960
The prayer tower is open right now.

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,740
Prayer warrior!

39
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,220
You that need prayer.

40
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,540
We're going to pray.

41
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,180
My God.

42
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,900
The prayer team is here.

43
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,940
We're going to hang down.

44
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,140
Right now.

45
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,760
Remove those brain parts.

46
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll stick this on.

47
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,440
What the hell is that?

48
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,140
Light your problem.

49
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,680
Light up.

50
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,220
Test it back.

51
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,860
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

52
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,700
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.

53
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,600
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,880
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness

55
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,940
before my fellow men.

56
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,200
Not in this life.

57
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,580
I've too much laughing to do.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,460
Hurrah!

59
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,520
This goes to show.

60
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
What is with meaning?

61
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,360
You know what I mean?

62
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,780
Meaning is so relative.

63
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,940
What is reality?

64
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,280
What?

65
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,340
Reality.

66
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,740
Yeah.

67
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:57,960
Yeah.

68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,420
What is reality?

69
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,160
Know what you what?

70
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,600
Just so selfish.

71
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,420
I don't get it.

72
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,920
What is reality?

73
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,780
See, we can make people trip right on the air

74
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,960
on various toxic substances,

75
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,600
bacterial agents,

76
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,240
and some of them only charge 15%.

77
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,500
Reality is what doesn't go away when dot, dot, dot.

78
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,740
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief

79
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,380
minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

80
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,360
This so-called civilization?

81
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,800
On the day when we finally realize that things are all backwards and we have slack without

82
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,080
work in the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs, then perhaps we'll find the true civilization

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,780
which needs not Xerox machines nor fancy coats and ties.

84
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,520
It don't have to have them.

85
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,300
It can have them.

86
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,680
You can be civilized and not live in a cave, but you're probably going to be more civilized

87
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,180
being one of these characters that sits in a cave scratching his butt than you are running

88
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,740
around on this treadmill of false slack.

89
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,660
Oh yes, and look at the humans lined up for the slaughterhouse.

90
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Oh yes, the harvest.

91
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,080
Praise Bob.

92
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,820
Let there be slack.

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm just an American boy.

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm just an American boy.

95
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,720
Raised on MTV.

96
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:38,420
And I seen all the kids in the soda pop pants, but none of them look like me.

97
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,560
So I started looking around for a light out of the dim.

98
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,760
And the first thing I heard that made sense was the world of Mahogany.

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:55,760


100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:55,760


101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
I was told to get a sword and a hammer and peace be upon them.

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,020
I shot and knew.

103
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,560
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin' I lie.

104
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,840
There's no god but God if my daddy could see my mount.

105
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,100
Chains around my feet.

106
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:25,740
He don't understand that sometimes a man's got to fight for what he want.

107
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


109
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


110
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


111
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


112
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


113
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


114
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,740


115
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,380
believes

116
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,500
and I believe

117
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
God is great

118
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,460
all praise

119
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,320
due to him

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
and if I should die

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
I rise up to the sky

122
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,920
just like Jesus

123
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,140
peace be upon him

124
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,020
I shine

125
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,620

guitar solo

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,180
we came to fight the jihad

132
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,680
and our hearts were pure

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,360
and we came to fight the jihad

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,860
and strong

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,620
and death built the air

136
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,460
we all offer the present

137
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,660

not revealed

142
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,720
now they're dragging me back

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,620

144
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,360

Ladies and gentlemen, give him your money.

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,580
B.O.B.

195
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,460
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

196
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,640
B.O.B.

197
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,120
Oh, man. Oh, oh, oh, man.

198
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,540
B.O.B.

199
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
Big Bang Bop.

200
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,720
B.O.B.

201
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,760
One, one dollar.

202
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,220
One dollar. One, one dollar.

203
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,620
B.O.B.

204
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,240
Bang, bang.

205
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,280
Big Bang Bop.

206
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,060
B dopropz.

207
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,080
B pap bop bop bop.

208
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,840

209
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,140
B B D bop.

210
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,560
Oh make some noise.

211
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,560


212
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,560


213
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:45,920
Eat, eat.

214
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:35,380
B.O.B.

215
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,700
Remix number two by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

216
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,040
And before that, my sermon,

217
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,500
backed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

218
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,640
at the Blind Lemon Club DeVival in Cleveland last year.

219
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,940
And speaking of last year, friends,

220
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,380
the world ends tomorrow!

221
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,440
This is our track.

222
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,100
Now it's on.

223
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,600
Running along the top of the muscles and all of that was torn loose.

224
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,580
It's so wonderful.

225
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,180
It's considered benevolent in that part of the world.

226
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,260
The ice is right there.

227
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,360
Here. There it is.

228
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,160
All right.

229
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,220
Look at that. Just like that.

230
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,700
Just that. Because it's plastic.

231
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,440
We've got the red dot in here because it's so wonderful.

232
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,420
Um, but, and, uh, and we were going around

233
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,680
and didn't even think we liked each other too much.

234
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,440
Well, you know what?

235
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,020
I don't know.

236
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,300
I don't have a clue.

237
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,020
$140.

238
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,420
The end times are near.

239
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,320
Hello.

240
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
Hello, monsters are born.

241
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,940
Did the end times come yet?

242
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,380
Are we incarcerated?

243
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,480
Are we dead?

244
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,320
Come here.

245
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,720
Or are we just thinking of a new way of living?

246
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,120
Look at this beautiful Bel Air mansion

247
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,620
made from stucco and popo

248
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,280
and filled with your favorite 3.5 kids.

249
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,960
Some of them have their asses dangling from the cactus

250
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,400
in their backyard, but you're a cowboy dad

251
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,520
and you're ready for this new century.

252
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,740
Let's go bomb.

253
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,800
Let's go bomb.

254
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,040
Let's go bomb with the president.

255
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,440
Yeah!

256
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah!

257
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,800
Yeah!

258
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,460
Yeah!

259
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:40,580
Yeah!

260
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,580


261
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,580


262
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,120
Now that fella knows how to get bombs.

263
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,680
Let's go do some drugs.

264
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,680
Legal drugs, that is.

265
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,300
Yeah!

266
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,320
Hey, let's put on a thing of these furry monkey pants

267
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,120
and dance for the guy with a grinded his organ over there

268
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,600
against a telephone pole.

269
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,340
It's disgusting.

270
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
Of course it's disgusting.

271
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,960
It's the world we're living in today.

272
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Open your eyes, dearly.

273
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,920
Open them wider.

274
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,020
No, a little wider.

275
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,420
Open them up wider.

276
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,140
OK, you got to get the drops in there.

277
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,640
Can you help me put the sticks up?

278
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,700
You can't look away now.

279
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,960
That's right.

280
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,860
Oh, that's right.

281
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,440
I threw up.

282
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,400
Yep, when I looked at my TV and saw what was going on,

283
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,100
I threw up.

284
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,420
I threw up.

285
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,540
I threw up.

286
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,020


287
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,120
I threw up.

288
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,140
I threw up.

289
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,200
I threw up.

290
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,800
Bye now.

291
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,360
What is the meaning of this?

292
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,340
You'll be reborn now, you hear?

293
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,120
What is the meaning of this?

294
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,080
The meaning of death and the cycle of rebirth.

295
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,540
What is the meaning of the tender, tiny thread that extends

296
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,960
from the flap below the reptile's eye deep into the womb

297
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
of nature itself?

298
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,300
There is a seeker born every minute.

299
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,520
Well, as far as our scientists have been able to determine,

300
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,200
the purpose of life is, in fact, simply to squirt.

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,100
Or in the case of some creature, it's to squirt.

302
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,400
Or in the case of some creature, it's to ooze.

303
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,860
Ah, squirting and oozing.

304
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,020
Ultimately, an ooze squirt.

305
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,740
Yes, that's it.

306
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,820
There's no high, lofty meaning of life.

307
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,740
It is simply to...

308
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,080
Squirt and ooze.

309
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,940
Yes, and not for the procreation aspects, just for the pleasure.

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,600
The mere ejaculation and the vibration.

311
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,160
That's it.

312
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,900
And banging the nervous system ever so gently.

313
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes, if you're looking for a meaning, there it is.

314
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,240
It doesn't matter whether it's by yourself or with somebody else.

315
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,940
It's just a bit...

316
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,260
That's it.

317
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,980
You can just take a walk out into your neighborhood any day

318
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,680
and get on the bus and get that same sensation

319
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,060
as you ride over them old potholes.

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,760
You know, life ain't much more than a oozing and a squirting

321
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,280
and a kind of a dangerous feeling coming up the back of your neck.

322
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,660
I'm gonna rub my little rat belly.

323
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,220
Things are growing up there now.

324
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,040
They're growing now.

325
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,960
And like bad thoughts, you know,

326
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,920
just hanging in the top of your head.

327
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,120
They can't get out.

328
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,880
They got to find a way out some day.

329
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Oh, I can't wait to have Bob rub my little round belly

330
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,760
over at that rabbit supper tonight.

331
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, he's gonna rub you like a Buddhist belly.

332
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,580
He's gonna create more slack out of the top of your head than you ever saw.

333
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,320
Hey, old Bob, he's Bodhi Shatva.

334
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:28,960
Yeah.

335
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,340
He's a fully realized enlightened being.

336
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,940
He's gonna be at that squirrel supper tonight.

337
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,940
You gonna be there, Benny?

338
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey, look, he's eating barbecued chicken.

339
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,500
And I never know Bodhi Shatva.

340
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,780
I enjoyed meat that way.

341
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,340
I mean, you know, that way.

342
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,900
Oh, hell, you know, him and Bob go way back.

343
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
I threw up.

344
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,700
Yeah, it's hard to pull it out of your moon pants.

345
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,640
Teej, you just let it go out in front.

346
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,440
Is that you going through there, Musgrave?

347
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,780
Now, why in the world would I be going through there, D-D-Dog?

348
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah.

349
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:04,840
Yeah.

350
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,240
Yeah.

351
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,700
Yeah.

352
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:05,880
Yeah.

353
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,120
Yeah.

354
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,580
Yeah.

355
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,220
Yeah.

356
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,780
Yeah.

357
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,640
Yeah.

358
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,020
Yeah.

359
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,620
Yeah.

360
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah.

361
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,320
Yeah.

362
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,180
Yeah.

363
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,900
Yeah.

364
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,420


365
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,040
Yeah.

366
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,560
Yeah.

367
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,240


368
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,500


369
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:15,700


370
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:15,960
Yeah.

371
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,360
Yeah.

372
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:16,520


373
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:16,620
Yeah.

374
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:16,740
Yeah.

375
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:16,760
Yeah.

376
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah.

377
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,300
Yeah.

378
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,340
Yeah.

379
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,040
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past.

380
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,820
I made time wait up for me to bleed my lizard.

381
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,600
My infernal breath wilts the tree of life.

382
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,920
I left my sword on the rock of ages.

383
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,460
Who will tear flesh with me?

384
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,840
Who will spill their juice?

385
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,360
Who will gouge with me?

386
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,180
Whose candle will I fart out?

387
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,860
Good.

388
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,820
I'm ready.

389
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,400
So step aside, all you but loot.

390
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Neurotic, insecure, bespectacled slaps all went meet.

391
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal.

392
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,240
I am not insane.

393
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,340
I'm a screamer and a laugher.

394
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,060
I make a spectacle of myself.

395
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,260
I am a sight.

396
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,760
My physical type cannot be classified by science.

397
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,800
My familiar is a pterodactyl.

398
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,340
I feed it to feagles.

399
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,140
Dziękuję milia.

400
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,140
You are a spy and a ratsam.

401
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,140


402
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,140


403
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,140


404
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,140


405
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,840
Someone asks Mutta for EQ.

406
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
You win if you avoid because you've destroyed me!

407
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,200
Why are you so hard on me?

408
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,320
You don't run, do you?

409
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,740
Fuck you!

410
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,340
The Brandflex from thebrandflex.com.

411
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,820
Before that, some brag of the subgenius Bob Foolery by me and Philo.

412
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:02,560
And now, well, soon actually, a classic live recording of a Jurassic song by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

413
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,860
But first, heart ignition.

414
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,180
What's going on?

415
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,580
Swag.

416
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,680
Slap.

417
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,840
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

418
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,000
Name the killer.

419
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:28,940
Bulb.

420
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,780
Name the killer.

421
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,800
Bulb.

422
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,660
Slap.

423
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,780
What's that noise?

424
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,180
Slap.

425
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
Swag.

426
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
Swag.

427
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,280
9.

428
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,740
Swag.

429
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Swag.

430
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,160
Swag.

431
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:08,820
Swag.

432
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,260
Swag.

433
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,300


434
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:10,620


435
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,120


436
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


437
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


438
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


439
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


440
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


441
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


442
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,660
Swag.

443
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,700
guitar solo

444
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,680
guitar solo

445
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:27,680
guitar solo

446
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,800
guitar solo

447
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,680
guitar solo

448
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,720
guitar solo

449
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,380
guitar solo

450
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,720
guitar solo

451
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,980
guitar solo

452
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,680
guitar solo

453
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,320
guitar solo

454
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,880
guitar solo

455
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,320
nature

456
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,280
I hate it

457
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,120
the swingin' love corpse is live

458
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
in St. Louis

459
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,900
1991 and now

460
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,860
from the Akron Revival

461
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,580
this summer, Dr. Katahdin

462
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Legu

463
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,380
who starts his sermon by reading

464
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,880
a suicide

465
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,940
note

466
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,500
a suicide note, is it mine?

467
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:37,740
I found this suicide note. It was from a young teenage girl. At least from the content I'm assuming it was a teenage girl.

468
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:52,420
It says here, I'm tired of the pain in my heart. You are all so unfair to me. You don't love me and you don't understand me.

469
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:59,340
Everyone hates me because I'm fat and ugly. The only thing I ever wanted was to be with Patrick.

470
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:09,080
But I found out he was at the mall with that slut Michelle. And I hope they all feel bad when I'm gone.

471
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:18,640
But, tough. I tried to talk to you about it, Mom. But you was more interested in your soap operas than my real problems.

472
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,400
So I'm not going to bother with that.

473
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,900
I'm not going to bother any of you anymore. And I hope Patrick is real happy at the mall with his slut.

474
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,320
You're going soft aren't you?

475
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,900
I hope you're all happy now. Goodbye.

476
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,060
What a stupid little bitch.

477
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,280
Fucking shit yeah.

478
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:49,960
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes me think, well...

479
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,400
What is a problem?

480
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
What is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

481
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,220
And it reminded me. It reminded me of when I was a child.

482
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,400
When I was a child I grew up in a town called Mansfield, New Jersey.

483
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:15,540
And out on Route 206 which cuts right through Mansfield, New Jersey, there's a farmer's market.

484
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,780
It's the biggest shop in town. Everybody goes there. It's the only reason anybody comes to Mansfield.

485
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,980
Is to shop at this farmer's market.

486
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,300
But across the street from this farmer's market, there was a junkyard.

487
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:38,980
Not just any junkyard. It was an old military junkyard full of crashed World War II planes and trucks and tanks and such.

488
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,240
And it was owned by a man named John Mihaljec.

489
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,660
John Mihaljec had a lot to say.

490
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,540
He had so much to say.

491
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,640
Did I own Route 206?

492
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,160
Down the entire length of his property.

493
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,840
He had these huge billboards with pictures of political figures on them.

494
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,540
They had a picture at the time, it was the 1970s.

495
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,220
There was a picture of President Richard Nixon with the bleeding body of a dead rat.

496
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,660
And there were these long, long ramps that he would put up on these billboards on his property.

497
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,700
And the town hated him.

498
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:28,460
When he drove by, the ramps on the sides were so long and involved that the cars would have to slow down to five miles an hour just to read them.

499
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
Oh yeah, they hated him bad.

500
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,200
So what did John Mihaljec do?

501
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,020
He ran for Senator.

502
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,080
That pissed off all the people who hated him even more.

503
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,840
All the townspeople hated him.

504
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,440
One day they said, we're going to finally take care of this John Mihaljec.

505
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,740
And that was the problem.

506
00:35:51,600 --> 00:36:00,440
So one night, some of the townspeople got together, in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies.

507
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,820
They all got their torches together and they went down to his property and they burned his house to the ground.

508
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,200
Oh, they burned his house to the ground, but that's not all they did because his wife was in the house.

509
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
And they killed his wife.

510
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,600
They killed his wife and they burned down his house.

511
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:30,460
And they said, finally we're going to see the end of John Mihaljec because no man is going to be able to stand up after something like this.

512
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,180
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

513
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:47,440
John Mihaljec, in the smoking ashes of the ruins of his home, the smoking ashes of his now dead beloved wife,

514
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:58,480
built a giant teepee on that spot and let everybody know they were not going to run him off his land.

515
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,660
The townspeople hated him even more.

516
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,880
So one night, the townspeople, in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

517
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,980
once again got together and they went out to John Mihaljec's land.

518
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,520
And they burned down his teepee.

519
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,700
This, they said, would run off John Mihaljec.

520
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,920
How much more could one man stand?

521
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,280
He would leave, he would kill himself, he would do something, but he would be out of their hair forever.

522
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,660
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

523
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:56,480
And so, on the smoking ruins of his teepee, built on the smoking ruins of his home and his dead beloved wife,

524
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,280
John Mihaljec built another teepee.

525
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,080
An identical teepee to the first, but with one small difference.

526
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,980
It was made of steel!

527
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,600
The villagers didn't know what to do about that.

528
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,740
They hated John Mihaljec.

529
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,160
They wanted to run John Mihaljec off his land.

530
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,740
But those stupid motherfuckers never could figure out how to burn down a steel teepee.

531
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,320
And John Mihaljec lived there until he died an old, old man.

532
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,800
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

533
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,620
Yes!

534
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,660
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

535
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,400
Yes!

536
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,260
Oh, brothers and sisters, John Mihaljec found the perfect solution to his problems.

537
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,700
Maybe you have problems too.

538
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,640
Maybe your problems could be solved by giving up or committing suicide.

539
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,160
Probably not.

540
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,160
Well, come to think of it, we probably solved all your problems.

541
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,640
But we're not the kind of a cult that's going to have a choice.

542
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,380
We're not the kind of a cult that's going to advocate suicide.

543
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,740
We are the first anti-suicide suicide cult.

544
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,860
One day we will all get together and after the point of time we will all drink Kool-Aid.

545
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,140
And nothing will happen. We'll just drink some Kool-Aid.

546
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
You don't lie until we say so.

547
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,680
Yes.

548
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm sure you have problems too, but I don't think that many of your problems are going to be solved by a big tin teepee.

549
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,960
However, there is always a solution to your problems.

550
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,940
And only the perfect solution to your problems.

551
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,660
And brothers and sisters, Bob.

552
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,420
Bob will give you a blueprint.

553
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,920
A blueprint for your perfect teepee of vengeance.

554
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:07,180
That will help you get over your problems without having to take a hundred Tylenol.

555
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,540
Yeah. Tom Waits. Are you Tom Waits fans here?

556
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,800
Yeah.

557
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,000
I remember there was a song by Tom Waits where he said something about a woman.

558
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,600
She was a crumbling beauty with a tattooed tear on her cheek.

559
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,340
For each year her man was away.

560
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,240
And then Tom Waits said, hell, there's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix.

561
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,180
Well brothers and sisters, it's even better for all of you.

562
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,520
Because there's nothing wrong with her.

563
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,460
There's nothing wrong with you that thirty dollars won't fix.

564
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,320
Yes brothers and sisters, because that thirty dollars, when put in the hands of Bob, will help deliver unto you the blueprint for your own tin teepee.

565
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,960
That tin teepee will fill that tin teepee shaped hole in your life.

566
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,400
Oh yes brothers and sisters, you may not have very small problems.

567
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,760
You might have little tiny problems.

568
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,220
Oh yes, but Reverend Stang, he's here to help you with those problems.

569
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,600
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a little bobkin.

570
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,580
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a bumper sticker or a t-shirt.

571
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:28,020
And brothers and sisters, through Bob's love, Reverend Stang is here tonight to fill that t-shirt shaped hole in your lives, brothers and sisters.

572
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,560
Oh yes brothers and sisters.

573
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,960
Can I get a praise Bob?

574
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,720
We're filling CD shaped holes tonight.

575
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,880
Oh yes brothers and sisters.

576
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,580
And I saw a lot of you out there tonight who have CD shaped holes.

577
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:41,580


578
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,040
CD shaped holes in your lives that are just begging to be filled.

579
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,440
And Reverend Stang is here tonight to help Bob fill your holes.

580
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,660
Can I get a praise Bob?

581
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,240
Praise Bob!

582
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:05,340
Many of my victims have joined my unholy legion of the undead, becoming creatures without souls, living only for hideous torment.

583
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,560
And I think if we continue that way, to, you know, do what they said to do with poor Shia LaBeouf,

584
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,420
to eliminate unsigned beings, what will happen next?

585
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,560
Well, did you write to your Congressman about the pigs?

586
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,700
Of course I did. I did.

587
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,460
I said we would be liberated and he said, he sent back a hand mimeographed, a Xerox letter.

588
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:29,320
He sent back a hand signed letter, I mean, that said thank you very much Citizen Dave for your interest in the pork.

589
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,760
We're preparing a place for you in the re-education camps.

590
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,880
We have your room number and your keys waiting for you in your special hot tub.

591
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,000
And then I wrote a letter back saying,

592
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,800
the pork problem is probably the most,

593
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,020
problem we have to deal with in these days

594
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,440
of post 9-11 surgery.

595
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,720
Well, humanity is in danger of getting

596
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,760
thrown out of the cosmic

597
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,520
tent

598
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,860
party for crapping

599
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,440
in the universal hot tub.

600
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,860
Not sending in their 30 bucks.

601
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,840
Yeah. The United States

602
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,680
Navy is going to build these things

603
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,220
that create sounds

604
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,640
underwater around 80% of the surface

605
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
of the oceans, which will kill all the whales and

606
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,800
seals and porpoises, and nobody's going to stop

607
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,980
them because they're the U.S. Navy.

608
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,720
What do you mean, Ghana? Ghana.

609
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,600
It's a word we use. I thought they already

610
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,560
did that. They get the most amazing recordings

611
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,160
out of that. Yeah, the whales

612
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,560
squealing in agony as their eardrums

613
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,600
explode. Now that is a song.

614
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,340
By the time they're gone, we'll have

615
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,880
figured out their language.

616
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,400
Well, yeah, by the time

617
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,040
they utter their last pained cry

618
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,980
of, yeah.

619
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,740
Pained cry?

620
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,460
Oh, I'm sure they have vials

621
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,220
of whale sperm hidden away

622
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:39,740
somewhere.

623
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,660
Oh, yes. Long DNA, then short DNA.

624
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,300
Any kind of whale you want.

625
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,840
How about a Moby-Doby? We've got a blue one.

626
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,800
We've got the oversized white ones.

627
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,160
Those whale incubators, though, are really

628
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,280
big. Yeah. And whale, but

629
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,980
there's a booming business

630
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,800
in whale placenta.

631
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,080
Oh, and there's nothing better

632
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,660
with a little bit of almond extract.

633
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,760
Whale placenta?

634
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,260
Shaved almonds? You like to shave

635
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,900
your nuts for the whales? You can get quite a bit from each

636
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,820
birth. Oh, yeah?

637
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,860
From those mighty mammals

638
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,840
of the deep, yeah? So they're going to give

639
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,940
or they're making like little quants that's full

640
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,780
of whales. That's what rich people

641
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,680
in Japan are doing, man. All the

642
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,080
really, the rich Japanese people

643
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,800
look at this. They bathe in whale.

644
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,400
Beautiful people. Freshly

645
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:25,760
caught whale placenta.

646
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,940
It is so lovely for my skin. I just wave a little bit

647
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,040
of whale oil on my arms and look

648
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,140
as smooth as a baby's forehead.

649
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,020
And also look what it's done

650
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,000
for my hair. So it gets you away

651
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,200
from the poo-poo stuff.

652
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,860
And back into the menstrual

653
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,700
placental.

654
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,660
My favorite place.

655
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,540
The plasma pond of the beginning.

656
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,920
The primal mommy. The original

657
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,760
ooze from which it all sprang.

658
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,060
Friends, you and I, each and every

659
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,420
one of us with the chromosomes

660
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,840
dancing on the backs of our spines.

661
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,140
Like little egg yolks. Or like little egg yolks.

662
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,080
And can be no more than

663
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,760
individual fried eggs.

664
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,900
So live it up as long as you can.

665
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,980
Send your $30 before you're

666
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,420
completely cooked. Do it!

667
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,200
Now! Now! Do it before

668
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,420
your sex differentiates. While you're

669
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,540
still a yolk. Before the zygote

670
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,340
splinters. Some of us

671
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,940
may go in a different direction.

672
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,460
There are X chromosomes.

673
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,440
There are Y chromosomes.

674
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,200
There are now Z chromosomes.

675
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,460
Yes, that's

676
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,700
right. Have your genes outgrown

677
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,220
you? What about the

678
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,540
anti-chromosomes?

679
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,200
What about them?

680
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,020
What about them?

681
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,400
What about them?

682
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,680
What about them?

683
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,540
Shoop.

684
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:43,700
Shoop.

685
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
The many moods of an alien.

686
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,920
I descended from monochromes.

687
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,860
I ascended from polychromes.

688
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,980
I descended from

689
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:53,860
morochromes.

690
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,760
I am

691
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,440
all chromatic activity.

692
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,940
Repeat this to yourself.

693
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:01,880
Then sit down

694
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,740
and close your eyes,

695
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,480
ears, nose, and throat.

696
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,840
For this is your

697
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,760
good place.

698
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,340
What?

699
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,580
Insert transition here.

700
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,340
Yeah, right.

701
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,660
Well, I timed it.

702
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,660
I had the guy.

703
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,940
Yeah, I could tell that.

704
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,240
It was a 15-second segue.

705
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,060
Amazing timing.

706
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,840
I laughed so hard.

707
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,620
Sometimes I slow down when I read.

708
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,960
It really caught me was the timing.

709
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,040
It was a 15-second segue.

710
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,640
Stang was supposed to say something kind of laconically funny.

711
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,840
And then you were supposed to say something really silly.

712
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,300
I'm going to sit over here and eat my cupcake.

713
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:36,880
I'll do all that later.

714
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:37,920
Okay.

715
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,880
So you'll make it sound like you said something laconically silly.

716
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,500
Oh, right.

717
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,540
And then Chaz said something really silly.

718
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,680
And then, oh, no, that's not going to be it.

719
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,280
Oh, okay.

720
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:47,980
Yeah, whatever.

721
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,020
It doesn't matter.

722
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,600
No.

723
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,360
These people are idiots anyway.

724
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,080
I mean, you put a certain show form.

725
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,180
You sew it together like a piece of stew.

726
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,440
You know, I mean, you just flap a shoe in there.

727
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,140
You put some of your own, I don't want to say the other words, some of your own stuff in there.

728
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,460
You just, you know, you don't really care what goes in there because you have no respect.

729
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,840
For your subgenia who listen each week.

730
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,460
What in the world are you talking about?

731
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,680
Oh, I'm just saying the way Stang so haphazardly throws his hours of slack together.

732
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,020
First, he takes all the drugs you can take.

733
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,840
Heroin, monochrome, femur, that weird poison from South America.

734
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,540
Well, no, that's how you organize each show.

735
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,240
You do heroin.

736
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,100
As a theme.

737
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,840
And then you pick certain material for the heroin-based show.

738
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,420
And then you do a bunch of crack.

739
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,220
And you pick all the material that goes with that kind of a...

740
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,700
So you're just pretty much living the life, aren't you, man?

741
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,900
You're just like kind of out there.

742
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,200
You're just living the life.

743
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:43,420
You know, and so forth.

744
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:43,920
Down through...

745
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,880
You don't really care about your...

746
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,300
Nitrous oxide.

747
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,040
Prozones.

748
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,980
Long jeans and shirt.

749
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,780
That, uh...

750
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:56,920
See, I can't even remember what drugs this show was supposed to be.

751
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,700
Stang, you're losing your balance.

752
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,700
Tell me about it.

753
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,760
This is that cut.

754
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,880
That's 15 different Claudine Leger songs all played on top of each other.

755
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,120
Is there a pill to counteract all those pills?

756
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,780
This is a pill.

757
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,880
This is the red pill.

758
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,660
Oh, God.

759
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,600
I hate the red pill.

760
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,080
Oh...

761
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,100
Oh...

762
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,100


763
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,060
Oh...

764
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,360
Oh...

765
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:31,580
Oh...

766
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:31,580


767
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:31,960
Oh...

768
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,100
Oh...

769
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,860
Oh...

770
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:37,900
Oh...

771
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,480
Stood on the edge of your feather

772
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,940
Expecting to fly

773
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,700
While I lie

774
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,920
We're all wired into a survival trip now.

775
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,580
No more of the speed that fueled the 60s.

776
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,440
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.

777
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,960
He crashed around America selling consciousness expansion

778
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,160
without ever giving a thought to the grim meat hook realities

779
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,680
that were lying in wait for all those people who took him seriously.

780
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,720
All those pathetically eager acid freaks

781
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,420
who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit.

782
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,500
But their loss and failure is ours too.

783
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,320
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion

784
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,080
of a whole lifestyle that he helped create.

785
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,780
A generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers

786
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,940
who never understood the importance of life.

787
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,040
The essential old mystic fallacy of the acid culture.

788
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,520
The desperate assumption that somebody, or at least some force,

789
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,480
is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.

790
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,820
It was possible for the dark to smash out the stageigkeit

791
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:19,480
and sixes around the anger field.

792
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,800
Through the jurors and specialists engaged at first glance

793
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,980
the

794
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,220
Oh, oh, oh.

795
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,700
I wanna go to the place I belong

796
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,520
I wanna go to the place I belong

797
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,260
Let's go!

798
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:12,260


799
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,520
Alright then y'all.

800
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,600
Hey there! How's it feel?

801
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,420
Number please.

802
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,980
One three.

803
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,540
Oh.

804
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,180
One three.

805
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,540
Thank you.

806
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,520
Hello.

807
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,240
This is Marlowe.

808
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,460
Why didn't you telephone?

809
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,440
I didn't have a nickel.

810
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,080
Oh. What did you find at the lake?

811
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:12,240
I found a little girl.

812
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:12,240


813
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,480
Shut up and get me my number.

814
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


815
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,460
Who's being cute now?

816
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,180
You are.

817
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,140
What?

818
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,340
Did you ever try to pull anybody out of the telephone booth?

819
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,540
Yeah. Muriel Chester and San Bernardino.

820
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,240
What's this Crystal Kingsman?

821
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,220
Coming to that.

822
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,720
Oh. What man?

823
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,100
The guy I didn't know his name.

824
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:38,840
Oh.

825
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,980
Where do you usually spend Christmas Eve?

826
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,340
To the gas station.

827
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,460
On the south road.

828
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,460
Oh. Where do you?

829
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,660
Little Fawn Lake.

830
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,660
It's a place in the mountains beyond Arrowhead.

831
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,320
Oh brother.

832
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,400
Here we are.

833
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,240
How did I get here?

834
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,520
Thirty days in the water.

835
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,320
Luckily a sailor came along.

836
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,280
What's the matter?

837
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,600
There isn't much left of her.

838
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,100
Shut up.

839
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,160
This is Marlowe.

840
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:12,960
And you are?

841
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,520
I'm here to see who the cougar is,

842
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:13,520


843
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,620
and before that the Broken Circle Gospel

844
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,780
Deluxe.

845
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,200
With Sister Sugar live at the

846
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,380
Blind Lemon Devival,

847
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,660
they're doing Spirit in the Sky.

848
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,180
Do you think it's alright to

849
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,960
ring our land in a ring of iron?

850
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,620
I'm trying to wind it up here.

851
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,760
The road goes on forever.

852
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,040
They're exaggerating the

853
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,620
harmfulness of uranium.

854
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,400
It's all been spent.

855
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,820
You just squirt it out of your tube of yours.

856
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,800
I like any common ejaculating orangutan.

857
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,780
It's the only squirt thing, only it's plutonium and it's spent.

858
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,040
Talk about that.

859
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,040
I can see why they call him Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

860
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,420
Don't get too close.

861
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,380
Not Popular Cowboy Dave.

862
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,360
Now that was it.

863
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,660
Now I remember Popular Cowboy Dave.

864
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,280
Yes, I do.

865
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,680
He was tall.

866
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,360
Tall.

867
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,600
He was rich and intelligent.

868
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:15,860
Christ-like.

869
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,000
Christ-like.

870
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,740
Popular Cowboy Dave was.

871
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,240
But, well, we're going to have to have Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

872
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,880
That's a good name.

873
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,520
Popular Christ-like Dave.

874
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,680
Popular Christ-like Stang.

875
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,360
And Popular Christ-like Chaz.

876
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,120
And, of course, Popular Christ-like Wee, even though she's a female.

877
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,000
Well, there was.

878
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,280
There was Popular Bull Girl Davina.

879
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,280
Oh, Popular Bull Girl Davina?

880
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:45,760
Yeah.

881
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,440
Was she Christ-like in her appearance?

882
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,100
No, no.

883
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,640
No, no.

884
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,700
No, she was just popular.

885
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,620
No shining.

886
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,340
Like a lonely traveler in the night.

887
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:52,780
Yeah.

888
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,560
Well, okay.

889
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,220
You know, that's what happens to some of them when they can't find that spot.

890
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,380
You know, when they can't reach down there far enough.

891
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,340
That's me, man.

892
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,060
Yeah, me too.

893
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,000
We keep on looking for the itchy, slingy, ooze, squirt mechanism, and it doesn't ever shine.

894
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,720
I'm flying for a lot of weeks.

895
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,320
Speak for yourself, Dave.

896
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,860
I am speaking for myself.

897
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,180
All right, then.

898
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,120
Fauxvine boy, Dave.

899
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,220
Hey, look.

900
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,500
You say Yaka Teasma.

901
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,080
And you're just deluding yourself.

902
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:21,780
And I say Yaka Teasma.

903
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:27,280
We're all lonesome, lonely stars in the night.

904
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,640
Lonely lights in the night.

905
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,740
We come in alone, and you go out alone.

906
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,440
Ships passing in the night, baby.

907
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,020
That's right.

908
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,300
You're burning your hair off in the middle.

909
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:36,920
That's the bottom line.

910
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,940
You come in alone.

911
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,280
You go out alone.

912
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,760
That's why you should spend the night with me, baby.

913
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,980
You urge, you squirt, and sometimes...

914
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,780
To make this loneliness end for just a little while, just you, me, and Bob.

915
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,440
Come on.

916
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:48,900
What do you say?

917
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,240
Come on, be Christ-like, just for a moment.

918
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,420

Don't worry, Boris.
