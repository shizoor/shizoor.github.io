1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
You will hear an important message prepared by Director J. Edgar Hoover.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,400
Who are you?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,640
Of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,120
Who are you?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,760
J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,440
has prepared this following important message.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,780
In case of the hour of slack, remain disturbed.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,080
Do not act normal so far as possible.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,660
But now let me tell you a story that I think will tug at your heartstrings as it did mine.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,720
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,660
Shut up, listen.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,400
From PR News in Washington, I'm demonstrating in pro- and anti-Russian rallies

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,320
at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas this weekend.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,280
The BBBBB reports violence erupted with whips at a pro-protest on the peninsula.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
Middle-aged women turned up in a car park.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,980
First, they attacked the driver of a white VW.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,480
A man was hit by a van, smashing his windscreen.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,680
Another driver was dragged into some bushes, kicked, beaten, and lashed with a Cossack's whip.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,260
We managed to run away.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,700
The BBBBB.

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,160
The search for Americans is continuing in the South Saturday morning local time.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,080
I spoke to Ignatius Ong, and Ignatius said they want to believe that Ong said this to us.

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,140
The, expect the worst, the, uh, the.

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,980
As the search continues, the International Criminal...

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Criminal is investigating two stolen PRs.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,880
Interpol says it's likely that this is PR.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,580
PRs report reports Italians are holding an assault rifle.

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,120
Completed by Michelangelo in 1504, the large, shiny, bolt-action assault rifle is a national icon.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,880
It's a symbol of democracy in the city of Florence.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,900
Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said it's selling for $3,000.

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,120
Franceschini said Italy has a copyright on state-owned PR news.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,540
The controversial...

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,120
Founder of WikiLeaks is hinting that this is PR.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Well, folks, we are going to introduce our first guest.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,420
And, in fact, it's a pair of guests.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:18,040
It's Reverend Ivan Stang and also Jeff Rosenbaum to talk about a, I guess I'll call it a self-created religious movement to some extent.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,260
But you'll correct me and describe exactly what it is.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,240
Reverend Ivan Stang, welcome to the Friday Show.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,040
Boy, thanks.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,400
It's great to have you here.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Interesting to do a radio show from a mall with little trains running through.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
I'm not used to that.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,600
Sure.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,080
By the way, the ladies under Carmen Salesman will be here in just a moment.

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,140
So make sure you stock up.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,140
Figure that one out.

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,580
Yeah, okay.

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,200
That's right.

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:52,060
So, Reverend Ivan Stang, Jeff Rosenbaum, who is here with us, told me about you because I was at a wonderful establishment that Jeff runs on East 195th Street.

50
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,480
There at the Euclid-Cleveland border.

51
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,980
And I saw emblazoned on the wall a classic picture that you see as part of a graffiti.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
And show that to Chris so he can see that and recognize it.

53
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:12,320
And that picture is a guy smiling with a 1950s-style haircut and a broad smile with a pipe sticking out of his mouth.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,100
And I see it painted on railroad cars.

55
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,040
I see it on bridges.

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,020
I've seen it on the sides of mailboxes.

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,000
Graffiti artists get bold enough to do that.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
It looks like it came directly out of the ads.

59
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,020
I've seen it on the sides of people's sides and their heads and their legs.

60
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,660
Ted's old.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,980
It's very cool.

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,620
It's a very popular tattoo.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,340
So, this is one of the most famous tattoos slash stencils in the history of the world.

65
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,120
What's behind it and what's the connection with you and your religion as Reverend Stang?

66
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,620
Oh, we're out of time.

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm so sorry.

68
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, tonight, dear friends, we're going to try a new money-raising technique.

69
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,320
It's real simple.

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,260
The more you pay us, the funnier and yet more biting and trenchant and perceptive.

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,900
Our wonderful show.

72
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,480
Will be.

73
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,700
So far, only a few people have called in, so the show is still fairly silly and immature.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,740
Although, still, no doubt better than anything on television.

75
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,520
Eh?

76
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,520
Uh, what now?

77
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,040
How are you?

78
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,040
Hi, Waldo.

79
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,980
How the hell are you?

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,200
Wow, we're just...

81
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,900
I sure am.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
Well, don't have a cow, Waldo.

83
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,340
Let's you and me go see what's cooking up at Bud's.

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,220
You mean where the corn dogs are puffing?

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Hot char?

86
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,100
That's right, Waldo.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,640
Are you ready?

88
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,340
Yep.

89
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,760
Nope.

90
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,440
Afraid, dear friends, you aren't ready.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,980
That one, that one's just...

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,000
We haven't even reached that level of intelligence yet because you haven't paid enough.

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,060
As more people pledge, the material in the show will gradually become more relevant,

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,040
more timely, more sophisticated.

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,120
And when we've raised 500 bucks, we'll turn the wit factor up to .5 degrees.

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,860
At $700, we'll achieve pithiness.

97
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,140
We'll reach pithiness levels above, well above 97%.

98
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,800
And when we reach, dear friends, when we reach our goal of 1,000 American dollars tonight,

99
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,980
when we reach that point, if we can reach that tonight, by then it will be the greatest

100
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,000
audio production in the entire universe.

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,740
Now, for now, it's still pretty stupid, I guess.

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,360
And, uh, because we're not going to be smart for nothing, friends.

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,360
We're subgenius.

104
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,330
Subgeniuses.

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,950
We must have slack or money.

106
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:41,510
Uh, because, well, for instance, as it says here in Slackalonians 4.25,

107
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:51,230
he was delivered, de-kidneyed, and eviscerated for our sins and was regurgitated from the

108
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:59,170
gorge of living death, even for the justification of these hours.

109
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:28,470
All of this must be looked over the history of our society.

110
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:28,470


111
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:28,530
And if you recall the case that the sap has completely taken over America and the world

112
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,410
within its own hands, cabins and howrails are quite different in color, but regardless

113
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,410


114
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,410


115
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,410


116
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,410


117
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,410


118
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,410


119
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,090
set purpose and knowledge, and you, speaking to the people of Dobstown, even with the second

120
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,510
helping of Rugo's pinkish-eyed ones, put him to debt by nailing him to the crosshairs

121
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,370
of Gwellman's gun site.

122
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:57,210
For Bob so shoved the world that he gave up his only besotted Sunday Supplement subscribers

123
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:05,730
that he, rather than they, should have the effulgence of slack unending, in order that

124
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:14,990
they be sure to endure eternal life, yea, to itch his own even unto the hind end of

125
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,950
the world.

126
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:26,250
Yet Dobbs regurgitated, freeing his epoptitude from the agony of slacklessness, for it was

127
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,630
impossible.

128
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:35,230
For knee ye, whose grunt is knee, to keep his hold on him, Dobbs went out on stage throughout

129
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:44,350
the night of slack for ye and everyone to prepare the way for us to leave the house.

130
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,630
Moronicus 2, 611.

131
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,190
Bob, who being in very nature Dobbs, did not consider equality with anti-Bob something

132
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,030
to be grasped, clutched, or palpated.

133
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,970
But rather...

134
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:04,850
Smoked in his living pipe, like a fine burly or rum-soaked shag, he himself nothing taking

135
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:12,430
the very nay, sure, taking instead the very nay-ture of a salesman, never taking no for

136
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,170
an answer.

137
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:22,230
And being in appearance as a man, he fumbled himself in the dark, staining the sheets,

138
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,750
and became obedient to entrop.

139
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,990
A.

140
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,210
Therefore God exulted and chortled to himself, but we gave Dobbs the name that is above every

141
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:42,550
name, Salesman of the Year, that, at the word of Bob, every knee should water, and each

142
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,110
human soil the tops of his shoes.

143
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,830
And now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether this cult, that cult, or for

144
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,250
that matter, any cult, should so long endure.

145
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,590
We are met!

146
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,590
On a great potter's field of that war!

147
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:07,370
These bland pinks, living and dead, shall little note nor long remember what we do here.

148
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,250
By the way, I forget, what is it that we are doing here?

149
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:17,190
Oh yeah, it is for we the living to confess that J.R. Bob Dobbs is dead to the infinite

150
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,570
gratification of Jehovah One, the Father, senile, infinitely maligned space god.

151
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,570
Jesus came to the world to be a god.

152
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:26,570


153
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,590
He came here as a servant, but Dobbs came as a salesman.

154
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,730
Prescriptures, 2019.

155
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:40,970
And he came unto the daughters of the farmers, and knew them well, when there was no room

156
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,990
for him to be by himself during the night.

157
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:52,170
And in the morning, before the sunrise, he continued travelling upon his route, so that

158
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,490
the franchise might not be usurped.

159
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,450
Yes?

160
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,250
And to this day, it never hath been so.

161
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,230
Bobbs is still the route.

162
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,450
Bobbs is still the franchise.

163
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:12,770
And now, dear friends, as Sister Basilica passes out among you, as she sniffs the contents

164
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,330
of the collection plate, each and every one of you, dear friends, should reach down, deep

165
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:25,830
down and give to the church of the powerful blinding apostasy.

166
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:33,110
Which fears no throne, but exalts in its own freedom to scatter its fundaments on the

167
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,510
earth, soiling the uppers of its shoes, to let down the inward-produced product of its

168
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:47,730
concentration, fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.

169
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,810
Ah, ah, for lo, the frop cloudeth my brain, and my body, and my soul, and my soul, and

170
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,510
my shield, and my buckler, and my shield, are ripped away.

171
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:05,250
I am naked before thee, Dobs, all nagoi, thou who hast unbuckled my buckler, and unsnapped

172
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,330
my shield, which was my sole protection, yea, my buckler being so unbuckled.

173
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,770
I am even as a poe-buck, or buck naked, before Bobb.

174
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,750
Bobb dashes a bucket of ice-water over my loins.

175
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,410
The buck path is not, for the buck and the doe dwell in the same forest.

176
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,790
The buck is Bobb.

177
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:25,790


178
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:25,790


179
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,830
He is bucking tradition.

180
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,930
He changeth brick bats into buckets of bucks.

181
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,930
Bucks, bucks, yea, bucks, bucks, but awkward bucks, difficult to explain away.

182
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,010
I am chicken before my epopt, yea, fowl, like the birds of the ground.

183
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,950
Neuroticus 13, 6.

184
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:54,150
Oh, sick, sick, sick is this world, O Bobb, who hath beslimed the ground after thee, even

185
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,790
like unto the slugs and snails.

186
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,450
The slugs are the snails of the garden, whose chambered shells we step on and crush inadvertently.

187
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,630
Thou art not the healer, but the pharmacist, for thou dost sell unto us thy remedy of slack,

188
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,750
and it is unto us that we pay over to you the price, the price, Bobb, which thou dost

189
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,610
ask, namely all that we have, and we shall call that into our beloved radio station,

190
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,770
which presents your words, which we know we would never hear on any other call.

191
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:25,770


192
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:25,770


193
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,630
The station is a kind of station, a station which needs so much money, and we shall put

194
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:40,570
it therefore in the envelope and send it in, for the excess are nearly upon us, and the

195
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,490
sale ends tomorrow.

196
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:51,950
Going out of business, all prices slashed, everything must go.

197
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,610
So ask not upon what day.

198
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:05,550
Today shall the tithe be sent, for, unless ye know otherwise, every day is Dobb's day,

199
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,930
and ye never know when the master cometh again and again.

200
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,250
Amen."

201
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,730
And praise Bobb.

202
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:25,590
And in fact, praise Dr. Howell, who actually wrote that extremely erudite story.

203
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,170
It's a very interesting story.

204
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,810
He wrote a very interesting and verbose rant.

205
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,270
Now, Ivan, when did you start the Church of the Subgenius?

206
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,410
When did it initiate itself?

207
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,870
Well, actually, my buddy Philo Drummond turned me on to the word of Bobb in the late

208
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,650
70s.

209
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,790
And January 1, 1980, we printed a little pamphlet that found its way into New York publishing,

210
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,550
and we ended up having a book deal.

211
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,390
We've done five books now.

212
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,470
So as long as you spell subgenius right.

213
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,850
Google will tell you everything else you need to know.

214
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,650
We're down to about 30 seconds.

215
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:07,070
Is the Church of the Subgenius the kind of thing that somebody who, in your opinion,

216
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,250
belongs to some other church, they're Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, whatever, could join the Church

217
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,930
of the Subgenius without any conflict with their present religion?

218
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:21,050
If they have a sense of humor, there shouldn't be any problem at all.

219
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,650
That's a big if.

220
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,490
Okay.

221
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,090
Well.

222
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,730
We have our own fundamentalists, too.

223
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,030
There's occasionally subgeniuses that think I'm too liberal.

224
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,110
That's hilarious.

225
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,670
Well, we're talking to Reverend Bobb, staying on Integrity Radio, WINT, 1330 AM.

226
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,470
It's Friday night here at 4 o'clock.

227
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,490
This is the end from the writer's desk.

228
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:09,490


229
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:09,490


230
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:09,490


231
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:09,490


232
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:09,510
Can't be yeah.

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,330
Right now

234
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,390
By simply delimited

235
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,390


236
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,390


237
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,390


238
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,390


239
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,870
An influential name on the caffeine brain, inebriation steam train

240
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,630
Dopamine dreams of a future sleep machine, for when ya, for when ya

241
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,830
Fluorescing, possessive and passive aggressive, Zephyrs knee deep in needy

242
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,470
Pornographic graffiti, for when ya, for when ya

243
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,810
When she tells you to mellow out

244
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,070
Then she tells you to mellow out

245
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,210
When she tells you to go to hell, slick, willy wet and wild ride a mile wide, for when ya, for when ya

246
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:36,090
Songs from Gonzo and beyond, being honest, you promised, you give me a heads up and I'll fill you in, for when ya, for when ya

247
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,410
Screw this, that's it, I quit

248
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,710
Your fight, I'll oppose it all

249
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,010
Godzilla!

250
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,470
Yeah, I've been Godzilla

251
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,910
I am Godzilla, but I live in the country little town

252
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,770
Stockholm's not big enough for me

253
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,730
I'll have to take a ride by the Japanese sea

254
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,310
And smash Tokyo down, yeah, yeah, yeah

255
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,630
That was fun

256
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,570
The Japanese, the Swedish Godzilla song by Lonesome Cowboy Dave

257
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,390
Swedish Godzilla

258
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,570
You know, the geography Godzilla song

259
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,590
What's the Godzilla song now?

260
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,450
It's the geography Godzilla song, apparently

261
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,210
These are all the places that Godzilla will be destroying during the coming time

262
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,510
Followed shortly by the U.S. Army behind him

263
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,550
It's sort of a mop-up in the...

264
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:49,050
Stockholm, Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing, Seoul, Haifun, Barzoo

265
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,550
And here they come

266
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,490
Connie's got connections in Connecticut

267
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,070
Yes, she really has connections in Connecticut

268
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,510
There goes Danbury

269
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,090
So she was born out in Wyoming as a girl she started roaming

270
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,110
Oh, there goes West, I feel

271
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,330
One day she took a trip way down to Florida

272
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,410
Oh, they're moving on to New York State

273
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,490
And she called the real station down in Florida

274
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,190
There goes Albany

275
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,270
And we're such a little cutie

276
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,630
And she soon had all the fellas there adoring her

277
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,130
Then Connie secured the leading role in a wonderful Broadway attraction

278
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,050
But she wouldn't stay on a great white way

279
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,130
The pace of the action...

280
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,250
Can I?

281
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,070
Can I?

282
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,270
I sometimes think what a great and wonderful thing it would be

283
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,130
If our Lord Jesus would dress up in one of those Godzilla suits around Christmas time

284
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,230
And come visit your neighborhood and perhaps my neighborhood

285
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,570
Just hang around

286
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,330
Maybe sing a song with a man

287
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,210
Or wear one of those funny 1938 haircuts

288
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,470
I think I'd love that more than anything except life itself

289
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,690
Except for this is a freaking life

290
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,670
Hell no

291
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,050
This is not life

292
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,570
This is a pee hole we've crawled into and can't get out of

293
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,510
I don't care

294
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,070
I don't care

295
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,930
As long as I can see Jesus dressed like Godzilla

296
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,010
Oh, some funny Sunday

297
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,070
I don't know

298
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,750
Behind the pews or making the pew

299
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,330
Ha ha

300
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,130
Huh

301
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,430
And that's why people join the Church of the Subgenius, friends

302
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,310
Cause we have holidays like X-Day

303
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,290
Where you can find Jesus dressed up like a Godzilla

304
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,550
Yes, it's true

305
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,910
Actually, they will have an ugly parade this year

306
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,730
And who knows how Jesus will dress this particular time

307
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,210
Could be wearing anything or maybe nothing at all, eh, Monsieur?

308
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,330
You know how Jesus is?

309
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,170
If only his mom would dress that way

310
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,630
Yeah, he is

311
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,990
I'm supposed to be happy, she's a mammy, I'm the pappy

312
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,950
Now Connecticut's my old hometown

313
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,970
Yeah

314
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,550
Hey

315
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,090
Oh, Connie, Connie in Connecticut

316
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,510
I know you're interested in these squids

317
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,130
These prairie squids

318
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,450
But as you can see we only have four of them left

319
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,890
And you have asked clearly here in your invoice you said you would send me six

320
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,310
And this is the past future, Connie, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to keep up with this one or not

321
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,450
But the thing is, you know, if you don't really...

322
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,850
You'll

323
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,470
Hey, I just realized there's some credits that need to be given here

324
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,970
That we just completely blew off

325
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,730
The PR news, of course, is from Mr. Fernand and Annie Leher

326
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,090
Leher

327
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,410
Oh, the lady, Leher

328
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:19,510
And this is Uncle Unan Canabite

329
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,950
Unclean One Canabite, in the background

330
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,290
Unclean One Canabite

331
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,450
With the, uh,

332
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,070
Oh, name ain't a song.

333
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,910
He owes no man.

334
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,030
Listen to that.

335
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,730
Oh, name.

336
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,490
Oh, name.

337
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,950
So you see, somewhere out there in the world,

338
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,910
there are some geniuses who care.

339
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,450
Although they don't actually do anything.

340
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,330
They really care.

341
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,830
May I just say right now,

342
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,230
for this body,

343
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,430
that I'm wearing a pink lady's merkin

344
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,310
underneath these silky panties.

345
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,930
I'm a pubic merkin

346
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,470
because for the love of Bob,

347
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,750
whatever his name is.

348
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,750
For want of something else to call him.

349
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,790
Bert.

350
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,370
I prefer to call him less than I have in the past.

351
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,270
That's for sure.

352
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,310
I'm listening to this play now.

353
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,770
May I say right now

354
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,710
that I'm having a dysfunction in my colon area.

355
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,210
That, uh,

356
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,030
perhaps, uh,

357
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,470
Too much information.

358
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,630
my entire intestine may leap out

359
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,390
like one of those alien things or whatever.

360
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,070
Thanks.

361
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,090
I'll begin an argument with someone like that.

362
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,890
Too much information.

363
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,330
May I just say a bunch of unentertaining,

364
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,470
boring crap that's just going to irritate you.

365
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,710
Would you like a Kleenex?

366
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,530
blowing?

367
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,750
a plastic bag

368
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,750
is this all you got?

369
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,310
Are you scared?

370
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,750


371
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,750


372
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,750


373
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,230
How is it going?

374
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,570
Not that good.

375
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,190

Why ain´t it come?

434
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,770
Tell us why Lincoln ain't done it yet.

435
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,990
All day long we've been sitting here and waiting for word that Lincoln...

436
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,490
It's X-Day.

437
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,130
divided into Man dementia and

438
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,130


439
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,530
Mr. Lincoln is just too soft.

440
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,330
It's coming.

441
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,470
It's coming.

442
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,070
Give it to me quick.

443
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,590
It's coming.

444
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,170
Lincoln had unwound his legs.

445
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,930
Walk went all the desk,

446
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,750
can take in a wooden, and as he scratched

447
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,370
his bottom, seedling took form.

448
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,550
To the flesh, serve one another.

449
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,810
Pain, that they are all endowed, and the

450
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,790
pursuit of, to the flesh, if you see

451
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,770
them plowing, let him alone. Pinch him

452
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,430
and free at last.

453
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,490
Free at last.

454
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,750
Be kindly affectionate, one

455
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,790
to another, with brotherly love.

456
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,530
We stand

457
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,270
together.

458
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,550
We stand

459
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,270
together.

460
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:22,610
Together.

461
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,190
He'd be coming in all sweated up

462
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,150
and laughing. He knew I liked

463
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,030
that sort of thing.

464
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,590
Get your hands off my leg!

465
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,330
I'm not going in there.

466
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,330
Private Mandamus,

467
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,250
we've been wanting

468
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,050
to speak to you now because of

469
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,530
your record.

470
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,670
It's a very important

471
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,570
and misread

472
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,450
piece of disinformation.

473
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,310
Private Mandamus, it seems

474
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,970
you've been working

475
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,050
for the Skel Patrol for the last

476
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,730
three months and haven't found one

477
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,930
bloody drunk. You've just been

478
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,030
writing these papers and handing them out.

479
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,870
We can't allow

480
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,730
this. We can

481
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,510
however prohibit it, you see.

482
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,850
How do we work?

483
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,470
Get your hands out of there.

484
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,910
I was breathing

485
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,710
so softly. I

486
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,730
could hardly rest my own temperature.

487
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,050
I was convinced something

488
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,890
had gone very, very wrong.

489
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,890
I was working with my central nervous system.

490
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,430
For instance,

491
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,290
this pineal gland here.

492
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,970
All I have to do is push the right

493
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,670
buttons. And you see, I

494
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,030
can expand. I can become bigger

495
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,810
or smaller. Of course, it's not

496
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,930
like before. I still

497
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,610
have limitations.

498
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,550
The Big Bang is over, so to speak.

499
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,790
But I'll be back again someday.

500
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,990
You know, they said God's, the mind

501
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,730
of God was damaged

502
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,530
in the Big Bang.

503
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,410
And that's what the New Age

504
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,270
is all about, man.

505
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,550
God's got brain damage.

506
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,210
That means you're God. You can do your own

507
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,650
thing. It's the age

508
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,610
of Aquarius, man.

509
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,650
You screwed up, but you're God, man.

510
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,850
It's so cool. You can be

511
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,710
like an angst character, like

512
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,070
Promethean James Dean of the old era

513
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,030
type. It's like there's no good

514
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,870
or no evil. There's just

515
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,670
you, man. And it's like

516
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,870
you just do your own

517
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,210
thing.

518
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,410
Yeah, unlike the New Age.

519
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,610
It's the New Age. What you feel,

520
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,710
that's what's real.

521
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,870
The Tao is like, you know, balances

522
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,670
angst and joy, man.

523
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,910
Well, it's not real joy.

524
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,050
It's closer to slack, actually. It's kind of a form

525
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,850
of loose joy, which hardly

526
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,470
ever assembles.

527
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,010
Well, let's say it's hard to achieve.

528
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,790
Hey, man.

529
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:38,750
Guess who?

530
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,910
Guess who?

531
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,350
Do something about him.

532
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,450
Friend, I can tell by the fact that you tuned in

533
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,770
that there are some things I don't need to tell you.

534
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,770
So, I'm not even going to

535
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:50,950
bother.

536
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,270
What is wrong with that guy?

537
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,430
It's alright. It's alright.

538
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,910
He's okay, man. He's been hanging around with private

539
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,770
mandamus, see. He's been telling

540
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,550
all that crazy stuff, you know.

541
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,310
He's going to be alright.

542
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,270
Look, look. See, his flesh tone

543
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,410
is, well, it's not really a flesh tone.

544
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,170
It's more of like a... He looks like the

545
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,110
bark of a tree or maybe... Hey, it's an

546
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,030
onion skin. Yeah, man. He's

547
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,870
a bit of a... The onion skin.

548
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,090
That's just one of those... He's the metaphor man.

549
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,910
Yeah, a little metaphor man. Like the conspiracy

550
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,150
itself as you peel away the

551
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,830
onion skin.

552
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,730
Yet there's another skin underneath.

553
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,050
And you peel away that skin. And there's another

554
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,230
skin. It's skin upon skin. That doesn't

555
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,270
work when you start peeling skin off

556
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,230
a lonesome cowboy. Dave here now, does it?

557
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,130
Yeah. You peel off one layer of skin and he

558
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,290
starts screaming. That's because there's only

559
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,130
one layer to a subgenius. There's no metaphors

560
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,590
here, man. It ain't like nothing but one of them.

561
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,930
It's because we're the pure, the honest

562
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,370
primates.

563
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,170
The mandrills of the

564
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,270
world, don't you see? Our purple

565
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,290
behinds glow with pride

566
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,170
and slackdomness because

567
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,130
we've got Bob in them. There's also the

568
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,210
toxic material. We can also look at that

569
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,070
aspect of it too, but sure, yeah, we're

570
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,070
glowing. You need to get a glow on every

571
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,350
day before you ride the bus.

572
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,590
Some of us don't actually ride it.

573
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,950
We just kind of take it around with us.

574
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,510
Friends, you're either on the bus

575
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,310
or you're off the bus. You're either on the saucers

576
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,230
or you're off of those

577
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,230
saucers, my friend.

578
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,490
For Reverend Ken Kesey, the great subgenius,

579
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,110
a dues-paying subgenius minister,

580
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,670
by the way.

581
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,370
I remember when Neil Cassidy

582
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,110
was achieving his penultimate

583
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,990
years, talked like

584
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,850
this, even though he's from Colorado.

585
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,230
He still had a nasal twang

586
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,090
that deviated

587
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,330
septum, perhaps, but we're all deviated.

588
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,990
You know?

589
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,870
This is where I should cut to a bunch of

590
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,630
Neil Cassidy.

591
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,770
But you gotta have to lead some meager, eccentric,

592
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,670
sincere maniacal

593
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,010
like Alexander. Donna made you discover

594
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,990
that's pretty fair. Spencer, that's

595
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,130
pretty fair for Tom Edison.

596
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,770
Well, here we want someone who's

597
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,070
like Tony Perkins. That's it.

598
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,610
Somebody who is

599
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,750
who could be either way,

600
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,550
but in this case, it's a definite

601
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,730
neurotic thing already, I mean.

602
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,830
Like, he's obsessed with racing.

603
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,510
Let's say Tony Perkins

604
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,730
has a sick cat,

605
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,050
not being approved of at all, as the son, you see,

606
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,730
would be, so he'd have a mania

607
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,810
for auto racing, even though, like, say,

608
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,610
Tony Perkins wouldn't be good for football

609
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,630
or wrestling or anything.

610
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,290
Why?

611
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,790
This fellow can't race with a dam.

612
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,470
He's the poorest of the bunch.

613
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,750
He only runs for the family. It's in his blood, you understand.

614
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,750
Here we got this rural French

615
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,070
garage-owning family that the uncle

616
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,150
brother, couple of the brothers, father himself

617
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,750
race.

618
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,490
Neil Cassidy, Neil Cassidy, Neil Cassidy,

619
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,150
Neil Cassidy, but I bet I could...

620
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,670
The old buddy Jack Kerouac, singing

621
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,370
lonesome songs to the moon, arguing with himself,

622
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,150
laying on his mother's...

623
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,810
You know you can't force Cassidy, okay?

624
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,030
Kids, we're talking about ancient, dead subgeniuses

625
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,910
of the past, and that's what you'll be if

626
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,710
you don't make sure that we have your correct

627
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,230
address on our mailing list.

628
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,330
And this is how we salute them.

629
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,590
For instance, we light two flowers

630
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,110
for Jack Kerouac.

631
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,630
For Neil Cassidy, we blow up

632
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,390
five flowers.

633
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,350
And for the others, we take the tiny

634
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,150
little regimental everyday

635
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,430
conspiracy bus and blow the hemp

636
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,190
into bluey. But for Bill

637
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,710
Hicks, we eat a whole can of black beans

638
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,470
and lay around pyroflatulating

639
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,630
all night long. Forget about the rice.

640
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,330
There's no need for it.

641
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,050
It's an experience.

642
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,430
It's hardly an experience.

643
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,250
It isn't

644
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,490
hallucination, my friend.

645
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,190
It isn't pollution that

646
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,130
harms the environment.

647
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,950
It isn't your eyes that are seeing

648
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,990
the wrong things.

649
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,310
It's your face that's in the wrong place.

650
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,170
You have

651
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,250
visited yourself upon

652
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,910
an ugly, angry world.

653
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,050
A world of misconception

654
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,430
and deceit.

655
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,870
There, sit down on the

656
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,950
toilet of love.

657
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,870
Place your fanny, your booty

658
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,990
firmly on the place

659
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,670
where...

660
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,150
Why can't I just forget about it?

661
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,010
It's because we're not in the world of love,

662
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,830
man. We're in the world

663
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,030
of the hate.

664
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,710
Getting the hang of it.

665
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,290
Now the system changed.

666
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,910
Every system

667
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,970
is an integral

668
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,050
downfall.

669
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,350
We may make it perfect.

670
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,470
We may make it perfect.

671
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,290
We may make it perfect.

672
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,330
We may make it perfect.

673
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,590
It's a bad idea, man.

674
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,030
I mean, like, if I had my chance

675
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,910
or my choice

676
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,170
to have my own church

677
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,210
or something, you know,

678
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,610
to make a spiritual movement,

679
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,030
you know, and reap

680
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,650
souls and

681
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,410
rape sloughs and, you know,

682
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,290
gather unto myself the many

683
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,630
from amongst the fumes and so forth,

684
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,010
you know, like, if I could do that,

685
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,570
why would I become a...

686
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,090
You know a slack genius or any of those other it's like

687
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,750
Most of these people are like nothing like my own

688
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:08,050
Formed everything, you know the big macrocephalic dudes man the guys with the high foreheads, you know

689
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,590
They're a brain thing. They've got the you know, like the hardening of the skull and stuff

690
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,690
These are like the leaders of this church

691
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,130
Oh

692
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,150
Speaking of which

693
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:26,090
Have you know some of us are just regular ordinary space was named to be empty

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,610
But you believe what I tell you

721
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,710
You

722
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,790
You

723
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:23,210
You are just a bit of a squirmer

724
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,290
We could have been more visible

725
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,350
You are very kind

726
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,610
But you believe what I tell you

727
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,130
You are very kind

728
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,990
But you believe what I tell you

729
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:11,990


730
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:11,990


731
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,690
You are very kind

732
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,890
But you believe what I tell you

733
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:36,870
You are very kind

734
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,130
But you believe what I tell you

735
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,650
You are very kind

736
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:57,570
But you believe what I tell you

737
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:57,950
You

738
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:07,270
You are not that out of touch

739
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,050
But you believe what I tell you

740
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,710
These guys sound like an early Leonard Skinner or something.

741
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,070
Well, they're from Birmingham, Alabama.

742
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,090
They've got that southern sound to them.

743
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,390
It's a little like Grits and Gravy, you know?

744
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,110
They're for real, like God's people tend to be.

745
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,730
I doubt if they're for real, Stan.

746
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,850
No offense, you Yankees, just don't speak God's language.

747
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,870
We don't have the physical mechanics.

748
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,470
Nor play God's guitar.

749
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,510
We don't have the demonic tongue you southerners do.

750
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,090
Nor God's harmonica.

751
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,790
We can't eat God's beans.

752
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,710
But we play Satan's fiddle, like Charlie, what's his fat?

753
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,570
Oh, yeah, you got that satanic fiddle playing down.

754
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,690
I got Charlie.

755
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:29,150
This is a special meeting, and I'd just like to remind everybody seated here

756
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,330
that they're not supposed to be in those seats.

757
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,650
There's something seriously wrong with your pants and your stuffing.

758
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,070
Be quiet.

759
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,810
Places we've had marked are inferior to the original places,

760
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,530
and they're translated into stellar material.

761
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:48,950
Some of you will be evaporated, then the rest of you will become like mother's milk.

762
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,750
That's right.

763
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,050
You'll become like soft, screwy, smelly.

764
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:01,210
Like the cream that runs down the side of Bob's pipe.

765
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,770
Like the unconscious underman and the macho muchachos.

766
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:12,210
Can you feel Bob swelling up in you down there?

767
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:17,570
Yeah, just a repetitious simian with nothing on your mind except for that blank check.

768
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,650
Did you say something about blank chicks?

769
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:21,090
Yeah.

770
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,630
We're looking for blank chicks and lads.

771
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,450
We're looking for blanker chicks.

772
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:32,890
Who can be filled in by Mr. Fill-in-the-blank-himself, J.R. Bob-the-Dobbs.

773
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,010
Ah, I remember Phil Dirt and the Dozers, my favorite band.

774
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,930
They were great.

775
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,830
But not as great as Phil-in-the-blank-himself.

776
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:46,730
Phil was cool, and I remember Jethro Tull of Jethro Tull.

777
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,270
He was a cool fella, too.

778
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,810
How did you meet him?

779
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,130
How'd you come upon him?

780
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:58,750
I used to be in commercial radio, and of course, that was before the accident.

781
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,950
It wasn't an accident.

782
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,510
That's another thing.

783
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,910
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

784
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,510
Iron lung.

785
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,110
Well, in your case, it looks more like a copper mask.

786
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,030
Yeah, we're dealing with some inferior metals here.

787
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,210
The iron butt.

788
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,410
And the iron suit.

789
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,010
I am your father.

790
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,950
And the iron fist of...

791
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,990
What is the iron fist?

792
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,950
The iron fist of the...

793
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,170
It's like the iron fish.

794
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:27,910
Tish.

795
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:28,610
Yes.

796
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,130
Revenge of the...

797
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:30,810
Tish?

798
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,490
That is the theme of our show.

799
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,410
Tish means dish in German, don't it?

800
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,610
How they take something...

801
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:37,690
Great.

802
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,730
And turn it into utter crap.

803
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,530
Oh, pish cash.

804
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:41,470
Like this show.

805
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,590
Like this whole radio station once we got here.

806
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,730
Tommy, can you feel me?

807
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,870
Can you hear me, though?

808
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,070
Can you feel me?

809
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:49,950
Can you see me?

810
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,250
Tommy?

811
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,670
It's a lot of malarkey.

812
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,090
Can you see me?

813
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,190
Tommy?

814
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,650
Can you feel me?

815
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,010
Can you smell me yet?

816
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:57,530
You're asking up.

817
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,670
I wasted my pants again.

818
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,050
Are you wasting it?

819
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,390
Can you feel me, Tommy?

820
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,150
Hi, Seba.

821
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:03,910
Hey, you're not Tommy.

822
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,790
You're just another scale in the road.

823
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:06,230
I hear you.

824
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,070
You feel the smell.

825
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:07,070


826
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:07,070


827
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:07,070


828
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,530
Seed rising.

829
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,550
Bob's a-coming, friends.

830
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,930
And you can get more of that man, Bob.

831
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,890
If you just write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

832
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:23,250
That's right.

833
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,170
The information's free.

834
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:27,750
You know, I love saying this because nobody just about ever does this.

835
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,530
But you can.

836
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,730
But you sound so cool when you do it.

837
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,050
Actually drop you a card to Subgenius Foundation.

838
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,410
No, not Dallas, Texas no more.

839
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,710
No, not Austin, Texas.

840
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,010
Nope.

841
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:36,570
They...

842
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,090
They don't need slack in Texas anymore.

843
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:39,990
No, they don't.

844
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,110
Or maybe it's too good for them.

845
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,090
DNA level C.

846
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,830
Here at DNA level C, friends.

847
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,010
That's post office box.

848
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:45,810
Got that pencil ready?

849
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,490
Box 181417.

850
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,390
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

851
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:56,370
44118.

852
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,350
And it's an address you won't want to miss.

853
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:04,450
It's an odd dress, all right, that she's wearing down there at subgenius.com.

854
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,430
But look, once again, the pubic...

855
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,670
Oh, that's mighty, mighty interesting.

856
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,310
I can't breathe.

857
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,350
I...

858
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,990
It's okay.

859
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,030
It's gonna be all right.

860
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,690
I'm telling you.

861
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,750
I keep trying to tell you.

862
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,350
It's gonna be all right.

863
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,210
You think it's really gonna be all right?

864
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,210
Yeah, yeah, man.

865
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,270
Princess Weir's always saying that.

866
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,470
I didn't like Red Mist.

867
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:30,530
I didn't like Search and Destroy.

868
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,290
I didn't like any of the other war rides at this freaking carnival, man.

869
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,110
I know, but I have it on good authority.

870
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:36,550
But it's not like you're gonna be able to do it.

871
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,550


872
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,550


873
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,550


874
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,550


875
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,550


876
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:36,550


877
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,690
It's gonna be all right, okay?

878
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,570
I don't like authority figures either.

879
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,690
I like figurines.

880
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,230
You know, little tiny gnome things you put in the back of your head.

881
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:43,350
It's okay.

882
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,910
It's the disfigurines you have to worry about, dude.

883
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:45,810
Oh, yeah.

884
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:46,630
Hey, look.

885
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,730
They're all like us.

886
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:48,690
They're all disfigurines.

887
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,610
Some of them have too much rouge on the left side of their head.

888
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,550
Heads up, friends.

889
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:06,050
Thanks to Lonesome Cowboy Dave for that, recorded back when he could get to the station.

890
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,550
I'm sorry.

891
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:06,550


892
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:06,550


893
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:06,550


894
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:14,650
And what's coming up next is the song Crazy Little Thing, performed by Mia Johnson.

895
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,870
That's from that Captain Beefheart album.

896
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:24,590
Oh, and the music we heard a couple of tracks ago, very weird stuff, was called Shower Scene

897
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,510
by the Psycho Skeletons.

898
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,730
And now, Mia Johnson.

899
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,290
Crazy little thing's just gone crazy, girl.

900
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,770
How'd you get a name like crazy little thing?

901
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,330
Probably the name that drove you crazy all along.

902
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,810
How'd you get the walk?

903

It moves so slow and lazy.

The way she moves there ain't no maybe

Talking real low like that

913
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,110
She brings things down lower than they should be

914
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,150
She brings things up higher than they could be

915
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,170

How old, how old, how old, how old, how old?

924

Cause if you're too young, girl

925
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,090
You're gonna be the ruin of me

926
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,170
They call her crazy, but I'm not

927
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,870
