00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,880
The Hour of Slack

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,700
How can we live with this threat?

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,580
Our best life insurance may be summed up in four words.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,360
The Hour of Slack

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,120
This will take some doing on your part.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,120
It will take slack to survive.

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,220
Bob.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,640
Bob, hello.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm playing with matches.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,420
NASA is still trying to find a way to repair a torn suicide bomber.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,360
NASA has mylar and it might be sewn shut.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,580
Discovery Commander Pam Melroy says...

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,480
So, and, uh...

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
On Wall Street 689.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,000
Federal Reserve policy makers are warning residents to keep an eye on PR's PR.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,980
But some say,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
Some warn that the Fed runs the risk of worse PR news in the fourth quarter.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,600
They say it could pick up strength in central Russia.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,480
Russian authorities have recently warned Russians of the potential for increased PR news.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm gonna get me an aeroplane.

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm gonna get me an aeroplane, fly it inside of your brain.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,620
Look, there's a bunny rabbit jumping around.

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,100
Fuzzy wuzzy rabbit make a squeaking sound.

25
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,980
Cute fuzzy bunny got a puppy black tail.

26
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,060
Tone around the sack for the US mail.

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm gonna get me an aeroplane, fly it inside of your brain.

28
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,160
Me and my bunny in my aeroplane, squeaking inside of your brain.

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,600
Squeaking inside of your brain.

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
Did you say it's funny?

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,960
Yes, love, yes it's fun...

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,500
Screaming in the rain depends on brilliance.

33
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
He's trying to get in the boat.

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,600
Better tasted candy.

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
Isn't he?

36
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,760
How are you today?

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,220
Is your bunny gonna take a trip?

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,100
Flying down into your lung?

39
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,120
Rutherford Hayes built a landing strip

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,040
He built it on the tip of your tongue

41
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,960
Starting at your eyeball near the macula

42
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,500
Circling your mouth and your uvula

43
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,940
Drop down the throat, there you see what he done

44
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,580
He's flying down into your lung

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,200
Flying inside of your lung

46
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,860
He's flying down into your lung

47
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:46,180
He's flying down into your lung

48
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,920
And yours truly, your dear friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

49
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,840
Oh, and Reverend Wat D. Falk and his brows.

50
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,760
But first, this.

51
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,820
I want to read a wonderful rant by Reverend Uncle Dr. Onan Kenobite.

52
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,380
A sermon on hypocrisy.

53
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,400
It is not my place to put down my fellow religionists.

54
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,240
The Church of the Subgenius believes every part of every religion.

55
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,740
Don't take these words as saying other religions are less than ours.

56
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,960
It's just that our religion is more than theirs.

57
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,580
You've come here tonight to hear more on religion.

58
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,940
And if we got a moron religion for you.

59
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,280
The Catholics believed in purgatory.

60
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,960
Until they didn't.

61
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,120
The Muslims believed each revelation was the final one.

62
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,080
Until they didn't.

63
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,860
The Mormons believed in polygamy.

64
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,840
Until they didn't.

65
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,840
Until they didn't.

66
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,400
This appears to the modern and skeptical eye as unto hypocrisy.

67
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,240
They say one thing.

68
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,300
And then they say another thing that is a different thing.

69
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,080
Gotcha.

70
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,860
There's a whole industry of one religion saying the other religion is hypocritical.

71
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,200
And atheists saying that all the religions are hypocritical.

72
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,800
It's not an industry that pays the bills.

73
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,960
But it does keep people busy in the important work of declaring their beliefs.

74
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,220
And it's not just the religious beliefs.

75
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,440
It's the religious beliefs that are superior to all other beliefs.

76
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,960
But wait, dear friend.

77
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,280
Do not view these contradictory claims as hypocrisy.

78
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,440
View what is said instead through the lens of religion.

79
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,600
The point was never to have you believe any particular belief.

80
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,660
The point was to have you publicly declare you believed it.

81
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,280
To convey your loyalty to the cause.

82
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,540
This is why religions can offer up a claim as an eternal truth one day and a forgotten

83
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,800
heresy the next day.

84
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,940
The experience of religion is a great way to show that religion is not a lie.

85
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,180
It's a message of belief.

86
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,680
The expression of commitment was the thing.

87
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
Not the particular thing committed to.

88
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,420
Remember that day when you found out you were the only one who really believed and for everybody

89
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,220
else it was just kind of a social thing?

90
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,680
It's that times seven billion over thousands of years.

91
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,820
What you need is to stop using your mind to think about your religion.

92
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,920
What you need is to remember that you remembered.

93
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,800
Belief is a thing to wear for a time.

94
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,780
And that if other people haven't remembered that yet, it's an opportunity for you to show

95
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,560
them how it's done.

96
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,600
What you need is the church of the subgenius.

97
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,440
Praise Bob and thank you Onan.

98
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Again.

99
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,240
Talk about retro.

100
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,860
Onan has redesigned subgenius.com.

101
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,760
Now it's not.

102
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,160
This is just in on his computer.

103
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,040
Satan finds work for nimble little fingers.

104
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,860
Onan is inspired by Buckminster Fuller.

105
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,300
He's really into the Dimexion approach of simplifying, you know, making things direct.

106
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,900
That's better than being inspired by Buck naked.

107
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,720
And he has made this.

108
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,740
It's even you don't have the way I've got it now.

109
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,800
It's black and white.

110
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,140
It's ancient HTML one.

111
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,980
Of course.

112
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,120
That's only because I got bored with all that web stuff after about five years.

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,300
But this is even more down and dirty.

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,800
It's literally a picture of Bob and a list of subjects.

115
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,040
And they go to the same places that the current one does.

116
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,280
But of course, all of that would then be made in that cascading form to become very spare.

117
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,340
So it would totally lose the psychedelic aspects and go straight into the black and white.

118
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,980
Purity.

119
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,720
The purity, I tell you, of your straight Bob, your true Bob, your black and white Bob, your

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,140
dots Bob, the post photographic Bob that may be true.

121
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,600
And yet we know by its stripes it is false.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,960
That beefy faced photo Bob.

123
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,340
Oh, you don't like that one, huh?

124
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,360
Is that now the official position of the church?

125
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,220
I'm beginning to suspect, Dr. Haldeman, this is making me feel better the more I think

126
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,640
about it.

127
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,940
It could not be that the conspiracy found a man who looked almost like Bob and aged

128
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,060
him, fattened him, did plastic surgery on him.

129
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,440
With good cape and line.

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,960
And used an ancient camera to take a portrait of him, got the pipe perfectly placed and

131
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,980
the brill cream in the hair just right.

132
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:49,920
And then half toned that and worked it into perfect replicas of old newspapers.

133
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,260
Maybe that's where that so-called original Bob comes from.

134
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,820
Who paid for this elaborate imposture?

135
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,280
Well, they followed the money.

136
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,060
Exactly.

137
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,420
Who's making money off Bob?

138
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,420
Bob.

139
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,000
It was just an early...

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,920
Bob hired this guy that looked sort of like him and he uglied him up and then, you know,

141
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,500
because he was trying to get us off his back.

142
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,020
They didn't ugly him up.

143
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,340
No, no.

144
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,080
It was just one of his early jobs.

145
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,800
This is an absolute...

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,360
This is an absolute photo representation of the living, breathing Bob.

147
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,100
I know, but the true...

148
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,940
What's the model job?

149
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,560
...Dog's head is pristine and perfect.

150
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,600
He's inhumanly perfect.

151
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,700
He's not perfect.

152
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,540
That's the problem.

153
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,860
They chopped off the head at the chin and they don't show the cascade of double chins,

154
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
the beefy, rotarian body and the sleazy, pinstripe suit.

155
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,560
That's not the real Bob.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,220
The real Bob always looked young.

157
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,400
Well, the glyph does.

158
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,980
He looks young.

159
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,780
The glyph is separated out.

160
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,340
He's separated from reality.

161
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,940
The glyph is in eternity, but the actual fleshy edifice of Bob is aging, towering,

162
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,040
tottering.

163
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,920
Yeah, he's probably 35 or whatever.

164
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
He's about 35 years old.

165
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:06,100
Yes, but you don't see the flesh under the face because the chin is an arbitrary cutoff

166
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,360
line.

167
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Well, Bob, in...

168
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:14,160
People were always confused by the asymmetry of the chin.

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,300
That's because it represents a line cut by something.

170
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,760
Well, we all know that Bob was a model before he was born.

171
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:19,760


172
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
That would mean he's like...

173
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,300
One of his early jobs was modeling.

174
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,660
He's about 90 now.

175
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,680
It was written in the book of the subgenius, the last word.

176
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
So, then it turned out to be absolutely true and I know that terrifies some folks.

177
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,200
But anyway, he'd be 90 years old now.

178
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,200
Yes, 90 years young as we say.

179
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,660
As with most good...

180
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,080
Yeah, 90 is the new 45.

181
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,360
Some of those guys don't age.

182
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,660
Even short duration saviors don't age.

183
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,560
Some of them don't age.

184
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,960
I didn't think he aged.

185
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,740
No, he doesn't.

186
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,420
He doesn't age really.

187
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,440
He does age, but it's just...

188
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,780
Age as well.

189
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,060
He ages in the word.

190
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,720
Can you see back in the Bible that people used to live to be 600 years old?

191
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,300
900.

192
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,400
See, there you go.

193
00:12:59,520 --> 00:12:59,880
Bob is still a child.

194
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,600
Moses was more than nine centuries...

195
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,540
Not Moses, Noah.

196
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,740
Methuselah was 976.

197
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,240
Yes, Noah lived almost as long.

198
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,000
His years were very great at the time he had sex with his new-born daughters.

199
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,520
Well, that was because...

200
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,880
They got him drunk.

201
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,220
There were no other guys except their brothers.

202
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,200
Oh, it wasn't his fault.

203
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,780
Oh, no.

204
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,680
They got him drunk.

205
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,300
Oh, yeah.

206
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,440
He didn't know what he was doing.

207
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:26,680
Sure.

208
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
Of course he didn't know.

209
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,020
Yeah.

210
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,020
It's all their fault.

211
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,580
Right.

212
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah.

213
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,020
Noah didn't do anything.

214
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,820
That whole thing is a bunch of hooey.

215
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,200
The ark sunk.

216
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
He's asleep in a cave and they go in there and...

217
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, it's in the Bible.

218
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,520
I can show you the wreckage of Noah's Ark on Stang Ranch.

219
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,680
Noah's Ark sunk on the site of the Paluxy River.

220
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,200
The cave subgeniuses...

221
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,520
It came down with a bump.

222
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,500
...had jumped ship.

223
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,260
They had jumped ship long before.

224
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,440
That's why they survived.

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,760
And they're not seen on any of the Noah's Ark...

226
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,740
And all those dinosaurs bolted out of the ark, leaving those tracks that you see.

227
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,560
Have you got the Noah's Ark photos?

228
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,320
Is that what you said?

229
00:13:59,620 --> 00:13:59,920
No.

230
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,440
We've got the wreckage of Noah's Ark.

231
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,420
He's got the beams, the ribs of the hull...

232
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,100
Oh, you can barely tell it's theirs.

233
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,280
...decking plants, the portholes, the lifesavers.

234
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,020
You know that Noah's Ark that we were talking about earlier that's in Kentucky?

235
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,600
Yeah.

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,080
I hear that when you're looking at the places where the...

237
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,480
Yeah.

238
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:27,820
...animals were stored that the aisles are very narrow so that it's hard to walk behind

239
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,540
somebody who's reading, you know, like a plaque that's really small.

240
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,980
It's a real small...

241
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,380
Terrifyingly claustrophobic.

242
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,260
And so they're standing there reading the plaque and you know how you have to kind of

243
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,520
bend over and it makes your butt stick out?

244
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,800
And now you're reading the plaque and somebody wants to come by and it's like they have to

245
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,740
scrape their crotch against your butt as they squeeze by.

246
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,860
Oh, these fundamentalist...

247
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,320
How do you do that?

248
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
You know, that's weird.

249
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,220
That's weird.

250
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,900
Please, God.

251
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,320
Please, Noah's Ark.

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,820
That happens in Noah's Ark.

253
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,440
Yeah.

254
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,540
Well, if it's that narrow, how the hell do they get the hippopotamuses through there?

255
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,140
I don't know.

256
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,900
Can you imagine walking behind the hippopotamus?

257
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,420
You wouldn't want to do that.

258
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,960
And having to scrape your crotch across their ass.

259
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,380
You do not want to walk behind a hippopotamus if there's any factual information to take

260
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,520
away from...

261
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm learning all the time from top to bottom.

262
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,040
Well, the hippopotamus takes its little tail...

263
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,100
Think about the poor guy...

264
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,900
And it whirls its tail and it flings shit as it walks.

265
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,660
Which one of Noah's sons had to muck those stalls?

266
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm talking about how the hippopotamus...

267
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,940
Think about mucking those stalls.

268
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,320
You don't want to walk behind...

269
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,860
Noah's son had to do that.

270
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,280
Oh, well.

271
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Listen, all I'm asking...

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,680
Hey, can you guys share that mic in a more equitable way?

273
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,080
No wonder they hated it.

274
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,500
Well, it's because I'm not eating it, Louie.

275
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,200
Well, Philo's overpowering everybody.

276
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,500
I know.

277
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,660
And that's what he told you he was going to do.

278
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,680
Whichever way I do it, it will be wrong.

279
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,600
Yeah.

280
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,540
I'm sorry, sir, but every...

281
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,580
It doesn't matter which way...

282
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,800
Can't both of you just lean into that thing a little bit?

283
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,900
Come on, get close.

284
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,200
See, it's like...

285
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,340
Just like...

286
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,120
We're going to touch beards here.

287
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,140
Oh, God.

288
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,060
Oh, Jesus.

289
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,400


290
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,660
Lean in.

291
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,040
Why don't you tie me in and knock together?

292
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,780
How's that?

293
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,120
That's what we need to do.

294
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,200
Listen, how many lifeboats were on Noah's Ark?

295
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,600
None.

296
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,300
That would have been a blasphemous...

297
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,100
Yeah, absolutely.

298
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,580
See?

299
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,700
And what happened?

300
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,140
That would mean the Lord wasn't going to provide.

301
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,080
See?

302
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,580
It's not going to sink because God is at the...

303
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,020
But the Lord also didn't, as Philo just said, somebody had to clean up all that muck from

304
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,560
the rhinos and the tigers and the bears, oh my.

305
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,980
Well, if you saw the recent movie, the bad guy stowed away on the Ark.

306
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,600
I mean, all this other stuff that they added with the long-suffering Jennifer Connelly

307
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,500
as Mrs. Noah rolling her eyes and doing all the chores on the Ark.

308
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,480
I like thinking they could design the Ark.

309
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,300
I think they could design the Ark in such a way that they knew they were going to have

310
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,540
to muck it out, you know, like from an elephant.

311
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,060
They got to muck out an elephant stall every day.

312
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,400
You open the forward...

313
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,600
But you know, in that version that John Huston...

314
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,560
...Sea water washes through.

315
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,480
Yes, in the Bible, in the beginning.

316
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,200
They fed them milk.

317
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,880
They would milk the other animals and feed the...

318
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,100
Like the tigers were drinking milk.

319
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,900
They didn't know it was bad for them.

320
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,260
And that would calm them down.

321
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,500
That made the tigers all calm, you know.

322
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,280
So they didn't want to...

323
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,420
Why didn't they just make like a trap door in the bottom of the ship and just let it

324
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
just go out the bottom?

325
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,860
They swill the ocean water through the Ark.

326
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,040
I think that would have been a good idea.

327
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
That would have been a great idea.

328
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,660
Yeah.

329
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,860
Like the Aegean stable.

330
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,440
But God...

331
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,800
They may have, you know, may have like...

332
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:37,900
I would think that the animals drinking milk, their capacity to crap was increased, but

333
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,640
it would have been easier to clean up.

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,480
Oh, yeah.

335
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,520
It would have been like baby shit everywhere, you know.

336
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,920
And then they recycle that and feed that to the monkeys.

337
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,420
Yeah.

338
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,980
You open the petcock at the front of the Ark.

339
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,880
Or at least the insects.

340
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,340
Exactly.

341
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,120
And it swills the water through at hoof and paw level.

342
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,100
They have two flies in there.

343
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,360
I was going to say they would have brought a lot more flies with them than I think they

344
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,360


345
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,660
Well, they had two flies.

346
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,980
They had two cockroaches, two mosquitoes, and those two tapeworms.

347
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
They had two flies and those two flies have to eat all that shit.

348
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,120
Yep.

349
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,460
They had plenty of food for the flies.

350
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:07,780
There you go.

351
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,780
That's the answer to the question.

352
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,960
Can you guys say...

353
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,540
They grew unnaturally large and buzzed around the boat.

354
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
A flop of poo or a scat or something.

355
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:14,900
Yeah.

356
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:14,900


357
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,840
I don't know if there's some other word that's not against the law.

358
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,100
Besides, we don't say...

359
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,040
Besides what?

360
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,900
We don't say...

361
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,140
Poop.

362
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,360
Besides the Anglo-Saxonism.

363
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,080
We can say flop.

364
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,120
Poop.

365
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,280
Let's say flop or plop.

366
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,780
Feces.

367
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,800
Hold on, everybody.

368
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,220
Get this out of your system.

369
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,040
Let's say ejecta.

370
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,260
Oh, other words besides excrement?

371
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,580
Shite.

372
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,740
Excreta.

373
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,120
Scat.

374
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,900
Fumets.

375
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,240
Scat.

376
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,500
For animals.

377
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,720
Effluvient.

378
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,060
How about fumets?

379
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,800
Anal effluviant.

380
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,380
What do you mean by that?

381
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,760
Subgenius Bible.

382
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:44,900
Subgenius Bible.

383
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:44,900


384
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:44,900


385
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:44,900


386
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,320
And the Bible study class is on Noah's Ark.

387
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,880
Is it over yet?

388
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,580
Do you want it to be over?

389
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,020
We didn't talk about the radio mast and the radio operator's room.

390
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,040
Do you want it to be over?

391
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,320
I can find the theme music.

392
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,340
Oh, yeah.

393
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,360
Philo's dancing with impatience to unleash his theme music.

394
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,300
Hello, this is Children's Bible Hour with Aunt Bertha.

395
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,140
Oh, there you go.

396
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,760
And Billy and Billy...

397
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:14,900
Billy and Billy.

398
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:14,900


399
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:14,900


400
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,640
A new excrement.

401
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:15,800
...a new inimitable instrument.

402
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:15,800


403
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:15,800


404
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,880
...eternally in the wrong.

405
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
On Noah's Ark.

406
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,120
Noah's Ark.

407
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,120


408
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,860
Noah's Ark.

409
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,440
No way.

410
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,440


411
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,440


412
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,580
No way.

413
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,000
No way.

414
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,000


415
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,040
Many people ask how we dealt with the excrement on the ark.

416
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,040
It's metaphor!

417
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,720
A metaphor.

418
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:41,500
The metaphor shoot is where we place the ark's refuse.

419
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,140
I hope you like this story, boy.

420
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,060
Into the chute.

421
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,340
It says metaphor on the lid.

422
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,240
Do you think maybe they brought extra animals so they could eat them?

423
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,860
Or did they just eat plants?

424
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,080
No, they drank that milk.

425
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,000
They drank milk.

426
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,500
All they did was just drink milk.

427
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,380
No, no one in his family.

428
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,380
They drank milk, too.

429
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,060
They just drank milk.

430
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,980
That's all they did.

431
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,840
They just drank milk.

432
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,840
In the Russell Crowe movie, the bad guy ate several species in the ark while he was stowed away.

433
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,200
They ate the unicorn.

434
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,440
Which never survived.

435
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
The unicorn was the first one to go, wasn't it?

436
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,540
Well, it has its own skewer, you know?

437
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes, it does.

438
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,520
Yeah, so you use one to kill the other.

439
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,640
Yeah, and then you hold it.

440
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,380
When you roast it, it's got the handy holder on it.

441
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,860
Like corn.

442
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:28,040
The Noah's Ark movie also showed the Nephilim, the ones who came in bread with the daughters of men,

443
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,200
as looking like the giant bunch of rocks creature left over from Galaxy Quest.

444
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,720
This was not in the Bible, but it was an eye-burning special effect created just for the movie.

445
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,380
You did see the Noah's Ark movie.

446
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,820
Yeah.

447
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,600
With Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly and a million creatures.

448
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,440
I saw it and I forgot it.

449
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,200
It wasn't like the book.

450
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,620
It was not like the book, but it was good.

451
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,500
Well, it had its moments.

452
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,700
You like the George C. Scott version better?

453
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,380
Did you prefer the George C. Scott?

454
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
It's narrated by John Huston, sir.

455
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,080
Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible.

456
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,900
And according to occultists, the next two books.

457
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,100
Did he get royalties for that?

458
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,200
Probably not.

459
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,500
I don't know.

460
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,400
He did not get to go into the Holy Land.

461
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,220
He had to hang around outside at the border there.

462
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,620
He was given a special treat by God.

463
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,620
God allowed Moses to see God's buttocks at the end of Moses' life.

464
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,780
You can look at God's butt.

465
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,280
That's what he got.

466
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,620
Hang here at the edge of paradise.

467
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,860
You can stay there.

468
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,460
That's as close as you're going to get to.

469
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,360
Moses was not allowed to enter into the promised land.

470
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,540
No, he couldn't go in.

471
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,020
He had to.

472
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,280
They made a little gate.

473
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
The Moses Gate.

474
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,960
Where he had to hang outside that gate.

475
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,260
And just look wistfully in between the gate itself.

476
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,600
Into the paradise.

477
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,020
He claimed magic power for himself, supposedly.

478
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,920
That was actually from God.

479
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,980
And so God became Roth, as he would in those days.

480
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,420
He said, no, you can't do that.

481
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,960
After 40 years of leading these arguments.

482
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,060
Plus he struck the rock.

483
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,520
Remember, he struck the rock.

484
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,320
And water came forth.

485
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,620
Yes.

486
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,660
He wasn't supposed to just, you know, say, come forth.

487
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,780
But he actually struck the rock.

488
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,380
And Edward G. Robinson said, yeah, where's your God now, Moses?

489
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,840
Yeah.

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
Yeah, where's your God now?

491
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:34,920
Well, so God, Moses asked of God, could I see you as a result for my lifetime of service?

492
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,820
And God said, no, because my glorious.

493
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,920
You can see my ass.

494
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,100
It burned your face off like what happened to Philo.

495
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,380
Yeah.

496
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,120
The glorious.

497
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,040
The glorious effulgence of God's being would burn and frizzle him like a bug zapper.

498
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,280
But if he waited till God passed and looked at God's hind parts, as it says in the Bible.

499
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
The multitude of hind parts.

500
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,800
So he got to see God's bottom before he died.

501
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,580
The million asses of God.

502
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,240
Yes.

503
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,960
That's astonishing.

504
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,900
That's exactly right.

505
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,940
There's a million different asses.

506
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,180
They had to wait, waiting there for everyone to pass by.

507
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,020
The incalculable manifestation.

508
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,140
The incalculable manifestation of the almighty.

509
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,620
Very interesting that you said that because that is the name of the band that will be playing.

510
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,580
Uh-oh.

511
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,400
The million asses of God.

512
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,720
Yeah.

513
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,280
This is a squirrel mill, or speaking English, a high-speed nut house.

514
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,560
A mill is a hot rod or souped up jalopy, which was once just a car.

515
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,280
A squirrel is a space kid who can't get off the earth, but is always crying.

516
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,720
The making of the universe.

517
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:52,800
The day I left town where the heavenly acerca erase.

518
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:00,760
The day I left town where the раздел remain studying the master of notion and the suffixcence of law.

519
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,500
That girl who booked a notion and ran away, so as was a crystal of anğin who plays theólefgolyokeens,

520

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,980
We'll be right back.

539
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,280
We'll be right back.

540
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,620
We'll be right back.

541
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,140
We'll be right back.

542
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,100
We'll be right back.

543
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,720
We'll be right back.

544
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,900
We'll be right back.

545
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,800
Thanks, Lee Murr,

546
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,480
for that touching ode to

547
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,320
lumbar spondylosis.

548
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,800
And now, let's see what the old

549
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,980
doctors are doing.

550
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,460
What are you doing?

551
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,780
Now let's see,

552
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,880
here's the schedule.

553
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,680
give up the mic.

554
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,440
Today is the day when we forget what day it is.

555
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,200
You've already done that once, Hal.

556
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,700
Totally reserved schedule.

557
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,140
Stay up all night

558
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,800
and upset everyone.

559
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,620
I'm not going to do that. I'm going to go to bed early.

560
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,000
It's intrepid.

561
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,480
Well, if Mike

562
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,540
gets up early,

563
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,520
get up and go off to the parade field

564
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,140
intrepid as all get out.

565
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,440
And greet our alien

566
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,620
masters when they finally descend.

567
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,620
When they gleaming

568
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,740
saucer craft.

569
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,760
Yeah, and we don't want to do it

570
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,120
all bleary-eyed and grumbling

571
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,600
because we had to wake up

572
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,680
or stay up.

573
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,960
So stay up all night then.

574
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,120
No, that's even worse.

575
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,640
Well, you can't.

576
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,180
It's all intrepid and stuff, man.

577
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,480
What are you guys

578
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,940
distracted with now?

579
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,640
I was just trying to figure out what that vibrating

580
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,740
the stage was vibrating. It was actually making your voice

581
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,220
vibrate.

582
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,900
It's vibrating.

583
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,280
Maybe it was

584
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,260
your thing down here.

585
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
That's what was amplifying all that

586
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,540
stuff.

587
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,080
You have

588
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,840
solved the mystery, Shaggy.

589
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,420
How about if you and Scooby go and have a nap?

590
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,580
Scooby snack.

591
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,600
A snack.

592
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,200
Hey, Susie,

593
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,360
you want to come up here and touch my knee?

594
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,340
Want to come up and touch bases?

595
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,280
Somebody get Philo

596
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,840
out of there. That's all I care about.

597
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,560
I don't care what sits in that chair.

598
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,080
As long as it's not Philo.

599
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,420
Yeah, I've been noticing that probably.

600
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,160
Well, see, he's fixing the sound.

601
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,840
He's fixing it.

602
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,120
All right.

603
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,420
Yeah, I'm getting a serious 60 cycle.

604
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:19,700
Huh?

605
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,840
He's fixing it.

606
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,080
All right.

607
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,460
That will actually waver and it will it will knock

608
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,860
spacecraft off course.

609
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,200
The dark phase shifts the sound.

610
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,560
Yeah.

611
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,100
And once again, you can blame the dog.

612
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,240
The dog did it.

613
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,600
The reason why X day is not going to happen tomorrow is because

614
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,340
the dog ate it.

615
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,740
I told those guys to fuck off.

616
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,960
Phylo or Fido, one of the others.

617
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,240
They came to me and said, Hey, are we still on?

618
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,360
I said, fuck off.

619
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,360
And they were like, OK, that's all you know.

620
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,460
Fido just means faithful.

621
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,660
Phylo means love.

622
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,880
Phylo means love.

623
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,380
Yes.

624
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,200
Yeah.

625
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,160
The Fido also means love.

626
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,020
I mean, God backwards is dog faithful.

627
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,680
Loyal.

628
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,920
Leg out.

629
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,320
Yeah.

630
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,460
Say what?

631
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:10,560
Ah.

632
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
2019 is going to be a good year.

633
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,720
Especially effects.

634
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,160
It comes Bob gets it all together.

635
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,300
What, so you think 19 is going to be a good year.

636
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,720
Maybe for some genie, I bet.

637
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Pinks and dwarfs.

638
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,700
No, never.

639
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,620
Do we have every reason to be super?

640
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:48,560
optimistic because I know when Bob smiles I'll ignore bad weather no what

641
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,120
about the dog what about the dog what about the dog he'll pee the floor and it

642
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:03,300

645
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,440
minutes long if we do the whole thing I have to go up to the main stage could

646
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:26,180
tell by you and mom's reaction in the car that we shouldn't do it brown white

647
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,260

excite his glands escaping will surely take the dog you've been sent to the

650
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,780
principal's office yeah see there's one real real funny part in here that has me

651
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,600
in it hey why don't you sell some of my CDs while you're sitting over there

652
00:36:52,600 --> 00:37:00,680
CDs outside the yard I see the varmint he's lost in the text of the opera he's

653
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,900
lost in the libretto

654
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,680
I'm a wicked doggy buddy I'm glad you sure hear me as I'm tearing things up

655
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,880
take a pew take a pew he's got a hymn stang first welcome to the camp we need a

656
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,420
break and I have a cold that's why I sound like this here's the Rudy Schwartz

657
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,200
project with a little ditty called ass and hammer

658
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,300
so

659
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,240
that's pretty good

660
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,440
Thank you.

661
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,720
Thank you.

662
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,840
Thank you.

663
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,820
Thank you.

664
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,100
Onan just now trans-channeled this through his phone.

665
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,200
Some people are just so ready to tell you what to do.

666
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,180
They'll tell you what you did wrong, and they'll correct you.

667
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,780
Well, I'm tired of their co-rectal examinations.

668
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,000
Let me be.

669
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,000
What looks like a screw-up to you might also be a screw-up to me.

670
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,280
But it might also be a carefully contrived art prank,

671
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,780
infinitely delicate and subtle.

672
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,380
And if some pink boy comes hee-hawing in with their

673
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,140
actually to fix it,

674
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,180
then the whole thing's a mess.

675
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,180


676
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,680
Everything is ruined.

677
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,960
Try TriologySoaps.com.

678
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,480
And now we welcome a new member of the subgenius brethren.

679
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,180
I have to say, I believe that your eyebrows should have their own zip code.

680
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,140
Or their own name.

681
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,660
You have your name and your eyebrows, because I find them very awesome.

682
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,780
Thank you, thank you.

683
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,320
I only wish you could have seen my eyelids 20...

684
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,660
Well, my eyelids are there.

685
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,780
The eyelids of mourning.

686
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,520
20 years ago, women would come up to me in bars and say,

687
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,940
I would kill to have your eyelashes.

688
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,860
I'm batting them at the moment, in this.

689
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:43,880
Anyway.

690
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,440
Yeah, but a moth would kill to have your eyebrows.

691
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,600
A moth would kill to have my shirt.

692
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,160
Batting every gentleman.

693
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,180
Oh, I have a subgenius hymn that I worked on long and deep.

694
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:56,840
Let's have it.

695
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,440
That's why Bob's so deaf, yo.

696
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,400
That's why Bob's so gnarly, dude.

697
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,900
That's why Bob's so groovy, man.

698
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,900
That's why Bob's so cool, cat.

699
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,840
That's why Bob's so hep-gate.

700
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,100
Tis why Bob has such virtue, sirrah.

701
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,900
Indequoad Bob, genua dea pibus es meritrice mea.

702
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,260
Bob.

703
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,760
There you go.

704
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,840
Reverend Wat B. Falk, dear friend.

705
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,320
And by the way, the Latin in that meant,

706
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,320
that's why Bob is the knees of bees, my whore.

707
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,180
Whoa.

708
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,480
Thank you.

709
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,400
Yes, he's the bee's knees.

710
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,340
Because everyone is going to be looking that up.

711
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,780
Well, I had to, of course.

712
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,280
Listening to the Hour of Slack, they're going to go,

713
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,160
what did he say?

714
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,800
Oh, okay, good, he just told us.

715
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,300
So now it saved me the time of having to do that.

716
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,580
But that was the internet that told me, so who knows if it's correct.

717
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,400
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

718
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,420
Gentlemen, question mark?

719
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,900
He's the head of that sub-genius church, which means he's super...

720
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,980
I'm glad you answered to Bob's call.

721
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,700
I bet I know why I'm all here.

722
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,480
No, I'm not all here.

723
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,180
My name is Ivan, and I control the trademarks all.

724
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,060
Redacted.

725
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,020
And if you want to copy Bob, you'll have to cut my balls.

726
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,780
So pull down your pants and pull them up.

727
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,620
Pull out your wallet.

728
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,320
You cannot escape our thrall.

729
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,660
Dun, da, da, da, dun.

730
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,600
There's that 60 cycle, hum.

731
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,480
There we go.

732
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,100
There we go.

733
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,080
Finally, somebody's been reading their prescriptions.

734
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,100
We're not going to take it.

735
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,820
That's your line.

736
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,280
Oh, is that?

737
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,540
Okay, then it's something...

738
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,620
Never did and never will.

739
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,800
Don't want no religion.

740
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,700
See, we don't have to change that part.

741
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,400
I wanted to thank you, Reverend Stang.

742
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,700
I'm getting a marvelous placebos off this pill that I took.

743
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,440
I did want to emphasize I'm aware it's a placebo,

744
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,220
so that you're not in any legal trouble.

745
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,700
I mean, dispensed medication without a license on the public.

746
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,920
Did you get your pill?

747
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,800
Yeah, he did.

748
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,420
Oh, okay.

749
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:42,840
He did.

750
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,340
And a wonderful placebos it is.

751
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,060
Okay.

752
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,720
The Placebo Domingo, okay.

753
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,140
Placebos.

754
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,900
Placebos work better than conspiracy medicine.

755
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,680
Did you read the placebos?

756
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,280
Studies have proved it, especially for mental problems.

757
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,840
Placebos.

758
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,440
A placebo works slightly better than antidepressants.

759
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,420
Well, we are well supplied here.

760
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:06,780
Yes.

761
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,760
So, okay.

762
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,780
Placebos.

763
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,260
You know, Princess, we and I thought about sending you the edited tape of a...

764
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,600
It's like we cut...

765
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:27,080
We really did translate all of Tommy, but then we cut it down to 15 minutes of Buddy,

766
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,580
the dog opera.

767
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,340
Okay.

768
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,700
And we thought about...

769
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,280
She wanted to send you the 15 minutes so you could play it while we sang it.

770
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,620
And I was going, let's not do that to him.

771
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,680
Although he may not even know that old record that well.

772
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,340
I don't know.

773
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,740
Well, I do own a record store in the Who.

774
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,480
I've been a Who fan forever.

775
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,720
We used the Live at Leeds version.

776
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,080
Oh, that's even...

777
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,200
That's one of my favorite records.

778
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,580
Yes.

779
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,560
Well, you see, you should have done it, but you...

780
00:43:59,560 --> 00:43:59,720
Yep, see.

781
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,040
Lacked the gumption.

782
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,260
And I've got the 15 minute cut down.

783
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,220
Some of the songs we're saving for my sister to write about the other dog, Claudia.

784
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,100
Gotcha.

785
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,700
I'm the pit bull.

786
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
I'm Claudia.

787
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,460
Or something like that.

788
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:15,840
I don't know.

789
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,260
We'll see.

790
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,180
Wow.

791
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:17,800
Yeah.

792
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,340
We're here.

793
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,960
This is what we have to look forward to.

794
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,080
Somebody likes our song.

795
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,920
Susie's the one who...

796
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,820
I knew somebody would like our Buddy opera.

797
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,320
We love it, actually.

798
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,340
But yeah, look at that.

799
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,200
We got it all worked out.

800
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,860
Pete Dog Send on guitar.

801
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,480
Yeah.

802
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,740
John N. Weiss.

803
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:48,320
Yeah, it's amazing how easily Dog and X-Day worked itself into that whole thing.

804
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,520
It's a boy that can't see or hear.

805
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,680
Well, this is a dog that better not piss and poop.

806
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,460
Yeah, but they all do that.

807
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,500
You're not gonna pee here.

808
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,080
Buddy, can you hear me?

809
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,960
Well, that's when he escapes and you're looking for him.

810
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,240
How can he be trained?

811
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,980
That's awesome.

812
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:08,360
Yeah.

813
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,300
When he has no brain.

814
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,800
Yes.

815
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,620
Buddy, can you hear me?

816
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,780
See me, feed me.

817
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,020
Feed me, feed me.

818
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,940
Pet me, rub me, see me, hear me, spoil me, feed me.

819
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:21,840
Yeah.

820
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,580
Towards the end, he's just saying, feed me.

821
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,780
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

822
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,400
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

823
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,420
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

824
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:27,980
Yeah.

825
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,460
Right.

826
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,680
What is right behind you?

827
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,840
Oh, right behind you.

828
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,280
I smell your butt hole.

829
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,720
I can tell you are in heat.

830
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,140
Heat.

831
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,520
Follow me.

832
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,420
Let me see.

833
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:43,880
Oh, my God.

834
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,080
Yeah, we have it all.

835
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,540
We have it all down.

836
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,320
It's a dog's view of, you know, outside, I smell the varmints.

837
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,440
Outside, I smell the varmints.

838
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:56,900
Outside, I smell the varmints.

839
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:56,900


840
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:56,900


841
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:56,900


842
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:56,900


843
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,160
I'll get my quarry.

844
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,440
Yeah, it's majestic.

845
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:14,280
It's all about peeing, crapping, sniffing, tearing up pillows, digging out from under

846
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,300
the fence, jumping over the fence, ripping the throats of groundhogs.

847
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,020
And mail men.

848
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,080
And mail men.

849
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,380
Yeah, there's all mail men.

850
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,020
Yeah, there's a mail man in there.

851
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,260
And

852
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,080
Oh yeah

853
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,740
The mail carrier

854
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,940
Now see Reverend Angry Larry

855
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,700
Is all wrapped up in the opera

856
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,420
Yeah you should have sent him that disc

857
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,320
Yeah you should have

858
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,560
The pop

859
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,640
Rock

860
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,680
This would have actually been one of those things

861
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,140
To where if you had sent it to me

862
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,020
And Andrew the Impaled

863
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,600
You know we probably could have done

864
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,700
A full on

865
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,720
Well let me put it this way

866
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,280
We had

867
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,480
This suddenly started jumping

868
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,740
Into our heads about two weeks ago

869
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,340
About the same time that

870
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,640
We had to get X Day Ready and Starwood

871
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,760
And then I got those 200 orders

872
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,200
And it was our slack

873
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Our slack was

874
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,620
Okay we have all these things we have to do

875
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,260
We're subgeniuses

876
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,240
Instead let's write a rock opera

877
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,400
And we did

878
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,040
We got all the way through the whole damn thing

879
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,380
And I have a background tape

880
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,760
That we could lip sync to

881
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,400
But we're not

882
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,700
We're not

883
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:23,700


884
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:23,700


885
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,680
We're not

886
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,320
We're not

887
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:25,320


888
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:25,860
It needs work

889
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,740
We need work

890
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,160
We will be able to finally do our duet

891
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,560
Of Geek Acres

892
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,920
When Princess We finally wakes up

893
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,260
From her enchanted slumber

894
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah

895
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,820
Yeah it's

896
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,640
Yeah we did

897
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,420
It's very very carefully thought out

898
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,620
You end up

899
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,280
You cry at the end of it

900
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,340
Of course you do

901
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,760
Well your ears hurt at that point

902
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,160
Yeah

903
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,800
Pee on the bed sheets, chew up the pillows, tearing things up, tearing things up.

904
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,900
I like how you put father and the people that are saying it.

905
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,680
That's me.

906
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,260
Right.

907
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,840
Yeah.

908
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,900
That's what I'm saying.

909
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,080
The owner.

910
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,000
Do you think it's all right to leave the dog while we go shopping?

911
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,580
Do you think it's all right?

912
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,100
He's been a little frisky tonight.

913
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,320
I think it's all right.

914
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,500
I just think it's all right.

915
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,520
Boy, are they wrong.

916
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,200
A harsh stench of human sweat creeps up on me.

917
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,300
All at once a pink mailman I suddenly see.

918
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,660
He smells like a butcher shop viscera pail.

919
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,040
And his stupid sack stuffed all packed full of mail.

920
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,040
Places to play, mailmen to bite, hydrants to pee.

921
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:57,200
Each urination makes a note in my symphony.

922
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,020
And here's the part about me.

923
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,360
His rules are the rules that fuck up all my slack.

924
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,360
Won't let me off leash, won't give me a snack.

925
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,000
He is my warden, my prison guard.

926
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,720
I'll either escape him or bite off his nard.

927
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,260
And then...

928
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,360
Did you ever see the faces of the bobbies?

929
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,520
They get so excited.

930
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,920
Waking up on X Day morning hours before the atmosphere's ignited.

931
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,360
They believe in Bob and all the slack including Connie's generosity.

932
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,600
Peeping in the pond to see what girls look like unclothed in curiosity.

933
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,880
And Buddy doesn't know what X Day is.

934
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,220
He doesn't know who Bob is or what paying is.

935
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,300
And so on.

936
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,360
Feed me, feed me, feed me, feed me.

937
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,880
So we've been through the whole thing.

938
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
That's almost...

939
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,740
The whole thing.

940
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,120
Out of order, but you get the idea.

941
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,380
The work has been done.

942
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,040
So next year, on my escape vessel, you and Andrew...

943
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,560
Yeah, we'll do it.

944
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,900
And Fat Mandy...

945
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,220
Sure.

946
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,640
And that way, I don't have to sing.

947
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,000
The whole stage version with all the...

948
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,060
In other words, you want us to sing it and do the whole thing.

949
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,540
Well, your name will be on the credit.

950
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,000
And Pete Townsend.

951
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,200
Yeah.

952
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:28,160
I had a feeling that you guys would say I was more Oliver Reed than Roger Daltrey.

953
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,480
Okay, well...

954
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,140
Remember the movie of Tommy?

955
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:33,620
Yeah, yeah.

956
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,100
Oliver Reed?

957
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:35,700
Uh-huh.

958
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,300
What were they thinking?

959
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,040
You didn't think that worked well?

960
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,580
No.

961
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,980
He was terrible.

962
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,940
I mean, he's a great werewolf.

963
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,260
He's a good lecher.

964
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,880
He's real good at lots of roles, but...

965
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,140
He's singing.

966
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,380
He's singing.

967
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,960
And they had Jack Nicholson singing in that.

968
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,740
Yeah, that was probably a bad idea, too.

969
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,140
Crazy stuff.

970
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:58,780
Kid stuff.

971
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,620
You know...

972
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,900
That's Ken Russell, man.

973
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,780
Kid stuff.

974
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,320
He was out there.

975
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,300
Ed Wood with a budget.

976
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,380
And now, the Psychoskeletons.

977
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,540
Skeletons.

978
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,720
A tune called Overpass.

979
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,180
Overpass.

980
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,120
Então fricking overpassi.

981
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,120


982
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,120


983
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,700
Thank you.

984
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,220
Thank you.

985
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,680
Thank you.

986
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,900
Take them as needed or as often as necessary.

987
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,240
And Susie chucked one right before us.

988
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,640
How do you feel, Susie?

989
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,200
Good.

990
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,480
She looks very smooth.

991
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,100
Should you take more than one at a time or just do one every 30 seconds?

992
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,360
Well, that's the start.

993
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,980
Work on that.

994
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,320
You'll feel kind of good when you're finished, too.

995
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,840
You'll be able to feel well.

996
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,060
You'll feel pain very well.

997
00:53:53,580 --> 00:54:03,740
You see, the thing about demon worshippers and all that sort of folk is that the stuff written about them is all written by their enemies.

998
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,720
It's a cute sensitivity.

999
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,180
I'm not talking about devil crud.

1000
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,700
Devil crud.

1001
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,780
Satan worshippers, that's another form of Christianity.

1002
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,900
Satan is this Christian character.

1003
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,760
If you're into Satan, you're a fundamentalist Christian.

1004
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,920
I'm worshipped.

1005
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,340
Satan from India.

1006
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,520
Shaitan.

1007
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,640
That's the A-Ram Satan, I believe.

1008
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:35,040
And then there's the Satan of the future, of the far future, Lord Thessidon.

1009
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,160
You probably remember that.

1010
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,560
The sandworms are also called Shaitan.

1011
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,120
The future of Zophique.

1012
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,020
Sandworms.

1013
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,640
I hate them.

1014
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,400
You hate them?

1015
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,920
There was a cult in the U.S. military.

1016
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,360
A demon worshipping cult.

1017
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,480
And they got in trouble.

1018
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,520
But they said that was their own freedom of religion.

1019
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,540
And they defended themselves eloquently.

1020
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,320
What are you doing over there?

1021
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,680
No thanks.

1022
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,080
I can stay for ourselves.

1023
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,940
Well, you know, the reason we didn't get into Sundance with the subgenius documentaries

1024
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,060
is because there was a really good documentary about the Church of Satan.

1025
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,020
And their attempt to put up a statue.

1026
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,720
Sundance people didn't want to have it too Church of things.

1027
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,600
Satan had a bigger name.

1028
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,100
So there you go.

1029
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,320
It's only because he's been around a little longer.

1030
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,520
Well, yeah, sure.

1031
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,220
Well, you're a feat.

1032
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,880
Film festival critics of Sundance.

1033
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,780
Right. They know who he is.

1034
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,800
They think they know.

1035
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,820
Yeah, they think.

1036
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,040
They think they know who Bob is.

1037
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,720
Yeah, but they don't know who Bob is.

1038
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,680
What they know would not clog the foot of the fool.

1039
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,420
It's funny, you know, in that documentary movie, of course,

1040
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,100
Philo and I and the other old-timers said,

1041
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,100


1042
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,580
we just have to do the usual,

1043
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,160
oh, it's just like Mad Magazine, officer.

1044
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,640
It's just a joke.

1045
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,780
We're a satire, a mirror of society's defects.

1046
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:02,900
That's all.

1047
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,200
You know, it's just a takeoff.

1048
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,820
Now, of course, we have to do that in order just to survive.

1049
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,960
But the important thing is,

1050
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,360
plain ordinary audiences that watch that movie

1051
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,280
at these film festival premieres, people have never heard of Bob,

1052
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,800
they come away.

1053
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,140
They go and praise Bob.

1054
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,000
And it's, I mean, it does a really good job.

1055
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:31,380
It's a much better subgenius recruitment film than Arise is,

1056
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,100
because Arise only appeals to people who are already saved.

1057
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,800
Whereas this thing explains to them.

1058
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,780
What a relief that was,

1059
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,520
that this movie does not only claim that we're still active

1060
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,260
and not moribund, something that ended in the 80s,

1061
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,080
but they bring it forward and connect it to today's intellectual and political

1062
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:51,520
landscape.

1063
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,080
So all my reservations about the film have vanished,

1064
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,260
and I will enthusiastically promote it.

1065
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,480
Well, before I was ready to denounce it,

1066
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,080
I thought it was going to be this terrible thing that was totally distorted.

1067
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,220
That's because you've never edited five feature length documentaries, Dr. Howell.

1068
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,820
The documentaries usually end up making themselves.

1069
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,120
Because of all the great stuff you've got in the can.

1070
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,080
Because you only have so much good footage.

1071
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,180
And, yeah, it's funny, we were so afraid that she,

1072
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,040
that Sandy was going to turn it into a Connie-ite film.

1073
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,400
A Namby Pamby.

1074
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,260
She was like possessed with that.

1075
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,780
But Connie is never mentioned in the whole film.

1076
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,760
At no point.

1077
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,820
She wanted to.

1078
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,360
She wanted Connie on the poster, even.

1079
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:45,020
Well, that was before her wisely hired editor

1080
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,360
and wisely hired writer and other people kind of,

1081
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,420
like, here's how it works.

1082
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,460
Lewis Black actually said,

1083
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,740
now, Sandy, you know, nobody gives a shit about Connie.

1084
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,000
It's all Bob.

1085
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,040
No offense, Connie, but, you know, let's face it.

1086
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,640
I told her, I had to say, you know, Sandy, to tell the truth,

1087
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,760
we've sold Connie products, but nobody ever buys any of them.

1088
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:15,560
And, in fact, they just like the straight black and white old-time Bob.

1089
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,180
They don't even buy color Bobs.

1090
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,740
Yes, they're retro in every way.

1091
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,700
It's like a behind the curve, helpless, hopeless.

1092
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,580
But there is hope at subgenius.com.

1093
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:32,040
In fact, that's also part of my email, stang at subgenius.com.

1094
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,580
But here's the important part.

1095
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,740
Now you listen to this.

1096
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,900
Can I still have my dog?

1097
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,200
No.

1098
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,600
Oh, no, please.

1099
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:55,560
Hey, Bob.

1100
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,880
I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education.

1101
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:06,800
For the children.

1102
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,520
Teletubby.

1103
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,740
You get 152 hits.

1104
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,500
It may sound silly to you, but...

1105
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,020
Something bothering you, boy?

1106
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,380
Nuclear jet.

1107
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,960
Oh, God.

1108
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,360
Oh, OK.

1109
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:57,880
When I take it, this place, this Maple Street, is not unique by no means.

1110
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,860
The End

1111
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:02,860


1112
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:02,940
You

1113
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,400
