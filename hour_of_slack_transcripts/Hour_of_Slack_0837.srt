1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
They should all drown in lakes of blood.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,080
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,080
Now they will learn why they fear the night.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,800
Our...

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,060
Slash...

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,040
Friends! I wanna hear a praise for the hog!

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,460
I wanna hear a praise for the damn hog!

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,060
I wanna hear a damn praise for the god hog!

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,580
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,240
What are you?

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,080
What are you?

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,380
Stop it!

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,380
Come on!

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,020
My research!

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:41,980
Research!

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,200
You call fooling around with superstitions and voodoo rights research?

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,480
Well, it's a cult. We have to do this.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,000
But the work I'm doing is very important.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,620
Look, they're over the bridge now. They're on the other side of the...

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,100
Get down!

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,940
Oh, darn.

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,580
Doctor!

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,300
Well, that couldn't be avoided.

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,660
He just wiggled around and...

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,380
Oh, I see.

26
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,760
All right.

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
That'll work. That'll work. We'll just use that scene then.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,620
...to alarm them. Tie him down securely.

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,380
Doctor!

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,420
Here he is.

31
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:08,880
Your friend!

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,460
Quickly!

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,500
Oh!

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,540
I guess when the doctor begins to lose faith when he's...

35
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,180
I think he's leaning on his computer. I mean, his keyboard.

36
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,680
Forever.

37
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,080
Forever?

38
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,760
I'd like to try it.

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,820
That's a heck of a moment, huh?

40
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,240
You know, Doc...

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,900
He says he wants to listen to the show forever?

42
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,200
I made an amazing scientific discovery in this laboratory of yours.

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,620
Looks like he's coming around.

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,060
All right. All right.

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,600
It's Ivan Stang. We're resuscitating Ivan Stang now.

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,020
There's only one way to go.

47
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,100
He's over.

48
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,780
He's stabbing...

49
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,200
I just stabbed a scalpel into his...

50
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,520
That's just a stupid superstition.

51
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,380
No, no, no. You're a real guy. Come on.

52
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:41,900
Yes, you are right.

53
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,200
Come on. Come on. Come on, Ivan. You can do it.

54
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,740
Come on. Come on. Come on.

55
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,320
There's a queen of UFOs. She's outside trying to get in the studio.

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,980
Come on, Ivan. Come on.

57
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,760
Come on. Come on.

58
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
We're attaching the... Okay.

59
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,760
There we go.

60
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,180
I thought you were having a flashback or a daydream.

61
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,020
You're having a deja vu or something.

62
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,560
Your thumb is all the way in your eye.

63
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,700
Look at him. He's so pensive.

64
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,300
It's so a flashback.

65
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,080
Andrew the Impale could do that.

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
Oh, man.

67
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,460
Thumb all the way up into the sinus cavities.

68
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:08,960
Don't worry about me.

69
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
He's tugging on his goatee now.

70
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,540
And he just pulled off the old Aurora.

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,240
I had a piece of spinach up there in my sinus.

72
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
I had to get it out.

73
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,300
So disgusting.

74
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,920
He's not kidding.

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,240
I had to wipe off the inside of his glasses.

76
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,600
Now the feces are building up.

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,540
I'm not...

78
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,160
This is...

79
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm not sure what the spinach that is.

80
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,560
...the concepts we express here.

81
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,240
And I think most of the people in these short, short live tape programs we present aboard

82
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,940
Sibian Broadcasting Neck...

83
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,620
Sib...

84
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,080
Sib...

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Sibian...

86
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,060
Neck...

87
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,060


88
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,140
Neckworks.

89
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,220
I have to remember to say that right.

90
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,180
The Sibian Neckwork is proud to present...

91
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,520
Sib...

92
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,100
Sib...

93
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,360
Sib...

94
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,000
Sib...

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,280
Sib...

96
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,020
Sib...

97
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,120
Sib...

98
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,660
Sib...

99
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,060
Sib...

100
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,660
Sib...

101
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,520
Sib...

102
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,120
Sib...

103
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,640
Sib...

104
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,740
Sib...

105
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,080
Sib...

106
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,020
It's what...

107
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,760
Blood...

108
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,840
S...

109
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,140
S...

110
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,420
S...

111
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,460
S...

112
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,560
S...

113
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,660
S...

114
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:04,860
S...

115
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,160
S...

116
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,140
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this

117
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,120
brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

118
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

119
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,320
This is Reverend Ivan Stagg and I'm afraid that our time has already run out, because,

120
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,060
friends, a minute of slack is aaaall of slack.

121
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,160
So, I'll see you next time.

122
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
the conspiracy is going to give you.

123
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,980
That's right.

124
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
In this world, you'll get a minute of slack

125
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,620
and almost 24 hours of false slack.

126
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,020
And how do you know the difference?

127
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,640
Because friends, the real slack is free,

128
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,760
even if it isn't always legal.

129
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,580
So it's sad that we only have one minute,

130
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,580
but it balances out in one great religious urge,

131
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,740
one great religious evacuation of the senses.

132
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,080
And I would recommend reading

133
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
Prescription 1714 and 3691.

134
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,240
And friends, we need blankets and contraceptives

135
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
for those boys and girls

136
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
in the home for slackless children.

137
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,500
Your contributions also keep those we hate

138
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,480
starving to death.

139
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,920
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge

140
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,780
of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap,

141
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,720
as this will buy so much for those poor children.

142
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,180
Bob Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed faith,

143
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,100
and now our announcer won't give you

144
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,080
the mailing address of the Church of the Subgenius.

145
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,960
Thank you, and let there be slack.

146
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,140
Reminds me of a, uh,

147
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,900
false,

148
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,780
real,

149
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,960
flying along here with us now,

150
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,220
early in the morning,

151
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,980
on a happy,

152
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,120
happy,

153
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,620
sort of,

154
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,820
new political wind.

155
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm all there.

156
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,100
I'm all for it.

157
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,140
Yeah, we're all over it.

158
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,580
I'm, um,

159
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,900
at lockstep.

160
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,980
I'm right with you.

161
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,620
Yeah, the Homeland Security people will, uh,

162
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,460
be by in the morning.

163
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,360
And they'll check out your house and your life, and...

164
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Can you...

165
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
I do not want to check out my house.

166
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
FM radio waves to me?

167
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,040
They have to check out everything.

168
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,640
Yeah, we use all radio waves.

169
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,640
But can you explain how they work?

170
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,580
How radio waves work?

171
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,080
Yes.

172
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes.

173
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,060
We have the overman here tonight.

174
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,160
Tough question.

175
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,280
Yeah, Philo Drummond,

176
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,360
who in a moment after being, uh,

177
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,180
in the...

178
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,800
You can hear the conference in the background.

179
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,580
What do you think, you know,

180
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,060
is that...

181
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,320
We'll explain that.

182
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,980
How does radio work?

183
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,660
Dr. Drummond,

184
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,120
we have, uh,

185
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,260
a young lady who wanted to know about

186
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,940
how, uh,

187
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,960
radio waves work.

188
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,260
So do you have, like,

189
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,060
or do we have...

190
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,000
You've got headphones on?

191
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,840
Yeah, you can know.

192
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,280
Radio waves.

193
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
I do have headphones on.

194
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,100
Radio waves.

195
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,840
Okay, yeah.

196
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,280
Radio waves.

197
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,220
Well, they just...

198
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,220
I am the show.

199
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,280
They're these little things.

200
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,660
They sort of float out there.

201
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,500
They've got, like,

202
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,980
little tentacles on them

203
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,400
that kind of hang in space

204
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,780
but have, uh,

205
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,000
their own modified cilia

206
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,420
that are constantly flowing in the breeze.

207
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,100
And as the breeze passes by,

208
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,540
the cilia, uh,

209
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,460
sort of undulates.

210
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,240
They drive the organism,

211
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,640
the sound wave,

212
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,140
uh,

213
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,700
on its, uh,

214
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,420
journey to your ears.

215
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,480
Does that help?

216
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,600
It helps.

217
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,080
And this music always plays

218
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,600
when radio waves are...

219
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:09,780
You know,

220
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,700
even if you're listening

221
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,940
to a discussion show

222
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,780
about atomic waste,

223
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,040
this music would be playing

224
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,480
in the background.

225
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,160
You just can't hear it.

226
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,120
But music like this

227
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,780
is always controlling

228
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,860
your emotional reaction.

229
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,360
That's true.

230
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,660
Music like this, uh,

231
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,760
is hanging around

232
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,900
along with the radio waves.

233
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,640
Or music like this.

234
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


235
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,640
Radio waves have an affinity

236
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,860
for music like this.

237
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,220
They just kind of hang together

238
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,260
in a symbiotic relationship.

239
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,420
There were a few producers

240
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,720
who were involved

241
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,120
with the kind of, uh,

242
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,480
underworld.

243
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,300
But then,

244
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,760
if you do it,

245
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,700
if you accept, uh,

246
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,840
the money from them,

247
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,560
you must be ready

248
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,340
for the guns as well.

249
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,160
Well, you accept it, uh,

250
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,660
you accept it for what it is.

251
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,460
It could be money,

252
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,240
it could be guns,

253
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,240
or it could be butter.

254
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,840
You know, depending on your,

255
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,760
your state.

256
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,640
And, uh,

257
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


258
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,180
the state that you're in.

259
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,340
So, if you...

260
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,060
You know, I want to get back

261
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,740
to some of the magic

262
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,480
about Pangea and, uh,

263
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,620
Lemuria and Mondana.

264
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,300
Oh, yeah, back in the old days.

265
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,460
The old, when we were

266
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,960
just hanging out.

267
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,600
The old ways.

268
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,660
Because I've seen, uh,

269
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,680
video from that time.

270
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,920
Yeah, we were like

271
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,080
just a pack of amoebas,

272
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,380
you know, like running wild.

273
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,880
Hanging around.

274
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,660
It's like,

275
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,340
let's extend our protoplasm

276
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,420
over into that area

277
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,880
for a while.

278
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,700
Wild zygotes.

279
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,880
You know, the next thing

280
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,800
we know, there was like,

281
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,860
I had a twin there.

282
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,260
Looked just like me.

283
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,860
And, you know,

284
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,380
like, what's going on here?

285
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,220
So, we started hanging

286
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,460
around together for a while.

287
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,300
Next thing we knew,

288
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,980
we were like a

289
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,500
symbiotic organism

290
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,220
of individual cells

291
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,440
that was all together

292
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,780
with their own, uh,

293
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,820
their own collective purpose.

294
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,280
Slathering and slithering

295
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,120
until one day

296
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,260
we had a flagella.

297
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,040
And we stuck the flagella out

298
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,020
and started manipulating

299
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,080
our environment.

300
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,160
We decided, you know,

301
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,060
maybe we should,

302
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,840
maybe we should think about it.

303
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,320
We should leave this, you know,

304
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,040
crawling out into that

305
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,760
other atmosphere.

306
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,540
You know, we should leave this

307
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,300
sweaty, liquid environment

308
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,520
and move beyond it

309
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,520
and move over into that dry area.

310
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,220
Of course, we'd need some legs.

311
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
We need to, we need to

312
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,600


313
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,580
Looks like a ghost town.

314
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,900
No, it does look like a ghost town.

315
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,360
It's too new.

316
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,900
So, we did.

317
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,860
And there we are.

318
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,760
And so, that's how it happened.

319
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay.

320
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,480
Any, any more, uh,

321
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,100
to help you with any other questions?

322
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,560
Well, there's a bad ball,

323
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,320
but there's a good ball.

324
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,400
There's a real ball,

325
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,720
but there's a pseudo ball.

326
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,120
You better watch out.

327
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,560
Better watch out.

328
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,900
Better watch out.

329
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,420
All the roads you'll know.

330
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,540
Attention, all biotech personnel.

331
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,040
This is a biohazard alert.

332
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,740
Until further notice,

333
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,280
containment protocols are in effect.

334
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,720
Bob!

335
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,160
Bob!

336
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,420
Bobby!

337
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
Dana, what's going on?

338
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,780
Sheriff Morse, they locked the doors.

339
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,540
Bob's inside.

340
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,500
Why lock the doors?

341
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,740
I don't know.

342
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
Who else is in there?

343
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,460
Just about everybody, I guess.

344
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm sorry.

345
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,560
Bob!

346
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,060
Bob!

347
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,680
I found the problem,

348
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,100
and there is no biohazard.

349
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,140
It was a false alarm.

350
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,660
You can unlock the doors

351
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,640
and let everyone go home.

352
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,300
This is a non-biotech problem.

353
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


354
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


355
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


356
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


357
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


358
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


359
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


360
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


361
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


362
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,300


363
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,260
This is a non-event event.

364
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,600
And do you know what happened?

365
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,640
Again.

366
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,780
And do you know what happened?

367
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,040
Again, that big, bad, ferocious

368
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,960
world of the future!

369
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,720
Follow me!

370
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,400
All the signs point to serious health damage.

371
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,760
There are no winners in a nuclear war.

372
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,760
The minute you have another war,

373
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,680
there's not going to be any world left,

374
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,240
I don't think.

375
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,280
Because we're going to blow one another's faces.

376
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
Because in this day and time,

377
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,640
we don't know what we're going to come to.

378
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,100
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

379
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,700
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

380
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,980
And we're all going to end up

381
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,940
digging our own holes.

382
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,360
And as soon as we dig them,

383
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,340
they're going to fall in on us.

384
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,260
I don't think anybody would know what to do.

385
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,180
Even possibly the president.

386
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,580
The only true religion is guns!

387
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,560
I would listen to television and watch it.

388
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,840
And I would confess,

389
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,420
and Cinderella lives.

390
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,460
Happily ever after?

391
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,060
Yes.

392
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,460
How did you know?

393
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,420
Because good little girls like Cinderella

394
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,600
always live happily ever after.

395
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,100
I like to be in America.

396
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,060
Okay by me in America.

397
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,560
Everything free in America.

398
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,700
For us most, be in America.

399
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, America.

400
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay, world.

401
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,180
You are violent.

402
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,880
You are pushing all this murder on us.

403
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,900
So here it comes right back at you.

404
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,660
And we'll use murder to sell deodorant.

405
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,400
So that you'll just get bored with murder.

406
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,320
Right?

407
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,940
Say that last week.

408
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,160
I can smell those...

409
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Am I hallucinating the echo?

410
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,680
I can smell those hellish teeth.

411
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,300
No, you did.

412
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,840
And it's true.

413
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,300
Those hellish teeth are ready to snap around all our orifices

414
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,820
and gobble us up and spit us out.

415
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,800
The end is nigh or near.

416
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,400
Whichever, you know, you choose.

417
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,060
You know, I had been thinking,

418
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
oh, well, I'm up here in Ohio.

419
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm safe.

420
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,900
Everything's cool here.

421
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
They're not warlike.

422
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,260
Ohio is...

423
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,940
It was an Ohio National Guard guy

424
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,000
that zapped those Canadians.

425
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,660
Yeah, boy, did I have another thing coming.

426
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,740
Who was it?

427
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,120
That figures.

428
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,820
It was probably a Texas guy, really.

429
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,200
Yee-haw!

430
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,240
Probably a Cleveland State student.

431
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
Yeah, probably a Cleveland State guy.

432
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,680
I could get a medal for this.

433
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,020
And then everybody would like me in Cleveland.

434
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,960
Everybody in Cleveland hates you now,

435
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,840
especially those people from Windsor, you know,

436
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,680
they hate you a lot.

437
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,940
And they're starting to reexamine their prosthetic devices,

438
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,160
or I mean their prostology.

439
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,180
The Canadians are starting to reexamine,

440
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,140
hey, any time they say get a gun and we jump in there,

441
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,800
why don't we do something different, et cetera?

442
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,800
Well...

443
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,220
No.

444
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,440
War is heck.

445
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,180
Yes, that's right.

446
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,000
War is heck.

447
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
And, uh...

448
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,960
Here, here's a guy who knows General Katahdin.

449
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:13,980
Yeah.

450
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,380
You are correct.

451
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,020
The Mexicans, the Canadians,

452
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,940
their days of thinking,

453
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,040
finger-banging Mary Jane Rottenkrotch

454
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,120
through her pretty pink panties

455
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,940
are over!

456
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,380
Over!

457
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,100
Join the Lake County Coast Watchers'

458
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,380
guard against Canadian attack.

459
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,380
Yeah, we got us a militia watch there.

460
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,460
We better watch it tonight.

461
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,820
The Canadians are about to...

462
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,060
This is my church.

463
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,880
There are many others like it,

464
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,980
but this one is mine.

465
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,740
Mm-hmm.

466
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,940
Yeah.

467
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,060
The line is a never-locked-in embrace.

468
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,040
You won't get it till it's in your face.

469
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,480
Oh, get me out of deep red.

470
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,640
Go back.

471
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,840
Die!

472
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,560
In the night!

473
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:58,860
In the night!

474
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,680
That's where I wanna be.

475
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
Die!

476
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,280
Yeah!

477
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,120
No, die!

478
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,860
Die!

479
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,160
A useful member of society.

480
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,620
Die!

481
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,380
In the...

482
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,920
I just need a little love that only

483
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,020
makes me feel good.

484
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


485
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


486
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


487
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


488
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


489
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


490
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


491
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


492
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,520
money

493
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah

494
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,800
I can't

495
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,900
shake it off of my back

496
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,480
God damn

497
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,200
thank you

498
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,760
It's too tight

499
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
It's too tight

500
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
Yeah

501
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Some things

502
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,760
never change

503
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,060
Price of bullets

504
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,340
remains the same

505
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,460
And here we go

506
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,460
Hand over this

507
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,360
Slap on the wrist

508
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,980
Nine

509
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,220
Nine

510
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,820
Nine

511
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,300
That's all I'm asking for

512
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,760
How much

513
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,240
How much

514
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,960
do you wanna give

515
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,220
Give a give a

516
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah

517
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,400
It's just a little bit

518
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
Give a

519
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,240
Nine

520
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,980
Give a give a

521
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,500
Yeah

522
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,040
They operate

523
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,520
So that's the state of the

524
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,800
thing

525
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,760
Well

526
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,840
That's what you grab

527
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,380
Give a

528
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,960
Nine

529
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,900
Give a

530
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,300
Nine

531
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,520
Nine

532
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,300
Nine

533
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,920
Nine

534
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,680
God bless America

535
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,440
Lillian

536
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
I love them all

537
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,860
Set aside

538
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,940
I don't want to die

539
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:14,940


540
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:14,940


541
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:14,940


542
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:14,940


543
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,040
And I've got her

544
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,380
Her son

545
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,240
I love

546
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,700
I thought the bomb

547
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,960
Yeah

548
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
Yeah you come down here

549
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,380
and mess with us

550
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,120
You're gonna burn

551
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,640
for sure

552
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,400
Yeah that's what

553
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,040
they used to say

554
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,700
Why don't we just

555
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,240
you know I mean

556
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,380
Bush said

557
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,460
if you're not with us

558
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,260
you're against us

559
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
and he is proving it

560
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,160
even if you're with us

561
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,520
you're

562
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,440
we're gonna

563
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,080
we're gonna be

564
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,340
uh

565
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,520
Yeah even if you're with us

566
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,640
we're against you

567
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,680
We've got a gun

568
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,700
at your back

569
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,780
at all times.

570
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
That's a new strategy.

571
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,540
Even if you're with us,

572
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,400
we're against you.

573
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,740
Yeah.

574
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,900
And that goes for American citizens, too.

575
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,940
They're killing us,

576
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,320
and they have guns pointed at us all the time.

577
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,840
That's been going on for a long time.

578
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,560
It's not political megalomania.

579
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,000
You've got to learn how to live.

580
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,920
It's the 21st century, baby.

581
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm not freaking out.

582
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,480
I'm okay with it.

583
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm not advocating any kind of argument

584
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,460
or in any way.

585
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,260
Any seditious or treasonous

586
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,980
or even complaining.

587
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,840
I wouldn't gripe about the government.

588
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,700
We're proud to be owned in a free country.

589
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,940
We accept the yoke.

590
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,320
The security is...

591
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
The lack of security

592
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,080
was due to too much freedom

593
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,420
and abuse of the freedoms

594
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,400
we, our forefathers, fought for.

595
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
The yoke is soft and warm.

596
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,380
We must earn back

597
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,700
the rights of freedom of speech

598
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,500
and gun ownership and things like that.

599
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,100
Those are old-fashioned things.

600
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,580
We have to prove we're responsible enough.

601
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,340
Every child is a village,

602
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,860
and the government is your friend.

603
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,940
That 25-pound pack is your yoke.

604
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,380
That gun is your yoke,

605
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,480
and you are the egg,

606
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,740
and you're ready to get pumped.

607
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,720
Look at them little canucks down there.

608
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
This is your brain on a frying pan.

609
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,840
The Rainmaker

610
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,960
came to town

611
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,360
and the people got what they wanted.

612
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,440
The Rainmaker

613
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,560
came to town

614
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,620
and everybody got what they need.

615
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,040
Hey, hey, hey!

616
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,600
Well, the people wanted power

617
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,720
and reputation galore.

618
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,300
So they became a bunch of bullies

619
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,040
in the assorted sizes war.

620
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,300
And they sailed around the global block

621
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,600
looking for some heads to knock.

622
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,400
And most of them came home heroes,

623
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,120
heroes in a box.

624
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,220
And the Rainmaker came to town

625
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,620
and the people got what they wanted.

626
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,820
The Rainmaker came to town

627
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,940
and everybody got what they need.

628
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,520
The Rain came falling down

629
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,720
cats and dogs and buckets.

630
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,640
And the Rainmaker sailed away

631
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,500
on a flood of relief.

632
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
Hey, hey, hey!

633
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,860
Well, the people wanted beauty

634
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,160
and prettiness and all.

635
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,560
So they stretched and they dressed

636
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,640
and they made up

637
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,520
and put mirrors on every wall.

638
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,280
Till they all went blind from ice cream

639
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,060
from the thing they wanted most.

640
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,300
Now everybody's so isolated.

641
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,200
A good-looking bunch of ghosts.

642
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,100
And the Rainmaker came

643
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,640
to town

644
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,100
and the people got what they wanted.

645
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,260
The Rainmaker came to town

646
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,380
and everybody got what they need.

647
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,980
The Rain came falling down

648
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,240
cats and dogs and buckets.

649
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,120
And the Rainmaker sailed away

650
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,040
on a flood of relief.

651
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,000
Hey, hey, hey!

652
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,880
Well, the women just wanted their food to keep.

653
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,100
Instant potatoes and rubber meat.

654
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,240
The kids just wanted to watch TV.

655
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Now the girls can't spell

656
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,900
and the boys can't read.

657
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,920
The men just wanted a steady job.

658
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,480
Now they got to pay the union mob.

659
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,540
And everybody wanted to be free.

660
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Laws and rules should keep it that way.

661
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,980
Hey, hey, hey!

662
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,060
Hey, hey, hey!

663
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,440
Hey, hey, hey!

664
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,580
Hey, hey, hey!

665
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,720
Well, everybody wants to be happy.

666
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,820
Everybody wants to be warm.

667
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,560
And be loved and liked and wanted.

668
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,580
And have some kind of home.

669
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,020
But getting it is work.

670
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,180
And keeping it is tough.

671
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
But destroying it's the easiest.

672
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,660
And the rainmaker came to town.

673
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,000
And the people got what they wanted.

674
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,180
The Rainmaker came to town.

675
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,260
And everybody got what they need.

676
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
The Rain came falling down.

677
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,100
Cats and dogs and buckets.

678
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,040
And the Rainmaker sailed away

679
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,940
on a flood of relief.

680
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,940
Hey, hey, hey!

681
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:08,940


682
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:08,940


683
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,160
A flood of relief.

684
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,220
Now sail away.

685
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,720
Sail away.

686
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,420
And the Rainmaker came to town.

687
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,760
What is anybody going to do about any of it?

688
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,920
Well, the first thing we'd like you to do here at Camp Slaughter is put your hands on your feet.

689
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,040
Put your hands behind your back for the manacles and chains.

690
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,720
How long before we start seeing the images of Canadians protesting in the streets and burning effigies of George Bush?

691
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,300
Well, they're already burning effigies of George Bush.

692
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,760
Well, how long before we see them is the question.

693
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,040
There's somebody seeing them right now, I'm sure.

694
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,260
Seeing the Canadians? They do have invisibility powers, which is one of the reasons we had to slaughter them.

695
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,920
The jump had to be ours. We had to get the tech first.

696
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,720
So if they're invisible, they could be in this room right now.

697
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,120
They could be outside waiting for us with their Mountie hats.

698
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,640
Oh, man.

699
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,820
Oh, man.

700
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,900
Oh, man. The stars.

701
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,220
Where's my goat?

702
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,820
Ah, you in the tub.

703
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,140
Where am I?

704
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,800
Is this Afghanistan?

705
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,060
Oh, no, man. No.

706
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,000
Ah, is it Iran?

707
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,820
No, man. This is the Marines.

708
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,980
Marines? Move over.

709
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,980
Oh, oh, oh.

710
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,120
I really like the way you wear your towel on your head.

711
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,320
Put your hands on me. I live here, man. Leave me alone.

712
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,040
Hey, Dad, I quit the band again.

713
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
Got any lutes?

714
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,960
No, just paint the house, okay?

715
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,760
Oh, come on.

716
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,280
Dear animals!

717
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,640
Oh, come on.

718
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,820
Okay.

719
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,040
Everybody out of the hot tub. There's gonna be a nuclear war.

720
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,720
Oh, did he say it was too hot in the hot tub, man?

721
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,620
Oh, I think he said everybody out of the icebox.

722
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,180
Oh.

723
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,440
Is this beer?

724
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,340
Oh, no. That's seaweed shampoo, man.

725
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,280
I don't believe this. Did you say nuclear war?

726
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,380
You got it.

727
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,280
We'll be boiled like sausages with ice.

728
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,360
Hey, look. There's no time left. We're gonna have to do it the Navy way.

729
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,700
Wrap the towels around your head so you won't be blinded by the blast.

730
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,800
Oh, that's hot. I'm gonna be nuked to death. That's what I'm gonna do.

731
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,560
Then all I've got on is Pam Jergensen's extra towel.

732
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,080
Hey, don't you dipsticks get it? They're gonna take us in a ball. I mean, this is Ground Zero, heroes.

733
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,400
Hey, don't any of you duds want to escape?

734
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,100
Escape? Oh, man. If this isn't escape, what is?

735
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,620
Really?

736
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,140
For sure.

737
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,280
Whatever.

738
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,780
The Fire Sign Theater, dear friends, from Fighting Couch.

739
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,780
That's like a ten-year-old album, believe it or not.

740
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:22,820
Before that, lots of Einstein's Secret Orchestra ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB in Cleveland with Professor Chaz and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

741
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,280
And yours truly, Princess Wee.

742
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:34,920
And we also heard lots of bits and pieces from Media Barrage Number Five, the old subgenius type.

743
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,440
Being remixed in progress.

744
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:49,760
And bits and pieces of puzzling evidence and Dr. Philodruman from KPFA in Berkeley, the subgenius show that's been on for 18 million years.

745
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,700
And there's more coming up, dear friends.

746
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,940
Including Hale Pope Huey, Dr. LeCume, Dr. Lémure and Leibach.

747
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,140
And Glass Madness and m-m-m-more.

748
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,100
Einstein's Secret Orchestra at Crazy.

749
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:12,440
crazy stuff from that wonderful news group called alt.binaries.slack.

750
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,320
Thank you.

751
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,380
If you would like to become a member of the Canadian Armed Forces

752
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,420
and serve your queen, whoever she might be, and your country poundly,

753
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,020
please step through this magnetic door.

754
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,080
Pew, pew, pew.

755
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,200
There's the bohunks.

756
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,700
There's the nornax.

757
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,600
There's the hate-boing-boing-dingers.

758
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,700
There's the hate-date-boing-boing-dingers.

759
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,720
Go on back to your frozen wasteland and leave the fight to us, you pussies.

760
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,060
You know, if they were serious about the war on terrorism,

761
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,880
wouldn't they have sent more troops in there immediately?

762
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,200
Yeah, well, that's true of everybody.

763
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,620
Who's?

764
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,840
Well, I mean, who's been in there getting their butts shot up?

765
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,760
The Northern Alliance.

766
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I mean, the Americans.

767
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,020
Good afternoon.

768
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,760
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes

769
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
against our staunch friend, Canada,

770
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,060
more than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across the...

771
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,020
Codini is a mystic seer.

772
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Mystic Codini.

773
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,140
Codini.

774
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
Dr. Codini.

775
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,340
All hail Dr. Codini.

776
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,000
For he is a...

777
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,160
Mystic seer of future events.

778
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,900
Listen to this thing he made...

779
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,200
Good afternoon.

780
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,180
...two months ago.

781
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,880
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes

782
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,200
against our staunch friend, Great Britain,

783
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,920
Australia, Germany, and France, Canada,

784
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,300
more than 40 countries in the Middle East.

785
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,380
He just got the order wrong, that's all.

786
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,020
They killed Flipper.

787
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,860
Great Britain's next.

788
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,500
Australia.

789
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,280
They killed that little white dog with the brown spot on his eye.

790
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,960
And then they killed everybody in the whole town.

791
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Well, the people in Canada are queen worshippers, too, aren't they?

792
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
Aren't they idolaters?

793
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,120
Yeah.

794
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,840
They're a bunch of monogamous quips.

795
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
They worship the mother instead of the son of...

796
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,300
The king of...

797
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
The son of God.

798
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,640
Yeah, man.

799
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,620
Think of it that way.

800
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,280
And you spend a long time thinking over the...

801
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,560
See what happens to your eyeball.

802
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,760
And their women are real loose, too.

803
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,880
And they don't have...

804
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,980
That's why they deserve it.

805
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,620
They have loose women morals.

806
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,320
Yeah, their limbs are all like...

807
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,920
Their women are morally loose.

808
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,040
Like when they're off at their lives.

809
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,080
Yeah.

810
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,520
Their limbs go...

811
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,220
Don't they have some kind of prime ministers or parliaments or something like...

812
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,260
And he talks much like this.

813
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,820
The prime minister of Canada.

814
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,740
I am deeply regretful of the incidents which happened today.

815
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,080
And their minorities speak French.

816
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,940
What kind of a minority speaks French?

817
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,480
I know.

818
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,660
That doesn't make any sense.

819
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,900
An Asian minority.

820
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,900
If you're speaking French, you're supposed to be in the majority over somebody else.

821
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,220
If you're any kind of a real Frenchman.

822
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,980
Well, is there?

823
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,900
I mean, give...

824
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,580
You're not supposed to be playing hockey.

825
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,320
You're not supposed to...

826
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,120
But they're not Frenchmen, right?

827
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,660
They're Canadians.

828
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,280
So...

829
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,540
So they don't say...

830
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,240
We're all targets now, man.

831
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,820
We're all targets now.

832
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,420
Everybody.

833
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,340
I'd be careful next time I went on the RTA, man.

834
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,320
I'd be careful.

835
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,600
Well, this signal skips right over the lake.

836
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,000
The Canadians can hear us.

837
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
We're targets of them.

838
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,020
Borders are shut down tonight.

839
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,440
In...

840
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,940
Really?

841
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,380
Yeah.

842
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
In memory of George Bush.

843
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,160
Oh, George is doing a lockdown now.

844
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,920
We're on the...

845
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,660
Lockdown of Canadians?

846
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,140
Canadian border?

847
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,220
Yeah.

848
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,560
Didn't they close the internet, too?

849
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,180
And...

850
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,240
But Bush declared that MP3 pirates were terrorists.

851
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,060
Yeah.

852
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,560
I mean, you know, people who download stuff from those Napster-like things.

853
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,480
Yeah, Grokster.

854
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,880
Yeah, that's terrorism now.

855
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,960
They have synthesized some of these psychotic genes in his head now.

856
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Dope smokers.

857
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,480
Oh, that was...

858
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,380
Definitely terrorists.

859
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,360
And, you know, I see those commercials.

860
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,180
David Lockdown for weeks now.

861
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,980
Buy American.

862
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,540
Yeah, my God, if you're going to smoke dope, buy that great Humboldt County stuff.

863
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,820
The object in constructing me was to prevent war.

864
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,260
This object is a tank.

865
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,920
I will not permit war.

866
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,580
It is wasteful and pointless.

867
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
I've been helpless so long.

868
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,180
My eyes are confused.

869
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,540
My brain all full of junk.

870
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,520
I don't know what I should do.

871
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,660
Maybe go up on a mountain and become a monk.

872
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,260
I'm a screaming...

873
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,160
Bob Dallas!

874
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,680
Won't you help me?

875
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,180
Bob Dallas!

876
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,340
See me through!

877
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,240
Bob Dallas!

878
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,760
Can't you see my problems?

879
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,120
Bob Dallas!

880
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,340
What am I gonna do?

881
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,400
I searched on the mountains.

882
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,280
I searched on the beaches.

883
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,680
I searched on the deserts.

884
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,200
I searched in the woods.

885
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,380
I searched in the rocks.

886
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,600
I searched on the treetops.

887
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,660
Hoping, hoping that I could find...

888
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,600
Bob Dallas!

889
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,160
Won't you help me?

890
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,480
Bob Dallas!

891
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,620
See me through!

892
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,460
Bob Dallas!

893
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,060
Can't make it.

894
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,320
Bob Dallas!

895
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,600
Without help from you.

896
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,780
I need help.

897
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,240
Bob Dallas!

898
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,180
I need help.

899
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,960
Bob Dallas!

900
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
I need help.

901
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,840
Help me.

902
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,440
Bob Dallas!

903
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,540
My friend.

904
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,540


905
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,540


906
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,520
I need the help.

907
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,340
Ah!

908
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,340


909
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,340


910
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,340


911
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,720
I need help.

912
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,580
Bob Dallas!

913
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,140
Bo hamb!

914
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:18,880
Bob dollars!

915
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,320
Bob gal!

916
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,460


917
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,460


918
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,460


919
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,460


920
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,140
Bobpping in area inана Riverацию.

921
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,820
Man, I'm glad you guys are explaining all this because, you know, I'm from Texas and we don't...

922
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,480
Yeah, be careful of people you drink.

923
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,780
We don't cotton to no Canadians.

924
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,520
We never saw anybody from Canada.

925
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:43,460
So if you see someone drinking a Molson's or a Moosehead at a bar, feel free to execute them military style.

926
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,580
Or if you see some fat guy with a .50, you've got to go right there.

927
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,800
You've got to do them right on the spot.

928
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,780
But are the Canadians our enemies?

929
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,880
Everybody's our enemy.

930
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,400
If you're with us, we're against you.

931
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,820
They're confused, Dave.

932
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,560
They don't know what they're doing.

933
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,040
They don't see the true light or even the purple one there on the left.

934
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,180
They're just confused about everything and they need to be shown.

935
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,300
My friend's friends is my enemy.

936
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,880
They be shown the yoke.

937
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,600
Step in, please.

938
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,320
Mr. Kenock, you're going to like this yoke.

939
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,120
It's got a freeze compartment right here and there's little pucks hanging from it.

940
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,600
Can't we just enslave the Canadians?

941
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,300
People of Canada, this is a message from the United States.

942
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,240
The United States of America, prepare to take on the shackles of slavery.

943
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,280
We will march through your country.

944
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,980
We will destroy your armies.

945
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,340
Your streets will run red with your blood.

946
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,380
We shall rape your women and your caribou.

947
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,300
Not to mention your moose.

948
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,420
And that will be the fun part.

949
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,160
And your moose.

950
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,560
And actually, another thing.

951
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,500
Your beer is our beer.

952
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,560
Each individual Canadian family has...

953
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,500
Dudley B. Wright cannot save you.

954
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,380
Abandon your work.

955
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,760
The worship of the hawk gods of the sky.

956
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,900
Prepare as we shall melt your cities of ice.

957
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,540
And so...

958
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,720
Legium's voice will be the only voice they can hear over the lake.

959
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,280
And we'll put all kinds of reverb on it.

960
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Yeah, at that moment, at that very moment, the weather was just perfect and the signal skipped over the clouds.

961
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:22,660
The most paranoid guy with his hand on the button of their one little nuclear-tipped warhead.

962
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,900
Their secret one.

963
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,260
Canada, Asia, nuclear.

964
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,900
I'll have you know that Canada is a nuclear-free zone.

965
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,900
I kind of take a little regress to that remark.

966
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,860
Oh, yeah, everybody's got a nuclear-free zone, right?

967
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,320
Sure, everybody's got a nuke in their pocket.

968
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,220
Everybody's got one in the basement.

969
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,280
I had to have my air conditioner recharged and they used the nuclear-free zone on that.

970
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,280
Oh, they used nuclear energy to clean your air conditioner?

971
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,820
No, that's nuclear energy.

972
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,540
That's different.

973
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,020
Nuclear.

974
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,720
Oh, nuclear.

975
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,040
Yeah, there's nuclear and nuclear.

976
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,300
Well, what is nuclear?

977
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,360
Those are two different things.

978
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,220
What is nuclear?

979
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,140
Well, one is really dangerous and poisons everything for 90,000 years.

980
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,560
And the other one is just, it's not that bad.

981
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,520
The other one makes your popcorn.

982
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,180
Any friend in need is an enemy, indeed.

983
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,140
It's the sign that your world is coming apart.

984
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,340
You're sitting in front of your table having your same old lackluster sandwich.

985
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
And who flies in through the window?

986
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,700
The world is ending, that's who.

987
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,560
And you're sitting on a stump by yourself.

988
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,540
Those Canadian soldiers.

989
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,620
Beware of the Canadian soldiers.

990
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,860
It's their season.

991
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,920
One tin soldier rides away.

992
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,020
They're well-armed, man.

993
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,420
They got all this stuff, man.

994
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,240
They got the funny hats.

995
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,080
They're well-armed, man.

996
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,440
Don't mess with them.

997
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,920
We just ran about five minutes.

998
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,180
We're really sorry, Canada.

999
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,620
Coming in from Windsor, Detroit.

1000
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,320
This is a sick humor show.

1001
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
You shouldn't take anything we say.

1002
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,200
Seriously, this is all just...

1003
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,080
Please don't.

1004
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,280
Yeah, we don't...

1005
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,600
Because there are people in London.

1006
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,360
I've gotten letters and emails from people in London, Ontario,

1007
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,700
that they do get this station.

1008
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,620
We see it.

1009
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,580
And we are sorry.

1010
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,000
It was a Canadian that went into Janine today.

1011
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,060
You know how those guys are.

1012
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
There are good Canadians.

1013
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,080
There are some good Canadians.

1014
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,720
There's a few.

1015
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,860
Mostly up in Toronto.

1016
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,420
They must be judged individually on their merits,

1017
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,240
and they must stand trial.

1018
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,360
Stanley Kuhn-Hartner.

1019
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,280
They're good Canadians.

1020
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,140
They really should.

1021
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,700
He's the guy that puts the hour of slack on the internet.

1022
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,880
Well, they probably should nuke Vancouver.

1023
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,100
God bless America.

1024
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,740
My home, sweet home.

1025
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,300
God bless America.

1026
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,940
My home, sweet home.

1027
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,680
My home, sweet home.

1028
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,160
My home, sweet home.

1029
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,160


1030
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,160


1031
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,160


1032
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,160


1033
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,220
We're climbing to the top of that mountain, boys.

1034
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,120
Just because it's there.

1035
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,480
And we're jumping off the edge of the Western world.

1036
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,460
Just because we've been there.

1037
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,080
And we're digging a hole deep in the ground.

1038
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,740
Oil goes to Chinatown.

1039
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,360
And the party's starting when the sun goes down.

1040
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
On the other side...

1041
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,960
Out of the world

1042
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,360
The people in England

1043
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,160
Are standing in line

1044
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,680
Killing up to see the queen

1045
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,720
Between the royal weddings

1046
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,260
And the kids on the door

1047
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,440
The sun sets comfortably

1048
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,800
And back in the States

1049
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,560
It's we three kings

1050
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,860
Of greed, guns, and gasoline

1051
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,000
And a racial chase

1052
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,700
Through Georgia streets

1053
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,980
On the other side of the world

1054
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,500
So around and around

1055
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,140
And around we go

1056
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,000
We are here

1057
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,760
That's the law I know

1058
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,040
We might as well like it

1059
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,480
That's the gospel, oh

1060
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,680
The other side of the world

1061
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,420
Well, there's young people

1062
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,240
Falling in love

1063
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,020
There's young people

1064
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,960
Falling in love

1065
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,620
There's young people

1066
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,840
Falling in love

1067
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,600
Falling in love

1068
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,560
There's young people

1069
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,400
Falling in love

1070
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,020
Everywhere I go

1071
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,400
Old hides behind

1072
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,480
Those angry eyes

1073
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,200
Denim collars against the cold

1074
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,760
I got a letter today

1075
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,200
From Tokyo

1076
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,760
A little Japanese girl

1077
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,320
That I'll never know

1078
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,580
She's eating pizza

1079
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,480
And singing

1080
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,940
Let my people go

1081
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,880
On the other side of the world

1082
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,840
Oh, yeah

1083
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,500
So around and around

1084
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,160
And around we go

1085
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
We are here

1086
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,780
That's the law I know

1087
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,040
We might as well like it

1088
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,480
That's the gospel, oh

1089
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,640
The other side of the world

1090
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,860
Yeah, yeah

1091
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,940
Well, around and around

1092
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,540
And around we go

1093
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,460
We are here

1094
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,700
That's the gospel, oh

1095
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,460
We might as well like it

1096
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,080
That's the gospel, oh

1097
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,960
The other side of the world

1098
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,380
The other side of the world

1099
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,720
Let's get out of here

1100
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,500
Where is the present time

1101
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:07,500


1102
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:07,940
Let's go

1103
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,240
See you in the netherworld

1104
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,720
You'll see

1105
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:08,720


1106
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,120
You see

1107
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,360
You see

1108
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,140
You see

1109
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,840
Your stupid minds

1110
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:13,960
Stupid

1111
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,440
Stupid

1112
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,920
They're stupid

1113
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,980
Stupid humans

1114
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,440
Nothing is more delicate or complex

1115
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,780
Than the human brain

1116
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:21,920
Sorry

1117
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,060
It didn't mean anything to me

1118
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,100
I will remove the skull and reveal to you what happened.

1119
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,500
Well, it's just a frozen dead, so you can do that.

1120
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,420
And I can study the brains.

1121
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,100
You are going to be all right, Doctor.

1122
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,160
No!

1123
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,840
Doctor, we'll put your brain back in. You'll be fine.

1124
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,180
Everything is confusing.

1125
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,840
I tell you I know.

1126
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,160
I know!

1127
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,460
Well, it was that I know dot com or something.

1128
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,180
I know, I know. What you know you never know.

1129
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,860
That's right.

1130
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,620
I've got to get back to work.

1131
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,360
We're going back to work now.

1132
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,180
If I don't see you again, this is like seeing a prosthesis.

1133
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,960
Good luck to you, too. Take the Popeye spinach with you.

1134
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,500
You.

1135
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,520
I'll take C.

1136
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,320
Bitch!

1137
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,520
What you gonna do?

1138
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,860
I'm gonna make you a brother!

1139
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,400
You want too much?

1140
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,960
You want your neck wiped?

1141
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm a damn good one!

1142
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,580
Bitch!

1143
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:19,980
Bitch!

1144
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:21,780
Bitch!

1145
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,520
Bitch!

1146
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,440
You don't cut!

1147
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,500
You don't clean!

1148
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,800
Bitch, you're in the world!

1149
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm pregnant!

1150
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,960
So am I!

1151
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,780
I'm pregnant, okay?

1152
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,500
I don't care!

1153
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,140
I don't care!

1154
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,380
I've been with this man for a year and a half.

1155
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,140
I don't care!

1156
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
I've known him for a year and a half.

1157
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,580
I don't care!

1158
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,680
I don't see no ring on your finger!

1159
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,400
I don't see no ring on your finger!

1160
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,120
It don't make no difference!

1161
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,120
It don't make no difference!

1162
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,700
I don't see no ring on your finger!

1163
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,820
He don't walk over there!

1164
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,600
You take hoes to a hotel where you take hoes!

1165
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,080
I found an old national lampoon with a great story in it called Amish in Space.

1166
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,140
Oh, that dress.

1167
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,140
It was a weird concept.

1168
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:51,980
Oh, a good perp seminar.

1169
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,360
I mean, the first people to make it here were a bunch of religious, you know...

1170
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,320
Folk?

1171
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,300
Amish in space.

1172
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,880
So the Yoders landed here some five billion years ago.

1173
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,320
The first people that came here got wiped out because they were a bunch of drunks and stuff.

1174
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,900
Married the Lizards.

1175
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,300
But the second group, the ones that did make it, were the Puritans.

1176
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,520
And they were the religious fanatics.

1177
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,480
And they were the Sunshine Boopers.

1178
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,140
The Haters of Hats.

1179
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,120
But using a ship made of wood was within the...

1180
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,360
They didn't use wood in their religion, right?

1181
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,200
But would making an airtight, heat-shielded spacecraft be within Amish tradition?

1182
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,520
Or would you have to hire the English to do everything?

1183
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,580
Sheesh, that tiny little brain of yours.

1184
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,200
Why not?

1185
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,760
Or trade out your daughters with some English scientists.

1186
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,440
Yeah, they're making big strides. They use some technology.

1187
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,160
Who, the Amish?

1188
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,660
They use Mennonite drivers and they pimp their women as horse.

1189
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,120
They make their sons grow drugs for the people amongst them.

1190
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,620
The Yankee crew who cannot make drugs ourself.

1191
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,940
And they get in car accidents when they're not supposed to drive.

1192
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,000
That Amish crystal meth is about as good as it gets.

1193
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,860
I do not believe in gossip and I will not put part in this conversation.

1194
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,260
I shall always stop along the farm roads there when I'm heading to...

1195
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,620
Buy a little butter?

1196
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,500
A little cheese?

1197
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,120
Some eggs?

1198
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,060
Yeah, when I'm out in the country.

1199
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,400
And some pure crystal meth, man.

1200
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,800
Are thee feeling sleepy, pilgrim?

1201
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,820
Nah, nah, no sleep, nah.

1202
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,300
Yeah, yeah, no sleep in here.

1203
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,420
No, I don't need to sleep.

1204
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,420
Amphetamine lab.

1205
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:22,900
No, no, no.

1206
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,720
The cows have all been given pretty good milk since we keep feeding them that stuff and they're...

1207
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,200
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

1208
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,560
They chirp, you know, when they get to the ends of things.

1209
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,600
They're not like us, you know, with their beards and their funny hats and those bitch forks.

1210
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,100
And the bonnets and the blue jumper suits.

1211
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,440
I met a comedian once called the Amish comic.

1212
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,340
Hey.

1213
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,340
Now there's some swinging music.

1214
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,220
Ah, there you go.

1215
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,960
I feel like I'm in Chi-Chi's.

1216
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,560
I feel like I'm in my parents' living room.

1217
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,880
With the gold hanging lamps.

1218
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,640
Yes.

1219
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,160
I fell asleep under the matador statue.

1220
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,380
And of course there was a little weeping Jesus and one of them clowns with a blood tear coming out of his eye.

1221
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,380
Jesus is always weeping.

1222
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,560
Mary's always weeping.

1223
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,820
What's he got to cry about?

1224
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,220
He can come back from the dead.

1225
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:18,680
I mean.

1226
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,920
Why?

1227
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,400
I believe it's because Jesus was taken to the weeping post before he shed his blood.

1228
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,860
They stripped him naked to the waist.

1229
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,980
And the man who carried the whip brought the whip down across his back.

1230
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,500
This is what I remember hundreds of years before the manifestation of Christ when he said,

1231
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,160
Who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

1232
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,220
For he was wounded for our transgressions.

1233
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,980
He was bruised.

1234
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,420
He was tortured.

1235
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,400
Yes.

1236
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,360
Yes.

1237
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,340
They took Jesus.

1238
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,860
They taxed him.

1239
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,340
Oh.

1240
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,020
They made him a work of 80 hour a week?

1241
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,020
Yes.

1242
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,840
Yes.

1243
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,580
You think they let Jesus off easy?

1244
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,040
Wait till you see what they're going to do to you my friend.

1245
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:08,840
Oh.

1246
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,580
You think Jesus got it hard?

1247
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,880
When are they going to nail you up there with electrified nails.

1248
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,960
They'll put you on a cross made out of old death.

1249
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1250
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1251
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1252
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1253
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1254
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1255
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:17,960


1256
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:26,420
and fish and you have to eat that or die. Oh, they're gonna, oh, I can feel it. Oh,

1257
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:37,240
the pain, the pain of my religious spirit. Oh, I love, I love to be nailed and beaten

1258
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:44,680
and flogged, oh yes, by the nuns and the altered boys. Oh, oh, bring them into me and I'll

1259
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:51,380
just, they can tie me up. You think I'm, ah, they can't tie me up because I'll bust loose

1260
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:57,980
my bonds. I'll preach, I'll preach pain and death and torment. I'll preach iniquity and

1261
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,200
evil. Oh, they can't, they can't hold me down. They can talk about me all over Dallas County.

1262
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,040
They can blacklist me from the film business. They can send me out into the streets to squint

1263
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,440
my blood out, but hell, I'll keep preaching damnation. I'll preach,

1264
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,280
I'll preach about the heaven that's gonna kill everybody. Oh, oh yes, I'm gonna.

1265
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:06,440
You were on marijuana, spends the dreams, sleeping pills for a few years. But on LSD,

1266
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,320
on LSD, you begin to die a little.

1267
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,460
And that's the way you get this extraordinary sense of revelation.

1268
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,520
We always have something very funny happens when we start that number.

1269
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:39,180
These mean shoes, hope you guess my name. Oh yeah, what, what, what, what, what do I give you?

1270
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,860
It's the nature of my game. Oh yeah.

1271
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,640
The Mennonites are really what...

1272
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,240
We're having a pirate radio tower raising.

1273
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,800
Tower raising.

1274
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,440
Yeah, a tower.

1275
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,100
A ship raising.

1276
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,220
A microwave tower raising.

1277
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:57,860
That's right.

1278
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,900
A nuclear death ray raising.

1279
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,840
Simple folk, but their heads are in the right...

1280
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,980
Oh, they're not letting anybody...

1281
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,980
They're not letting anybody in on what they're really all about.

1282
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,780
They got Nike sites out there.

1283
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,900
They've got ICBMs built up.

1284
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,360
They really do have silos.

1285
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,060
The silos, believe me, those silos, they don't hold corn.

1286
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,700
Now, Janet Reno was around.

1287
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,280
She'd Branch David-y in their asses.

1288
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:22,640
That's right.

1289
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,540
She'd lay some Branch David-y on their ass.

1290
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,480
Yeah, you can't do that.

1291
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,020
They'd show them Mormon...

1292
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,480
They got the deal.

1293
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,560
See, the Mormon...

1294
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,640
The Mennonites, they got the deal, though.

1295
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,900
The government knows.

1296
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,840
They got the nuke.

1297
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,840
They can watch cable TV, too.

1298
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,400
You bug us, we push the button.

1299
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,420
That's as simple as that.

1300
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,780
Don't set us on fire.

1301
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,160
You go find your Dave...

1302
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,380
Right.

1303
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:44,820
Whatever.

1304
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,720
Out in Texas, Waco, and you burn him alive, you're fine.

1305
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,340
Go ahead.

1306
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,140
He just got guns.

1307
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,920
You come after us.

1308
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,700
We're pushing the damn red button, buddy.

1309
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,860
They leave them alone out in farmland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York.

1310
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,180
I only knew what they had to fear, these rural cults.

1311
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,960
Actually, the Mennonites are really what...

1312
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,980
They're the deterrent because the Canadians know about them.

1313
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,200
Why?

1314
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:08,500
They balance them.

1315
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,820
The Canadians will never invade us because they know about the Mennonite silos.

1316
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,360
Right.

1317
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:14,840
Yeah.

1318
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,460
That's a problem.

1319
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,540
Wife, aren't the smallpox germs intact in thy fruit cellar?

1320
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,140
They've still got germs that we wiped out a lot.

1321
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,900
We thought we'd wiped out.

1322
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,040
But they've been cultivating these long-lost...

1323
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,240
I got this one anthrax cow named Bill.

1324
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,060
So what they have to do before they launch the rocket is piss on it.

1325
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,280
They just fill the warhead with urine or crap in it or something.

1326
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,540
Something to spread their bodily functions over a wide area.

1327
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,260
Which reminds me, have you ever...

1328
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,380
Masters of the planet through bacteriological warfare.

1329
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,360
Yeah.

1330
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,240
And hexing, too.

1331
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,460
Right.

1332
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:05,500
All of them brave nuclear warheads bore emblems of the hexes they had shown on the silos down below.

1333
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,960
Satellites were able to target the enemy with hexes.

1334
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,400
Oh, what's the deal with that?

1335
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,840
Come on.

1336
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,940
You have me.

1337
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,820
Sub-G's got their own credit cards, their own car, and their own oil company.

1338
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,260
Oh, you never would have thought so.

1339
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,780
Just a few years ago, they were all broke, deadbeat art bums.

1340
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,700
And now, look at them.

1341
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,300
They're just like some poor little armor dealer on the road.

1342
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,380
All little bodies get hit by cars and knocked off the front bumpers of the famous Stang.

1343
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:39,720
What?

1344
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,720
Stang is responsible for this auto carnage?

1345
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,060
Of course.

1346
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,040
He has a fleet of limos now that carry him all over the country.

1347
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:47,960
Mm-hmm.

1348
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,680
And those damn hillbillies who work for him just love to crush little creatures on the road.

1349
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,840
Yep, that's what they do down there.

1350
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,460
They don't have any room to work for Stang and crush little creatures on the road.

1351
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,380
Yee-haw!

1352
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,240
That's what we say here.

1353
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,560
Oh, my God.

1354
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,380
Oh, my God.

1355
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,220
Who is this?

1356
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,340
Well, I don't know.

1357
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,680
You're playing the record.

1358
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,160
I was asking the trailer brides.

1359
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,660
Yeah.

1360
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,240
Oh, great.

1361
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,380
Oh, my God.

1362
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,600
Those little trailer twists certainly turn me to one of those beach events this evening.

1363
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,320
They will?

1364
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,120
Of course.

1365
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,840
Well, that's a different, puts a different complexion on the matter of...

1366
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:43,860
Uh-oh.

1367
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,400
Oh, my God.

1368
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,160
Nice foundation.

1369
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,740
Other black tie with my suit on.

1370
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,420
And now we have a slow dance for you, those of you that are couples.

1371
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,060
Yes, with that slow-eyed...

1372
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,280
This is the mop-up, the motor oil on the dance floor.

1373
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,420
We'll mop up the motor oil with these dancers.

1374
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,880
God bless them.

1375
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:08,660
In a 72-hour dance marathon for the Subgenius Youth Outreach Program.

1376
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,720
103rd Street.

1377
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,380
All right.

1378
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,860
Ah, such boys.

1379
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,980
I shot him up first.

1380
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,520
And such pretty girls, too.

1381
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,260
Busy rapping together.

1382
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,880
So much to do, so much to see.

1383
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,440
He didn't want his arms bathed in alcohol.

1384
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,560
And not just in Soma, or Overtown.

1385
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,220
What part of the week?

1386
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,060
I don't know.

1387
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,900
I don't know.

1388
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,060
I don't know.

1389
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,940
I don't know.

1390
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,080
I don't know.

1391
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,180
It's pretty slow.

1392
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,140
Yep, just like in the springtime back in Arizona.

1393
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,060
The lights are going out in the city.

1394
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,820
The long day wanes, the slow moon climbs.

1395
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,180
The lights are going out all across this country.

1396
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,520
Our freedom in chains, slowly suffocating.

1397
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,500
The end.

1398
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,220
Keep running, keep running.

1399
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,900
Who are those?

1400
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,800
I've heard the Mennonite mafia around Cleveland Heights is running everything.

1401
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,240
The Russians are running scared.

1402
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,480
Nobody messes with them.

1403
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,100
Nobody.

1404
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:00,100
The brothers, the Puerto Ricans, nobody messes with the Mennonite dudes, man.

1405
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,440
Hey, can you grab the door?

1406
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,160
But extinguish that.

1407
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,840
Face of yours.

1408
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,180
Put out that face.

1409
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,940
Would someone put the Dave face out, please?

1410
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,180
It's shedding all over.

1411
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,880
Oh, look.

1412
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,240
The Dave brain out.

1413
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,800
The Dave face keeps pushing its snout into my flat.

1414
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,340
It's like putting the cat out.

1415
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,000
Let the Dave face out.

1416
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,460
No, no, keep the body in.

1417
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,440
Don't let the body go out.

1418
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,020
God knows what it'll do.

1419
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,960
All right.

1420
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,400
You can stop that hissing and waving of claws, my friend.

1421
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,700
The game is up.

1422
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,820
Did you hear me?

1423
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,600
You're not fooling anyone.

1424
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,040
You're not a cat.

1425
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,280
You're a man.

1426
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,720
A man disguised as a cat.

1427
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,920
I thought I would be able to find my way home.

1428
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,780
But now it seems I'm just wandering these places again.

1429
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,800
Is that really you or is that like a space suit in your inside someplace?

1430
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,480
Maybe just your brain, a little jar, something like that?

1431
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,200
Here it is, straight.

1432
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,860
One of the sides.

1433
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:06,940
One of the sides.

1434
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,120
The scientist in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.

1435
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,760
Well, don't look at me like that.

1436
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,860
These scientists claim that this monster, beast, whatever it is, it's a prehistoric thing.

1437
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,320
And if you laugh, I'll bring you.

1438
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,460
It's romping somewhere around the North Atlantic.

1439
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,360
A monster.

1440
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,940
How can she love a monster?

1441
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,620
Let's get that through your head.

1442
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,560
You dried up monster.

1443
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,220
We've been hearing this sexual stuff for years.

1444
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,780
You know, the five day orgasm.

1445
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,280
It all happens without physical contact.

1446
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,740
It's only the beginning.

1447
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,020
Why should this reality be public domain?

1448
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,980
What's so great about it?

1449
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,060
Maybe, maybe they gave you some drugs.

1450
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,520
Maybe none of this is real at all.

1451
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,460
He's going into shock.

1452
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,560
Yep, this is the one thing you don't think about on the show.

1453
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,600
Maybe this is not real at all.

1454
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,180
Get him the allergen.

1455
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:49,840
Get him the allergen.

1456
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,700
Lower down those plastic curtains.

1457
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,260
You can't tell what's real and what isn't.

1458
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,160
Lower ourselves into the caller's brain.

1459
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,640
Okay, speak now.

1460
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,880
Or forever hold the little pieces that are left on the floor.

1461
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,780
That's about your shattered heart.

1462
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,700
My pain.

1463
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,400
On the surface.

1464
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,780
In casual conversation.

1465
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,540
Yes.

1466
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
That beard is all gray.

1467
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,740
Yeah, yeah.

1468
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,540
It just seemed like normal guys.

1469
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,280
Wanna trade me the rest of this banana?

1470
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,260
Sure, we can trade the whole show for a couple bananas.

1471
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,780
We've done it before.

1472
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,680
I'm giving you great input.

1473
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,560
Thanks for the input.

1474
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:24,780
Yeah.

1475
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,720
We have to put it in somewhere.

1476
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,160
Might as well be here.

1477
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,760
Doctorsors taught me a lot about dealing with tension.

1478
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,460
Yeah, here we go.

1479
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,620
No, not tense, are you?

1480
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,760
Much better.

1481
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,060
Now I can see that you really are a clever doctor.

1482
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,520
I gotta go to the doctor!

1483
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,840
I gotta go to the doctor!

1484
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,080
I gotta go to the doctor!

1485
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,040
Oh, Slack.

1486
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,780
P.O. Box 204206.

1487
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,780
Austin, Texas 787.

1488
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:06,760
I'm Dr. Slack.

1489
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,760
2- 0.

1490
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:14,140
That's a box 204-206.

1491
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,300
Austin, Texas 787.

1492
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,300
2- 0.

1493
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:29,900
And it's so calm at www.subgenius.com.

1494
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,920
Praise Bob.

1495
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:36,840
you
