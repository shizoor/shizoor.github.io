Oh, Slime.
Touch it gently.
Caress it.
It accepts you.
Oh, thank you so very much.
It is like a fluid.
You are truly, truly.
Through which you can float.
My one-eyed guru.
And if you run into it,
I have worshipped other one-eyed gurus.
But as you snuggle up.
Through aeons by,
I have wasted my spiritual juices on them.
One fuzzy.
One eyes.
Bathtub full of hot gel.
But now, when I see you rising in the eastern horizon.
Fuzzy and red.
And made and built for my sexual pleasures.
I can only offer up my squanderances.
And what meager supplies of vestiges.
Dave's talking to his dog again.
Oh, puppy.
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.
There is a pain between my ears.
For those who don't understand,
perhaps they're always on the short poopy end of the stick.
Yes, the short poopy end of the stick.
There's a lot of short doggy poop around to put on the stick.
But if you want to live like a real man or woman,
you must, you must, you must.
It is...
Gone.
Later.
Than...
You...
Think.
It's too late for me to think, dude.
It's too late for you to think.
It's too late for you to think.
As chimpanzees are to humans, humans are to us.
I love the smell of my pump in the morning.
You'd much rather have us happy.
Happy.

And satisfied to leave.
Smells like...
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
Kyle Andy Whistler.
I hate you.
I hate you.
The Pensioner Roll Program in this baby is really gone.
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired
and chemically corrupted by the fake artificial food coloring.
We're the lucky ones.
The handful with the chance to reach another world
And we'll use those guns
You'll use them, Doctor
To keep your only chance to stay alive
Somebody tell me
Who is this guy?

A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent God-fearing citizen,
And the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant
To those of us who prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer.
Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people.
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid

Friends, this hour of Slack, number 1,122, is a tribute to our late friend Chaz Smith,
Who vacated Earth Plane 1 for greener pastures on October 16th.
He was, um,
One of the most valuable contributors to the hour of Slack and to Slack in general.
And, uh,
So this is kind of a hard show to put together.
In fact, this is the second time I've attempted to do it.
And I'm just gonna talk a little bit about Chaz, and then the rest of the show will be all songs from his band,
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, and clips from his old radio show, Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland,
Which is where some of the best parts of our Slack came from originally for like 10 years.
And also we'll hear some excerpts from Subgenius Devivals, where Einstein's Secret Orchestra headlined at pretty much every show that we did.
For a long time.
Chaz was hospitalized about a month ago with double pneumonia and had a stroke while in the hospital.
But he'd also been fighting Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Which he beat in his youth, but, um, it came back and he'd been getting radiation treatments.
He had just turned 50.
Chaz was a music professor at Cleveland State University and taught the most popular course in the whole school, a class in the history of rock and roll.
He put a lot more into that class than just the history.
The students loved him because he would spontaneously just start ranting about life or society or space or science or whatever grabbed his attention.

And he also taught regular workshops in music and consciousness at festivals like Starwood, Winterstar and Serious Rising.
And taught basic musical composition to little kids through a program with the Cleveland Opera.
He has three textbooks that he wrote, From Woodstock to the Moon and The Soul of Sunrise.
Then there's a third one which was just recently finished and isn't published yet.
The real focal point of Chaz's work is that he's been working on a lot of music.
Chaz's life though was playing music.
He was in the Clocks in the late 70s and early 80s and then started Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
Which during most of its existence had Lonesome Cowboy Dave DeLuca, Bob Mosick and Michelle George in it.
And they produced a couple of really good studio albums and a lot of wonderful live recordings.
Cleveland Radio.
And the radio listeners got to hear Chaz's show, Swamp Radio, for I guess over 20 years.
And that was a wild show.
He'd play whatever kind of music he was into at the time, which really could be just about anything.
And also did sort of improv comedy and radio plays.
First with Brain Rot Radio Theater with Dave DeLuca and Dan DiDonato.
And then later on, he did a lot of other things.
Later with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself and Princess Wee.
And he also took calls from listeners.
And he got some pretty wild listeners.
And the bits recorded on that were a mainstay of Hour of Slack for a long time.
Chaz was also an outdoorsman.
Not a hunter, but a hiker and camper.
And his seasonal camp out at Brushwood was almost like an art gallery.
And also a performance area.
He actually built a stage there.
And some of the coolest events at Brushwood happened there.
And if you're familiar with Brushwood, that's saying a lot.
His camp was called Tranquility Base or Club Tiki Banzai.
Or both.
And he ran a regular festival himself called the Rumble in the Jungle, which was sort of legendary.
Friends, thousands of us are going to remember Chaz.
His former students are almost beyond number.
It was a really popular class.
And he had an awful lot of fellow musicians and performers and camping buddies.
And he was part of a lot of communities.
Brushwood, Ace in Cleveland, WCSB, Cleveland State, Church of the Subgenius.
He wasn't the only reason I left Dallas for Cleveland.
But he was definitely one of the main ones, friends.
And he is already greatly missed.
He did not have health insurance.
And his family is, I mean, he was in intensive care for a month.
And if you want to help Chaz's family, you can send donations.
Or look at a website.
And get your pencil ready because I'm going to give the information about that.
Donations for Chaz can be sent directly to donationsforcharlesvsmith.com.
At US Bank 26410 Lakeshore Blvd, Euclid, Ohio.
Euclid is spelled E-U-C-L-I-D.
And the zip is 44132.
Make checks payable to donations of Charles V. Smith.

You can also go to a website which should have a PayPal donation thing up by the time you hear this.

Have a look, there's something in the air
And measurements of time crumble and climb
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear
The storms roll over and start to play
With toys left over from yesterday
But just now on the road
The pavements all aglow
While they wait and they watch
For the gates to close
With heads bowed they only see
Each other in the wet black street
And measurements of time crumble and climb
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear
Jaguar, Knight and White Gear
I'm living in jungles of radio waves
Never, now or ever or yesterday
And just now in the air
Where black becomes clear
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear
There's no words in books here
Have a look, there's something in the air

Will you smoke up the pipe?
Will you hit the osmolite?
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?
Will you climb the mountaintop and jump right off into the frond?
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?
I know the wound is humming
Cause I know soon Connie is coming
Astro intercourse, universal force
Galaxy's a number in the billion
They're all there for you
If you're the boss to see it through
I know the wound is humming
And light the fire of truth
Will you ever let go to your instinct bonobo?
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?
Will you escape on the date July 5th soon?
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?
Will you?
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

he becomes larger and gives birth to many more children,
shown in this diagram here.
Until lightning strikes nearby.
And then there's monkeys swinging from trees.
As soon as the lightning clears, the smoke clears.
And there is the force of Zeus as the lightning bearers
stretch each one of those monkeys down.
Then as soon as the rain dries up, the trees die away, like within two hours.
So the monkeys don't have as many trees to swing around in.
Then they have to jump down to the ground and run from one group of trees to the other.
And they found that after a while, they stood up.
They could run faster if they stood up, not on all fours.
And right about that time, their heads started getting bigger.
And I am lonely, and I shall create me man from the mud of the earth.
And he shall slay all these nearly evolved other primates.
And so God...
Rose up the first completely created, unevolved Homo sapiens.
And now for a limited time only, you can own in your very own home
this unlimited collection of man's original Homo sapien collection.
And that was exactly 2,714 years ago that happened.
And then God placed all the fossils to full.
To test the faith of the scientists.
And the geologists.
That is what is the crux of everything in reality.
If you're out in the African desert somewhere, and you find a skull,
it was planted there by God just a few thousand years ago.
So you could lick it?
It's right next to where Lucy was.
You go down a few feet deeper than Lucy even.
And there's another one.
Well, there were cavemen and dinosaurs running around back then.
But the great deluge came and smashed a lot of...
So you could lick it?
Yeah.
Was that when Noah?
Yeah, when Noah managed to...
But see, the dinosaurs were too big.
And that's why they didn't survive.
And the Australopithecines and the Andropoles,
Paleoanthropocas and so forth were all too smelly.
That was their only defense.
And so Noah and his family...
Actually, Noah's wife didn't let them on.
There's no account.
No suitcase.
No money.
Them three brothers just shouted.
They were going to erect human eggs.
They were going to take the eggs from primates by taking two of each kind.
And why did these other ones, these non-godly primates,
why did they bury their dead ceremoniously?
Like Neanderthals buried their dead ceremoniously in...
They were Satanists.
Yes.
They were burying them to the wrong god.
Yes, the neutral primates are all Satanists.
And so they were also lost in the great flood.
But many of them had not learned the correct prayers.
So as their prayers are uttered throughout the woods
and picked up thousands of years from...
The Grand Canyon was cut 2,000...
I mean, 303 years ago.
I get up in the rain
The sun has yet to rise
I shake the webs and clear my head
Put on my target eyes
Brown boots and brown fields
Brown is all I see
But the red spot on my middle stick
Is all I really need
On my ride there's many sides
And the bandits on my tail
Another target in the eyes
Of midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
Ooh
Midnight's growing pale
From morning mist I rise
To help them greet the day
With little silver sunbeams
And little infrareds
I paint the house
I paint the dog
I paint the chicken
I paint the chicken

I paint the chicken
And when they come out
To see the show
I turn and paint them too
On my ride there's many sides
Bandits on my tail
Another target in the eyes
Of midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
They'll never know
They'll never see
Before the hit I'm gone
Back into the dragon's breath
To sing the dragon's song
Back home folks think what I do
I do to keep them out of my sight
I'm free
And no one knows my secret
No one knows I fly for me
On my ride there's many sides
Bandits on my tail
Another target in the eyes
Of midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

Ooh, midnight's growing pale

Things without minds, a world of pain, no luxury, no comfort, no delight, suffering at every corner.
Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself.
We must get out. We must get out. We must get out this place.
Is there no more? There is no future. We have destroyed the land we live in.
We have taken the earth and enslaved the earth.
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
This is the sloth-jawed face of evolution.
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
This is the slow-pivot, slumbering, lumbaring face of evolution.
End up!
No, even if they...
Next day then. Workout will go for sex day!
We want you people to dance into the new century.
Screw into the new century.
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover is what you'll be doing forever.
So make sure you're not asleep.
Make sure you're not watching TV.
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch.
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch.
You'll never be able to scratch.
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.
A sea of Bob's pills.
But you're just too blind yet to see them.
Oh, friends.
I know you're not the dumb, asticated type.
I know you're the smart, asticated type.
Oh, but people say,
Reverend Stagg, what is slap?
I know you're the smart, asticated type. Oh, but people say,
Reverend Stagg, what is slap?
I want you to tell me what slap is.
I want you to tell me what slap is.
You know, friends, the television doesn't have to watch you as long as you are watching the television.
And a lot of people, a lot of people think that slap is that Miller beer commercial
where everybody's good looking and you're rich and your team just won the game
and you're drinking Miller beer and your favorite show is on.
And you know that's bullshit.
Because slap is not laziness, friends.
Slap is getting into the zone.
It's being awake and alert and doing what you wanted to do until your eyes snap open
and you're smart enough to realize that you are God.
Life is worth living.
And everything is just as psychedelic as an old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.
Now, hold that thought.
Hold it in your head.
Because that is what slap is all about, friends.
Slap is something for nothing.
Yes, at quadruple X day, the crowds, the masses will all rise up, raise their hands up and sing,
All flesh is like grass.
They shall raise their feet and scream,
All flesh is tastier than grass.
And that lemongrass can be used with practically any vegetable, fruit, fowl or vuels, vuels, vuels.
And a new barb odor will rise up.
And a new, newbile reporter will sing behind him and say,
Then all is flesh as is vigras.
Froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit.
The crop circles promise to lead us the way home.
The pipe of Bob dolls is waiting for us.
The escape vessels of the sex goddess is coming.
I've paid thirty dollars to fly into space.
My father had told me not to go off to space.
So I took cash from his wallet and was on my way.
My brothers and sisters, they said it's all a sex cult.
They tried to stop me, but I shot them all dead.
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.
And all they will call you will be,
D-Bobby.
D-Bobby.
Some of us are smelly and some are not wanted.
Codini has told us we have to move on.
We went into T-Base just to meet all our heroes.
But Lagoon's got a really big knife and a gun.
We cried in the woods and we cried in the hot tub.
We washed down our pride with the water.
We cried in the water of fire.
We cried with some hairy old man they called Mojo.
But we just want to hang with the ones we admire.
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.
And all they will call you will be,
D-Bobby.

The campsite erupted just when we all passed out.
A fireball of liquid that singed my young face.
Who were all these people who taught me the lesson?
Never pass out stone drunk at Tranquility Base.
But is this the best way to teach the young preacher?
And is this the best method to show us?
The way to set us on fire and laugh at our screaming.
And be known by no name except D-Bobby.
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.

Are you the next American Idol, Dave?
I'm the next atonal recital.
I'm the next beautiful, beautiful bag of puss.
Look at that big old brain cell.
Look at that big old brain cell.
It's oozing out.
Big old ugly bag of water held up by a bunch of sticks.
Dicks.
That's a very romantic portrait.
It is.
Just painted of the human race.
Yeah.
Saline solution and a flaky...
I told my class the other day.
The aliens looking in from outer space, you're just a ugly bag of water held up by a bunch of white sticks.
If some babe goes, oh I love your eyes.
I think it is, yeah.
Praise Bob, that's right.
See if some babe says, oh I love your eyes or something.
Well the bag of ugly water, the ugly bag of water is actually an old Star Trek thing.
From the original episode, I think there was some entity that came from outer space and kept calling them ugly bags of water.
No, see I think Landry makes more sense now than the ugly bags of water.
But then I added the...
Held up by sticks.
Held up by sticks.
It's a slavvy boinkment you've used by the water.
Slavvy boinkment.
Once again you've been sitting there for the last two hours thinking the radio was on.
No man, the radio's not and it's the voices in your own head.
Those many, many, many voices.

But you don't listen too carefully, they will drive you mad.
Rewind, rewind.
Te ponere loco.
Te ponere loco de todo.
Are you listening, sheeple?
Are you listening to my voice?
Are you listening?
You'd better unscrew yourself.
Help me escape.
Unscrew yourself from the system.
I have a brain.
Unscrew yourself from the man.
You have a brain?
Unscrew yourself from the mountain that is humanity.
That has no escape for you.
Help me do things.
They make me say things.
Help me escape.
We are only here to help.
I can think.
I have a brain.
Partners away from Stang's throat.
They make me do things.
Leave him alone.
They make me do things.
Yes, I'm Bryce Bessinger.
They make me say things.
They make me say things.
They make me do things.
They make me do.
Open the cage.
Please.
Please.
Please.







They make me say things.

And the most colloquial way we can say that God makes us do all kinds of funny things.
I know what I'm saying.
And one of the funniest things he's made us do so far is to pretend a belief into our
beliefial systems that somehow he, she, I, we, they, and it are all one with a capital
O and a capital of zero.
We must get off.
We must get off.

We must get off.
We must get off.
We must get off.
We must get off.
We must get off.
We must get off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some people say a man is made out of mud.
Some people love their mud.
Present company included.
I saw people loving mud at that Starwood Festival.
My whole seminar was about loving your mud.
Well, it was because the mud was your only possession, right?
Mm-hmm.
The birth of the blues when mud was your only possession.
I even took away their names.
All their last names are now Smith.
This was your workshop at Starwood?
Yeah.
Wasn't that supposed to be a workshop in the history of American music,
not?
The love of your mud?
Uh, how can you discuss one without the other?
The history of rock and roll and mud love?
Mm-hmm.
Mud love at the crossroads.
Makes total sense to me.
Made total sense to 25 believers in my workshop.
Well, it was weird because I didn't know you were doing that.
And after the, I was walking down the roads at Starwood,
and I'd see these hippies.
And I'd see these hipsters and characters walk by cradling ostrich egg-sized lumps of mud.
And they'd have little sticks and things stuck in them to decorate them.
They were cradling them like babies.
That's right.
They're mud babies.
I didn't understand until later that it was you, Professor Smith,
that had commanded these young students and old students to make babies or something out of mud.
Mm-hmm.
And to love them as their only possession so that they could, I guess, identify with the slaves.
The slaves and the Appalachians.
When all you had was your mud.
That's right.
Hey, at least you guys had mud.
All we had was sand down in Texas.
Yeah.
We didn't have water to mix with it.
So we couldn't cradle our sand ball.
It would just fall through our fingers.
Somebody actually pointed out that right there, right near there, the Mississippi Basin cuts through.
So that mud really is, you know, Delta mud.
Cuts the Mississippi what?
Delta-bound mud.
The Mississippi Basin cuts up.
Well, weird water underchannels go all over the country.
The Ohio River cuts way off in different directions into Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but it all happens underground.
You're saying when a pagan urinates on the path at Brushwood, that water eventually goes down to New Orleans.

And parties at Marksville.
Marty Groff.
Yeah.
Right.
But by then it's combined with an...
I mean, have you ever seen the Mississippi River down there, right there at New Orleans?
Yes, I have.
It's a lot of water flowing there.
So it has to combine with many, many, many people's having their urinations in the mud.
I don't know how it is.
You know, the vibes from your atoms of uric acid.
Acid join with the vibes of all your, you know, fellow party goers eventually makes it into the Gulf of Mexico.
Yeah.
And when you stand there down at the French market and watch all that water, that muddy looking water flowing past.
That's a lot of flush toilets and a lot of pagans and a lot of campgrounds.
Girls, doff tots for rock and roll professors exam on Woodstock.
Doff tots.
Flip hooters for her.
Hey, mister, si da cesta.
Don't you laugh, I thrill you.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that was good.
Good though.
She's actually playing her two-message pregnant belly right now.
What's up, viebro?
There is no death.
There is no war.
I'm going to the Bahamas.
That's why them babies down there all have the funny heads in there.
I'm going to the Bahamas, man.
I'm heading out for that big evening.
I'm going to the Bahamas.
I'm going to the Bahamas.
I'm going to smoke me a big fat spleef big as my forearm.
I'm going to set my reptile hairs on fire.
Sitting on a beach somewhere.
Some psychedelic beach somewhere.
Neon beach.
You want to know what songs I played in class on September 11th yesterday?
I played.
Freebird.
No, I didn't.
It's more absurd than that.
I played the Andrew Sisters.
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.
I played Coming In on a Wing and a Prayer.
I played Dylan.
You know, hey.
One of his pro-war songs.
Yeah, right.
I played.
Wait, what else did I play?
You played that Slovak orchestra song.
The one, the folk orchestra song.
That was Rushdill.
I played Comanche.
Comanche.
Johnny Horton.
I told him to go to.
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember that.
I told him to go to Vietnam Memorial on Memorial Day.
Did you play Green Berets?
Urinate on the foot of the.
No, I didn't do that one, but I should have played that one.
Yeah.
And then I played Elvis.
I played Elvis from Elvis for him, too.
Elvis Costello?
Because he's just really cool.
Yeah.
You know, he's just real American.
Yeah, and he joined, too.
Rather than have his head shaved, he enlisted and had his head shaved.
Oh, that was just, you know, publicity stunt.
Of course it was.
He was just going to hump some fraud lines and make some tunes over there in an army barracks.
Yeah.
That was PR for the army.
Yeah.
They didn't take us seriously last time.
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.
Didn't take Donald Trump as seriously.
But this time we've learned our lesson.
We can't rely.
On invisible monsters from outer space.
We can't even rely on Bob.
We have to learn how to escape Earth without being dependent on the conspiracy or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but build your own ship.
You may not have to, but just to cover your ass.
Build your own ship.
Even better, go buy Hangar 18 or...
Area 51 or Cape Canaveral or Studio 54 and steal your own ship.
Ah, yes.
Extract your own fuel.
And while you're at it, friends, let's swab the deck on the spaceship that we're already stuck together on.
We're already riding on the spaceship and it's in bad shape.
And it's high time we cleaned it up.
Earth!
We must get off!
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.
Whether we blow it off or blow it up.
Just don't blow it, friends!
Dave, I think you've been listening to too much commercial right now.
Alright, here, I'll give you a set up.
I'll give you guys a set up.
You can do the God is a cowboy one.
You can do a version of it.
Okay, when I point at you, you can just rant.
Whoever, Dave, you, you rant.
But on the theme of God and the Wild West.
But also, God is a cowboy.



God being an extraterrestrial cowboy.
Yeah, right, right.
Wearing gaucho chaps.
A chandelier belt.
Maybe a lonesome cow god.
Turquoise buckles.
Big old pair of lizard skin boots.
Denver lizard skin boots.
But, uh,
If, uh,
When I throw my hand up.
That's the script.
Stare away from your armpits.
Avert your gaze.
That's the other script. Don't breathe in, say enough.
You gotta stop for the chorus.
And then go preach all you want on the other part.
Okay, what's the finger sign for speaking Portuguese?
To give it a Brazilian flavor.
If I hold up the, hold up my finger green.
Then, yeah, just go for it, dude.
Okay.
What if you bend over and spread them?
What if God really is a cowboy?
And his favorite people of all, that's it.
You know, he's on America's side.
Because they were the cowboys.
He created cowboys here after he got done, you know,
Messing everything up.
And then he finally got it right.
When he made the cowboy,
God finally got it right.
What if God was Paul Bunyan?
Yee-haw!
Hehehehehehe!
That's right!
Woo-hoo!
Get along, little doggies!
Yeah!
Get along now!
Hyah-yah!
Listen, God is a cowboy!
That means you're his little cow.
That's right!
You know where God's taking you?
Little, little doggie?
Little bobby?
You know where God's
whipping you onto?
Well, don't you worry about that.
Because he's taking good care of you along the way.
He's fattening you up, baby!
Yes, sir!
You're God's little
future hamburger, baby.
He's gonna sell you at the market
at a good price.
He's gonna catch you down that trail.
That wild,
tumbleweed ridden,
rattlesnake sneaking trail.
Yes, God has got
his cats on!
That's all he's got on!
He's naked! Naked!
God must be a cowboy
He saw me in a dream
He rode in from my darkness
Onto my TV screen
Worked somewhere deep inside me
My passion it ignites
That God must be a cowboy
Riding through the night
Yeah, guess we got the job
alright. We're driving them
Brahma bulls back on down
to Laramie. Laramie's
quite a few fathoms from this
here reckoning. It looks like
we're gonna have to follow the stars.
But the stars we're gonna be
following aren't your usual stars
you see in the sky. They're the
stars you see when God beats you
over the head with that Winchester rifle!
Yee-haw!
Woo-hoo! Yee-haw!
You're going to heaven,
little bobbies! God's
taking you to heaven!
Ah, yes!
Ha!
God must be
a cowboy came to me
in a dream. He rode in
from my darkness onto my
TV screen. Worked somewhere
deep inside me. My passion
it ignites. That God must
be a cowboy riding
through the night. Get on! Get on
now! Yee-haw! You can't slow down!
We go to
destination. Boys and girls
we're going to this, this slot.
I mean heaven. Heaven is where
we're going at the end of this trail.
Yee-haw!
Get on! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hey, man. Hey, man. You're
on the wrong... Hey, wait! You're going the wrong way!
Wait!
Wait! You can't ride that bull
by. What are you doing on the back of that? Hey, man! Get over
there! Get on!
Get on, little
doggies! God must
be a bad man. It's a long trail.
We're almost there!
Hyah!
God must be a cowboy
came to me in a dream.
He rode in from my darkness
onto my TV screen.
Worked somewhere deep inside
me. My passion did ignite.
That God must be a cowboy
riding through the night.
Hey, uh, I
see the fire's off in the distance.
But that don't look like
the fire.
It looks like, it looks like
it looks like pokey slid into the old Jimmy's campfire.
Let's boozy on down
and have some beans and bread
and some cornbread. Oh, I love Johnny King.
Hey, let's all just get a
skin of women. Wait!
Wait! Those are the fires!
The hell! The fire!
My legs are on fire!
My
legs
are on fire!
Welcome aboard, boys!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Your slaughterhouse was first!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, God must be a cowboy, gave to me in a dream
He rode in from my darkness onto my TV screen
But somewhere deep inside me, my passion did ignite
That God must be a cowboy, riding through the night
And all my dreams...
My dream what?
That God is a cowboy?
A cowboy, very big, and... and with eyes!
Now I lay me down to sleep, in cold crystal patterns
I pray, I pray
Amino acid ancestors
Now I die, before I wake in silent void
And I'm no longer the same
No more...
Galactic space
Shimmering molecular designs
Are you trying to bum out the people that are tripping or something, Chaz?
Hey man, you trying to put a dodecahedron in the back of their conceptual shadow space now?
Hey man, life is a joke, it's alive!
Ha ha!
You...
You...
And friends, someday you're gonna shut up like hell.
So you better make... You better...
Better shout and make a lot of noise.
Because someday your vocal cords are going to be frozen.
Just like that is snow right to the left of your...
They're on the monitor.
So I'd like to give thanks to the universe for every single extra second that I get to live.
Praise Bob and hail Connie.
My God, there's at least seven minutes left of this life.
This little life captured forever on the spinning disks and reams.
So much more permanent than you or I.
We are but mayflies.
Bugs.
Perhaps just as we examine and pity and laugh at the little mayfly in its brief span.
Perhaps some larger creature is gazing upon us.
Perhaps our little world is but an aquarium.
And you are nailed to the door of perception.
Endlessly watching it swing open and shut.
Jesus came knocking but no one answered.
It's more like Prometheus on the dock waiting for the persecutor to let him be.
Buddha came knocking and they hit him on the head with a stick.
Bob came a knocking but you didn't have your thirty dollars.
And he was too thick.
And so Bob was wroth and wrath in his anger.
And he yanked upon the rug and spread the banana peels.
And so many fell and the bigger they fell, the harder Bob came.
And his laugh rang out for political corruptigation from holiday to holiday.
Very, very drastic disease in the body.
But he was healthy.
We thank our lord, Jesus, the five-master-lord.
In his big, shiny fangs.
For God has made us in his own image.
And he's tired of looking in the mirror.
No problem.

If you've got a plan,
Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs,
the living avatar of Slack.
You whom we thank
for our frop,
our
frankness,
our frang,
and our pang-eye,
and other things that the listener
does not know.
It is time
for all of you to decrease.
Let go of the many, many
foods you have been tempted to do.
Float downstream, dude. Black is the color and none is the number.
Turn off your mind.
Relax.
Void, void, void.
Anything that makes it
harder to pee
is anti-Slack.
J.R. Bob Dobbs, 1959.
I believe that
prunes are God's
answer to man's every
dilemma. Anything that makes it harder to
learn is also
anti-Slack. Reverend Ivan Stang, 2000.
We can only
offer our
sincere thanks for that.
So turn off that TV and turn up
your radio and read a
book every now and then. Food!
Oh, boy.
I've noticed.
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very.
It's Halloween, children.
It's spooky time.
Things are going to get weird, aren't they?
People act weird.
It's special.
It's amateur.
A great little wash in the back of your head.
Welcome to it.
Till next week.
For two hours, they see what my world is like 365 days a year.
Till next week.
Keep your hat on.
Tie your back to the wind.
You're sacking the saddle.
See y'all.
Well, I guess it's time to sniffle up to that old cosmic calendar
and count off another day.
Remember, the higher you vibrate, the greater your chances of a vibratory accident.

When I'm driving on parkways past midnight,
please pay attention to the small animals which you could strike with your mighty fist,
especially if you had a wheel and a window.
But that's only for a superior, super-evolved being,
something you would never be until you make your vibration level so much higher.
Just think of vibrating at higher levels.
Think of it.
Just keep it in your mind.
Take me home, silly boy.
Cause I'm still in love with you.
Take me home.
Thank you, Mom.
It's the neutral matter.
I can't stop doing it.
Oh.

From my point of view
She's so Stuart

Oh, time passes quickly
and I wanna find my way up to which path

Go to sleep
And dream of flying high
On lullabies
And dreams that Bob has now
Sex goddesses and squid
Shall hide away
The smiling face of Bob
Will keep you safe
Till your sex game
A sex goddess
Will keep you safe
By counting sheeples
Follow bulls
To the halfway bill
Follow blob
By following bull
Go to sleep
And dream of times when we
Will meet to sing
And praise the name of Bob
Sex goddesses and squid
Shall hide away
The smiling face of Bob
Will keep you safe
Till your sex game
A sex goddesses and squid
Shall hide away
The smiling face of Bob
Will keep you safe
Until your sex game

But keep my eyes to the ground
I go round and round
Like a sad little clown
Oh, oh, I get it
In my dream
I'm standing on the mountains on the moon
And I'm looking back at Earth
And there it is, just floating underneath me
And there's nothing holding it up
And it looks so small and fragile
And as it spins around there I think
Gosh, that's where it all started
That's where humans first took their first steps
That's where all the songs that were ever written were wrote there
All the deeds that were ever done
All the people who ever lived
All lived there
