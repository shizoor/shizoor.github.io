1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
She would never say where she came from.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,140
The Self-Genius Power of Bob.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,220
Today, we ain't got enough slack.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,560
We ain't got enough slack.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
Slack is what gives us breaks.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,520
Breaks on the car.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,520
Breaks on the train.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,360
Breaks to make you go insane.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,580
And slack is what brings you life.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,140
Life takes away your slack.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,240
Pussy waitresses take away your slack.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,060
Arrogant cashiers take away your slack.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,340
Insensitive employers take away your slack.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,400
Withholding tax takes away your slack.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,720
Life takes away your slack.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,040
What gives you back your slack?

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,480
What gives you back your slack?

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,140
Get on your balls!

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,960
That's what gives you back your slack.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,420
That's what now gives you back your slack.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,980
After I found Bob, I knew that everything was going to be all right from now on.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,580
You see, the aliens had been tampering with my brain

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,500
and been making me think that needy was the only way back.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,160
Oh, but dear friends, you know, once the slack was given to me,

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,540
the ropes of life should know...

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,380
I could no longer rip my brain asunder and twist the...

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,480
the very air from my throat.

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,480
Yes, dear friends, you found nothing like it till you find Bob.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,200
Because the peace that Bob has told me one day,

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,540
that unless I freed myself from Meaghy, they said,

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,340
Doctor, they said, physician, heal thyself!

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Oh, hear me, God, what I have heard so afraid.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,920
Spare me now!

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,380
No, don't you hear me!

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,100
Come pickle your memories now!

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,420
Indeed, the day before we first parted,

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,700
my heart sunk in breath.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,360
Oh my God!

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,360


40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,360


41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Oh, God, Working on my brain is so hard...

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,820
It's as if I'm exhausted!

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,540
But this side is too powerful to go on calling it a poem.

44
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,540


45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,540


46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,420
Freak, nut, and bug, and psychic bum.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,800
There, there they sit and cerebrate,

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,320
The fervid pote who never potes,

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,440
Great artistes, male or she, that talk,

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,780
But scorn the pigment and the chalk,

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,540
And cubists, sculptors, wild as goats,

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,220
Theosophists and swamis, too.

53
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,560
Two. Musicians mad as hatters be,

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,760
E'en puzzled hatters, two or three.

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,040
Tame anarchists, a dreary crew,

56
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,560
Squib socialists, too damp to soosh.

57
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,360
Fake hobohemians steeped in suds,

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,980
Glib females in artistic duds,

59
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,160
With captive husbands cowed and gauche.

60
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,460
I saw some soulmates,

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,760
Side by side, who said their cute young souls were pink.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,460
I saw a genius on the brink, or so he said, of suicide.

63
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,100
I saw a playwright who had tried,

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,020
But couldn't make the public think.

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,160
I saw a novelist who cried,

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,520
Sending his own stuff to his drink.

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,540
I met a vapid, egg-eyed gink,

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,440
Who said eight times,

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,000
Art is my bride.

70
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,180
A queen in sandals slammed the pans,

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,540
And screamed a Chinese chant at us.

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,080
The while a hippopotamus

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,140
Shook tables, bookshelves, and divans,

74
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,440
With vast terpsichorean fuss,

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,660
Some oriental kind of muss.

76
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,940
A rat-faced idiot boy

77
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,540
Who slimes white paper ore

78
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,420
With black and white,

79
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,320
And a black belt.

80
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,820
He is a kind of burbling blare,

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,380
Who warbles sex-slush sad to hear,

82
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,840
And mocks God in his stolen rhymes,

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,520
And wears a ruby in one ear.

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,180
Murmured to me,

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,420
My soul drinks song out of a golden bowl.

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,500
Drinks love and song,

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,940
My golden soul.

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,100
I let him live.

89
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,100
There were no bricks, or even now that golden soul were treading water in the sticks.

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:03,240
A pallid skirt, anemic wisp, as bloodless as a stick of chalk, got busy with this line of talk.

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,040
The sinner is misunderstood.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,580
How can the spirit enter in, be blended with the truly good, unless through sympathy with sin?

93
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,760
Frying, I murmured, sad and low, I pass the buck, I do not know.

94
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,620
Upon a mantle sat a bust, some Hindu god, pug-faced and squat,

95
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:36,820
a visage to inspire disgust, Lord Bilk, the deity of rot.

96
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,980
Nay, surely, t'was the great god Bunk, for when I wonked at it, it wonked.

97
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:52,020
I heard, I heard it proved that night, that fire is cold and black is white,

98
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,620
that junk is art and art is junk, that virtue's wrong and vice is right,

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,400
that death is life and life is death, that breath is rocks and rocks are breath,

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,560
and cheap and easy paradox, the fool springs, hoping that it shocks.

101
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,560
Brainsick, I stumbled to the stone.

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:23,000
street, and drooled to a friendly cop. Since moons have feathers on their feet, why is your headgear

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,720
perched on top? And if you scorn the commonplace, why wear a nose upon your face? And since Pythagoras

104
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:40,780
is mute on sex hygiene and cosmic law, is your blonde beast as bland a brute, as blind a brute

105
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:49,120
as Bernard Shaw? No doubt when drilling through the parks with Ibsen's ghost and old Doc Marks,

106
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:58,200
you've often seen two golden bowls drink suds and sobs from crystal bowls. It ain't, he says,

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:06,820
I ain't, old kid, and I would pinch him if I did. Thank God, I said, for this at least,

108
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,760
the world in spots is well-polished.

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,600
Ah, yes, dear friends, that was Onan Canabite, Uncle Reverend Dr. Onan Canabite, reading

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,120
Proim. Before that, we heard some media barrage tapes from the olden days, before our slack.

111
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,240
We used to edit these collections and collages that we called media barrages. We heard a little

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,760
bit of Pope David N. Meyer, Philo Drummond, yours truly as a child.

113
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:54,780
And, uh, uh, oh, and our titles and news are from Leigh Murr. Now, let us check out Massive Hot Dog Recall.

114
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,900
Why don't you try a juicy good hot dog? Mmm, delicious.

115
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,780
I'm a little bit of a fan of the olden days. I'm a little bit of a fan of the olden days.

116
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,540
Standing next to you in the vestibule, you dropped your mail, I picked it up for you

117
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,560
because you smiled and I'm demented. I consider this relationship cemented.

118
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,740
Why complicate things with self-control? I can see us dating right through my peephole.

119
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,760
I stand behind you on the edge of the road. I'm a little bit of a fan of the olden days.

120
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,940
I smell your hair, so I remember later, yeah. I know we never spoken, but because I'm broken,

121
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,780
I pretend that you're my lady.

122
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,120
Frily liberties in the laundry room. I keep sweating out the memory of your perfume.

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,440
You take the garbage out, I want you to do it. It's so intimate, we live sifting through it, yeah.

124
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:09,940
Yeah.

125
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And if you find out what I'm all about,

126
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,600
you will never be my lady.

127
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,680
Yeah.

128
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

129
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,560
guitar solo

130
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,220
Some moving van parked on our sidewalk

131
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm panic-stricken, baby, let's pretend to talk

132
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,320
Why are you doing this? Because I can't commit

133
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,540
You broke up with me and didn't even know it, yeah

134
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,420
I know we never spoke, but because I'm broken

135
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,300
I pretend that you're my lady

136
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,500
And if you find out what I'm all about

137
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,380
You will never be my lady

138
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,860
Oh, what a relief.

139
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,380
That was Massive Hot Dog Recall,

140
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,900
Al Motherspaugh's band,

141
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
that song Peephole,

142
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,020
and now let's call Dave.

143
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,180
It stinks up the atmosphere anyway,

144
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,860
and you're bound to believe it's the next one

145
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,800
from one to another.

146
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,880
You know, you start right off,

147
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,140
you think incredible Scientology

148
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,420
that you've heard and don't believe in anymore.

149
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,200
You know, any kind of sports vehicle

150
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,760
that you could possibly buy,

151
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,360
but that's why they had that whole reunion spectacle

152
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,820
or whatever they call it.

153
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,760
The, uh, the, uh,

154
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,560
Super Bowl.

155
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,960
Oh, yeah, that was just the other day.

156
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,040
And I guess they were having a Latin figurative

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,260
of the, uh,

158
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,580
it was the Spokane Blue Devils

159
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,740
versus the Rodimus Bosch

160
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,060
and the, you know,

161
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,680
twisted artists or something.

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,660
I don't know.

163
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,080
Did you have anybody invite you to a Super Bowl party?

164
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,920
Well, they invited me to a

165
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,300
chicken wing persecution complex

166
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,540
devotional ceremony.

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,740
And I was there.

168
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:09,740


169
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,100
I can't go to those things anymore

170
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,720
because my ankles are too fat.

171
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,820
And sometimes I'll grease up the steps

172
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,300
and that's it for me, you know.

173
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,920
Right in front of Father Perry and Father O'Malley.

174
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,800
They both were crying like babies.

175
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,060
Especially when I whipped it out,

176
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,460
you know, I showed them a picture of Bob.

177
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,780
My son was about to host a Super Bowl party.

178
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,540
And I went, huh?

179
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,500
He goes, actually, I've been doing that for 15 years.

180
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,480
And he goes, I know, you know,

181
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,940
it's not for the game.

182
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
It's for the commercials.

183
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,620
He makes commercials for a living.

184
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,160
That's his conspiracy job.

185
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,040
It's a real conspiracy job.

186
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,220
I mean, if you make commercials,

187
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,560
that's a pretty serious conspiracy job.

188
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,220
It's a real conspiracy

189
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,220
why only the wealthiest corporations in America

190
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,440
can afford to broadcast their commercials

191
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,080
for a living.

192
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,960
They're craving bestialities.

193
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,660
Well, no, actually.

194
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,860
They can write them off for taxes as advertising.

195
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,780
And essentially, a million or so,

196
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,560
millions of dollars cartoons,

197
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,360
you haven't paid for it.

198
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,540
Just the balloon part.

199
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,140
The cartoon balloon?

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Yeah, but you're allowed to fill in the blanks.

201
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,680
You know what I'm saying.

202
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,780
Yeah, well, I used to watch...

203
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,080
You don't have to pay for commercials,

204
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,060
but like they say,

205
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,580
you were like the local jeweler

206
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,280
or the lop-headed person's signal fire.

207
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,720
They still have those sometimes.

208
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,220
Well, you know, I used to work for the conspiracy

209
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,160
making commercials.

210
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,480
I just helped, though.

211
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,460
I wasn't the director.

212
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,060
So I wasn't nearly as successful

213
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,680
as a conspiracy servant as my son has been

214
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,060
because he's much better paid than I am.

215
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,480
I never was.

216
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,820
I used to write jingles

217
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,860
in semi-national markets, too.

218
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,700
Can you believe that?

219
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,220
You wrote jingles?

220
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,160
I wrote jingles and performed them

221
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,020
and did all the guitar and the bass work

222
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,880
and did all the singing and stuff like that.

223
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,260
I'm not surprised.

224
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,200
We all had to pass.

225
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,880
We all had wives at one point.

226
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,500
I want to be part of the world's thing just like you.

227
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,840
No, go ahead.

229
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,040
No, after you.

230
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,800
I insist.

231
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,500
We don't need every woman, sir.

232
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,400
Oh, no, no, no, no.

233
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,960
I insist.

234
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,420
No, no, no, no.

235
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,040
No, absolutely not.

236
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,100
I don't even remember what I was going to say.

237
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,740
Something vain, I'm sure.

238
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,520
Avaricious, full of vice and sexual powers.

239
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,660
Well, no, no.

240
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,480
More like full of yearning for such things.

241
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,180
You know, self-delusion to make me feel like,

242
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,300
you know, I'm a big shot

243
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,420
or a fancy schmancy,

244
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,160
one of the swells, you know, for half a second.

245
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,380
Well, you sat up there and smiled and said,

246
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm delusional.

247
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
Well, yeah, because then I look around

248
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,220
at my actual environment

249
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,200
and everything's covered with dust.

250
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,500
God, this dust.

251
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,480
And clown, yeah, clown.

252
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:29,940
Yep.

253
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
God, it's horrible.

254
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,720
I can make it a little darker

255
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,400
by blowing as hard as I can

256
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,280
on these black,

257
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,520
plastic-covered machines.

258
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,520
But really, I mean,

259
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,380
I could draw a little dinosaurs

260
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,740
and stuff in the dust on these things.

261
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,400
Blowing machines

262
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,460
and drawing dinosaurs?

263
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,460
Yeah.

264
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,620
Hey, careful.

265
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,120
I can't see you doing that.

266
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,080
I can't see you stooping down so low

267
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,840
you've got to make the micrometer putt.

268
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,840
Oh, yeah.

269
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,540
I can't see it.

270
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,080
I can see Bob as a golfer,

271
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,020
but not you as a waiter.

272
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,660
My head's a-bobbing.

273
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,760
And I'm a-bobbing.

274
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,660
Because I've got to blow the dust off the machines.

275
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,600
Just to make them look better.

276
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,380
They still work.

277
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,800
Well, I'm staring at a big old four-track

278
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,060
T-Act reel-to-reel player

279
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,220
that is here just

280
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,880
because it looks sort of cool.

281
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,020
But it's been destroyed by dust

282
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,140
over the centuries.

283
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,740
It's got a sound on sound,

284
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,260
one of those sound-on sound things

285
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,420
where you keep on bouncing back and forth.

286
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Right, that's how they did magical...

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,960
By the time you get to the fifth generation,

288
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,140
you're full of retards.

289
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,620
The Magical Mystery Tour was recorded

290
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,160
on a couple of four-tracks

291
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,860
bouncing back and forth.

292
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
Yeah, you got more tape hiss that way,

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,240
but nobody hears it.

294
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,840
More participation, though, too.

295
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,180
You can think of it that way

296
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,500
because a lot of waitresses

297
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,780
don't like to wear underpants

298
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,160
when they're serving people food

299
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,000
at the local...

300
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,060
What?

301
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,800
If I'd known that...

302
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,160
I'm not sure...

303
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm not sure...

304
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm not sure...

305
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,860
I'm not sure...

306
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:04,860


307
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm not sure...

308
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,640


309
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,640


310
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,640


311
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,540
Waitresses not wearing their pantalons

312
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,900
underneath their dainties?

313
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,180
I can't believe it.

314
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,900
A waitress?

315
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
Yeah, it's a new law.

316
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,560
Don't they get cold?

317
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,060
Well, of course they get cold.

318
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
It makes them want to, you know,

319
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,840
get warmed up.

320
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,420
You know what I'm saying?

321
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,260
Oh, man.

322
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
Well, I'm glad to know that.

323
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,520
I swear, Dave,

324
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,060
I wouldn't know anything cool

325
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,420
if it wasn't for you

326
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,480
and my other friends

327
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,780
that know the cool stuff.

328
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,180
Well, think of it.

329
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,040
I swear, man,

330
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,480
I didn't know about Me Too

331
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,320
until yesterday

332
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,500
and that's why I learned

333
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,220
all this stuff.

334
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,080
And it's definitely

335
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,540
important for us to...

336
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,500
Why?

337
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,600
I believe it's because

338
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,040
Jesus was taken

339
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,160
to the whipping post

340
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,200
before he shed his blood.

341
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,620
They stripped him

342
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,660
naked to the waist

343
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
and the man who carried the whip

344
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,560
brought the whip

345
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,780
down across his back.

346
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,800
This is what I saw

347
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,360
hundreds of years

348
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
before the manifestations

349
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,280
of Christ

350
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,300
when he said,

351
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,120
who hath believed our report

352
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,900
and to whom hath the arm

353
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,960
of the Lord been revealed?

354
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,380
For he was wounded

355
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,800
for our transgressions.

356
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,780
He was bruised.

357
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,360
Oh, he was tortured.

358
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,260
Yes.

359
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Yes, they took Jesus.

360
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,660
They tapped him.

361
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,480
Oh, they made him,

362
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,060
they made him a work

363
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,840
of 80 hours a week.

364
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,820
Yes.

365
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,640
Yes.

366
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,340
You think they let Jesus off easy?

367
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,680
Well, you see

368
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,180
what they're going to do to you,

369
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,920
my friend.

370
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,400
Oh, you think Jesus got it hard.

371
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,840
What, they're going to nail you up there

372
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
with electrified nails.

373
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,340
They'll put you on a cross

374
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,280
and make that old dead fish

375
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,440
and you'll have to

376
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,900
eat that or die.

377
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,320
Oh, they're going to,

378
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,720
oh, I can,

379
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,960
I can feel it.

380
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Oh, the pain,

381
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,780
the pain of my

382
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,840
religious spirit.

383
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,280
Oh, I love,

384
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,700
I love to be

385
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,300
nailed and,

386
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,160
and beaten and flogged,

387
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,500
oh yes,

388
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,660
by the nun

389
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,640
and the,

390
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,740
the altered voice.

391
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,140
Oh, oh,

392
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,260
bring them into me

393
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,760
and I'll just,

394
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,380
I'll,

395
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,220
they can tie me up.

396
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,060
You think I'm,

397
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,860
ah, they can't tie me up

398
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,980
because I'll bust loose my bonds.

399
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,800
I'll preach,

400
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,160
I'll preach pain and death and torment.

401
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,360
I'll preach,

402
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,180
ah, iniquity and evil.

403
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,980
Oh, they can't,

404
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,320
they can't hold me down.

405
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,060
They can talk about me all over Dallas County.

406
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,540
They can blacklist me from the film business.

407
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
They can send me out into the street

408
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,520
to exploit my blood

409
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,700
and, but hell,

410
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
I'll keep preaching damnation.

411
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,700
I'll preach death.

412
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,360
I'll preach about the heaven

413
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,760
that's gonna kill everybody.

414
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,140
Oh, oh yes, I'm gonna.

415
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,560
Do you think I oughta put a glossary in there

416
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,940
because some people say they can't understand it

417
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,760
and I'm, I was talking about Neighbor World.

418
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,300
Oh, yeah, neighbor,

419
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,720
well, no, I don't think you need to put a,

420
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
well, actually,

421
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,880
maybe you should.

422
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,040
I think there's a glossary at the end of Clockwork Orange.

423
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,120
Friends, Dave has,

424
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,680
brought up his novel Neighbor World,

425
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,360
which isn't selling fast enough

426
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,020
because I know you haven't bought one

427
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,120
and they're not expensive.

428
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,020
Anyway, it's so richly and imaginatively written

429
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,320
that people keep asking,

430
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,580
telling Dave that it needs a glossary

431
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,440
because he made up a lot of future words.

432
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,840
It takes place in the future with future words.

433
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
And I picked them all up from Contest.

434
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
You know, I had this,

435
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,540
this website called Context and you just go to it

436
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,120
and you type in loom or looming.

437
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,000
What does that mean?

438
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,960
And it's like getting high off of light pulses

439
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
that are made for that purpose

440
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,600
to keep the viewer glued to the screen

441
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,980
and with its mouth shut and obedient

442
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,300
and eventually brain damaged and carted off.

443
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,480
Well, you get. And eventually brain damaged and carted off.

444
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,940
And eventually brain damaged and carted off.

445
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,040
Where do they cart them off to?

446
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,520
The un-house.

447
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:10,840
The what?

448
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,240
The un-house.

449
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,240
Yeah, the un-house.

450
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,880
That's right.

451
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,180
Man.

452
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,720
Where everybody becomes like a product ID.

453
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,060
They become, you know, a mosquito, so to speak.

454
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,380
A swarm of many of one.

455
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,920
You know, I told you that my,

456
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,720
the most dependable science fiction reviewer,

457
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,340
high end science fiction aficionado,

458
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,000
that I know loved Neighbor World.

459
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,400
That's G. Gordon Gordon.

460
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,240
He's the guy turned me on to Ian M. Banks

461
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,080
and a whole lot of other just fabulous stuff

462
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
I wouldn't have known about otherwise.

463
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,680
And so I was glad to turn him on to one

464
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,060
that was yours.

465
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,020
On the other hand, I don't think my sister,

466
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,080
I sent my sister one in jail

467
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,140
and she didn't say anything about it.

468
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,320
She asked me, what, Luke?

469
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,980
What the looming was?

470
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,180
And I thought, uh-oh, that's not a good sign.

471
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,460
And I think she kind of gave up on it.

472
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,820
Of course, she also had these Neil Stevenson

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,380
highly educational novels to read over and over again.

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,220
Yeah, especially the population.

475
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Princess, we just finished Neighbor World.

476
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,760
It only took her a year and a half.

477
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
It's not really a very long book, Franz.

478
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,020
But you can't skim it.

479
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,600
Because you have to concentrate on what the hell is going on.

480
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,660
Because it is like Clockwork Orange.

481
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,860
Now, some people would pick up that book and say,

482
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,700
well, it's just nonsense.

483
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,360
There's no such thing as these words.

484
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,620
That's because they don't speak Russian or nursery rhyme.

485
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:01,120
But there's an actual sensible reason for that weird slang

486
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,300
that those bad juvenile delinquents use.

487
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,300


488
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,300


489
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,300


490
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,080
And it's a future England talk.

491
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,160
You know, the funny thing is that it's like an old documentary.

492
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,140
It's like, oh, yeah, Clockwork Orange, the future.

493
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,920
All that stuff started happening 30 years ago,

494
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,220
right after he made the movie.

495
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,900
Partly because of the movie, I'm sure.

496
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,260
I mean, I used to dress up in a clown suit

497
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,360
with a cane and a bow tie.

498
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,560
And my friends and I would go around.

499
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,440
And, well, we beat each other up.

500
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,600
You and your three dudes?

501
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,160
Drew?

502
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,280
Drew?

503
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,280


504
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,320
You and your three droogies?

505
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,300
Yeah, the droogies.

506
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,960
And we beat each other up.

507
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,280
And mostly just for videos or films.

508
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,740
We didn't have video then.

509
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Thank god there was no YouTube then.

510
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,680
Yeah, we used to try and crash pretty poly.

511
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,360
And there was times when we'd be, well, we'd go out

512
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,820
and have a shave in the rain.

513
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
Have you ever tried that?

514
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,120
You get one of those, like, foaming at the mouth.

515
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,940
Well, I don't know.

516
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,400
I did try to figure out something as close to VeloCet

517
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,440
or VeloCet as I could.

518
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,140
That was the one I was interested in.

519
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,000
What were the other ones?

520
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,540
VeloCet would put knives in your blood

521
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,520
and make you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.

522
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,340
Yep.

523
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,440
Molecle Plus.

524
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,140
Molecle.

525
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,620
Right.

526
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,460
I got the impression that that was sort of like psilocybin

527
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,160
chemical.

528
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,440
Like mushrooms.

529
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,780
And yeah, boy, those were some great drinks back then.

530
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,800
You know, when Molyco was recreational, you know,

531
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,340
it was legal.

532
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,540
Now you can only get it if you have a prescription.

533
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,240
And only in certain states.

534
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,400
And all of ultraviolence was important, too.

535
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,300
They didn't let you forget it for a moment.

536
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,860
You didn't even have to go and apply.

537
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,300
You could just become rearranged right in the middle of the sea,

538
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,140
or, you know, you could just go back.

539
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,860
You know, right in the carpet right in front of the boss.

540
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,940
And you say, watch this, and then disincarnate, reincarnate,

541
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,720
fly out the window.

542
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,080
Boy, it just irritates the hell out of me.

543
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,700
I don't even know what it is.

544
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,860
Oh, by the way, Princess Weave's conclusion about Neighbor World

545
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,160
was that it was really weird.

546
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,060
And the ending was not what she was expecting.

547
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,140
And she considered it a very, very weird ending.

548
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,140


549
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,140


550
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,140


551
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,720
And she thought it was a very unusual book,

552
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,300
because it doesn't have the same kind of structure or cliches

553
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,900
or progression that you kind of expect from a modern-day

554
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,260
quickie airport thriller.

555
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,000
Well, somebody told me, does the hero get what he wants?

556
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,380
Which is, you know, the, what's it called,

557
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,760
that the motivations part of fulfilling your job as a novelist

558
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,520
or fiction writer?

559
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,200
What do they call that?

560
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,460
Sales?

561
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,120
It says, wouldn't the hero get what he wants?

562
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,620
No, when the hero or heroine gets their whatever their wish is.

563
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,620
It's like, when I grow up, I'm going to be,

564
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,740
and it's the story of Janet Fiswick.

565
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,380
Well, but all Standard wants is just a half,

566
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,680
a little bit of breathing space, just a tiny bit of slack.

567
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,620
If you understand so good, Stan, if you were a man or a woman

568
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,680
or something, I'd probably introduce you

569
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,920
to my friends over here.

570
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,100
It has a happy ending in much the same way that, you know,

571
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,100


572
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,100


573
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,400
that Terry Gilliam movie, Brazil, has a happy ending.

574
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,060
Yeah, I've heard that.

575
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,560
I think that might be true.

576
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,480
So, anyway, friends, I can't, you know,

577
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,680
we can't recommend things like Neighbor World.

578
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,560
Enough!

579
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,340
This isn't a call to action.

580
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,720
This is just food for thought.

581
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,520
Just chew on it for a while,

582
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,800
like those rawhide strips that the dogs love so much.

583
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Mm-mm.

584
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,420
They keep them busy for 15 minutes.

585
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,400
That book will keep you busy for 15 minutes per page.

586
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,140
It's kind of like reading Finnegan's Wake.

587
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,280
You have to keep going back to the Cliff Notes

588
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,140
to figure out what the heck's going on.

589
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,320
But that's good.

590
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
That means it's not the same old pap.

591
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,000
It's not just that mediocre pap.

592
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,500
It's either so bad that it's amazing,

593
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,540
or it's so good that it's amazing.

594
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,840
Either way, it's amazing.

595
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,720
For those who have the spirit of discernment,

596
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,440
for those who have eyes to read the 10-point print,

597
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,360
and it is 10-point Garamond.

598
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,400
Garamond?

599
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,140
Yeah, it may even be 12-point.

600
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,000
Well, I didn't want it to be over 11.5 points.

601
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,420
Well, I mean, it takes up more paper

602
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,780
and becomes more expensive the bigger the print is, but...

603
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,660
Well, it's like your forehead gets bigger.

604
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,800
For what reason?

605
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,520
Well, you left crying in the rain.

606
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,820
My eyes got smaller.

607
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,180
They were like little rotten, shrunken olives

608
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,460
that dried out.

609
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,780
Magnifying glasses.

610
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,480
Yeah, or some kind of expensive machine

611
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,740
that pumps the words directly into my brain

612
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,720
from an E-book.

613
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,320
Oh!

614
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,640
Book pills, they call them.

615
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,960
You just take a book pill...

616
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,300
Yeah.

617
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,020
You got the gist of it.

618
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,820
It's not like reading it exactly, but you can talk about it at parties like I just did.

619
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,120
And you have kind of a gut feeling about everything.

620
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,440
It's like a denouement.

621
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,140
Isn't that the truth?

622
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,220
I never had the book pill of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,

623
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,360
and it's just starting to come on now that I remember.

624
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,580
All I remember is eating squid with Burt Lancaster in the movie.

625
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,400
I never even saw that movie.

626
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,920
I've only read the comic book a hundred times, Classics Illustrated.

627
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,320
That story is ripe for a remake, a giant big-budget remake,

628
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,560
where they change the basic gist of the whole thing

629
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,740
and add a real hot-looking woman in distress.

630
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,360
Yeah, and Kissinger, you know the old guy Kissinger,

631
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,380
could be dressed up like Captain Nemo and stuff,

632
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,000
and he'd kind of sound like a pervert?

633
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,120
Well, Kissinger's dead, I think.

634
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,120
Wouldn't it have to be somebody?

635
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,800
I think he might have Mandela's disease.

636
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, God, yeah, where you only remember the alternate universe.

637
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,780
Right.

638
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,780
You only remember the things that didn't actually happen.

639
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,980
Yeah, string theory with no strings attached.

640
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:56,840
Yeah.

641
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,580
Yeah.

642
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah.

643
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:57,820
Yeah.

644
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,240
Yeah.

645
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,400
Yeah.

646
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:58,560
Yeah.

647
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


648
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


649
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


650
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


651
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


652
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


653
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


654
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


655
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


656
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


657
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560


658
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,420
A little bit over my head.

659
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,740
I can't remember.

660
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,120
What's the difference?

661
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,620
I can't remember accurately any of it anyway.

662
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,000
It's all Mandela effect for me,

663
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,240
combined with butterfly effect from that one time that I tried the time machine.

664
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,200
God, I should have known better.

665
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:23,180
I'd probably be rich by now if I hadn't gone back there and tried to make myself rich.

666
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,480
I thought it was terrible that you didn't let people think it was very nice.

667
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,320
I thought it was very nice and entertaining to read my book.

668
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,060
You make it sound like it's a treatise on physical logical by Aristopheles.

669
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,760
No, no, but it is.

670
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,660
It does require, I mean, it's fun for me because I like that kind of thing.

671
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,420
It's challenging.

672
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:53,960
One of my favorite novels is Anathem by Neal Stephenson, which also is told in future slang.

673
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,540
And, of course, the aforementioned.

674
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:58,560


675
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:58,560


676
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,900
And the clockwork orange, you see.

677
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,060
I love future slang, though, don't you also?

678
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,840
I mean, I thought that would be nice.

679
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,260
Most people would just go like, he said he's going to spur the client on his quenching,

680
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,800
and then it was time for Tuesday, so we all drool together.

681
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,380
And everybody would applaud.

682
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,960
And they'd say, we don't exactly, precisely know what that means,

683
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,920
but we kind of know enough to read the next page.

684
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,680
You know, what we should do is send that book to some famous authors.

685
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,380
But, okay.

686
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,260
The only authors that I know are people who are so unknown that they send books to me,

687
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,800
hoping I'll write a blurb for it.

688
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,760
And I do.

689
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,880
I always say things like, you know, a rollicking rollercoaster of thrills.

690
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,900
Surely another bestseller.

691
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,020
Intoxicating.

692
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,380
Well, I did that for your book.

693
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,160
I did a whole foreword and wrote blurbs on the back and everything.

694
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,400
But, you know, I can't, it's like, if I send it to Terry Pratchett, he's going to go,

695
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,080
who are you?

696
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,560
And besides, I'm dead.

697
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,740
If I could, you know, I could send it to Douglas Adams, I'll get the same response.

698
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,680
Actually, Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams did know about Church of the Subgenius.

699
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,700
And Douglas Adams even gave us a little tip of the hat in one of his books with a planet named Bob.

700
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,540
And the reason is I gave him a copy at a book signing in Dallas.

701
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,220
He'd never heard of it, but I handed him a copy of the book.

702
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,560
And a while later, he said, I gave him a copy of the book.

703
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,040
And a while later, it paid off because he made us feel good about it.

704
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:40,160
But see, what you've got to do is you've got to just go show up at the front doorsteps of these authors.

705
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,980
Like J.D. Salinger, you ought to track him down.

706
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,460
And just, you know, knock on the door disguised as a mailman and then shove it in his face and go,

707
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,620
here, just take this and don't tell anybody.

708
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,280
And of course, that means they'll have to tell everybody.

709
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,180
Well, what was that?

710
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,540
That was that movie with Stubborn.

711
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,860
By Stephen King, the book.

712
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,820
What was that one?

713
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,760
No, what?

714
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,420
Where the writer gets...

715
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:10,020
That book by Stephen King where the writer gets trapped by a lady who...

716
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,020
Misery.

717
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,180
Misery.

718
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,980
Well, actually, that's about five Stephen King books.

719
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,200
Any given plot that you go, what?

720
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,780
That one Stephen King book about the guy that can't sleep?

721
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, there's always five of those.

722
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,980
I think it was the third one.

723
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,940
They're all pretty good, though.

724
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,300
I mean, they're all page turners.

725
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,380
I'm not putting down Stephen King.

726
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,900
I think he's a real good storyteller.

727
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,520
I think The Stand is one of the great American...

728
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,920
It's like the great American novel.

729
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,960
I read it during flu season, too.

730
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,800
That was fun.

731
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,180
Probably Neighbor World is, too, though.

732
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,560
Right.

733
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,260
Just think about it.

734
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,860
Yeah, but they just don't know yet.

735
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,280
That's why they all need to go to indoctrination camps.

736
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,320
Because we can't just let people not think whatever they want to.

737
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,280
Well, now, for one thing...

738
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,380
We have to teach most of them how to read all over again.

739
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,680
You know, because they go to school,

740
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,980
and that just teaches them how to punch a keyboard and watch TV.

741
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,140
And putting little things on the keyboard

742
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,980
or taking, like, little notes into the books.

743
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,800
That doesn't work anymore because of the surveillance device.

744
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,260
Well, and they use...

745
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,340
I don't know if you've...

746
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,280
Well, Dave, you don't do a lot of texting.

747
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,880
But nowadays, you don't really have to type out a word.

748
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,060
You start to type out the word in little picture forms.

749
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,920
So you just stop, you know, then you can go on to the next word picture.

750
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,020
Like, if I type dog, a cute little picture of a dog,

751
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,300
tiny, but the size of the word appears on the screen.

752
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,160
If you go...

753
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,220
I love that.

754
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,600
A heart will appear instead of the word.

755
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,480
So it's getting to the point now where it's like,

756
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,420
if you just know the first letter of a word,

757
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,100
then the machine will fill in the comic book version of the word.

758
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,420
Iconograms.

759
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,320
And nobody really has to, you know, it's like,

760
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,620
whoa, he sent me some message about a dog.

761
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,060
Lol.

762
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,880
Yep.

763
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,380
Iconograms and so forth and whatnot.

764
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,160
Just, you know, these messages that I or you or I

765
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,860
would take half an hour to decipher

766
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,020
just because of the obscurity of the images shown

767
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,380
and believe, of course, incredible as it may seem.

768
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,080
Iconograms and so forth and whatnot.

769
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,060
Iconograms and so forth and whatnot.

770
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,040
Iconograms and so forth and whatnot.

771
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,420
She's got a place, a vanity place

772
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,740
in her head.

773
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,040
It's in her head.

774
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,380
In her head.

775
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:03,380


776
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,320
She's consciously conspicuous

777
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,020
on the screen.

778
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,580
wrong side of ridiculous

779
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,460
She doesn't

780
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,000
listen much

781
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,600
Just like

782
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,480
everyone else

783
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,820
She had her mindset

784
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,000
on and now

785
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,400
now it's in her head

786
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,100
When you look for it

787
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,980
you won't see it

788
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,260
but she'll tell you

789
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,040
you would stare

790
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,000
in her head

791
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,320
She's got a blade, a vanity blade

792
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,580
in her head

793
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,920
This is not a vigorous speech

794
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,520
She's literally got a vanity

795
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,380
in her head

796
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,700
She's got a blade, a vanity blade

797
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,080
in her head

798
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,900
That was Massive Hot Dog Recall again.

799
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
The song Vanity Plate.

800
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,460
That's Al Mothersbaugh on trombone and singing.

801
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,840
Let's eavesdrop in on Philodrummond and Bleepo Abernathy

802
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,380
from a recording made just a couple of weeks ago.

803
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:52,700
Hello.

804
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,620
Hey.

805
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:54,880
Are you there?

806
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,240
Jeffery? dessasenglishondetsenglish.com

807
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,240


808
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Oh, there you are.

809
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,280
I see Bleepo.

810
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,300
You're there.

811
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,560
Bleepo has reappeared.

812
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,140
There.

813
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,640
Yes.

814
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,560
The thing, it pops out.

815
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,080
It's crazy.

816
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,300
Crazy.

817
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,820
It's crazy.

818
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,480
It's nuts.

819
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,200
It's insane.

820
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,420
It goes in and comes out.

821
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,540
There we go.

822
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,860
But now we got it back.

823
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,200
Well, yeah.

824
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,540
Yeah.

825
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,420
I see a big BK.

826
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,020
It should be BA.

827
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,520
I know.

828
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,700
It defaults.

829
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
It defaults to the hamburger setting.

830
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,540
Facebook was cruel to me.

831
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,420
Cruel.

832
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,800
I know.

833
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,320
I know.

834
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,920
They made you take on that whole other thing.

835
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,840
It was much crueler to me than it was to you, though.

836
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,580
Well, they won't let me use my real name.

837
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,900
They make me use my human street name that I was born with.

838
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,700
They let me use my real name for a long time.

839
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,140
Like for four or five years.

840
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,980
And then some rat like Sam Stutler routed me.

841
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:50,700
Yeah.

842
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,320
Yeah.

843
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,220
It's funny that my Facebook suddenly.

844
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:03,140
Suddenly busted me right after that little flurry of butthurt involving bears on the

845
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,340
X day Facebook page.

846
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,020
Yeah.

847
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,440
Huh?

848
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,260
Well, but wait, Philo.

849
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,460
I still I still have two Philos that I'm friends with on Facebook.

850
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,580
There's still two people named Philo that I'm friends with.

851
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,300
Well, who's the other one?

852
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,460
I don't know.

853
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,000
There's two of them.

854
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
They had the same little head.

855
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,120
One of them.

856
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,520
One of them is dead and one is alive.

857
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,280
This Schrodinger's Philo.

858
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,460
Actually, it's one time I started a page.

859
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,780
Like a celebrity page.

860
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,780
Yeah, that's what they told me to do.

861
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,520
And I did that.

862
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,700
Now I'm burdened with having to keep it up.

863
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,160
Yeah, they said.

864
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,420
They said, oh, you want to be known as Ivan Sang.

865
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,180
We just started a fan page with that name.

866
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,600
But that's not the same.

867
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,420
No, I know.

868
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,560
No, it's not the same.

869
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,220
It's like a.

870
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:52,740
It's.

871
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,240
It's.

872
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,600
Fuck.

873
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,300
I hate it.

874
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

875
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,940
Oh, I mean, it's bad.

876
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,780
It's bad.

877
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,160
It's bad.

878
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,020
Man, I'm going to send literal physical CDs out to radio stations.

879
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,560
Okay.

880
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,240
But college radio stations.

881
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,520
Five of them.

882
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,180
Or.

883
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,940
Yeah, that's all it is.

884
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,620
No, they talk.

885
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
They talk a lot worse than we do.

886
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,800
Oh, they sure do.

887
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,960
But, you know, college stations don't have lawyers on retainer.

888
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,780
Mm hmm.

889
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,320
And they can lose everything if they get fined.

890
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,000
And, of course, there's always some agenda person out there that wants to close down

891
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,560
the station for whatever reason.

892
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,600
Because they played a George Carlin record.

893
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,020
Yeah.

894
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,780
Or whatever, you know, something they don't like.

895
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,240
But they said something I don't like.

896
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,100
What was it?

897
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,220
I don't know, but I don't know.

898
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,980
I don't like it.

899
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,900
I just know I don't like it.

900
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,560
And did you ever dream that you're.

901
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,040
Your nose will smell like Cyrano de Bergerac?

902
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,060
Well, I have certainly tried.

903
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,200
Actually, I kind of have.

904
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,800
Yeah.

905
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,620
Yeah.

906
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,140
You're not alone, Dave.

907
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,200
You're not alone.

908
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,940
Well, I was.

909
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,200
I wasn't worried about that.

910
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,940
But now I am.

911
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,780
I'm looking over my shoulder.

912
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,840
And listeners, you're not alone.

913
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,720
You're listening to your old pals.

914
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,980
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Stang.

915
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,940
And we.

916
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,640
We're your friends.

917
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,180
We want you to be.

918
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,540
You know, we want to lift you for just a second out of your mundane, confusing world.

919
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,560
And come into our mundane, confusing world.

920
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,580
At least it's a change for 59 minutes and 30 seconds.

921
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,080
That's the only way.

922
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah.

923
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:50,460
Oh, Dave, I saw somebody said a mean thing about me on Facebook.

924
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,400
Well, they're known to do that.

925
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:53,660
Yeah.

926
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,500
It started with a funny picture.

927
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:04,360
There's a picture of Les Claypool, who is a kind of a funny rock and roller.

928
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,020
He had a band called Primus or Premus or something.

929
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,280
Primus is what it was called.

930
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,560
Yeah.

931
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,700
And they had a picture of him and he had long hair and a goatee.

932
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,940
And then they put a picture of me that I just recently posted.

933
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,540
And he said that was like separated at Bergerac.

934
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,220
Is Stang and Les Claypool the same or something like that?

935
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,780
Some guy said, and we didn't look that much alike.

936
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:38,220
But this one guy comes in and he goes, well, Stang is like 20 years older than Les Claypool

937
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,240
and has one twentieth as much originality.

938
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,580
Or he's one twentieth as creative.

939
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,500
That was it.

940
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,900
It's like, I felt like going, well, man, since you can quantify creativity, you must really

941
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,580
know how to.

942
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
You must know all about that.

943
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,480
So why don't you fill us in on what Reverend Stang should be doing differently?

944
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,160
Oddly enough, I'd never heard of this person.

945
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,000
I think his name was Feral Him on Facebook.

946
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,860
Something like that.

947
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,260
A likely name is probably a Soviet artist.

948
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,680
Again, once as usual, they're still hiding around the entire world.

949
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,240
Some of them go to Argentina first and they come back and they know just how to hurt you.

950
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,660
How to get you right in the old gonads.

951
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,280
They'll start building.

952
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,160
They'll start building you up like you think you're Michelangelo and next thing you know

953
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,320
they've got you down on the floor like in some kind of Mexican wrestling movie.

954
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,720
Just twist you.

955
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,320
Well, I've learned the hard way to do it the easy way.

956
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:45,340
When somebody attacks you on the internet, the meanest thing you can do is ignore it.

957
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,380
Really?

958
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:52,880
Because the only reason they're doing it is so that they'll feel like they've got a

959
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,480
dig in it, that famous guy, which makes them feel better.

960
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,680
But if they don't know that the famous guy ever saw their dig, then it was just pointless

961
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,820
jealousy.

962
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,740
Just another example of them being a jealous loser.

963
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,220
The fastest gun in the West, only nobody gets really shot with a real gun.

964
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,240
They just get like their egos deflated by a retard.

965
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,860
Besides, I don't think I've ever stolen any gags from Les Claypool because I didn't even know him.

966
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
I didn't even know what that band was.

967
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,720
But they did a movie and they stole a gag from us.

968
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,920
Is it the extremely large cowboy hat?

969
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,400
Yeah, they mention this guy has built a house in a tree and he's showing off his toilet.

970
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,160
This is a mockumentary.

971
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,580
He's showing off his toilet and he says, and this is the excremeditation chamber, I call it.

972
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,480
I thought, oh, that's a little tip of a hat.

973
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,180
There's one like that in Wayne's World.

974
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,160
They refer to a band that was actually a band that Philo and I had.

975
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,060
I'll go ahead and say it, the Shitty Beatles.

976
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,780
You even see them walking by in the background and they're in Beatle outfits.

977
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,580
And Wayne looks over and goes, oh, so it's not just a clever name.

978
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,720
They went to the trouble of dressing as Beatles.

979
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,660
I guess they smelled like that too.

980
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:19,720
So.

981
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,160
Hey.

982
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,320
So, you know.

983
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,680
You know, every movie's got one rip off of Church of the Subgenius in it if you just

984
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,500
know where to look.

985
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,440
Whereas we don't rip off those movies.

986
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,520
Yeah we do.

987
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,820
In fact, the music that I've been, the music I'm playing in the background comes from the

988
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,400
movie Quest for Fire, a caveman movie.

989
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,960
Oh, I love caveman movies.

990
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,580
Hey, the president's on the radio right now.

991
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,680
Oh, that's right.

992
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,300
He's doing the SOB.

993
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,640
The SOB speech.

994
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,620
Uh, well, Dave, you know what?

995
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:02,560
We have recorded 54 minutes of something and I'm probably going to split it up into two

996
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,640
shows because I've got.

997
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,380
Hey, wait until you hear what's coming up next.

998
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,020
This great new song by.

999
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:19,180
Will have you standing on your forehead with joy and dancing with your fingers.

1000
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,140
So.

1001
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,440
I love dancing with my fingers.

1002
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:30,680
You know, the Kansas City Star about two years ago had one of these culture icon battles

1003
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:36,160
where they would pit one cultural icon against another cultural icon, and people would vote

1004
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,640
on it, and who would win.

1005
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,180
But it was always weird things.

1006
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,680
It was like, The Beatles versus a Snickers candy bar.

1007
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
Which one do you like better?

1008
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,200
You know?

1009
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,260
Yeah.

1010
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,680
And it was like, the New York Yankees versus a Hula hoop.

1011
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,120
Which one do you like better?

1012
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,120


1013
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,740
do you like better? You remember that? It was crazy. Anyway, it went on for weeks and weeks

1014
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:59,940
and weeks. And once all the cultural icons were voted down to the final, final, final,

1015
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,040
you know what won the final last thing that won? Johnny Cash.

1016
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,360
Wrong song.

1017
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:36,380
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine. I keep my eyes wide open all the time. I keep

1018
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:44,540
the ends out for the tie that binds. Because you're mine, I walk the line.

1019
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:05,880
I find it very, very easy to be true. I find myself alone when each day's through. Yes,

1020
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:14,340
I'll admit that I am a fool for you. Because you're mine, I walk the line.

1021
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:34,280
As sure as night is dark and day is light, I keep you on my mind both day and night.

1022
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:44,280
And the happiness I've known proves that it's right. Because you're mine, I walk the line.

1023
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:05,740
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine. I keep my eyes wide open all the time. I keep

1024
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:14,060
the ends out for the tie that binds. Because you're mine, I walk the line.

1025
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:37,380
I walk the line as performed by the great Bob Walkenhorst on the DVD called Live and On Purpose,

1026
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:49,360
2006. You're listening to The Hour of Slack, episode number 1714. For more information about

1030
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,320
This is PR News.

1031
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,640
Yeah, so that means we have to, like, wrap it up. It's been...

1032
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,100
Okay, well, I'll just say it's been a wonderful experience knowing you're here tonight on

1033
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:08,160
this, especially the developmental pockets. They're trying to make up different allegiances,

1034
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:14,000
grow and prosper across the land and across the many different genus and phylum lands.

1035
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,400
I'm, uh, uh, genus or phylum, um, categories.

1036
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:26,020
I did that. Yesterday, Dave, I did, uh, two different radio shows for a total of, uh, two and a half hours.

1037
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:33,980
One was a legitimate, uh, radio show out of Austin about the South by Southwest Film Festival,

1038
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:43,600
which is showing the Subgenius documentary on March 10th. And, uh, they, this little, this show called Lights, Camera, Austin,

1039
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,380
uh, interviewed the director, Sandy Boone, and she was in the studio with him.

1040
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,120
And the, and...

1041
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,120


1042
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,120


1043
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,120


1044
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,120


1045
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:55,540
And I was there on the phone. And, uh, so that was one of those professional type ones.

1046
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:07,020
Then last night, I got on the new Young Subgenius Turks show, uh, Time for the Show is the name of the show.

1047
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,580
It's the Time for the Show show.

1048
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,280
I'd like to appear on them one time, too.

1049
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:18,480
Well, Dave, it's kind of like Tarzan's radio station, but even more futuristic.

1050
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,820
You, you, you...

1051
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:25,680
They can't put you on unless you have a computer. You have to talk. They use a program called Discord.

1052
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,180
Oh.

1053
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,560
And, uh, that's...

1054
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,980
It's similar to Skype, isn't it?

1055
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,320
Sort of, yeah. Kind of.

1056
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:43,840
Uh, Philo and Bleepo and I did a show a couple of weeks ago that, where we used, uh, FaceTime audio.

1057
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:48,100
But we could do that because we all three have iPhones.

1058
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,800
I don't think...

1059
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:55,820
I think it would work with somebody who didn't have an iPhone. We'd have to use Discord, which, to me, sounds horrible.

1060
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,340
Uh...

1061
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,400
Yeah, but Humpty Trumpty sat on a wall.

1062
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,100
Right.

1063
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,840
And that's... And they, they just got done applauding for half an hour about that.

1064
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,900
I guess...

1065
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,880
Well, it's been going on for longer than half an hour.

1066
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:12,840
Well...

1067
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,800
Humpty Trumpty...

1068
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:19,380
That's your time. You, you, you, you live where the people have no focus or their focus is completely different.

1069
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:19,720
No.

1070
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,220
No, ours is central.

1071
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,480
Our, our focus is right in the center.

1072
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,420
Central time.

1073
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:30,960
Do you know that CNS stands for central nervous system, but it also stands for collective nostril spaces?

1074
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,780
No, you do not...

1075
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,040
That explains why those pills messed me up so bad.

1076
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,500
Yeah, if you take enough, enough of those pills, you could...

1077
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,220
They say you resemble Christ.

1078
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,000
Or whatever that means.

1079
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,000
I don't want to do that.

1080
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,780
He was pretty beat up in most of the pictures.

1081
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,380
I've seen.

1082
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,860
Yeah, I don't mean to be disrespectful either.

1083
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,460
I understand.

1084
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,880
You know, he was going through that for our sins.

1085
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,020
I, I get it.

1086
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,720
I just, uh, I don't want to, you know, it ain't me, babe.

1087
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,620
No, no, no.

1088
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,300
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.

1089
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,080
Don't nail me up on that thing.

1090
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:08,720
Yep.

1091
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:17,620
You know, whatever you say, Emperor Brutus, I need all this, whatever you're, you know, king of the most of the modern world at the time.

1092
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,560
Yeah, we'll have it your way.

1093
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,520
You know, I'm not going to go out there.

1094
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
That's what Bob said.

1095
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,660
And you can, and kids...

1096
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:32,860
Well, think of how much bigger the empire is now with Bob trying to stir things up and not stir them up at the same time.

1097
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,700
Oh, he's, you're right.

1098
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,220
He's mainly just selling popcorn to the end of the world spectacle.

1099
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,580
You know, he's, he's, he's the guy going hot dog, get him while you can.

1100
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,100
Hot dogs, the last 10 on earth, only a dollar each.

1101
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,460
It turns out there's 10 more hot dogs.

1102
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,160
Every human that's ever lived.

1103
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:51,880
Oh, yeah.

1104
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,420
Yeah, but they're made out of humans.

1105
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,500
Well, of course.

1106
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,060
Poor humans.

1107
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,040
Poor humans.

1108
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,220
Only the richest people have a dollar for that hot dog.

1109
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:17,200
Anyway, we should go, except that anyone wants to know more about Neighbor World and its fringe related projects like the Church of the Subgenius.

1110
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,240
You can look at Subgenius.

1111
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,040
com.

1112
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,660
And there is going to be a big party in Austin March 10th if they can just find a new venue.

1113
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,400
Some rich company bought the venue that Sandy had.

1114
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,080
She was going to throw a party, a free party for everybody.

1115
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,480
Anybody wanted to come to it.

1116
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,680
They do that at party centrals all over the country.

1117
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,760
It was a devival.

1118
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,480
But the problem is it's in the middle of South by Southwest.

1119
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:48,860
And I mean, a Motel 6 outside of town costs 400 bucks a night during South by Southwest.

1120
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,740
So finding...

1121
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:56,380
Any place that you can have a party in besides the Walmart parking lot is really hard.

1122
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:04,540
I told her I was up for standing on an apple crate at the Walmart parking lot and leading a little devival.

1123
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,780
You know, she can hand out the drinks and food.

1124
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,840
We'll have a party.

1125
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,380
But, you know, the man always shows up.

1126
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,800
That's happened to us before.

1127
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,160
Anyway, it's Subgenius.com.

1128
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,200
And you can learn everything about it.

1129
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,780
And we're going to be famous.

1130
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,800
We're going to be famous for about a month because that movie is actually pretty good.

1131
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,540
And it'll probably end up on Netflix or someplace.

1132
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,840
And everybody will go, oh, I had no idea it was like that.

1133
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,460
I completely envisioned it as something completely different.

1134
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,200
Church and Subgenius.

1135
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:35,480
Wow.

1136
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,100
It's not anything like I thought.

1137
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,420
I'm going to send them $35 now.

1138
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,140
Of course, by the time that happens, the price will be twice that.

1139
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,160
Yeah.

1140
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:49,540
And you pay.

1141
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,100
And you pay the international date line, too.

1142
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,460
So they have to send it back in time.

1143
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,280
Right.

1144
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,160
And then next day will happen.

1145
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,740
For you to get it the next day, of course.

1146
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,460
I mean, you know.

1147
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:57,900
Right.

1148
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,500
And then July 5th is coming in about four months.

1149
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,120
So that's it.

1150
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,720
Which equals July 12th by the time they discount all the numbers again.

1151
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,700
Either way, the world ends.

1152
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,000
Yep.

1153
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,500
And you may die.

1154
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,740
But you may not on that day.

1155
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,260
Depends on how close you are to old Bob.

1156
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,720
Depends on if you're asking permission.

1157
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:19,360
When you say,

1158
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,680
Hey, may I die, you know?

1159
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,200
Yeah.

1160
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,660
I know I'm going to get to stand on the running boards outside his car.

1161
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,700
I can't say I'm at the right hand of Bob, but I can stand on the running board.

1162
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,360
He said so.

1163
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,820
Oh, I'm going to wear one of them residents.

1164
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,960
Remember the old band of residents?

1165
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,460
I'm going to wear one of those old costumes he used to wear with a huge eyeball.

1166
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:44,560
And like a square top hat and a banjo and a mandolin on my fingers.

1167
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,860
That's what I'm talking about.

1168
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:57,460
And on that note, let us drift slowly away like bubbles in outer space.

1169
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,400
Oh, wait.

1170
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,180
Bubbles in outer space would instantly burst.

1171
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,440
They'd be the weakest, most pathetic thing.

1172
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:12,480
Yes, let us go ahead and float away like bubbles in zero gravity, zero vacuum, total vacuum,

1173
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,080
and the end of all things, or at least this show.

1174
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,540
This darn weekly show.

1175
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,700
Week, indeed.

1176
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,460
Okay, weekly.

1177
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,220
Okay, weekly.

1178
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,640
Okay, well, that's the end of the show, but I'm still here.

1179
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,340
Are you still there?

1180
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:42,740
No, he seems to think that when I say it's the end of the show, that means we have to hang up.

1181
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,980
It's the end of the show, but that doesn't mean we have to hang up.

1182
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,180
I guess we do.

1183
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,200
Thank you.
