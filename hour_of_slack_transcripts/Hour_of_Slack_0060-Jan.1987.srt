1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Well, thank you very much, Robert, and, uh, Happy New Year to you.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
Now, y'all don't touch that dial.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,180
Hey, don't touch that dial, I said!

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Don't go out!

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,000
So...

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,660
Zamora...

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,440
The crossroads of the world.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
You will...

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:44,940
Find what you want in Zamora.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,580
Oh!

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
7-H.

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,780
You, you, you.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,000
You.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
One composer feeds a fragment of it into several tape recorders and gradually...

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,180
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,080
The...

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,620
And on Earth.

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,540
Oh, God.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
Oh, God.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:29,980
Oh, God.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,900
Oh, God.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,300
And now I want a woman, and that's you, of course.

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,200
A ver, dÃ­game lo tocan.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,040
You mean it gets bigger than where it is now?

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,520
Ouch!

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,220
Oh!

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,200
Oh!

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,120
Oh!

29
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,900
Oh!

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,620
Oh!

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,320
Oh!

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,920
Oh!

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,160
Oh!

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Oh!

35
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,360
Oh!

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,360


37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,500
Oh!

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,940
Oh!

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,260
We got to meet some hats, isn't it?

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


47
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


49
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


51
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


52
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


53
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


54
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


55
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,260


56
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,520
Uh, I had to get in there and hole- after them rats one time.

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:06,840
Red hats took them down in, uh...

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:06,840


59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:06,960
But...

60
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,260
You...

61
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,080
dude...

62
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,180
Carrying, I had these...

63
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,700
Rats.

64
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,080
Rats!

65
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:23,260
I used to have to eat rat a lot back in the 90s, the depression.

66
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,980
World Depression II, they called it.

67
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,080
This was after the one in the 80s.

68
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,640
Boy, them was lean years, brother.

69
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,600
They had to wipe your ass with subgenius pamphlets back then.

70
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,660
That was the only kind of paper there was.

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,080
No wonder there was a bad, bad depression all over the world.

72
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,540
It kind of figures.

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,360
Dateline for Dominance didn't mention that it would be caused by subgenius church, and I can see why.

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,540
Why Bob would...

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:21,740
not want to mention that in his teachings to the uninitiated.

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
You know, they wouldn't understand.

77
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,400
Yeah, it was...

78
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,660
Them was lean years, boy.

79
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,920
And Mad Max movies.

80
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,280
I remember we used to look at those.

81
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,320
Boy, yeah.

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,480
I wish it had been that easy.

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Now...

84
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,440
All we got in this refrigerator is plutonium.

85
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:53,920
Yep.

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,780
All we got on the airwaves is this show.

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,640
This weird show.

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,680
I remember I used to be amazed that Dr. Gene Scott was on...

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,060
12 hours a day.

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,440
On TV in Dallas, Texas.

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,580
But now...

92
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,460
This show for 24 hours a day forever.

93
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,640
I just...

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,160
I wish this show could be more exciting, folks.

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,520
But, uh, just...

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,880
I guess...

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,060
Ever since the nuclear war, it's been hard for us subgeniuses to...

98
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,040
keep the show running like it used to back in the good old days, all.

99
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,860
I remember those times.

100
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,640
Good times, boy.

101
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,640
This is Doug Smith.

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,200
Come on!

103
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,060
Get up off that chair!

104
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,280
Follow me!

105
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Ready?

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,100
Go!

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
The Subgenius.

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,220
Hour of...

109
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,100
Watch.

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,060


111
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,820
Sound.

112
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,220
You're standing up late for it, wouldn't you say?

113
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,340
Definitely.

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,700
Welcome, potential initiates.

115
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,800
I love you.

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,460
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only

117
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,340
to be played on radio station...

118
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,460
N4.

119
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,000
In...

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,040
...the...

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,040


122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,040


123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,040


124
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,020
And only in the city of Dallas, Texas.

125
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,660
Here's your host.

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

127
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,280
And my good friend.

128
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,220
The sexiest man on earth.

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,360
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,240
I can't wait a moment longer. I've got to have sex with you.

131
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,040
The facilities are now enormous.

132
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,600
This is where the young composer feeds a fragment of it into several tape recorders and gradually...

133
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,920
You rang me up to tell me all about him.

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I can't wait a moment longer.

135
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,020
I can't wait a moment longer.

136
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,300
I can't wait a moment longer.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,120
Just...

138
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,220
Now!

139
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,580
There's pain inside.

140
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,980
Just won't let me be satisfied.

141
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,260
Woo!

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,540
Woo!

143
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,680
Woo!

144
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,100
Woo!

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,140
Woo!

146
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,840
There!

147
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,560
Well, all right.

148
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,780
Okay, well, I'm going to do a song now for all you cowboys and cowgirls.

149
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,980
All you hombres and ombres.

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,560
Let's hear the song about life itself.

151
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,960
The song about what happens when life sort of knees you down low, you know what I mean?

152
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,500
Let me hear some yeehaws out there!

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,280
Woo!

154
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,380
Woo!

155
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:09,680


156
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,360
This is a song about life as a spiraling force moving through the universe.

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,000
Unencumbered by a modular time constant.

158
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,600
That's right!

159
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,120
It's called Life Sucks, Then You Die.

160
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,880
Woo!

161
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,660
Woo!

162
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,820
Woo!

163
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,080
Woo!

164
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,480
Woo!

165
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,920
Ah!

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,480


167
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,260
Woo!

168
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,540
My house burned down in a flash of thunder.

169
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,060
My wife ran off with a one-legged plumber.

170
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,220
The crops fell dead when the river bed went dry.

171
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,380
My dog got squashed by a pickup truck.

172
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,140
My son ran away and got hooked on drugs.

173
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,660
My daughter's knocked up by the class hook he defied.

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,760
People say that life is good

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,440
It don't seem good to me

176
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm lost without a paddle

177
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,320
And I'm headed up free

178
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,400
People say that life is fun

179
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,060
But I don't know why

180
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,780
As far as I can tell

181
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Life sucks

182
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,540
Then you die

183
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,640
The government dumps its toxic waste

184
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,960
Right on top of my mother's grave

185
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,700
A team of experts say it won't do her no harm

186
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,700
But my sheep went crazy and killed my mule

187
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,900
I cut off my d*** with a power of two

188
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,580
Yeah!

189
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,640
Fixin' the hole where the meteor hit the barn

190
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,560
And it hurts every time

191
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,620
People say that life is good

192
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,240
But I just listen more

193
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,820
I got one foot on a banana peel

194
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,680
The other in the twilight zone

195
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,100
People say that life is fun

196
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,740
But I don't know why

197
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,760
As far as I can tell

198
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,200
Life sucks

199
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,140
Then you die

200
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
Celluloid

201
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,620
Sound Wave

202
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,600
And there's some yeehaws out there!

203
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,760
Sound of a ìº ï¿½ focused on the chamois

204
00:10:59,760 --> 00:10:59,760


205
00:10:59,760 --> 00:10:59,760


206
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,720
The subject is a 33-year-old male in good physical condition.

207
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,680
Here are the traumatic lesions which occasioned the death of the subject,

208
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,180
and we are going to enter through the sternum first

209
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,920
by snipping away the outer surface of the manubrium

210
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,640
and allow the floating ribs to float down the Mississippi to the ocean.

211
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,280
Let me see, has anyone got one of those little shiny things?

212
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,540
Hold on just a moment.

213
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,480
All right, get the light over here.

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,820
A little more frop into this.

215
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,040
This was puzzling evidence.

216
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,660
This ravaged cadaver, this course that we see before us,

217
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,520
was the vital and energetic form of puzzling evidence at one time.

218
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,620
You see his fibrillation.

219
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,520
He's fibrillating.

220
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,420
Give him more oxygen.

221
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,480
I'd like a little oxygen myself, actually.

222
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,720
I need to be important by investing in the present preparation.

223
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,980
Ah, thank you.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,420
Now that steadied my nerves.

225
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes, let me add him.

226
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:12,820
I'll...

227
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:19,160
Yes, get that one over here with the big apparatus.

228
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,340
All right, now we're going to...

229
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,080
We're going to sever the ribs here and...

230
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,880
More cotton, please.

231
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,360
A situation where there was such total dissension of the...

232
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,240
What carnage.

233
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
It looks like a battlefield.

234
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,820
Now you'll notice that we seldom see a sarcoma as half as advanced as this.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,820
You know, the squirming...

236
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,980
The hematomas are just...

237
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,540
Confirmation of the...

238
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,620
Yes, you're right.

239
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:55,620


240
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:55,620


241
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:55,620


242
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:55,620


243
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,460
Confirmness of the...

244
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,680
Notice up here.

245
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,340
Criminal isothermy.

246
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,100
Tighten these cranial sutures down.

247
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,080
I don't think we can...

248
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,880
See the patient suffered from a subdural hematoma,

249
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,240
which had suffused the dura and pia matter of the brain.

250
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,220
You see now this is in a dark, discolored...

251
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,820
Frankly, I don't know that there's all that much that you, Dr. Howell, or anyone else can do about it.

252
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,580
Ah, yes, dear friends.

253
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,480
This is your good...

254
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,960
Prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

255
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,560
And this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

256
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,900
For those of you who just tuned in for the first time...

257
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,800
Hey, quiet over there.

258
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,460
God.

259
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,040
Say, we got one of those volunteer helpers down here tonight.

260
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,940
Friends.

261
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,100
You can hear them in the background.

262
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,300
Moaning about the terrible chores that have been assigned them by the Bob.

263
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,000
Now, before I go any further, this is KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

264
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,980
And, uh, friends, for my regular listeners tonight, only,

265
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,360
tonight I'm gonna perform an act of, if you ask me, tremendous bravery.

266
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:13,920
What?

267
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,540
Somebody's trying to get into the station again.

268
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,320
I wish puzzling evidence was alive again to come in and help us.

269
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,580
If only David Byrne would let go of his name, we'd be all right.

270
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,880
Okay.

271
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,120
Anyway, I'm gonna do something real brave tonight, folks.

272
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm gonna announce a time and place for subgeniuses to meet if they want to see how they can do

273
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,680
volunteer help for the subgenius church and for KNON.

274
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,340
Now, this is not a devival, dear friends.

275
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,780
We're not...

276
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,040
This ain't a red-hot holy ghost hellfire revival I'm talking about.

277
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,120
It's not a party, either.

278
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,840
Not a party.

279
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,460
This is for workers, for drones, for those who, who, uh, feel like there's, there's some...

280
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,820
to be done here for the station and for the church of the subgenius.

281
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,080
This is all non-profit.

282
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,060
Uh, we've been crippled.

283
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,280
You can hear, you can hear the, the one, the ones who lost their legs at the last Doctors for Bob show

284
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,160
crawling along in the background there.

285
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,380
Crippled by lack of time, money, and manpower, and especially woman power, dear friends.

286
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,220
We still don't have the money, but with enough manpower, I'll have the time.

287
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,600
So, actually, I'm not going...

288
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,400
I'm not stupid.

289
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,660
I'm not stupid enough to announce a meeting, the exact place of a subgenius meeting over the air.

290
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,520
Nay, nay.

291
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,140
I'm going to give you a number to call tomorrow.

292
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,980
Not tonight.

293
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,180
This is a number to call tomorrow to get directions to this meeting, which is Tuesday night.

294
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,720
This Tuesday night at 8.30, dear friends.

295
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
This Tuesday night at 8.30, a subgenius meeting.

296
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,520
And I want you to call this number.

297
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,460
Got that pencil ready?

298
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,320
Tomorrow morning, or afternoon, or evening.

299
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,060
Anytime tomorrow.

300
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,860
Call this number for information on how to get to this meeting for those who would work to help the church.

301
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,020
And that number is...

302
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:10,600
The Mighty Cecilia at 692-6288.

303
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,780
Got it?

304
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,620
I'm going to be coming back again with that information.

305
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,880
692-6288.

306
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
8.30, Tuesday night.

307
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

308
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,460
For those who think...

309
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,280
They can help out.

310
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,280
Yes, yes, yes.

311
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,540
But, but, but...

312
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,240
But then...

313
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,020
But then it happened.

314
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,460
Bob came back.

315
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Yes!

316
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:49,700
And was he surprised to see me climb up out of the sand.

317
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,500
It's not so easy to do.

318
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,040
Because my...

319
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:02,900
My bones get heavier and heavier every year.

320
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,080
The fact is, they're turning into stone.

321
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:21,420
They lie in the ground and are transformed into rocks by the water and minerals.

322
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,440
Scientists say they're better...

323
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,640
They're better than the rocks.

324
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,900
They're better than the rocks.

325
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,900
They're just a dinosaur rock.

326
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,320
And that number to call again, dear friends, is 692-692-6288 tomorrow.

327
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Find out where and when to meet.

328
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,920
If you want to help, K-O-N and the Church of the Subgenius.

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is for subgeni only.

330
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,460
Ha!

331
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,620
Ha!

332
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,660
Ha!

333
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,740
Ha!

334
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,200
Ha!

335
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,540
Ha!

336
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,040
Ha!

337
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,540
Ha!

338
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,040


339
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,500
Ha!

340
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:13,500


341
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,200
Ha!

342
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,200


343
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,200


344
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,240
Ha!

345
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,400
Ha!

346
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,400


347
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,400


348
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,580
Ha!

349
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:14,880


350
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,220
Ha!

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,560
Ha!

352
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,720
Ha!

353
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,220
Ha!

354
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,940
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,300
6-9-2-6-2-8-8 tomorrow.

357
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,280
Call that number if you want to find out where the meeting is Tuesday at 8.30.

358
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

359
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,860
Uh, religion.

360
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,340
Uh, religion.

361
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,320
Uh, religion.

362
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,260
Hey all you jackals.

363
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
This is Ranger Randall Fields

364
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,740
from the banks of the Rock Creek Ranch.

365
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,500
Want to let you know that on Saturday, January 3rd,

366
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
we'll celebrate the new year and support

367
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Kano Inn with another great Texas

368
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,140
music celebration.

369
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,200
The celebration will feature Mark Two-Time,

370
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,920
Danny Collier, Ann Armstrong,

371
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,140
and Steve Hughes, and Dallas' own

372
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,980
Emily Aronson. Robert Earl

373
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,880
Keene Jr. will be back with us,

374
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,020
so come on out to the Sons of Kermit Hall.

375
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,940

$5 per person. So join us

378
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,220

379

or you can call

380
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920

381
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,980
or 828-9500

382
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,980
for more

383
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,060
details. Remember, Kano Inn

384
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,020
really needs your support, so come

385
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,500
on out and see Mark Two-Time,

386
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,060
Danny Collier, Ann Armstrong, and Steve

387
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,860
Hughes, Emily Aronson,

388
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,460
and Robert Earl Keene Jr.

389
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,960
I haven't seen Emily Aronson in a long

390
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,540
time.

391
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,020
But dear friends, if you want

392
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,040
to find where the subgenius

393
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,860
meeting is, 830 Tuesday night, call

394
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,900
tomorrow. Call 692-

395
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,400
6288.

396
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,640
Ah yes, if you dare.

397
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,900
Wow, it's so cool.

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,700
Oh my gosh,

399
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,400
they gave up.

400
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,000
Professional football players, in case you don't know,

401
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,820
have now gotten so big,

402
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,140
so strong, and so fast

403
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,040
that when they run into each

404
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,100
other, the human body can no

405
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,060
longer sustain the impact.

406
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,680
And join me in the same way

407
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,800
the images that with wits,

408
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:32,300
selling conspiracy monster manipulates you and becomes so sophisticated that no matter how slick you think you are,

409
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,820
you cannot resist.

410
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,120
We can't give you all the answers.

411
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,920
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

412
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,420
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

413
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,420
Love.

414
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,480
Children.

415
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,000
God.

416
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,580
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy, grown right here by our special process.

417
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,780
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

418
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,720
Who are we?

419
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,620
We're the normal people.

420
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,320
The most normal people in the world.

421
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,760
But not quite as normal as you.

422
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,620
People worry that the Church of the Subgenius is an anti-American church.

423
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,240
It's the perfect church.

424
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,640
We are the first real Americans.

425
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:07,300
We know what America is before they took it away from us and tried to sell it back to us for a profit.

426
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:17,160
Bob will come and replace all drugs, sex, and money in a paradise of unlimited slack.

427
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,080
Slack will be the only medium of exchange, friends.

428
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:29,360
And because you can't buy it, and as long as you can't buy slack, the conspiracy cannot win.

429
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,140
The Conspiracy

430
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


431
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


432
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


433
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


434
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


435
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


436
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,140


437
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,180
Friends, friends, we really need your help.

438
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:13,140
Bob trusts you and knows how to keep your trust, for he is your only source of his mighty pills and the beloved herb of immortality,

439
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,020
Habifrops zipulops.

440
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:26,580
or frop. Unlike conspiracy drugs such as alcohol and TV, the frop mixture combined with the pills

441
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:33,500
fill the holes left by brain cells you destroyed. And Bob makes the best pills ever once made.

442
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,340
You're the only one and the rest of them are wrong and you're the only one that's right.

444
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,160
And that's how you're supposed to feel because you got the pills of Bob in you.

445
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,900
Because Bob knows just the exact nanosecond when you're going to take that pill.

446
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,280
You're floating in a sea of pills only you're too deaf, dumb and blind to see it.

447
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,700
We're not talking about Tylenol. Hell, Jesus took Tylenol.

448
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,260
Now this is Habifrop Zipulops 2. And I don't like this stuff. It is free.

449
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,600
We have to smoke it. It's one of the rules.

450
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,420
We're talking about a barrel of Habifrop.

451
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,540
We're talking about a void, a limitless void of Habifrop.

452
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,620
Right. We're talking about several alternate realities.

453
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,580
Full of Bob pills.

454
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,720
Your girlfriend said he's going to strip you naked if you didn't take those pills.

455
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,580
Wow.

456
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,740
They had the one with the same living dog.

457
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,760
Baby boy.

458
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,540
Baby boy.

459
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,140
Oh, ain't it good when things are going your way?

460
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,140
Hey, hey.

461
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,980
Let me hear some yeehaws out there.

462
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,780
Yeah.

463
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

464
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,140
News on the USA Radio Network.

465
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,920
Don't touch that dial.

466
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,280
That's right, dear friends. We need your help.

467
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,720
The station needs your help.

468
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,720
And the church.

469
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,000
The church of the subgenius needs your help.

470
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,800
No, we're not going to give you free pills.

471
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,180
And it's not the kind of pills you're thinking of anyway, dear friend out there.

472
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,500
Nay, nay.

473
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,340
This is a new kind of pill.

474
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,160
A pill that depends on your faith and your face.

475
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,920
And on top of that, you need to know more.

476
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,860
But the only way you can find out, and this is not entertainment.

477
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,140
This is for those who want to help out.

478
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,700
And I'm speaking to those who help out.

479
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,660
Those who helped us out on the parade.

480
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,040
Ah, yes.

481
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,500
And those who feel like they can drive, run errands, type.

482
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,040
All kinds of things.

483
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,920
All kinds of things.

484
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,940
Including command the small army of the Bobbies.

485
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:14,140
To find out where this meeting is, 8.30 Tuesday night, tomorrow, any time during the day, not too late at night, call Cecilia at 692-722-7222.

486
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,380
622...

487
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,700
8... 8...

488
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,900
Ğ¾Ñ 12 hast Cou hurtÃ¡

489
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,200
4

490
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,620
4

491
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,940
So

492
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,040
Yeah yeah uh

493
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,120
But let's leave things of this world behind

494
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,820
and walk now down the path of Bob

495
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,800
for this brief minute of slack

496
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,480
from the church of the subgenius.

497
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,000
And so once again we find this deep-rooted contradiction

498
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,620
within the word of God,

499
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,480
who he himself has said,

500
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,060
I am everything, but yet everything is me.

501
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,680
And by this very self-same contradiction,

502
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,940
we know that we do have some measure of free will.

503
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,780
Yes, free choice.

504
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,680
And it's up to us to decide

505
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,160
whether we're going to sin in the ways that God wants us to

506
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,660
or if we're going to sin against God.

507
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,860
But yet, since he is everything and everything is him

508
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,340
or her or it or everything,

509
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,360
one could say, well, everything is everything,

510
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,180
so a sin might as well be a good deed.

511
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,440
Helping a little old lady across the street

512
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,140
might be a sin.

513
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,120
And if everything is everything,

514
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,500
now, this is an acid-head sort of mode of thinking,

515
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,560
and I don't think anybody wants to go along

516
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,700
with such a vague and, to say the least,

517
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,620
fluid philosophy,

518
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,360
because we have to have some sort of standard reference

519
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,220
for goodness or evilness.

520
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,060
We got a zero or meter on something.

521
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,300
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?

522
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,400
Let there be slack.

523
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,700
Oh.

524
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,060
Oh.

525
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,640
I'm a subgenius talking from Beijing, China.

526
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,460
Please, Bob.

527
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,420
My name is Li Lijing.

528
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,500
I will tell you some funny story.

529
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,860
We know that humor is through exaggeration,

530
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,440
metaphor, double-gloss, and other techniques.

531
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,200
It's my understanding that commercial music

532
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,100
is built on the aberrations of society.

533
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,960
Sex, dub, music.

534
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,020
Ass, loose, whores, pimps.

535
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,280
Faggots, cockroaches, crawlers.

536
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,600
.

537
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,140
.

538
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,140


539
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,140


540
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,180
.

541
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,040
.

542
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,040


543
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,040


544
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,040


545
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,040


546
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,060
.

547
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,080
.

548
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,080


549
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,100
.

550
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,200
.

551
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,200


552
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,220
.

553
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,220


554
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,280
.

555
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,120
.

556
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


557
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


558
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


559
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


560
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


561
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


562
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


563
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


564
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


565
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,020
.

566
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,580
Meat rack man.

567
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,560
Meat rack man.

568
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,100
Meat rack man.

569
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,980
Meat rack man.

570
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,780
For cops for toy for slaves to enjoy.

571
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,620
Meat rack man.

572
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,360
Meat rack man.

573
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,360
See the studs, drinking bud,

574
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,480
you scuttle to the breakthroughs.

575
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,580
Loving pain, that's his game.

576
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,640
Pinch my nipples, slap my thighs.

577
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,120
.

578
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,960
Meat Rack Man, Meat Rack Man

579
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,800
He's living sin as he goes in

580
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,840
Meat Rack Man, Meat Rack Man

581
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,380
Meat Rack Man, yeah

582
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,400
Just a kid from the country backpack

583
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,520
On his black back

584
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,620
Had his problems of pleasure and pain

585
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,100
Lines of cars and concrete movie stars

586
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,220
It's a shame

587
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,960
Just another 20 buck romance

588
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,000
In the heat of the night

589
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,760
It's a shame

590
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,260
Meat Rack Man

591
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
And all my street friends

592
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,940
And all my street friends

593
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,220
All my street friends

594
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,200
Sometimes you pay for old times

595
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,360
Sometimes you pay for old times

596
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,500
Meat Rack Man

597
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,360
Sweet little Alice by day

598
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,780
At night the door would slam

599
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,000
To take in hand

600
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,420
To a two minute two time

601
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,380
Orgasm in the promised land

602
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,940
Whips and chains

603
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,940
Were sweet Alice's little game

604
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,500
Whips and chains

605
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,080
Gone down one way the wrong way

606
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,380
No one understands

607
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,220
Meat Rack Man

608
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,160
Meat Rack Man

609
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,380
It's the island of living pew

610
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,100
Whips and chains

611
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,800
Meat Rack Man

612
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,160
Meat Rack Man

613
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,240
Meat Rack Man

614
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,840
Meat Rack Man

615
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,940
Meat Rack Man

616
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,920
I would remind you

617
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,260
that extremism

618
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,920
in the defense of liberty

619
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,920
is no vice

620
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And he came near me

621
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,360
and I just petted him a little bit

622
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,440
but my goodness

623
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,700
I don't understand all that

624
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,920
Now sodomy includes

625
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,120
both buggery and bestiality

626
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,320
Well there was a girl there

627
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,920
who was fully in love with me

628
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,880
around with a dog, put it on a kind of exhibition.

629
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,240
But that's as far as that went.

630
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
I had nothing to do with it.

631
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,480
And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.

632
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,220
During my marriage, when we had trouble relating to one another sexually, my wife and I, we

633
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:11,120
both went to doctors, and both doctors recommended a form of genital kissing to arouse one another

634
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,960
to a state where we could enjoy ourselves together.

635
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,580
This was recommended to us by doctors.

636
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Beyond that, I see nothing wrong with it.

637
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:24,640
The heartbeat, it's a heartbeat, and a heartbeat is a good vibration.

638
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,460
It's got to be funky.

639
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,680
It's got to be funky.

640
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:43,980
It's got to be funky.

641
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,100
It's got to be funky.

642
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,100
It's the island of living people.

643
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,220
It's got to be funky.

644
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,420
It's got to be funky.

645
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,680
It's got to be funky.

646
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,320
It's got to be funky, dear friends, and it will be, especially those of you, now I've

647
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
gotten a couple of calls that I wasn't able to pick up.

648
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,880
If you need to call back here, wait until you start hearing tapes again, give me another

649
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,860
call, because we're getting several calls at once.

650
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,460
I can only talk to two at a time and run all these decks.

651
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,720
See, every cut you hear is a different cassette running into this deck.

652
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,260
Wait a minute.

653
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,860
What is this?

654
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

655
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,300
Okay, trying to trick me every minute.

656
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,900
Dear friends, like I said one more time, we're having a meeting, a subgenius meeting, not

657
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,640
a camp meeting, not a revival meeting, a work meeting.

658
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:50,680
Those who want to help out in a volunteer way, we're going to meet Tuesday night at

659
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,080
830.

660
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,140
I'm not crazy enough to tell you where over the air, but if you want to find out tomorrow,

661
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,740
if you're serious, call Cecilia.

662
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,740
At 692-6288.

663
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,580
Not tonight, but tomorrow.

664
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,700
And the kind of people we're looking for, really, I mean, we need folks that are skilled

665
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,000
in, we need folks that have Macintosh computers to begin with.

666
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,480
That's a very, that's a real good qualifying thing.

667
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,840
Anybody who's got a Macintosh and willing to help out with typing.

668
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:29,740
We need Xeroxers, paystep people, free typesetting, mail order drones, and this is to help out

669
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,140
the station.

670
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:36,920
And or to help out the, um, uh, the over dominator of volunteers.

671
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,100
You see what I mean?

672
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,660
So, uh, anybody who can repair electronics, uh, audio equipment, access studios, stage

673
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:56,420
sound, PA, you know, you name it, call, call that number 692-6288 tomorrow.

674
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,120
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, subgenius.

675
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,920
Radio ministry.

676
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:05,940
Now what you just heard, meat rack, man, I can't remember who, who did that, but a whole

677
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,340
lot of this stuff comes from the Los Angeles subgeni.

678
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,280
Uh, in fact, what's coming up on this tape are a series of phone calls.

679
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:24,700
These are phone call recordings made by a true doctor, a, a, a saint, a saint of Bull

680
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,760
Dada in the church of the subgenius who goes by the name of.

681
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:38,700
El Minati, which is all you're going to know, but good old, uh, Dr. Lou here has, has done

682
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,480
some terrifying things to other people.

683
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,000
This is, uh, these, of course, these calls, uh, let me preface this with, with the fact

684
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,420
that these are all of course staged.

685
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,780
No one would really do this to another person.

686
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,280
Um, and those will be coming up.

687
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,000
But in the meantime, dear friends.

688
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,480
Okay.

689
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,220
If you need more information about just what this so-called church of the subgenius is

690
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:13,920
all about, you can write for free information, not a penny charged to give you the information.

691
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:23,620
And that number to write is PO Box 1 4 0 3 0 6 Dallas, Texas, 7 5 2 1 4.

692
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,640
Or tomorrow you can call 6 9 2 6 2 8 8.

693
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,300
But until then, dear friends,

694
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,340
.

695
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:47,460
, It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the.

696
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:56,860
The doctor said that you were likely the cruel guy.

697
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,440
Tremulous murderer.

698
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


699
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


700
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


701
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


702
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


703
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


704
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,620


705
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,800
These stupid fools, these poor, ill-fated humans.

706
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,540
They're mere humans.

707
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm not going to put you on again.

708
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,260
Yes, they call themselves dumb.

709
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,040
You want to know what the epic dog is, don't you?

710
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,180
The ride of the pig.

711
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,480
Stop.

712
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:11,880
Stop.

713
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,240
Tell us what it is.

714
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,820
At this point, what we're doing is...

715
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,580
I left a good job in the movies.

716
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,100
Yeah, something's not right here.

717
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,280
This is puzzling evidence.

718
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,860
Wait a minute.

719
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,120
We're going to rearrange everything.

720
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,380
I'm down here at the studio.

721
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm going to mix in a little bit differently here because...

722
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,360
I've got a real problem with the theme, don't you think?

723
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,180
First we're talking about phyllo, and then we're in this restaurant in El Salvador, and it just isn't right.

724
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,340
Here, I tell you what.

725
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,520
Let's really have a theme here, okay?

726
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,380
Okay.

727
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,680
I couldn't wait anymore.

728
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm climbing the damn walls.

729
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,680
Oh, I told you I had a banana.

730
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,060
Oh, God, it's good.

731
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,720
I just woke up next to Adolf Hitler's body.

732
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,520
Is this hell?

733
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,820
Is this hell?

734
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,060
Is this the pharmacy?

735
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,480
Speaking.

736
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,380
Yes, I want to call about a prescription that was called in by Dr. Horten.

737
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,460
When it was called in?

738
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,420
Pardon me?

739
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,580
When it was called in?

740
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,500
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

741
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,700
You said it was called in?

742
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,460
Yes, it was called in yesterday.

743
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,780
It's for lactose-strayed PET pads.

744
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,280
Lacto-what?

745
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,280
Lactose-stressed face pads.

746
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,380
What time it was called yesterday?

747
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,500
Probably about 1 p.m., I'd say.

748
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,980
Okay, what's the last name of the patient?

749
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,400
Last name, Elkins.

750
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,660
Elkins.

751
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,440
Hold on a second.

752
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,100
Let me check, please.

753
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:44,600


754
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,420
Well, I believe it was, yes.

755
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:52,080
Well, perhaps since time is of the essence now, do you have the non-prescription variety of the lactose stress pads?

756
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,880
Lactose stress pads?

757
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes.

758
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,240
I know.

759
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,360
I've seen them at your pharmacy.

760
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,100
Just in case.

761
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,440
Just a minute, please.

762
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:58,920
Thank you.

763
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,040
That's very strange.

764
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,600
I cannot believe that a product like that would sell out so quickly.

765
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,420
Well, what can we do?

766
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,760
I mean, do you have the nearest substitute?

767
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,160
I do need something.

768
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,940
I mean, I was counting on getting this.

769
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,100
First, you say the prescription is not available, then you say the shelves.

770
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,280
The prescription would be available if the doctor called.

771
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,380
Well, I can't understand what happened.

772
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,240
Why don't you call your doctor and ask him to call us?

773
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,380
Well, can you prescribe the nearest equivalent?

774
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,900
Okay, I'm not a pharmacist, so I can't prescribe.

775
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,680
Is the pharmacist available?

776
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,160
Just a minute, please.

777
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,640
Thank you.

778
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,420
There's nothing that he can recommend.

779
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,080
Well, can you give me some guava paste?

780
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,080
Okay, sir, I can't give you anything.

781
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't know.

782
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,020
Well, can I speak to the manager?

783
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,900
I mean, this problem has to be straightened out.

784
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,900
I can't believe that...

785
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,820
Sir, if your doctor called, we would have the prescription, okay?

786
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,560
Well, I'm not going to make a whole trip down from the Hollywood Hills if there's nothing

787
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,220
on the shelves.

788
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,140
Now, if the doctor didn't call in, perhaps this can be rectified by buying the same ingredients

789
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,280
on a non-prescription basis.

790
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,360
Okay, it's not available.

791
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,660
Is Mr. Coolidge and all the little people here available?

792
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:56,660


793
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:56,660


794
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,280
No, Mr. Coolidge is there.

795
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,660
I beg your pardon?

796
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,980
Do you have the sick raccoon medicine?

797
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,460
Can I buy a bonus love thruster?

798
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,820
One minute, please.

799
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,360
What's the name of the product you...

800
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,380
Children's aspirin.

801
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,980
We have Bayer aspirin.

802
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,220
Well, what's been the problem?

803
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,240
I've been on the phone for about seven or eight minutes, and I've been trying to get

804
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,520
a bottle of Bayer children's aspirin and find out if it's in the shelves, and I...

805
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,820
No, you haven't been asking for Bayer children's aspirin.

806
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,960
You've been asking for a prescription.

807
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,860
Well, I was asking for the generic name.

808
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,700
It's the same product.

809
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,640
Okay, I don't know if we have the generic name.

810
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:26,640


811
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:26,640


812
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,180
It's the generic Bayer aspirin, but we do carry aspirin.

813
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,320
Oh, I'm very confused.

814
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,900
Generic Bayer aspirin?

815
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,600
No, we have aspirin on the shelf.

816
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,860
There's no generic aspirin.

817
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,580
What flavor do you have?

818
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,080
What flavor aspirin?

819
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,260
Yes, of the children's variety.

820
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,220
They do come in flavors.

821
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,880
Excuse me, Mr. May I help you?

822
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,020
Yes, I've been simply trying to ask a question for the last five minutes.

823
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,320
My child is very finicky, and he only will take a certain kind of aspirin.

824
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:56,620
I'm sure he'll be fine.

825
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


826
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


827
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


828
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


829
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


830
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


831
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,620


832
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,880
I've been trying to find a children's aspirin, a Bayer, and I've been just trying to find

833
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,540
if you have the proper variety, and I just keep getting the wrong one.

834
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,780
We have a big line of aspirins and acetaminophenes and everything, and if you know the kind the

835
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,940
child has, definitely you'll find it on the shelves.

836
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,800
Do you have the Magenta Adaptions?

837
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,500
What's that?

838
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,320
Do you have the Magenta Adaptions?

839
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
The Magenta what?

840
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,120
The Magenta Adaptions.

841
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,220
No, I don't.

842
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,620
Well, is there any kind of equivalent?

843
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


844
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


845
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


846
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


847
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


848
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


849
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


850
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,620


851
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,700
No, I don't know what's equivalent, and believe me, I have a very busy night tonight.

852
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,640
I cannot ask anymore.

853
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,260
If you want any help, come here.

854
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
I don't believe you.

855
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,700
Sir, I'm trying to tell you I'm very busy.

856
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,200
Come over here and I'll help you.

857
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,380
Well, when you're dealing with sickness, time is never a consideration.

858
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,840
Everybody here is sick also.

859
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,800
What I can do?

860
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,040
I cannot be leaving everybody just to answer this question.

861
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,740
I'm telling you I'm ready to help you anytime.

862
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,780
Come over and I'll help you with everything you need here.

863
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,320
Have you tried the spiritual method?

864
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,600
No, I haven't.

865
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,600


866
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,600


867
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,600


868
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,120
I don't understand.

869
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,100
Medicines are not needed when spiritual contact may be made through the Buddha mindset.

870
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,520
What is that?

871
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't understand.

872
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:12,260
If you can simply find the coordinates of blood mentality, no medicine available on

873
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,100
any shelf on this planet is necessary.

874
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,540
Healing can be achieved through simple mental communication with our astral projected fathers

875
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,040
and mothers.

876
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,300
Oh my god.

877
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,340
I don't understand these things.

878
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,280
Maybe you, one day you'll teach me these things.

879
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,580
Well, I don't understand.

880
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:35,560
If you begin from the Eastern method that was introduced into the West about 1803, you

881
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:43,660
realize that all material wealth is simply a projection of our mindset.

882
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,380
Drug stores have no need to exist.

883
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,300
You yourself, whatever your name is, would no longer have a job.

884
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,040
You would become a simple mendicant on the streets of our fair city.

885
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,720
No one can do the same.

886
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:57,720


887
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:57,900
Okay, sir.

888
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,840
Thank you very much.

889
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,160
I have now three or four doctors on the line waiting for me to talk to them.

890
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:04,760
Possible?

891
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,080
Okay.

892
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,940
Get the aspirin.

893
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,920
I'm ugly.

894
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,680
Dirty, filthy, sneaky, horrible.

895
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,940
I'm gonna kill you.

896
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,040
What type of young lady are you looking for?

897
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,780
Just one, one, one, one.

898
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,560
What kind of young lady?

899
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


900
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


901
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


902
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


903
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


904
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


905
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


906
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


907
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,560


908
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,320
I'm gonna use brunette, most likely, or redhead, mostly.

909
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,340
Oh, but that shouldn't be a problem.

910
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,980
No, if you call us early Friday evening,

911
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,020
we can arrange for it.

912
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,080
Okay, also, would you have extra spanchels

913
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,100
of Ex-Lax and polystyrene?

914
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,520
Pardon me, sir?

915
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,760
What do you want to do with that?

916
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,640
Would you have extra spanchels of Ex-Lax

917
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,900
and polystyrene in the molded figurines?

918
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,340
Sir, I don't know what you're talking about.

919
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Well, most desk cards serve as a security service.

920
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,280
Sir, we don't carry laxatives and things like that.

921
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,040
The stores do.

922
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,200
Oh, well, that's not true.

923
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,560
No, I don't know what you think of me

924
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,660
and these kind of things that I do.

925
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,580
I don't give a flying...

926
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,760
Hey.

927
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,700
Jeff Murray here, station manager

928
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,320
of KNOA.

929
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,080
I want to remind you of our recent pledge drive

930
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,180
and where you can send your donation.

931
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,480
Now, remember, if you send KNOA a donation

932
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,880
before the end of the year,

933
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,200
you can write it off on your tax credit.

934
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,680
So donations, large and small.

935
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,060
Here's our P.O. Box.

936
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,000
P.O. Box, 710-909.

937
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,420
Dallas, Texas, 75371.

938
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,940
So let's get these donations in.

939
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,440
You know, it's the Christmas spirit,

940
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,300
and certainly, you know, we're going to have to do this.

941
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,460
And certainly, KNON, I think,

942
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,520
should be one of your more deserving recipients.

943
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,860
That's KNON, Post Office Box 710-909.

944
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,360
Dallas, Texas, 75371.

945
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,340
Happy holidays, and thank you very much.

946
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,580
And thank you, Jeff.

947
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,120
Well, friends, I want you to take him up on that.

948
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,760
Those of you who pledged, make sure you get that in the mail.

949
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,700
You'll get a reminder.

950
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,300
But even if you don't, you know,

951
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,260
go ahead and mail that pledge in.

952
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,940
We need it.

953
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,520
Make sure and tag it, Hour of Slack.

954
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,800
Otherwise, we won't get credit for you,

955
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,120
you as a listener.

956
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,340
Now, about this Tuesday night meeting at 8.30

957
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,800
of Subgenius Volunteers.

958
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,400
Now, see, most of the people who volunteered in the past,

959
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,720
not all of them, but it's turned out that quite a few

960
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,720
were actually Slack vampires, without really meaning to be.

961
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,840
But after the parade and finding that many Dallas subgeni

962
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,120
did indeed include folks who were not total flakes

963
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,160
and who did want to help, and even a few with the right skills,

964
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,000
my faith has been bolstered, dear friends.

965
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,040
So we're going to have that meeting.

966
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,160
Call 692-6288 tomorrow for directions.

967
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,720
None of the help we need is glamorous.

968
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,100
This is all menial zombie drone work.

969
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,640
It does require some skills.

970
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,300
And, you know, typists, paced-up phone calls,

971
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:25,840
that kind of thing.

972
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,820
They have to know what they're doing.

973
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,340
We also need people to run errands with their own cars.

974
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,440
And this, once again, this is all non-profit.

975
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,120
So no one, at this time, not one person receives a paycheck

976
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,000
from the Church of the Subgenius, friends.

977
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,800
Not even me.

978
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,240
I make my living doing, oh, even worse things.

979
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,180
So don't think this is leading to a job, because it ain't.

980
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,620
This is to help out the subgenius.

981
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,340
The station and the church, and everyone else on the planet.

982
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,720
If only they knew.

983
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,080
If only they could be told.

984
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,320
Now we're pretty picky who hangs out at the subgenius,

985
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,620
evil subgenius castle.

986
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,360
I'm a real Nazi about this, and Buck Naked can tell you that.

987
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,980
I'm kind of a cross between a hermit and a Nazi commandant.

988
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,800
And after the meeting, we'll call back those who passed

989
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,860
the psychic whiff reading test.

990
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,480
But if you do want to help, meeting 830 Tuesday night,

991
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,100
692-6288.

992
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,340
Oh, this song coming up, this was sent in by Lou Minotti,

993
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,120
whose phone calls we will hear some more of.

994
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,140
Uh, the, uh, remember,

995
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,600
recorded very recently in prison.

996
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,480
This is, you always wondered what Charlie Manson sounded like

997
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,540
when he sat down and did his rock and roll songs.

998
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,720
This'll take you back, even though it's, uh,

999
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,200
Charlie Manson.

1000
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:48,820
And it.

1001
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,140
Uh, Charlie Manson.

1002
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,040
Huh.

1003
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,800
It's inside.

1004
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,640
In the back.

1005
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,000
The front.

1006
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,840
No, it's in the back.

1007
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,840
No, it's in the front.

1008
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,840
No, it's in the back.

1009
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,900
They shoved it in the back.

1010
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,980
They put it in the back.

1011
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,840
All the love in the back.

1012
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,760
In the back.

1013
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,740
All the love get in the back, boy.

1014
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,900
And they call it your subconscious.

1015
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,600
Remember Freud.

1016
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,560
And the front is your computer.

1017
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,880
And I call him old ego is a too much thing.

1018
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,480
Old ego is a too much thing.

1019
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,960
You make you fool yourself.

1020
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,900
You'll think you're somebody else.

1021
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,080
The guy's the outlaw.

1022
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,460
The trouble your brain.

1023
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,120
Makes you wanna jump on a band fight.

1024
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,400
And you can't stand not to be right.

1025
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,060
It'll make you lie, make you cheat just so you won't be beat.

1026
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,540
It'll make you get on out of sight.

1027
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,160
You get afraid you're gonna act like a clown.

1028
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,360
And you get mad when somebody puts you down.

1029
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,080
Your hearts are pumping and your paranoid's just jumping.

1030
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,620
Look out, ego is a too much thing.

1031
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,160
When everything seems going so fine.

1032
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,600
Old ego puts itself on in a band.

1033
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,060
Your certainty turns to doubt.

1034
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,820
And then you start flipping out.

1035
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,820
Then you ease on out of your mind.

1036
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,480
You try not to be a fool.

1037
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,040
You try not to be a fool.

1038
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,420
And you get mad.

1039
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,880
It's a big thing.

1040
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,140
Old ego's a too much thing.

1041
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,140


1042
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,140


1043
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,140


1044
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,140


1045
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,140


1046
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,580
Do you have the Kermit series?

1047
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,700
The what?

1048
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,700
The Kermit series.

1049
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,800
Kermit? No.

1050
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,400
Can you give me some idea of the range of the facility?

1051
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,580
It's a big place.

1052
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,580
Well, in terms of square feet.

1053
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,080
I don't know the square feet here.

1054
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,460
What kind of clientele in terms of the area?

1055
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,020
This is an adult bookstore.

1056
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,040
Yes, but what about the ceramic collection?

1057
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,240
We don't have any ceramics.

1058
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,540
Well, last time I was in there, I met a man who was about 6'2".

1059
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,420
He had gray hair, and he assured me that the lens was available.

1060
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,640
There's another man, 6'2", gray hair, working here.

1061
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,240
Well, what about the love thrusters?

1062
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,200
The what?

1063
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,120
The love thrusters.

1064
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,880
I don't know what that is.

1065
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,680
The series or in the individual capacity?

1066
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

1067
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,060
I think I better get your name.

1068
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,720
Can you give me your name?

1069
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,980
No, you can't have my name.

1070
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,940
Well, please, please.

1071
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,200
If you want to know what we have, you can come down here.

1072
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,960
Well, you at least tell me this.

1073
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,860
Are the pages stick-resistant on most of your reading materials?

1074
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,340
I would imagine.

1075
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,180
What sort of substances will wash off these?

1076
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,560
Depends on what you pour on it.

1077
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,220
Well, let's say a normal unguenting solution.

1078
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,320
Depends if it's acidated or not.

1079
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,200
What about excrescence in minor form?

1080
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,720
That I wouldn't know.

1081
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,460
No.

1082
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,300
What about the junior chemo-chromos influence?

1083
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,680
I still don't know what you're talking about.

1084
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,140
I'm prepared to make a large purchase.

1085
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,840
You know, you really shouldn't alienate your customers.

1086
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,520
Yeah, but I really don't know what you're talking about.

1087
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,440
Well, can you tell me if the raccoon club approved?

1088
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,040
No.

1089
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,000
Well, what about the fist involved?

1090
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,340
The what?

1091
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:08,060
I'm prepared to come down tonight if you can assure me that the full line

1092
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,320
of treatment is available to you.

1093
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:11,820
Treatment?

1094
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,940
Yes. Do you have these floral books or the Greek master series?

1095
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,140
No, we don't.

1096
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,540
Do you all agree?

1097
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,540
No, we don't.

1098
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,000
Do we have the simple tracers and the low-fly prunes?

1099
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,520
Excuse me?

1100
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,240
Yes. Well, how many do you have of them?

1101
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,060
Of what?

1102
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,200
Of the free-fly prunes.

1103
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,400
I wouldn't know right now.

1104
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,540
How many other people are working here now?

1105
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,880
I really should speak to someone else.

1106
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,560
I'm afraid you're not making yourself clear.

1107
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,280
I'm the only person that is here.

1108
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,740
How long will you be here?

1109
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,980
I am here all night.

1110
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,220
Well, can you tell me if the palm service is still there?

1111
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,800
That I'm not sure.

1112
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,240
Well, what about Mr. Coolidge and all the other Coolidges?

1113
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,060
No.

1114
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,140
I need some help.

1115
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,400
Can you please help me?

1116
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,360
The only way I can help is if you come down here.

1117
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,860
Well, what are you prepared to do?

1118
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
What am I prepared to do?

1119
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,140
I'm not prepared to hang up on you.

1120
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,600
Well, I think you would...

1121
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,340
I'm so wired up that I feel like a switchboard buzzing.

1122
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:15,220
I'm a turbojet on the strip with my engine running.

1123
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:15,220


1124
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,540
There's a sweet young thing they just hired on in reception.

1125
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,200
Congregation?

1126
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,120
My, it's good to see a big crowd.

1127
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,940
Oh, I've been wondering where a lot of you have been.

1128
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,600
I've been wondering about a lot of things.

1129
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,480
I'm glad you're here on this Easter Sunday.

1130
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,940
Your flowers look so beautiful.

1131
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,220
I'm glad you're here.

1132
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,000
Thank you, Mr. Cook.

1133
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,000


1134
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,380
I'm going to go and get you your tassels.

1135
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:47,380


1136
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,380
I'm going to get right into the message.

1137
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,300
I'm gonna lay the truth down.

1138
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,840
I'm gonna strap it on.

1139
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,700
Thank you for that, amen.

1140
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,320
Yes, I'm not gonna spare anything.

1141
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,860
I'm not gonna smooth anybody's fur.

1142
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,080
I heard your sister.

1143
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,800
Yes, I will, pretty Jones.

1144
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:05,740
Yes.

1145
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,380
Mm-hmm.

1146
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,960
I'm gonna tell it like it is, as they say.

1147
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,400
Oh, I heard a hallow-lo-gy.

1148
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,700
All right, now, you're all quieting down a little bit.

1149
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,200
You're getting a little fuzzy.

1150
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:23,620
little too noisy. Hold it. Hold it down. I'm talking. Okay. Listen, I'm tired of so much

1151
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:32,020
around here that I had to unload on you today. Do you think I don't know what the hell is

1152
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:38,160
going on? Do you think, for instance, that I don't know that Bill Broden is going up

1153
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:45,880
seeing Irene Hobbs? Yeah. Going up there tapping that? Sure, I know it. Don't you? What in

1154
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,860
the hell's the matter with you? She told me right back there in my study what she was

1155
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:58,280
doing. I know it. Yeah. Uh-huh. And this being Easter Sunday and having such a big crowd

1156
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:06,120
out here and a lot of strange faces, where in the hell have you been? Hell, far. You

1157
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,140
come once or twice or you come twice.

1158
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:15,320
Yeah. That don't cut no ass with me, see? You know, we got a Sunday school teacher,

1159
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:22,620
and you know who in the hell I'm talking about. Yeah, Bill Bronson. That's who I'm talking

1160
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:29,540
about. There he sits right there, Bill. I'm talking to you, see? You ain't no more taking

1161
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:37,840
proper care of that Sunday school class. And you are finished. You're fired. Get out.

1162
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,460
You're out of that Sunday school class. Now listen, I mean business. I'm putting it down,

1163
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:53,240
ain't I? I ain't hearing no amen's, but I ain't wanting any. No. Hell, far. Hell, far.

1164
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,460
This may be the biggest thing that's ever happened. The biggest thing that's ever happened

1165
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,140
in our time. We're facing a new form of violence. We're facing a new form of violence. We're

1166
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,140


1167
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,720
facing a new form of life that nobody understands. It's like nothing we've ever seen before. This

1168
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,020
is some mental vampire report. We have been confronted with an enemy the like of which

1169
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:24,540
defies description. We're dealing with something totally alien. Looks larger. Looks like it's

1170
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:36,120
growing. We're dealing with something totally alien. Those hypnotic eyes. Alien, totally

1171
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,060
alien. Totally alien, dear friend.

1172
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,600
This little collage here is from the Snake Oil Symphony by Daniel Stephen Kraft. Man,

1173
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,700
I'm going to have to run down there and let Ron Lindsey in, friend. Stay tuned for Ron

1174
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:54,680
Lindsey and Soul Oldies. This is Reverend Ivan Stang on KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas.

1175
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,420
The preacher you heard just a little while ago was, he was not with the subgenius church.

1176
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:06,180
He was with a rival cult. But he was right. He was right. There hadn't been enough volunteers

1177
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,040
lately.

1178
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:13,820
And if you want to find out how to help out the church of the subgenius and or KNON, call

1179
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:24,420
tomorrow. Call 692-6288. No Bobbies, please. I mean, you can love Bob and help spread his

1180
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,660
message through thankless labor without being obnoxious about it. In other words, we all

1181
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,940
need slack. But unless you already have some yourself, you're just going to be draining

1182
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,060
off what little the rest of us have left.

1183
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,800
But in the meantime, dear friend,

1184
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:43,400
Those of the rest of you who are not Bobbies, I want you to call that number, 692-6288.

1185
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,220
Oh, yes.

1186
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:46,560
.

1187
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:46,560


1188
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,940
.

1189
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:00,920

1190
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,000

1191
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,100
.

1192
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,320
hey

1193
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:04,720
What is this!

1194
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,060
Gimme a piece of rock!

1195
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:07,700
That's not all he can express

1196
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,900
He knows the lyrics

1197
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,920
And his body isĞ¾Ğ¼

1198
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,800
By the way,

00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,280
I am

1200
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:16,880
Looks like

1201
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,480
IT IS

1202
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:25,580
Maybe they work together

1203
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,040
The way this car drives

1204
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,020
Foriii

00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,100

ro evans

1208
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,480

1209
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,000
is

1210
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,600
yes sir dear friends

1211
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,200
i'm happier than the morning sun

1212
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:20,120
that's the way it'll always be ever since the day you came inside of me

1213
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:41,360
johnny could only sing one note and the note he sang was this die if you want to

1214
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:42,340
you

1215
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:42,720
is

1216
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:11,640
so you come out and you draw and you say bam bam stop and the guy doesn't stop

1217
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,580
then you move up to the head and you put one right there and that's usually fine.

1218
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:36,340
Ah yes dear friends and so ends another hour of slack. If you need information on Church of

1219
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:45,600
the subgenius please be sure and write P.O. Box 140306 Dallas Texas 75214. Sending your pledge

1220
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:54,760
drives to KNON which station this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas Texas and stay tuned for Ron Lindsey

1221
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,260
and Soul Oldies.

1222
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:12,540
Now Bob you're getting to be a pretty big fella. Yes sir maybe this is a good idea chance for us to

1223
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:21,020
have a little talk. Why sure dad what's cooking? Remember the last time we talked about this old

1224
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:27,340
body of ours Bob? Yeah yeah I remember dad. No. Oh here's a match your pipe's gone out again.

1225
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:33,780
Well thanks but when a doctor speaks of the male organ he well he calls it a

1226
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:33,920
you

1227
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:44,820
when a man and a woman are married Bob they love each other very much and in in showing their love

1228
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:51,880
their instinct is to embrace each other as if well as if to try to become the one person God

1229
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,300
intended them to be or the the sperm as the doctors call it. Is that the seed that helps

1230
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:06,160
make a new baby? No no Bob well what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the forms

1231
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,840
in two little sacks beneath the penis which we call the. Oh but dad why do fellas get these

1232
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:19,140
these feelings before they get married? Now that's a good question Bob. Why do you ask him?
