00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
🎵

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,080
Ah, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,740
Uh, test, test, test.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,560
Yes, everything seems to be working.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,680
Uh, just fine once again.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, welcome to another service here at the Church of the Subgenius.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,140
Funny how that happens.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,780
Just about every show when we start up.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,500
But you know, friends, I think we should start with a prayer.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,660
Yes, uh, well, it's not so much a prayer as a deal, I suppose you could call it.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,640
Let's do business.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,580
Uh, Bob.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,520
Bob, I accept your offer.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,520
I want to be a winner on your terms.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,160
But right now, I turn over to you all my sins, my failures, my frustrations,

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
my insecurity, and my insincerity.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,620
I hope from you my excuse, a peace of mind,

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,620
power to live the new life that you promised for now and all eternity,

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,880
or triple my membership dues back.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,920
I invite you, Bob, to come into my life.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,120
Thank you for reserving a seat on the escape saucers of the sex goddesses for me.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,020
And thank you, Bob, for making me a winner.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,540
By giving me eternal slack.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,800
I pray in your name.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,000
Amen.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,540
Signed, Reverend Ivan Stang.

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,160
Date, hour of slack number 531.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,360
Because the book of the subgenius says,

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,860
he that hath Bob hath slack,

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,680
and he that hath not Bob hath not slack.

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,640
One Janer 512.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:53,960
512.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,240
Oh, yes.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,400
Yes, yes, yes.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,200
And listen to that lovely Zug's Rift instrumental there in the background.

36
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,140
It's such a beautiful thing.

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,940
And we'll clean the cassettes up off the floor.

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,680
You know, as I'm standing before the open exit doorway,

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,540
tears streaming down my eyes in glory and lust,

40
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,900
while the world around me is turning to negative particles,

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,320
charged dust.

42
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,400
And suddenly the sex goddess attendant looks at my card.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,500
As she, it turns to me and says,

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
you forgot to pay your dues.

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,720
And now I got the about to be calcified as a pink boy.

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,320
Blues, blues, he said.

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,040
It's blues.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, man.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,100
Do you want to pour it down?

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,220
Do you want to pour it down?

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,480
Pour it down.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,300
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,660
Hour of Slack.

54
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,120
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,640
That one time hour, friends.

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
That mysterious hour.

57
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,200
We can just get it started.

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Poltergeist infested hour, yes.

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,680
Friends, the poltergeist is working tonight.

60
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,300
Yes, he's working double time.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,420
He won't turn off.

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,660
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang.

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,760
You're liable to hurt yourself.

64
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,660
There you go.

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,080
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started here, doctor.

66
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm anxious to take off.

67
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,380
Take off.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,040
Oh, wait a minute.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,580
Will you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,780
What'd you do, doctor?

71
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,040
Central control processor on.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,100
There, central control is on, doctor.

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,180
Good, good.

74
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,220
Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,040
Yeah.

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Oh, watch out for that squid, man.

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,560
There's a prairie squid.

78
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:54,640
There's a prairie squid.

79
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,300
Right by the door.

80
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,860
Speaking of which.

81
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,420
And inject some of those collar soles, would you, into the retribution chamber?

82
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,420
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

83
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,680
Well, we really might.

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,780
Line two has a prayer request.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,920
Is that so, friends?

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,880
Well, tell them to pray.

87
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,660
That's right.

88
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,280
They're just going to have to pray, friends, because Pastor Naked ain't here.

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,040
And Pastor Naked ain't been here for quite a long, long time.

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,580
It's sad.

91
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,820
Pastor Bucknaked decided that the church or the subgenius wasn't for him and converted

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,080
to another faith.

93
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,440
But enough of that, friends.

94
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,180
That's old history.

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:47,080
Yes, we are going to rerun, rerun, a classic rerun interspersed with new runs.

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,080
The classic is, of course, Hour of Slack number 40, The Prairie Squid Show, featuring Dr.

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,940
G. Gordon Gordon as a special guest and stolen sound effects records also.

98
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,200
But before we get into that, friends, I have a couple of things that I need to cover with

99
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,420
you.

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,500
This will be probably my last chance to get this information out before I have to leave

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,300
town for the X Day Drill.

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,040
Yes, dear friends, once again, the church, well, actually, this will be for the first

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
time in quite a while.

104
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,060
The church of the subgenius is sponsoring a giant show.

105
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,660
A gigantic dock stock, you might say.

106
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:37,480
A church fest where saucers will scream overhead in wonderment and the gray aliens will mate

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,760
with yetis right by your campfire.

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,400
You'll meet your true yeti mate and you'll watch sideshow marvels poke things into their

109
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,860
faces.

110
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,960
You'll drink from tubs of purple Kool-Aid and it'll be raining prairie.

111
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,300
You'll see thatú

112
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:04,140
Dre eventual vives at the fullback out with a

113
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,240
RFID with characters including Samb профiles and more avere sitting

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,580
Glocken impossible to use

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,600
Glocken impossible to guilty

116
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,660
Glocken impossible to play

117
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,560
Glocken impossible to play

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:19,640
intelligibly

119
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,960
And now I'm going to turn on video.

120
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:22,960


121
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,040
It's a wind drum listen.

122
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,720
stuff right here and now I can only tell you where to get that information if it hasn't

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,620
already been mailed to you. By the time you get this tape delivered through your radio

124
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,260
you hopefully will already have the flyer that the Lord Jesus is working so hard on

125
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,580
even as I speak and Reverend Nikki and all her men are out there in the other room folding

126
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,580
these flyers and we've been battling with the infernal United States Post Office and

127
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,200
their silly rules and friends we're going to get that interim start fist to you just

128
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,460
as fast as we can but in the meantime you can call for information about that X day

129
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:13,000
drill sin fest at the DeVival hotline. I'm going to give that number right now. Here's

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,560
that number coming right up. DeVival hotline 216-557-7000.

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:26,260
Once again that's area code because for some reason the DeVival hotline is in Cleveland

132
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:34,400
at area code 216. Call that number 556-0338 and what you can also do is just send us that

133
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:48,040
self-addressed stamped envelope to the Subgenius Foundation here. P.O. Box 140306. That's box

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:58,780
40306 in Dallas, Texas 75214. Address that to Bob. We'll send you the flyers and so forth.

135
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,080
If you're a dues paying Subgenius member why it's a cheap weekend camp out where you'll

136
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,220
meet all the greats of it. It sounds last I heard the swinging love corpses were planning

137
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:18,560
to be there. Dr. Legume will definitely be there. Papa Joe Mama. Who knows what and who's

138
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,900
the sexy preetresses such as Reverend Nikki. You'll finally get to meet Will of Dobbs and

139
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:32,080
demand your back orders from him. And oh gosh what else. Well I mean there's just no end.

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,300
You'll just finally see what your fellow subgeniuses are like and you know half the time you won't

141
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:47,620
be disappointed. Yes you know because probably the majority of bookman are pipe men. There's

142
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,960
an intimate link between frop and books and radio shows have not the works of some of

143
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,280
our greatest writers and ranters been born to us on curling smoke clouds and have not

144
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:10,860
their authors advertised the benign influence of Frappi in immortal puffs. There is I affirm

145
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,720
in grateful recollection nothing better than the enjoyment of a radio show than the cloistered

146
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,040
calm.

147
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,080
Of a.

148
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,460
Life.

149
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,560


150
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,900
Library.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,800
And a pipe. Which draws coolly and sweetly. Dear friends because you know what I have

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:36,000
been seized. I have been seized in the spirit. He has me in his grip. He rebuked me for my

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,120
slackness. He is working through me now to direct my fingers. I am the puppet. I am to

154
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,320
reach out and touch Christian America. Dear friends yes and share my special

155
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,640
information and revelation with anointed ministries across the land for something is happening.

156
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,220
At twilight ye shall eat flesh it said in Bob's first book exodus 16 12 and it seems

157
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,900
incredible that my actions should be even at all necessary.

158
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,740
So hypnotized is Christian America sitting in front of their devilment boxes in front

159
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,940
of that dancing snake. It is robbing Bob, friends, robbing Bob. Idolatry! I believe that sinister

160
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:32,660
anti-Bob powers in Washington and Moscow have put the big quash on data crucial to our knowledge

161
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,440
and continued existence, and if this mailing that we are preparing for you itself does not get to

162
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:47,840
you, do not be surprised. What price, subgenius silence, when the United Nations peacekeepers

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,240
march into the heartland with their jackboots, seizing books of the subgenius, bombing our

164
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,880
churches, setting fire to babies, our mothers and daughters lashed down and raped by wolverines,

165
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,660
will America then come to its senses, pop its finger out, and recognize the ultimate forces

166
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,420
that have begun to employ our plans?

167
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:17,860
As their battlefield, Deuteronomy 3221, so I will stir them to jealousy with those who are no

168
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,320
people. I will provoke them with a foolish nation and a foolish notion too, friends.

169
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
So you don't know, you just don't know. At my worldly workplace, there's this woman with her

170
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,500
TV ever on, and I am shackled, forced to endure the eternal torments of cuss words,

171
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,320
erping forth like blood.

172
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,000
A drunk slashing belching huns. I witness unto her politely explaining that each cuss word is a

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,620
rusty poison spike rammed into the tender sacred crotch of our short-duration savior Bob Dobbs,

174
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,720
that this cannot be allowed, that Bob's blood's on my hands. What shall I say at glory time?

175
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,600
It is as if I'm being mauled by amusement park lions for the depraved entertainment of Roman

176
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,360
senators. Each cuss word, a slicing claw of malignancy.

177
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,180
The ripping,

178
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:15,480
the ravenous jaws peeling away my outside layers, yanking out my personal bodily organs to ruin Bob's

179
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,700
internal order, and dragging them dripping across my body. My hands guard my face, but the fever-crazed

180
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:29,820
animals, the beasts bite down to crush my knuckles that pop like balloons, and the blood squirts into

181
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:36,140
my eyeballs, washed, washed in the blood and the pee. This is what it means to be a true and

182
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,180
righteous subgenius.

183
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,940
Bob believing,

184
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,220
leaving martyr in these ghastly, wicked, violent latter days, for the time will come when they will not endure sound

185
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:53,820
doctrine on their radios. And so I informed this woman that she must repent, quit her job, or else, or else scream in

186
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:02,720
chains of ultimate agony through judgment, where time runs backwards in the worm pit torture palace of shrieking

187
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,480
hell, and you know what she says? Have a nice day.

188
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:17,600
That I'm a creep, a kook. That I must shut up, and she will, or she will get the authorities, and have me fired.

189
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:25,380
Friends, that's what we're up against in this modern day and age. It's a sad and sinister time.

190
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,580
My dear, precious, subgenius brethren.

191
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
By the way, as honest as I'd like to be, I...

192
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,780
I have to lie.

193
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:49,920
I have to lie and say that that last rant there was written, actually, by Reverend McDonald, who's a Christian, and I just changed it a little bit.

194
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,640
And now, friends, back to The Prairie Squid Show. Thank y'all.

195
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:07,860
That music in the background, by the way, was by Zug's Rift, of course, from his CD Villagers on Musical Tragedies.

196
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,040
And, uh, thank y'all.

197
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,340
Number one, cassette deck two is not working.

198
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,100
And the ports on the starboard side are completely...

199
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,480
That's okay, uh...

200
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,080
We're losing air fast, and we're gonna have to try to keep up with it, friend.

201
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,080
Well, I'll open up this big blue cylinder of church air over here, doctor.

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,200
Ah, yes, heavens.

203
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,120
Now I feel considerably better.

204
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,320
Ah, yes, I'm in this church air.

205
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,620
Oh, yes, praise God, I feel that church air now.

206
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,280
Yeah.

207
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,700
Do you feel it?

208
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,860
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience? I bet you can.

209
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,140
I bet you can. If you can't, reach out and feel it, friends.

210
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,100
And if you can't reach down and feel it, then you're gonna...

211
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,360
And then you probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

212
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,180
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

213
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,160
When you were... When you... Now, I know about half our audience, Dr. Gordon, probably unders...

214
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,180
Probably remember when they were teenage.

215
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,860
Boys and girls out in the, you know, West Texas or wherever they're from, going out in the fields and...

216
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,560
Taking off their clothes and spreading some prairie squid bait all over, you know...

217
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,160
Yes, yeah.

218
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,920
What did you used to use for... I used jelly, mostly.

219
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,800
Yeah, I found...

220
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,640
Honey, whatever I could steal from my folks.

221
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,160
Peanut butter with bananas in it worked real well.

222
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,600
Yeah.

223
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,180
Yeah, I found that was...

224
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,160
And those...

225
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,780
Those...

226
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,600
Decompressants from all that traveling, doctor.

227
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,500
...squids, would they be...

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,240
They'd be crawling out of the... Well, of course you know...

229
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,540
...squids, they're crawling out of the woodwork.

230
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,240
Yes, indeed.

231
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,860
Out of the brush.

232
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,180
Out of the weeds, so to speak.

233
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,800
You just lay there and wait for them.

234
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,420
And there you were.

235
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,560
And be quiet, because you'd scare them away.

236
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:46,840


237
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,620
They're very... And, you know, it's just... Just to give you an example, it's just like...

238
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,140
Do you remember back when you were a kid, there were all those thousands of those little cute horny toads around?

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,900
And why do you think they called them horny toads, Francis?

240
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,780
Yeah, because they counter exist.

241
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,680
You know, they're part of a symbiotic relationship with that favorite outdoor mollusk of ours.

242
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,400
Yes, and dare we say the name again?

243
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,580
The mighty prairie squid.

244
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,420
Prairie squid. Yes.

245
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,460
Oh, yes.

246
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:20,020
And, of course, as you know, Dr. Stang, I have just come back from a fact-finding tour through the Amazonas regions of Brazil.

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:30,080
Yes, friends, just to fill you in exactly on what's going on here, we have as our special guest tonight Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Yes, indeed.

249
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,080
The erstwhile head of the Greenhill-Dobstown encampment.

250
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,900
And now commandant of Dobstown II just outside Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

251
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,740
Yes, friends, right on the coast where the surf is high and so is everybody else usually.

252
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,420
And, friends, you know...

253
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,780
And this, what you're listening to, dear friends, is the hour of slack...

254
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,560
Yes, friends.

255
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,580
...on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

256
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:05,980
Now that the uranium has warmed up, the airlock leak has been stopped, I think it's about time we launched this show.

257
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,360
Yes, sir.

258
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,400
I can feel that, the mighty thrust of that show lifting us up higher and higher.

259
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
That thrust, yeah.

260
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,460
As Dr. Mothersbaugh's beautiful hymn, the Bobcata, plays in the background.

261
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,520
And maybe if I hit this tape deck hard enough...

262
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,940
Hit it hard.

263
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,180
Well, whatever.

264
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,040
We don't do that, okay?

265
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,580
It's not voodoo.

266
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,920
It's not curses.

267
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,660
It's, uh...

268
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,760
It's sowing and reaping.

269
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,520
And, uh, sometimes it happens and...

270
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,880
We gotta pray for that young man.

271
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,920
That guy needs some help.

272
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,940
These guys need some help.

273
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:50,060
We're gonna focus on an endangered species that probably, you know, half of you who weren't raised in the South probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

274
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,780
And we might as...

275
00:17:50,780 --> 00:18:04,380
Maybe we ought to identify, you know, just so people will know, who don't know what a prairie squid is, Doctor, perhaps we ought to at first sort of, as best we can, define our terms and say that a prairie squid is really...

276
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:12,500
It's a sort of a physical metaphor for a lot of things, and it's probably exactly what you think we're talking about when we're talking...

277
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,420
Well, it's not a metaphor.

278
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,020
It's an endangered species that lives on...

279
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,160
Yes, I know, but...

280
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,080
That used to live on prairies, and the fact that most of these collars don't even know what a prairie squid is...

281
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,060
Well, they don't even know what a prairie is.

282
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,140
It's all been covered up with...

283
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,620
Most of them.

284
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,320
...Los Colinas and all that kind of stuff, right?

285
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,160
Yeah, that's right.

286
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,560
Well...

287
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah, but at the same time, it is a metaphor for existence, Doug.

288
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,600
The very struggle of...

289
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,180
Who's Doug?

290
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,980
Of the prairie squid.

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,020
Doug, the guy over there.

292
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,460
The struggle of the poor...

293
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,660
Now, friends, you know, you do see prairie squids nowadays.

294
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,980
You can go to the supermarket and buy a dead, cellophane-wrapped...

295
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,680
Plucked?

296
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,500
...Shaved prairie squid.

297
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:50,900
Yeah.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,680
I mean, they...

299
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,820
It's shocking. It's shocking.

300
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,080
To us, to us old-timers, I mean, most of you, you...

301
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,920
That's the only way you're ever gonna see it.

302
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,160
They've never seen them alive.

303
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,540
I know.

304
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,160
A lot of them, people don't even know that they are actually alive.

305
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,980
They're just a wild animal.

306
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,180
And, friends, that's such a waste because, frankly...

307
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,180
Oh.

308
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:14,940
...frankly, what the prairie squid is best used for is the sexual act, sexual...

309
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes.

310
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,880
...congress.

311
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,500
And I'm, you know, I know this may...

312
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,660
We don't want to offend any radio...

313
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,040
But it's a...

314
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,020
But this is a...

315
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a well-known fact, Dr. Staines.

316
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,560
Yeah, I mean, you can look in the encyclopedia under prairie squid...

317
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,040
Under prairie...

318
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,880
Under squid sub prairie.

319
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,180
...or subgenius.

320
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,220
Yes.

321
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,340
And it'll say, see...

322
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,880
Subgenius, see prairie squid.

323
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:32,980


324
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,340
Exactly.

325
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,880
And, you know, yes, it is.

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,860
That's its best use, and some people might find that offensive, but they're the people

327
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,780
that don't like to think about things like that because sometimes they're not sure how

328
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,560
to do things like that, or they're afraid that somebody will laugh at them if they...

329
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:48,880
Oh.

330
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,500
...said that they did something like that, that they had them a prairie squid or two,

331
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:53,540


332
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,220
Oh, most of them think the prairie squid is a myth.

333
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:56,940
Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,860
They get real embarrassed if you talk about a prairie squid in polite society.

335
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,600
Yes.

336
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,320
They're the polished ears of the rationalists.

337
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,880
Yes, oh, yes, yes.

338
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,060
The modernist, the so-called...

339
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,640
The politically correct ears of the various groups.

340
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,600
...humanistic.

341
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,280
Yes.

342
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,740
You know, if they were humanists, if they were really concerned about humanity, they'd

343
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,920
free the prairie squid prisoners, and they'd quit killing prairie squids and making purses

344
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,040
and shoes out of them.

345
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,080
Well, I mean, it's worse than killing whales for dog food, Reverend Stang.

346
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,200
I mean, if you think about it, I mean, at least you're benefiting some canines who would

347
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,480
otherwise not have anything else to eat, but the very idea of killing and tanning prairie

348
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,640
squid and turning them into purses and basketball shoes...

349
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,680
It's repellent.

350
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,000
It's repellent to anyone who's really lived with nature, anyone who is really a nature-oriented

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,100
person who's concerned about the environment would, despite the stigma, despite the embarrassment...

352
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,300
They would be proud, Doctor.

353
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,460
They would be proud.

354
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,200
...proud, nay, they would find it their Bob-born duty...

355
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,900
Duty.

356
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,300
Duty, my dude.

357
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,860
Duty, yes.

358
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,880
...to seek out that prairie squid and protect them.

359
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,580
And nurture.

360
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,020
I mean...

361
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,840
And nurture that prairie squid.

362
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,640
So, we're not handling too much of the phony work tonight.

363
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,900
But I know just what to do about this.

364
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,800
Instead of any real...

365
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,360
Les said it was an anti-Bob...

366
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,460
They all want to be...

367
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,660
There's a common psychosis, this anti-Messiah complex.

368
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,280
Well, it's the only way you see it.

369
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,720
They want to be...

370
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,360
If you get your name in the paper as an anti-Messiah, it's in the same size type as if you were the Messiah.

371
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,400
They want to...

372
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,220
I mean, they link you to the Messiah by being...

373
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,660
I mean, guys that are saying they're anti-Bobs, they're just saying that so they can have their name linked with Bob.

374
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,940
You understand?

375
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,700
Exactly.

376
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,360
It's a hate-love relationship.

377
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,380
They know they can't...

378
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,760
They aren't good enough to be Bob or to even serve Bob right.

379
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,880
And they're mostly anti-squid people.

380
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,160
You know, you see them at these squid suppression rallies.

381
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,020
Yeah, and...

382
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,800
You know, getting a burning...

383
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,000
No right to squid.

384
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,800
You know, they got the no right to squid...

385
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,040
Burning records.

386
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,260
Yeah.

387
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,220
Burning records trying to stamp out prairie squid.

388
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,360
And those are the same kind of intolerant people who the only way they can react to something is to kill them.

389
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,140
If they don't understand it, they kill it.

390
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,920
They kill...

391
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,020
And if they can't eat it, they make socks or shoes or something like that out of it, you know.

392
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,780
There's people out there that would kill a Playboy magazine if they saw it crawling around through the bushes like a prairie squid.

393
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,100
Especially if they thought it would hurt them, you know, a little bit.

394
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,240
And since they're good for the same things...

395
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,960
Well, except that, of course, the Playboy magazine is by no means...

396
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,820
a prairie squid, Dr. Stang.

397
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm sure that you and I know that perhaps a Playboy magazine might be employed with a prairie squid, but certainly no such thing...

398
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,740
Man, I've never needed a play... anything besides just the squid.

399
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,820
The squid itself is all one really needs.

400
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,080
A prairie squid, it's like... it's like a snail without a shell.

401
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,700
A really large, about a foot long, they've got a light...

402
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,780
They're differing variations of color of hair and how much hair, how curly it is.

403
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,700
Yeah, and where it's distributed and...

404
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,060
and, you know, whether they're an elongated squid or a small, squamous, flattened-out squid, you know.

405
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,760
And just as a... as a snail is like one just... it's a pseudopod, it's a big foot.

406
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,000
A prairie squid, friends, is a huge erogenous zone. That's all it is.

407
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,720
A mobile erogenous zone. And we're not talking about one of them camper conversion kits either.

408
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,300
That's right. And this is not... this isn't some chauvinistic thing, because I know a lot of country girls out there know what we're talking about.

409
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,440
Because a prairie squid...

410
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,080
Well, it interfaces both ways, right, Doctor? I mean, that's...

411
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,580
Without... without expensive interfaces, you can plug right into these amazing new pets.

412
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,280
I mean, you don't need attachments or rubber washers or anything like that with a...

413
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,300
It just... one serves the entire family.

414
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,260
And back in the old pioneer days, when they first came across this prairie from little towns up the northeast and the north...

415
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,140
It was a family thing.

416
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,860
Yeah, sure, you had the little prairie squid cage right there on the back of the covered wagon.

417
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,340
Everybody had them. I mean, you... you nurtured them.

418
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,320
And now... now they're almost extinct.

419
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,180
Now you could... you could cruise Turtle Creek from one end to the other and never find...

420
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,940
never find an ambulating prairie squid.

421
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:15,200
About five years ago, I saw the first wild prairie squid I'd seen since my childhood running around near Glen Rose, Texas, near the power plant.

422
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,280
So, well, who knows? Maybe they'll be real big, glowing prairie squids in a few years.

423
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,980
Yeah, that's true. Maybe they'll be mutated prairie squids, you know?

424
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,000
I mean, other things are changing fast, and people's social habits are changing.

425
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,960
And perhaps one day, Doctor, perhaps one day, the squid will...

426
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,100
In Bob's time...

427
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100
The squid, if Dobbs is willing, will return...

428
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,580
After Bob comes again...

429
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,320
...in all of its glory.

430
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,520
And the squid will.

431
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,000
The... yes, friends.

432
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,020
Yes, after Bob comes the squid.

433
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,620
But I... I think... I think now it's... it's... it's time for a phone call.

434
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,980
We'll go ahead and take a phone call here, friends.

435
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,360
But we're not going to answer.

436
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,680
You're a lame one.

437
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,080
Blue Mouse, call Johnny Normal's conference line.

438
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,080
And you guys let her talk, or she's nice.

439
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,880
No, Bob.

440
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,740
Let her talk, or she's nice.

441
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,340
Okay, we'll be nice if you talk.

442
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,980
Yes, that's fine.

443
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,120
That's right.

444
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,560
Oh, there she is right now.

445
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,240
Alright, let's see what she has to say.

446
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,380
Go ahead.

447
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,460
You don't even know why Rue Mouse...

448
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,900
Oh, no.

449
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,240
She knows.

450
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,140
Wait a minute.

451
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,660
Oh, no.

452
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,640
Now, Nick, I come in case, and this... this happens every damn time you put me on the defensive.

453
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,700
Is it... is it educated?

454
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,260
Well, first of all, you're not supposed to say damn.

455
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,180
So let's go...

456
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,800
I can't wait.

457
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,760
I can't wait.

458
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,120
Hello.

459
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,800
You're...

460
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm down to...

461
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,200
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

462
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,460
Uh, elevator parts.

463
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,740
Give her... give her a chance.

464
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,120
Okay, here's the chance.

465
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
This is your chance if you blow this.

466
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,000
Okay, I want you to know...

467
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:30,100
I want you to know that you're all on tape as, uh, violating the FCC rules, so don't

468
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,680
be sending people out after me.

469
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,040
I've got...

470
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,540
I've got tape on you, fool.

471
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,160
It's gonna come back on you.

472
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,120
Nothing's gonna come on you.

473
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,240
It's gonna come back on you.

474
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Ding-dongs button.

475
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,480
Nothing will happen to you.

476
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,160
You're nothing but a hypocrite.

477
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,440
You self-righteous hypocrite.

478
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,040
You sluggish, sluggish...

479
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,320
I am the Adron of Hestor.

480
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,420
My father is Had Urter, a hodler of the...

481
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Well, I'm not a self-defiling hypocrite.

482
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,260
I'm a surfer.

483
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,740
You know, that's what I am.

484
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,180
And let's...

485
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Let's get into that.

486
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,240
Let's go to call number one.

487
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,220
Only three more minutes.

488
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,040
I'm sorry that that neurotic woman got on the air, but you know what happens sometimes.

489
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,080
They get past our...

490
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,880
By all means, let's...

491
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,400
We're starting.

492
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:01,960
We're starting.

493
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,600
I just can't believe someone would call in and have the nerve to say things like that

494
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,520
about Prairie Squib.

495
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:06,840
I know.

496
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,200
And not only that, but they call somebody else's show...

497
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,540
I know.

498
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,420
...using our airtime.

499
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:10,980
Using...

500
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,000
And our area code, for that matter.

501
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,400
That...

502
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
You can bet it's gonna be charged to K-N-O-N.

503
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,020
...show that they're not speak its name in Berkeley, out in California.

504
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,920
Oh, they're hip out there in California.

505
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,680
Oh, yeah, but they...

506
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,300
They're so hip.

507
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,040
They've got...

508
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,380
Oh, they've got their crack, so to speak.

509
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,960
Yes, yes.

510
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,980
Their drugs and their wild sex.

511
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,200


512
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,800
Oh.

513
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,520
But have you ever heard a person from one of these hot tubbers talking about a Prairie

514
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,120
Squid, friends?

515
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,040
No, you never have.

516
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Never.

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,120
They don't know anything.

518
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,960
You haven't heard about those...

519
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,380
They don't even know...

520
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,260
They've never heard of it.

521
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,560
Those organic boys with their avocado dips and everything.

522
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,200
They're city folks.

523
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,840
Yeah, they don't know about Prairie Squid.

524
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,680
Oh, they know everything.

525
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,740
They know everything.

526
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,060
But they don't know that.

527
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,260
And if you told them...

528
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,800
If you tried to tell them about it, they'd think, oh, how quaint.

529
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:52,980
They'd think, oh, how quaint.

530
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,340
They'd think, oh, how quaint.

531
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,060
He's talking with his southern accent.

532
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,980
How folksy.

533
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,520


534
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,840
How folksy.

535
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:56,920
Yes.

536
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,940
Oh, he must...

537
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,880
He must be near to the earth or something.

538
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,340
Yes.

539
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,060
Yes, yes.

540
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
But I'm an artist.

541
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,980
I don't have to lower myself to those demeaning...

542
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm involved with such incredibly cerebral machinations over the...

543
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,620
Unpolitically minded.

544
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,260
I don't have to...

545
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,200
Over the politically correct aspect of my art and how it applies to Prairie Squid...

546
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,180
Yes, I'm not obsessed with...

547
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,240
...that I don't really have to think about the humorous side of these things if there

548
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,220
is a humorous side, because I'm serious.

549
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,960
I'm from California, I'm from California.

550
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,680
I don't have to do veiled juvenile humor, guising as some sort of highfalutin' environmental

551
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,140
concern citizen satire.

552
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:32,780
Yes.

553
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,140
I'm not that kind of person.

554
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,460
Oh, no, no, no, of course not.

555
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,900
No, that's what they'll tell you every time, friends.

556
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,540
Yeah, that's the line they'll spring on you.

557
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,640
The sophisticated line.

558
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,380
The conspiracy is...

559
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,740
Their bourgeois line.

560
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,920
The conspiracy is insidious, friends.

561
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,040
Incredibly, they make you want what they have, and they make you think...

562
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,920
And make you feel stupid because you haven't got it.

563
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,260
Yeah, and they make you think it's better than what you already have.

564
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,740
That way, once they get your attention directed at what they have, they can get your slack.

565
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,900
Your slack, friends.

566
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,580
That's right, and you're a Prairie Squid, too.

567
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,740
And if, as long as you're the kind of person that can still, you know, if you can find

568
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,660
one, you can go out in the woods and have a short relationship with one of these harmless

569
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:16,800
animals...

570
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,720
Or a long relationship.

571
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,580
I mean, you know, like, it's not...

572
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,880
There's no limited time...

573
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,660
The tantric sex magicians in India and the ancient cultures of the Earth have known of...

574
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,480
I mean, these creatures are not just common to the continental U.S.

575
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,900
That's right, and Reverend Stang, I don't know if you know it or not, but in Tibet,

576
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,960
they breed in the temples a special variety.

577
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,140
Oh, the fattened special prairie...

578
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,600
The special prairie squid.

579
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,680
The soft squid, they call it.

580
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,860
Yeah, it's the one that the Dalai Lama has.

581
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,660
Uh-huh.

582
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,560
And they still breed them there, and they have to ship them out to India where the Dalai

583
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,280
Lama is now.

584
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,080
You know, the Chinese let them because...

585
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,380
They're better fed than almost anyone in Tibet, any human being.

586
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,360
They're better fed than most of Tibet put together.

587
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,160
And, friends, when you become a member of the Church of the Subgenius, you become eligible.

588
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,660
Yes, eligible, friends.

589
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,340
We'll give you your very own prairie squid direction and survival package.

590
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,700
Give yourself to the feeling, friends.

591
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,360
Remember to write for information.

592
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,260
We don't want you to say,

593
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,560
I don't want you to send money.

594
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,300
We want you to send your whole wallet.

595
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,980
That's right.

596
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,980
You can take the money out.

597
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,560
Just send us the rest, especially those little pictures that you keep in the secret compartment...

598
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,900
Yeah, a few credit...

599
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,860
...that you don't show anybody.

600
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
We'll take the credit cards and things, too.

601
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,780
Well, we'll take those.

602
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,660
But those little pictures that no one else knows about, that's what...the Bob already

603
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,680
knows about those.

604
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,100
Yeah.

605
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,580
And we can judge just how highly to rank you in the great hierarchy of the Church.

606
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,940
And Bob collects them, too, we might add.

607
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,640
And the better ones, the better the pictures that come out of that little, tiny, secret,

608
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,240
embarrassing compartment in your wallet, the higher the rank you get.

609
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,300
The higher up the rungs you move.

610
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,200
Yes, friends.

611
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,960
And we also found that one person who sent his wallet in had a picture of a prairie squid

612
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
in it and didn't even know what it was.

613
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,080
He thought it was some curious...he thought it was some curious little life form or a

614
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,780
blowup of a bacteria or something.

615
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,780
And he'd been carrying it around for years because he felt it gave him good luck.

616
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,800
And it did.

617
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,640
It did.

618
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,060
It gave him incredible good luck because it brought him to Bob.

619
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,080
And you see that just a picture of a little thing like a prairie squid can set you on

620
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,980
the right path.

621
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,440
It'll put you right.

622
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,020
The path to Dobbs and salvation.

623
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,140
Praise Bob.

624
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,560
Bob loves you.

625
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,220
Bob loves you.

626
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,020
Bob loves you.

627
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


628
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


629
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


630
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


631
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


632
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


633
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,020


634
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,320
And you know, if you could just let go of those hang-ups that have kept you...that have

635
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,000
kept you tied down, friends, you could...

636
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,220
Shackled by your own life.

637
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,840
Your own insecurities, as they might say, Reverend Stang.

638
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,820
Your ignorance.

639
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,700
Your pathetic ignorance.

640
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,620
Your pathetic pink ignorance is what it is.

641
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Yeah.

642
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,240
Your ignorance of the subgenius P.O.

643
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,620
box number, which we were about to forget to give.

644
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,060
Oh, can we do that?

645
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,940
You bet we can.

646
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,580
We have to.

647
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,740
Oh, well, in that case...

648
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,140
Bob said we had to party.

649
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,780
Yes, well, that box number...

650
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,120
Friends, why are you sitting there listening to this radio show?

651
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,580
Why aren't you out partying?

652
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,360
Bob said to party.

653
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:16,980
Party.

654
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,840
Bob said you had to party.

655
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,060
Yes.

656
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,700
He didn't say you could.

657
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:20,700


658
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:20,920
He didn't say you could.

659
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,140
You had to party.

660
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
You had to party.

661
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,440
He didn't say you could.

662
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:22,440


663
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,200
He didn't say you might if you felt like it.

664
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,300
Yes, indeed, friends.

665
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:25,920
He said to get out there.

666
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,280
Where's that...where's that dirt?

667
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,360
We want Bob says to get out there and do it.

668
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,760
Bob says, find the squid.

669
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Yes, friends.

670
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,580
Let's bring those squids back.

671
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,580
Well, well, well, in the meantime, we'll just step back...

672
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,860
Someone said to Barry McGuire...

673
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,780
...into the real world.

674
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,000
...said, all you Christians, you're all the same.

675
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,840
You've all been brainwashed.

676
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,320
And Barry thought for a moment.

677
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
He said, yes, I am.

678
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,040
That's true.

679
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,180
But you sinners have been brainwashed also.

680
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,000
The only difference between you sinners and us Christians is that us Christians, we have

681
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,040
chosen to wash our brains.

682
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,840
That's a little rough.

683
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,280
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the liberals and the modernists, so

684
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,420
they soften it down, you see.

685
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,740
And of course, they would read that verse.

686
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,180
And they would say, Bob, you're all the same.

687
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,920
Let God be true in every man.

688
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,540
Be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance, in my opinion, they'd say.

689
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,060
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

690
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,500
But the Bible says, let God be true and let every man be a liar.

691
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,600
To make these Christians into a political force.

692
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,320
They don't want us involved.

693
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,140
Let's tell them we're not listening to them anymore.

694
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,180
We're going to have to do something.

695
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,180


696
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,180


697
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,180


698
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,180


699
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,180


700
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,700
We're going to have to be involved.

701
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,060
It isn't going to take Ronald Reagan three years to learn about the godless, aggressive

702
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,380
nature of communism.

703
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:06,740
Over the last two or three decades, the federal government seems to have forgotten both that

704
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,060
old time religion and that old time constitution.

705
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,900
It's been 1984 since 1989.

706
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,180
It's been 1984.

707
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,180


708
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,180


709
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,420
It's been 1953, friends.

710
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,220
That's right.

711
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,060
That was probably the last time your parents told you about the Perry's Good.

712
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,520
After that, you know, there was a law.

713
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,900
Yeah, you weren't even allowed to talk about it until J. Edgar Hoover passed on.

714
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,260
There's a law, friends, on the books.

715
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,460
It says this.

716
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,260
No subgenius can do anything it wants.

717
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,480
Now, is this a free country?

718
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,320
Yeah.

719
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,300
What kind of repressive law?

720
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,600
What kind of repressive law?

721
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,700
What kind of repressive law?

722
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,400
I mean, they talk, oh, America, home of the free.

723
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,740
Land of the brave.

724
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:55,960
Home of the brave.

725
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,440
Sure.

726
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,980
Are they brave enough to go out?

727
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,280
Are they brave enough to talk about prairie squid?

728
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:00,940
Oh, no.

729
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,340
No, no, no, no.

730
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,100
Can they talk about those two dogs we know of?

731
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,940
Oh, no, no.

732
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,760
Can't talk about them either.

733
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,640
But, you know, and they're saying, oh, well, it's a land where we have free discussions.

734
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,080
Yeah.

735
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,840
It's a democracy.

736
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,880
But you can only launch a bleeding head of Arnold Palmer on Thursday.

737
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,820
Thursday night, they say.

738
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,960
And not if it's a public holiday.

739
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,480
Yeah.

740
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:33,200
A golfer head can only be launched on Thursdays in your own, you know, in the home of a consenting

741
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,400
person.

742
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,020
You can't just go next door to your neighbors and launch a head if you feel like it.

743
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,120
And, dobs forbid, you launch a head in public, like downtown on the main square or something

744
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,100
like that in North Little Rock, you find yourself in trouble with the county law, boy.

745
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,420
Yeah.

746
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,920
You can tell them, oh, but officer, like Doctors for Bob did.

747
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,740
You can say, oh, officer.

748
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,960
But I'm a bold surrealist, sir.

749
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,980
I'm a bold surrealist.

750
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,380
Oh, yeah.

751
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,760
Oh, yeah.

752
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,280
We got bold surrealists.

753
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,980
We got 40 men hanging from telephone poles up in Tucker that like to say they were bold

754
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:03,980


755
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,840
They were bold surrealists.

756
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,680
Yes, friends.

757
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,140
Yeah.

758
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,520
Oh, they'll launch every kind of head.

759
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah.

760
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,280
They'll launch a sneed head.

761
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,020
Oh, yeah.

762
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,840
They'll launch a Trevino forearm if you aren't careful.

763
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,600
Wearing big green straps the whole time.

764
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,980
The whole time, friends.

765
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,860
Friends, I want you to listen to this tape and just listen to it.

766
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:19,860


767
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:19,860


768
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:19,860


769
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,020
And I want you to meditate.

770
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,640
Meditate on this message tape.

771
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,100
Close your eyes and think about Prairie Squid and listen to this tape.

772
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,380
That's true.

773
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,420
They did, but the head moved up or down.

774
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:39,180
And I can recall not too long ago, my father said to me, while playing around at home,

775
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,660
you're moving your head.

776
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,780
And I said, I don't think so.

777
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,280
I said, I'm keeping my eye on the ball.

778
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,300
And he said, well, you're keeping your eye on the ball?

779
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,580
Oh, yes, but your head is moving up and down, which I had worked into this unconsciously.

780
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,960
See, Arnold Palmer unconsciously knew that his head was going to be launched.

781
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,200
And you, his head had to be launched.

782
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,760
Yeah.

783
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,060
But that's not the real, that's not the Arnold Palmer that you're thinking of, friends.

784
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,600
No, no, no.

785
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,260
You're just not the guy that drives a tractor.

786
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,060
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

787
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,920
No, no.

788
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,600
It's not the guy who sells, you know, oil-based petroleum products.

789
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,980
This is, this is the, oh, forget it.

790
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,320
You don't even want to, there's no way they can understand it.

791
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,580
There's no way they can understand it.

792
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,180
They really couldn't.

793
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,800
Just write to that box number.

794
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,260
Yeah, that box number, friends, for the Church of the Subgenius.

795
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,520
And we'll send you plenty of information about prairie squids, golfer head launch-ins, slack,

796
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,200
slack, how to make, how to get free sex all the time from anybody for anything.

797
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,260
And, and Reverend Stang, yeah, the Good Sex for Mutants Dating League, I believe, you

798
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,360
know.

799
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,820
Oh, that's right.

800
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,500
Yeah, we had mentioned it a while.

801
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,600
Yeah, that's another church service.

802
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,640
Yeah, since Buck sold the Good Sex for Mutants Dating League, the cat lady.

803
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,220
Well, he had to.

804
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,440
He was just getting worn out, Reverend Stang.

805
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,720
You know what he sold it for?

806
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,040
It was, it was getting worn out.

807
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,800
It was wearing him out.

808
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
But you know, you know what he sold it for?

809
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,080
All I'm hot and heated.

810
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,800
You know what he sold it for?

811
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,280
Franchise?

812
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,740
No, what did he sell a franchise for?

813
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,500
A bottle of Ripple.

814
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,240
Well, that seems to be value received for value given, if you ask me, Doctor.

815
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,520
But, friends, when you write to P.O.

816
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:08,480
Box 1403-06 in Dallas, Texas, 75214, you can get information.

817
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,720
And you don't have to send money.

818
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,220
You'll get lots of printed information.

819
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,520
That's right.

820
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,880
It'll tell you where to write the Good Sex for Mutants in Salt Lake City.

821
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,420
Cat lady.

822
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,700
We'll send you, we'll send you the little maps of the.

823
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:27,480
Of the known existing prairie squid wildlife refuges in your area, if there are any, if

824
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,020
you're fortunate enough to live in a part of the country where there are still a few

825
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,500
of these precious creatures left.

826
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,800
Where they're still legal.

827
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,340
Yeah.

828
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,340
Well, they're not really.

829
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,540
Oh, Doctor Dool, you just got back from the mutant beauty contest at the Good Sex for

830
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,540


831
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,600
Yeah, I was one of the judges at the Good Sex for Mutants Dating League first annual

832
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,680
beauty contest in Salt Lake City.

833
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
Just 10 days ago, Reverend Stang.

834
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,280
Those lovely, how were those lovely and disgusting subgenius mutants, Doctor Gordon?

835
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,500
They were, they were some of the most beautifully disgusting mutated sickly creatures that I

836
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,040
have ever seen.

837
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,040
Beautiful mutants.

838
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,700
And there was actually a close runner up.

839
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:13,280
She was voted Miss, well, we think she was voted Miss Congeniality, was actually a mutated

840
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,080
variation of prairie squid.

841
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,780
Praise Bob.

842
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,980
Praise Bob.

843
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,520
And it was the biggest, the biggest prairie squid that I have ever seen.

844
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,720
I say it was about 110 pound prairie squid.

845
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,500
And friends, if you just tuned in late.

846
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,100
God thank you for touching his life.

847
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,880
Do whatever you have to do.

848
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,240
Lord, short of killing the boy, do whatever you gotta do to bring him in.

849
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,440
Yes, Jesus.

850
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,160
Jesus name.

851
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,760
All right.

852
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,380
Praise you, Jesus.

853
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:40,860
All right.

854
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,880
Go to sleep, lady.

855
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,220
Praise you, Lord.

856
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,060
Just cut him loose.

857
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,220
Cut the boy loose.

858
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:47,940
Oh, amen.

859
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:47,960
Oh, amen.

860
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,500
Let God do it.

861
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,660
He does a much better job than we do.

862
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,140
Praise you, Lord.

863
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,180
Go on and have a drink lady.

864
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,080
You need a drink out there.

865
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,840
Oh, yes.

866
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,560
Uh-huh.

867
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,840
Ha-ha.

868
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,500
Oh-ho.

869
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,280
Oh.

870
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,220
Hee-hee.

871
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,140
Hee-hee.

872
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,220
Oh, Lord, we praise you.

873
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,220
Thank you.

874
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,840
Oh, Lord, Jesus.

875
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,540
You're so wonderful.

876
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,460
Oh, mama, that is wonderful.

877
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:17,940
Oh, mama.

878
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


879
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


880
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


881
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


882
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


883
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


884
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


885
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


886
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940


887
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,700
you know when friends if you had joined up if you'd been the first person on your continent

gordon here the pope of south america the entire continent of south america it's mine when those

890
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,900
soul are the harvest friends when we start collecting those souls you know who's gonna

891
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:04,600
get to skim to skim that fine fine layer off the top out of the soul rendering vat don't you friend

892
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,000
oh and they're trying to keep them from selling any kind of soul down there nowadays oh yeah they

893
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,560
they don't used to be in the old days you couldn't give it away and now it's against the law to sell

894
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,680
it so what are you gonna do and and all the religions

895
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,140
want to have your soul friends bob wants your soul but just temporarily he'll give it back after he's

896
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,260
and he only he only uses it a little bit while he's got it friends that's something to think

897
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,780
he doesn't dry you out that's right friends as jayner hyper cleats uh the the uh the trance

898
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:42,120
spouter of all time jayner hyper cleats and little rock arkansas once said they they said my mind was

899
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,660
in this jar and then they poured it down a sink i want you to read this book it's called the

900
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,080
trance and i want you to think about that friends and

901
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,200
he's a maniac out to rule the world what can i do to make you understand

902
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,440
i love you

903
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,700
goodbye ice man

904
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,960
i want that money you owe me

905
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,680
so

906
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,960
so

907
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,300
microstructure that stores the energy of systolic contraction

908
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,520
there is now increasing evidence that the connective tissue surrounding the individual muscle cells

909
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,720
as well as the tissue linking the cells also plays a role.

910
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,420
And I think that about sums up how the prairie squid actually moves, Doctor.

911
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm sure, I'm very sure that our audience has been finally, finally so glad to know

912
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,820
or at least feel like they can go out into the street and feel cool again.

913
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,060
Knowing about, you know, how they work, right?

914
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,520
Yeah.

915
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah, that's what it's all about.

916
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,540
Well, Chicago's youngest mother, an unnamed girl,

917
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,800
at the age of 10 years and 8 months gave birth naturally in Chicago.

918
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,180
This is the second youngest in the United States when she was delivered of a 6-pound, 4-ounce girl.

919
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,740
Now, friends, you know, at the same time, he described it as pterodactyl-like.

920
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,120
It had a Brahma bull type of hump on the back, like a pelican's pouch at its throat,

921
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,520
and a 5- to 6-foot wingspan.

922
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,900
Not with...

923
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,260
Feathers.

924
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,120
This was a reptilian thing.

925
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,540
And it was seen by a paramedic who works for the Harlingen, Texas, emergency medical service.

926
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,060
Well, I was down there on the river and a big bird came down.

927
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,140
Man, it was tremendous.

928
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,960
Yes, big bird is back.

929
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,460
Probably hunting prairie squid along the edges of the Rio Grande River.

930
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:11,300
And, friends, somewhere at the edge of your mind is a sort of a tiny cluster of memories

931
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,880
that date back to human prehistory,

932
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,680
to a time when...

933
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,460
Every man, or in those days, they weren't men at all.

934
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,380
They were yetis.

935
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:19,840
Yes.

936
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,600
And the women, even the women were yetis, too.

937
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:31,920
And in those days, friend, the prairie squid didn't have to live among horny toads to stay stimulated.

938
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:40,600
It was able to, let us say, converse physically with the yetis at any time that they wished.

939
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,120
You know, the yetis, friends, your ancestors, those of you who are true subgeniuses.

940
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,320
Except for that one variety of self-stimulating prairie squid, doctor,

941
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,320
which, as you know, became extinct in the late devouring period, I think it was.

942
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,540
Yeah, well, that was...

943
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,140
There was...

944
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,300
Yeah, but that was long after the yetis were extinct themselves,

945
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,100
and that's probably what killed them off.

946
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,040
I'm holding in my hand here a book titled Things You Never Knew Existed.

947
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,120
A very forthright compendium, friends, one might say.

948
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,380
And right here on page 44, there it is.

949
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,100
Squid, comma, prairie.

950
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,920
And there is an entire summation.

951
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,320
Now, you can get this information on this prairie squid

952
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,760
by merely writing to the Church of the Subgenius.

953
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,740
That's right, friend.

954
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,860
And if Reverend Stang would be so kind as to give him that sacred box number really quick one more time,

955
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,820
and I believe we might get a guest telephone caller as their lights are still...

956
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,420
Well, no, it looks like he's drifted off again, doctor.

957
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,140
Oh, we'll get one, we'll get one.

958
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,540
Friends, that address is for you to write to for more information.

959
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,940
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the only individual who could save your soul and then give it back to you again.

960
00:44:51,720 --> 00:45:05,120
That address for Bob is Subgenius Foundation, P.O. Box 140306, dear friend, in Dallas, Texas.

961
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,700
75214.

962
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,040
And, uh, oh, friends, you don't know what.

963
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,000
You don't know what could be coming your way.

964
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,440
Send in the mail once you sign up with this amazing church with your free information.

965
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:26,280
You can find out the inside story on not just things like prairie squid.

966
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,560
You can find out why you've been losing at the races and how to start winning again.

967
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,300
How come you didn't get that big raise at your conspiracy job that you're nailed to?

968
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,040
How come that special date with her didn't work out?

969
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,260
And remember that first time you found you couldn't do it for the second time?

970
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,040
Yes, friend.

971
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,020
Friends, that's only almost as scary as the second time you find that you can't do it for the first time.

972
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,120
It's scary, friends.

973
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,420
It's a scary, scary world out there.

974
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,280
People waiting to see what you can do.

975
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,300
You won't have these problems if you just let Bob solve them for you.

976
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,680
Get right with Dobbs.

977
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,480
Let Bob into your life, friends.

978
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,520
Let Bob into your heart.

979
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,380
You need Bob.

980
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,380
You have to have Bob.

981
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,820
You have to have him.

982
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,020
You better have him.

983
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,840
You know you want it.

984
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,660
Because I'll tell you, friends, when those...

985
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,380
You have to have it.

986
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:14,580
You have to have it.

987
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,100
Because when those...

988
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,640
When those end times come down, if you're not right with Bob, you're gonna fry.

989
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,800
And you'll probably deserve it.

990
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,140
You will deserve it.

991
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,940
You'll wish you could die, friends.

992
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,020
You'll wish you could die.

993
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,300
But Bobby...

994
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:26,940
But it'll be worse.

995
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,160
Oh, Bobby, he won't let you.

996
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
He won't let you die.

997
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,200
You'll be going, Bob, kill me.

998
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,660
Give me a car right here.

999
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,160
Please, Bob.

1000
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,280
You didn't tell me the end times was gonna be worse than a Sidney Sheldon miniseries on TV.

1001
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,040
Friends, we're gonna take that caller right now.

1002
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,180
Where are we gonna take her to?

1003
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,640
To our territory.

1004
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,600
Our territory continues to be shaken under these conditions.

1005
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,120
Squick.

1006
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:49,820
Squick.

1007
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,280
It's been a long time since we were trapped by a line.

1008
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,260
That's a squid ick for the uninitiated.

1009
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,340
Yes, this is the show that continues to be trapped by the tiny callers.

1010
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,140
An icky squid is a sticky squid.

1011
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,480
You call in, we are forced to listen to you.

1012
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,180
We always used to say at the academy.

1013
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,420
That's right, an icky squid is one that's actually...

1014
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,360
And if you were just to call...

1015
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,060
It's the icktheus.

1016
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,260
You're now listening.

1017
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,080
What is an icktheologist?

1018
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,760
If you're awake, it won't make any sense.

1019
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,080
It's a giant icktheosaur.

1020
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,180
No, you're asleep right now, and this is the ugly show.

1021
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,540
Is that a squid, or is that an icktheosaur?

1022
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,200
...in central California at this hour, and even people in the building refuse to listen to it.

1023
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,040
Well, let's hear what that other caller has to say.

1024
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,880
Okay.

1025
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,640
Oh, he's calling another caller to see what he has to say.

1026
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,360
He's calling another caller.

1027
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,140
It's a chain reaction.

1028
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,640
Call callers and find out what they have to say.

1029
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,360
The last person who broke the chain, something terrible happened.

1030
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,040
So don't do it.

1031
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,740
Do what it says and call the next caller.

1032
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,600
Call a caller now.

1033
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,400
The last caller disintegrated two U-quarks, a D-quark, and three pi-basins.

1034
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,920
Go ahead, go ahead.

1035
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,520
Go ahead.

1036
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,720
We let you speak if you're real.

1037
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,040
I'll tell you all them freaks out of it.

1038
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,700
Just pick up the phone and dial in.

1039
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,440
They've been called.

1040
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,520
There you go.

1041
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:49,640
See?

1042
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:49,960
Yeah.

1043
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,000
Somebody don't tell us.

1044
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,680
Tell us about your basketball game down there at Santa Fe School with all the eight-year-olds today.

1045
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,580
Tell us about that.

1046
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,000
Icky squid.

1047
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,100
They talk about squid.

1048
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,620
They talk about squid out there.

1049
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,440
Yeah, they can talk.

1050
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,740
They like to act like people who know what a prairie squid is.

1051
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,260
But anybody who called an icky squid.

1052
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,040
Because they heard about it for months, frankly.

1053
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,040
Yeah, of course.

1054
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,220
I'll just throw these little wellmen down there.

1055
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:10,660
Yeah.

1056
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,200
Yes, that was one of the hour of slack.

1057
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,060
There's a lot of hour of slack shows out there.

1058
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,740
Actually, that one's not.

1059
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,180
That predates the hour of slack.

1060
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,720
That's the pre-hour of slack show, isn't it?

1061
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,300
More than an hour, less than a show.

1062
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,920
It's kind of a cut show, if you know what I mean.

1063
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:32,420
But there's also, we just, just last week, a new hour of slack started up in Boston at the radio station with the MIT campus.

1064
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:39,620
They're praising Bob, Dr. Bleepo Abernathy, and Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger of the Church of Mr. Science.

1065
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:39,880
Praise Bob.

1066
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,100
Some of you out there are lucky enough to be in correspondence.

1067
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,380
Correspondence with these individuals.

1068
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,860
And we'll be playing some of their variation.

1069
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,700
It's different.

1070
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,560
It's a Yankee kind of thing.

1071
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,640
But up in Boston, you know, they're a wild bunch.

1072
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,020
There's some subgeni up there.

1073
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:55,760
Feisty.

1074
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,480
They're dangerous up there, doctor.

1075
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,720
They have to be because the audience is in Boston.

1076
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:06,400
I have stood in front of, it was like the Alamo friends, that time at the Spit Club, DeVival in Boston.

1077
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,840
You know, we do, we travel around and do DeVivals in other towns, not Dallas.

1078
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,660
Dallas, apparently.

1079
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,160
And the club isn't ready for, they want to call us a comedy act.

1080
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:16,800
An act.

1081
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,500
A joke.

1082
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:17,860
An act.

1083
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,900
A joke, they said.

1084
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,300
Uh-huh.

1085
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:27,620
If that's an act, then those five people who left that club spit in Boston without any legs ought to get an Academy Award.

1086
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,260
Yes, friends.

1087
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,640
Copyright 1996, Jane or Hyper-V.

1088
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,860
And friends, I want you to think about Bob.

1089
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,620
Let's go to some, I haven't played this version of one of Buck's songs in a long time.

1090
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,740
Well, as Pastor Naked cannot be with us tonight.

1091
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,760
Oh, I think it's only proper that we-

1092
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,040
That we not play his version.

1093
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,060
That we not play his version.

1094
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,300
But, uh, Onan's and Here Somewhere In Here.

1095
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,340
Aw, yes.

1096
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,140
Aw, yes, friends.

1097
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,100
Somewhere In Here.

1098
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,240
The tapes are running backwards.

1099
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:56,920
Yes.

1100
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,260
Yes.

1101
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,560
Yes.

1102
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:01,940
Yes.

1103
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,180
Yes.

1104
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1105
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1106
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1107
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1108
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1109
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1110
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1111
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1112
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1113
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1114
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1115
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1116
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1117
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,180


1118
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,660
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1119
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,960
Is he waiting there for me?

1120
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,100
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1121
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,240
What could be waiting there for me?

1122
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,880
What could stop the aliens from killing me?

1123
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,780
What could stop the aliens from killing me?

1124
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,820
Bob can't help me, but will he?

1125
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,680
Will he help me?

1126
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,700
Bob's my inner guide and he's leading my body.

1127
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,260
He's even nice to my pets.

1128
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,480
Bob's that little voice and he's not just a dream now.

1129
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,260
The mightiest guru yet.

1130
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,660
It is the time is a day.

1131
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:12,660


1132
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,340
Bob's got an engine.

1133
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,600
If you don't go fast it won't let me go fast.

1134
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,600
Easy.

1135
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,000
I won't listen too.

1136
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,000


1137
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,800
All right.

1138
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,000
Good luck.

1139
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,680
We'll find you.

1140
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:30,080
When will I have to pay a fee?

1141
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:52,660
It's the Pipeetune ofizz perimeter

1142
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,420
I think they're waiting for me.

1143
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,800
Waiting for me.

1144
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,460
Lady, someone.

1145
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,300
Huh.

1146
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,200
Help me, somebody.

1147
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,820
That was Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

1148
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,580
Yes, indeed.

1149
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,700
He's the youngest doctor out there from Knoxville, Tennessee.

1150
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,060
And a true crib fisherman, too, Dr.

1151
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,900
Yeah, he's a crib fisherman.

1152
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,960
He'd be fishing out of some cribs, I tell you, Bob.

1153
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,280
Looking for some prairies.

1154
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,500
Yeah, he'd be a squid fisherman.

1155
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,480
Well, they do have prairie squid in Tennessee

1156
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,700
because there is sufficient prairie there, or at least open lake.

1157
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,140
Well, they have those gulch squids, they call them.

1158
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,100
Yeah, they got some of that delta squid down around New Orleans,

1159
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,660
but I don't know about that delta squid.

1160
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,680
It kind of tastes muddy.

1161
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,420
That's my favorite kind, boy.

1162
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,560
You like it with red beans and rice?

1163
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,520
Yeah, after you use them, I'll only eat them after they've been used.

1164
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,600
Well, they aren't even good.

1165
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:49,780
That's right.

1166
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,580
They're tough.

1167
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,000
They're tough.

1168
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,000


1169
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,260
You got to eat them.

1170
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:51,260


1171
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,320
You got to soften them up a bit.

1172
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,540
You got to tenderize them a little, as the doctor would say.

1173
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,320
Ah, yes.

1174
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,200
Ah, yes.

1175
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,160
And fine squid.

1176
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,860
So I'll tell you.

1177
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,080
Oh, this little famous piece of music is also by Dr. Onan.

1178
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,580
I believe that's part of the Hour of Slack introduction at times, is it not?

1179
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,780
Yeah, yeah, right.

1180
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,560
He's got a new one on the way, a new digital Bob song.

1181
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,680
See, everything's digital here.

1182
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,620
We're not live.

1183
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,360
That's why we can't take any calls.

1184
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,420
This show has been entirely on.

1185
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,720
Basically, you have to use the digits of your right or left hand to operate anything.

1186
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,940
Anything on this show.

1187
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,420
That includes move the turntable around with your fingertips.

1188
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,800
But we don't use turntables.

1189
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,580
We only use broken tape decks here on the Hour of Slack.

1190
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,920
That's sweeter sound.

1191
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,680
And friends, praise Bob.

1192
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,220
Praise Bob.

1193
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,700
A tape deck can be smashed to pieces.

1194
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,640
But if it's needed for the Hour of Slack, it will.

1195
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:34,680


1196
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,220
And best to have a frock zip you lobster.

1197
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,260
Ah, yes.

1198
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,620
Let's step into a quick moment from a subgenius revival.

1199
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,140
This was the last one in L.A.

1200
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,560
You were there as security, running security.

1201
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,640
And Bob got shot again anyway.

1202
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,640
Oh, yes.

1203
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:49,820
Yes.

1204
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,700
But this time it was one of those dispensable Bobs.

1205
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,360
Yes.

1206
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,440
He was afraid to go out there.

1207
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:56,860
He knew.

1208
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,600
The guy that wore the Bob mask in L.A.

1209
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,420
And it was a Bob mask.

1210
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,240
I mean, Bob, the real Bob, wouldn't go in L.A. at the Alexandria Hotel.

1211
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,440
He certainly wouldn't be seen at the Alexandria Hotel.

1212
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,360
That's for sure.

1213
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,260
In fact, I didn't even want to be seen at the Alexandria.

1214
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,320
In fact, nobody wanted to.

1215
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,480
The only thing that was really seen was obscene.

1216
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,560
And that was that obscene big dead rat that was in the Pope of New York's breakfast.

1217
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,240
And he was sitting at the office table or something like that.

1218
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:21,800
I forget it.

1219
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,620
That's the way popes are treated in L.A., friends.

1220
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,600
That last year.

1221
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,480
Last year.

1222
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,560
Oh, speaking of popes in L.A., doctor, before you play that, I think we ought to.

1223
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:38,180
Most people don't know that the pope of all Arkansas, who's on temporary combat duty in Los Angeles, reaffirmed his nuptials.

1224
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,460
Yes, he did.

1225
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,480
He did.

1226
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,720
And he did it the subgenius way, too.

1227
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,040
He got it wasn't he had already gotten a short duration marriage.

1228
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:46,820
That's right.

1229
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,040
I mean, he already had the paperwork.

1230
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,400
He already had the paperwork.

1231
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,400
He did have the paperwork.

1232
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,660
He would have sanctified couplings, friends, for the last few years.

1233
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,560
But their short duration marriage ran out.

1234
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:03,940
And rather than send Buck any more money, they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel, as Norm just told me they're called, a parlor chapel wedding.

1235
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,620
Marriage parlor.

1236
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,620
And when he left the chapel, this acolyte came running.

1237
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,000
You know, it was one of those ten-minute ceremonies.

1238
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:17,560
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going, sir, there's supposed to be a $25 tip, quote, tip, unquote.

1239
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,220
Tip.

1240
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,540
And to which Pope Sternow.

1241
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,120
And to which Pope Sternow threw down a dollar and said, sir, kill me.

1242
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:23,820
That's right.

1243
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,960
But we should say congratulations to Pope Sternow and his faithful uber matrix, that is to say, Miss Dottie.

1244
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,400
That's right.

1245
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,160
And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

1246
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:33,540
Yes, sir.

1247
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,540
They are further contaminating.

1248
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,520
The little tiny Arken-Sanian yeti babies.

1249
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,240
The gene pool.

1250
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:47,360
Sternow's father, the way he became a subgenius was his father was one of the guys who had to stand on the Nevada desert and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away.

1251
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:47,780
That's right.

1252
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,080
Wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

1253
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,200
Duck and cover, baby.

1254
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:53,960
You betcha.

1255
00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:05,640
But they weren't allowed to in those days, and the result is thousands of subgenius children of those selfless servicemen who gave their genetic structure for nuclear dominance.

1256
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,380
There you go.

1257
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:16,900
And rather than, I was about to play that Hal song from the L.A. Devival, but I think instead we will, Dr. Dool, dare to play this live report from L.A.

1258
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,080
Sternow, we're calling to you now.

1259
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:27,340
This is Dr. Sternow Docks and Dr. Byron Verner of Famous Potatoes organization in Los Angeles.

1260
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,700
Can you hear us, Sternow?

1261
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:29,820
Sternow?

1262
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,640
And, uh...

1263
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,220
Yep, that's them.

1264
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,760
I'm having trouble, I don't think they can hear us.

1265
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,160
Sunset Boulevard is very second.

1266
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,360
At this moment, using, uh, a peculiarly...

1267
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,780
Uh, evolved...

1268
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:46,880
Uh, evolved...

1269
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Set of ocular...

1270
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,800
Uh, evolved...

1271
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,060
Set of ocular...

1272
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,320
Sensory mechanisms...

1273
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,140
Sensory mechanisms...

1274
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,000
Attached to the, uh, sensory...

1275
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,680
Uh, evolved...

1276
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:54,940
Sensory mechanisms...

1277
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:03,520
Accumulative mass of tissue located in the, uh, upper meridian of our particularly alien life.

1278
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,660
I don't really...

1279
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,100
Uh, uh...

1280
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:16,500
And there seems to be a woman crossing the street with a skirt which is, uh, much, much out of the limits of...

1281
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:16,860
Much, much out of the limits of...

1282
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:28,080
Much, much out of the limits of...

1283
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,980
Much, much out of the limits of...

1284
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:28,980


1285
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:28,980


1286
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,060
Much, much out of the limits of...

1287
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,120
Uh, uh, the spiritual powers that....

1288
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,440
Just done.

1289
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:32,440


1290
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:32,440


1291
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:32,440


1292
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,240
It's really elaborate, but let's be honest.

1293
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,300
I think it's...

1294
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,540
It's really elaborate, but let's be honest.

1295
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:36,780
I think it's...

1296
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,200
I think a button...

1297
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:37,200


1298
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:37,200


1299
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,140
That's me, guys...

1300
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,140


1301
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,060
Say hi to Katie.

1302
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,100
Look, the bell, Woody...

1303
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,500
Not me.

1304
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:42,840


1305
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
T anywhere, buddy.

1306
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:43,840


1307
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:43,840


1308
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,860
There's a, uh...

1309
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:46,640
Yeah.

1310
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,680
drinks. You can actually get prairie squid drinks.

1311
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,460
Yeah, they put them in a blender. They put them in a blender

1312
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,420
with protein powder and just

1313
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,640
turn them into a really

1314
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,080
thick, it's kind of like a daiquiri

1315
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,720
in texture.

1316
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,620
But it's not the real prairie

1317
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,280
squid, though. It's the flash frozen stuff.

1318
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,700
I mean, nobody does it with a live prairie

1319
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,100
squid. Praise Bob.

1320
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:07,900
Praise Bob.

1321
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,660
Well, dear friends,

1322
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,640
it's time for a moment of

1323
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,940
serenity and melody.

1324
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,140
Yes, if you'll turn to page

1325
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,140
five in your program,

1326
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,460
I'm going to lead you in the hymn

1327
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,000
which we call Bob is My

1328
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,380
Story.

1329
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,240
This is a hymn

1330
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,620
which is usually performed in

1331
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,400
moments of extreme stress

1332
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,840
and such, I judge this to be.

1333
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,360
It's very easy.

1334
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,980
And you can support me on the second verse and the

1335
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,440
chorus if you choose.

1336
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,940
So we'll sing Bob is My Story.

1337
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,740
Page five.

1338
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,960
I saw a man

1339
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,880
with a pipe and a grin

1340
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,000
all in the new morning light

1341
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,740
smiling at me

1342
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,080
like a madman

1343
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,680
till he

1344
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,720
made me

1345
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:02,760
uptight

1346
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,080
I told him don't bother

1347
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,180
me anymore

1348
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,520
but he kept on just the same

1349
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,420
till I was

1350
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,840
totally brainwashed

1351
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,620
but I was totally brainwashed

1352
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,500
Bob is his name

1353
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:18,720
this is the chorus

1354
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,680
he is my story

1355
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,180
Bob

1356
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,180
is my song

1357
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,100
Bob

1358
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,120
my amphetamines

1359
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,300
all

1360
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,300
the day long

1361
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,580
I won't tear

1362
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,140
my poster of dogs

1363
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,080
down

1364
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,860
I'll feel no sadness or shame

1365
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,880
till I rejoin

1366
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,680
him in dogs

1367
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,600
down

1368
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,520
Bob is his name

1369
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,920
he has no lack of his patented slack

1370
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,780
for those of his following fold

1371
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,380
he is the friend of whoever will send

1372
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,360
green back your gold

1373
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,080
he's growing stronger and stronger

1374
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,860
but he keeps redder than flame

1375
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,860
I'll be a pig boy no longer

1376
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,600
I'll be a pig boy no longer

1377
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:15,600


1378
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,540
Bob is his name

1379
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,500
Bob is my story

1380
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,900
Bob is his is your story friend

1381
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,200
and Bob is your fame

1382
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,340
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do

1383
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,900
keep your squid juices pumping

1384
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:36,400
Bob

1385
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,540
by the old digital counter on the wall Reverend Stang

1386
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,860
yes we're coming down we got three minutes left

1387
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,740
three minutes of slack time friends

1388
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,540
and I could play some burbling background noise

1389
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,280
or I could play the official sign off tunes and so forth

1390
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,180
but we could just talk for another three minutes

1391
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,160

1392
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:54,900

1393
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,300
we could talk for another three hours

1394
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,100
or three days if that's what it takes

1395
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,040
to get you to write to that sacred post office box

1396

01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,160
and learned we are in the dark knowledge

1400
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,080
and forbidden sciences of time control

1401
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,640
and slack extraction

1402
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,280
