1
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:41,000
I love you.

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,900
Genuine.

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,240
Beautiful.

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Giant.

5
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,680
Perfect.

6
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,380
Cool.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,940
Special.

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,500
Cheered.

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,180
Labyrinth.

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,440
Easy.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,940
Ultimate.

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,400
Best.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,780
Natural.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,300
Growing.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,820
Special.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,540
Nice.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,880
Proud.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,360
Quicker.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,460
And much more.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,560
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,280
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,720
No, I'm going to compress it.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,620
All into just this one intensive total rerun show.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,820
Except that actually it's not.

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:47,400
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,780
and holy days and the hole in head days, as it is for some people.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,180
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.

28
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,480
Yes.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,820
Oh.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,620
You wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,440
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,440
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmas, a guitar axmas.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,560
It's cool, man.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:27,880
Cool.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,340
Cool.

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,480
And.

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,620
And.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,420
Praise Bob and who.

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,180
The whole, uh.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,840
Oh.

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,080
Oh.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:35,700


45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,280


46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh.

47
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:37,560
Oh.

48
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,640
Oh.

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,100


50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,580
Oh.

51
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,420


52
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,420


53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:43,800


54
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,400
Oh.

55
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,140
Oh.

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,440
Oh.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,800
Oh.

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:47,860
Oh.

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,340


60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,380
Oh.

61
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,380


62
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,380


63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,380


64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,380


65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,380


66
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,540
Oh.

67
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,100


68
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,100


69
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,400
Oh.

70
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,940
Oh.

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,800
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,100
Will you stop it?

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,620
Woo!

75
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,460
When this angel heard

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
Chop-a-pa-pop, chop-a-pa-pop

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,380
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine-tree needles sting me

79
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,380
Ram-ba-jam-ba, ram-ba-jam-ba, ram-ba-ding-dong

80
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,700
You'll never know how much that smarts

81
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,820
So who put the stomp in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

82
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,500
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,440
Who stood the wood where I poopsie-poopsie-poop

84
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,220
Who put the stick up my hip-ty-dip-ty-dip

85
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,960
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

86
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,460
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
I might squeeze

88
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,400
Slip of this

89
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,080
Too tight

90
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,700
It's that psychedelic time of the year

91
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,520
Do you know where your brain cells are?

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

93
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,740
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid them

94
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,760
Don't go walking down to the bar

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,660
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,920
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits

97
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,740
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

98
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,280
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,320
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

100
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,020
Till I get the damn chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,440
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,460
Apple mango pie

103
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,600
Ain't no good of a child

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,580
That dog's running off with them brain cells

105
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
Can you do something about that, boy?

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,580
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

107
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm gonna have to

108
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm gonna have to

109
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


111
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,780
I'm gonna have to

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm gonna have to

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm gonna have to

117
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,360
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

118
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,300
Ah

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,100
Merry Christmas!

120
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,740
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun

121
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,860
The faith of a child

122
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you got

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,940
Spend all the money you got

124
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,680
The Christmas trough

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

126
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,740
Oh, look, Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
Oh, he's like a cowboy Santa.

128
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,540
How jolly.

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,300
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pill.

130
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,180
Boy, I really need one of those.

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,160
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit, though?

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,420
I need the show bath.

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,580
The show de-lousing.

134
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones.

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,320
That's enough of that.

136
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:52,800
Oh, he's got headphones.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,420
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,720
It's been increased in size to...

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,440
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

140
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,500
Look, it's swelling.

141
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,600
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,080
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

143
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,100
Oh, those pills.

144
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,760
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

145
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,160
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied...

146
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,160


147
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,460
I'm shocked by the...

148
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,340
The red pills are really good.

150
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,800
I like to take the red one and the blue one.

151
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,260
Yes, the red one and the blue one.

152
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,600
At the same time.

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,720
That way you go in and out.

154
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,520
The warp mix is easy.

155
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,900
It's so high, you can't go over it.

156
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,240
Angels we have heard on high

157
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,920
Singing about mountains high

158
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,560
And those mountains in reply

159
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,780
Sing about mountains high

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,440
Lord, there are mountains far away

161
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,440


162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,360
And that we wish we had something to

163
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,800
iksi

164
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Lobby

165
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,120
The Need for vlog

166
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,040
Network

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,560
Wi-Fi

168
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,480
Music

169
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,980
chunk

170
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,780
PLEASE

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
Barbie dogs.

172
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with bars.

173
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,520
Barbie dogs.

174
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,240
Barbie dogs.

175
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:53,160
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

176
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,940
It will empower us to resist them.

177
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,780
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

178
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,280
It will be a bomb for kids.

179
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:22,800
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

180
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,280
Good has lots of muscles.

181
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,560
Good.

182
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Good!

183
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,420
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,160
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.

185
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,080
Sexual.

186
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,300
Desires.

187
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Latent in children.

188
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,780
Brought out.

189
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,740
Through the vehicle of this so-called farmer cult exploits at church.

190
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,080
Batteries not included.

191
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,420
She's new.

192
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,500
From Kenner.

193
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,660
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

194
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,720
We must buy our toys.

195
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,560
Yes.

196
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,080
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

197
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,980
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

198
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,280
Mean Palmer VDs.

199
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,540
Angels we have heard on high.

200
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,780
It was by the Philistines.

201
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,260
The collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album.

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
Which you can get for free.

203
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,620
Get this.

204
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,740

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,040
Obtuse.

206

I-U-M-A.

207
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,200
Dot.

208
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,380
Com.

209
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,600
That's Obtuse.

210
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,520
Excuse me.

211
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,740
Ah, yes.

212
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,400
And next up.

213
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,420
The real story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

214
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,780
The real story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

215
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,480
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

216
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,980
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

217
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,160
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

218
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,800
And he wanted his two front teeth.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,900
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

220
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,360
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

221
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,840
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

222
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,660
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

223
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,380
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

224
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't.

225
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,380
He wanted tens and twenties.

226
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,920
Tens and twenties.

227
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,560
Tens and twenties.

228
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


230
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


231
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


232
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


234
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,160
And he wanted to play the drums.

235
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,160


236
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,160


237
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,560
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

238
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,320
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

239
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,900
And that's the real story of Christmas.

240
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,120
Take the holes in the miles of holly.

241
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Tears of the season to be jolly.

242
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Don't we know I'll get a barrel

243
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,540
Roll the engine, you tight-chest

244
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,880
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

245
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,400
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

246
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:33,100
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

247
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,260
He wanted an electric train.

248
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,420
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where he was going to set it up.

249
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,980
He could picture the whole thing, and he would dream so hard

250
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,080
that the whole thing would come true.

251
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,600
It would come to life right before his eyes.

252
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

253
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,740
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set

254
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,420
with locomotives and freight cars.

255
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
And a station.

256
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,560
And the caveman.

257
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,020
The water tower.

258
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
And all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

259
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,360
So rad that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

260
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,700
The End

261
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,060
The End

262
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,660
The End

263
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


264
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


265
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


266
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


267
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


268
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


269
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


270
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


271
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,660


272
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
sujetu

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,120

274
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,240
Gigant sentiments

haha

276
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:25,620

284
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,360
little confused about what Christmas is all about are we celebrating the birth of Santa

285
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
Claus or his death when they nailed him well that that's the ancient agents of

286
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,200
GD but the presence of Jeannie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared

287
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,040

288
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,220
day

289
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,560
season and it was something else in between there but but before it was after it was a pagan holiday

290
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,280
and before it was a shopping season it was something else but I think they started a war over

291
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,700
foreign

292
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,280
foreign

293
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,780
I don't like some color, I don't see the world at all

294
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,880
Yeah, I'm so much good, I'm not nice at all

295
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,400
Oh, oh, glory, oh, oh, Santa had extra sense

296
00:16:34,080 --> 00:17:01,220
Oh, oh, glory, oh, oh, Santa had extra sense

297
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, oh, glory, oh, oh, Santa had extra sense

298
00:17:31,240 --> 00:18:01,100
Oh, oh, glory, oh, Santa had extra sense

299
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,980
Santa's nose driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errand

300
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,680
And he may show up at your house, my friend

301
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,780
If you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius

302
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,080
Or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows

303
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,340
And having strange microphones

304
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,260
How did that paternity suit ever turn out between Dobbs and Santa?

305
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,400
And who?

306
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,460
His dad

307
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,580
Santa Dog

308
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,220
I don't know

309
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,380
I don't know

310
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,980
And I don't think it was a simple result

311
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,180
Yes, but Saint Nicholas, this is fact

312
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,280
Saint Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose and bloodied his nose

313
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,960
And sucked him

314
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,620
Really? The historical Saint Nicholas?

315
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,620
Over the Trinity of God

316
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,660
The original Saint Nicholas in Turkey?

317
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,780
I swear upon Bob and the Holy Spirit

318
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,760
Who the hell is God?

319
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,360
The Holy Spirit is from our part of the country

320
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
I can tell you shit, God

321
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
Who the hell is God?

322
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,780
God!

323
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,160
Who the hell is God?

324
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,140
Ask Dobbs one day

325
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,100
That's the question we should be asking more

326
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,760
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day

327
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,600
Bob did a backflip and from that day on, he too was a believer

328
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,040
And from the snowdrift and snow

329
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,640
A little child bearing flowers emerged

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,040
And Chip, Chip, what else was on the table?

331
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,080
Each one a dirty flower

332
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,020
Saint Nicholas

333
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,400
Sip, sicken

334
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,020
The historical Santa Claus is, uh...

335
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,880
Originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in, uh...

336
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,280
Was it, was it Constantinople?

337
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,260
Yeah, like one of those...

338
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,480
It was in ancient Byzantium

339
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,000
Asia Minor in general, yeah

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,360
Yes, he was, and he was, uh...

341
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
He was known for...

342
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,560
Sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving...

343
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,960
Gifts

344
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,520
Light-sized lumps of coal

345
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,120
Complete with a fake beard and a CIA wallet

346
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,020
And a Wall Street credit card

347
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,440
A saint he was, the girl said

348
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
Saint Nicholas invented the CIA

349
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,880
That's good, that's...

350
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,760
You got it, brother

351
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,720
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney

352
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,840
You got it, brother

353
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,360
They knew when they were sleeping

354
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
They knew when...

355
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,320
He knew when they were awake

356
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:15,940
That...

357
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,080
You got it, brother

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,600
But like the CIA, he was...

359
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,280
That's Foucault, baby

360
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,220
He was protecting them

361
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,700
Foucault knew that Saint Nick was a creepin', stinkin' spy

362
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,200
What?

363
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,720
He knows when you've been sleeping

364
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,360
He knows what you've been eating

365
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,220
Hey, man, my kids still believe in Saint Nicholas

366
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,200
And who cares?

367
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
He keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain

368
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Madison Avenue, of course

369
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
No, the surveillance community

370
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,900
And Disney

371
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,940
Under your direction

372
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,780
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company

373
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,760
Miller Bear, you know

374
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:43,980
He's a very powerful being

375
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,640
If you're bad, he punishes you

376
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,380
If you're good, he rewards you

377
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,360
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus

378
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,940
Walking the earth

379
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,800
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is

380
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,880
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling

381
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,520
When they're awake

382
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,380
I think, I think really if you want to make a deal

383
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,280
You have to do it with, you know

384
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,100
Could Dr....

385
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,400
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman

386
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,980
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

387
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,660
Well, we find it a very likely possibility

388
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,480
From the falsified documents we have here

389
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,220
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet

390
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,940
You better watch out

391
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,440
You better not

392
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,140
You better not tell them

393
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,560
Tell them you watch

394
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,080
Tell them you watch

395
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,720
What are you doing there

396
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:33,720


397
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,120
Theorist

398
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,280
Spect clinician

399
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,840
Men who live in deux

400
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,380
Make of the following

401
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,640
James Bond

402
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,060
The Doctor

403
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,800
Joaquin C.

404
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,060
What are you doing there

405
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,120
Theậy

00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


409
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


410
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,160
Now this coming, take care.

411
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,160
Here is the thing.

412
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,060
He knows when you're away.

413
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,980
He knows when you're in bad or good.

414
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,800
Don't be goodness, goodness sake.

415
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,640
Oh, you better watch out.

416
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,400
You better not cry.

417
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,360
You better not care.

418
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,960
And I'm telling you what Santa Claus is telling you to tell.

419
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,960
Do you think I'm psycho, Mama?

420
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,600
I've seen my ex last night.

421
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

422
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
We all saw X-Mas last night.

423
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,020
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in Stank's head.

424
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,800
It would not leave for the little sugar plums and berries dropping.

425
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,260
Touch.

426
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,040
Ex-exclusion.

427
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,500
All those little sugar plums.

428
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,740
All those sweet and that plums.

429
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,220
The poison in the plums.

430
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,100
Material plums.

431
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,540
Biological agents who only take 15%?

432
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,560
It came with our plastic boxes of bags.

433
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,740
And one thing showed up hurt little baby.

434
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Wait.

435
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,200


436
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,420
And a second time.

437
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,600
Everything there was right.

438
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,560
With a half guitar in there mucha terror.

439
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:35,560

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,660
Admit you.

448
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:37,660

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,380
Great doggie.

450

Oh, it's a great day, all right.

452
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,740
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. American.

453
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,800
Shop as usual.

454
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Shop as usual.

455
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,400
Shop as usual.

456
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,680
And avoid panic buying.

457
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,860
It's two days old Christmas.

458
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,180
There's a million things to do.

459
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,760
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due.

460
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,860
Where are my relatives?

461
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,460
Why haven't they showed up?

462
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,800
I bet they're at the airport.

463
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,360
I forgot to pick them up.

464
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,340
Christmas, it's almost here.

465
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,620
Christmas, it's almost here.

466
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,940
Christmas, it's almost here.

467
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,580
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull.

468
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,380
Santa Claus is real.

469
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,280
You can hear the calls,

470
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,660
Santa Claus is real.

471
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,980
Santa Claus is real.

472
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,340
Santa Claus is real.

473
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,780
You can hear the claws,

474
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,220
Santa Claus.

475
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,160
Who's the head man?

476
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,560
Santa Claus.

477
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,500
Santa Claus.

478
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,380
He was a huge, beastly,

479
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,060
bulging man.

480
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,060
He was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

481
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,940
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan.

482
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,180
On July 4th.

483
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,180

Including that announcer.

490

This announcement has not been a perfunctory

491
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,780
announcement, but an announcement

492
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,780

More from Corporal Blossom.

592
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,060
I am really,

593
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,480
really impressed

594
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
by their editing work.

595
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,200
And that's on

596
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,480
Corporal Blossom

597
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,520

603
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,420
And now,

604
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,260
more Jethro's.

605
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:07,920
Huh.

606
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:08,980
Huh.

607
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Hi.

608
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,080
Hi.

609
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Hi.

610
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Hi.

611
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Hi.

612
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,460
Hi.

613
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Hi.

614
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,920
Hi.

615
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,400
Hi.

616
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Hi.

617
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Hi.

618
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,120


619
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,380
Hi.

620
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,380


621
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,600
Hi.

622
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,180
Hi.

623
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,260
Hi.

624
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,080
Hi.

625
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Hi.

626
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,040
Now you're blaming Jesus.

627
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,180
You're blaming our Lord.

628
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,500
I sort of understand because...

629
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,860
I understood the way any old fool would understand.

630
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,040
There was no Jesus.

631
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,220
No flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

632
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,400
It's not that you don't want to.

633
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,820
It's that they won't let you.

634
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,940
No, they're ashamed.

635
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,700
Just a crime of wilderness.

636
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,600
They're ashamed.

637
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,080
And the hot pursuit of wolves everywhere in the background.

638
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm ashamed of them.

639
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,900
It's cold.

640
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,980
I'm leaving that city life behind and radio people crazy.

641
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,140
I can't get my noodle back in the pan, Jan.

642
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,240
Come on, cowboy.

643
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,520
No, man.

644
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,160
I was trying.

645
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,700
I was trying to get against this here tree, and it started whispering to me, man.

646
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh, you've been drinking.

647
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,340
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

648
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,800
There's the face of Virgin Mary.

649
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,880
I swear to God, look at it.

650
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,960
Isn't it?

651
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,260
What?

652
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,360
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

653
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:55,900
Wow.

654
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,960
A Christmas witch?

655
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,980
I'll be whole.

656
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh, my God.

657
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,380
Yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more witchy than angelic.

658
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,400
I know she must be a true witch.

659
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,580
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing out of you for real.

660
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,960
She's running by hovering Christmas ornaments.

661
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,140
Looks like a radar device.

662
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,640
What?

663
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,820
Yo.

664
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,920
Yo?

665
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,340
It's her.

666
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,200
What up?

667
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,100
Nothing.

668
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,100
What's up?

669
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,940
What a deep voice.

670
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,860
First Christmas.

671
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,640
Witch.

672
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,140
Witch.

673
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,700
Witch.

674
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,320
Witch.

675
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,140
Witch.

676
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,920
Witch.

677
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:51,980
Witch.

678
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,400
Witch.

679
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:53,840


680
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,180
Witch.

681
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,200
Witch.

682
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,480
Witch.

683
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,040
Thank you.

684
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,560
Bye.

685
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,440
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

686
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,860
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

687
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,840
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

688
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,440
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

689
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,440
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece and the health department made us take them down.

690
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,340
I remember my father well, you know.

691
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,160
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

692
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,360
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?

693
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,400
He used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.

694
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,880
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.

695
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,820
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

696
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,040
I said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.

697
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,180
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside

698
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,020
and told us.

699
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,300
Biggest lie ever heard.

700
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,360
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

701
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,320
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

702
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,220
They even come to questioning now.

703
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,160
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

704
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,520
Oh my God, dang, come on.

705
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,700
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister, created the conspiracy?

706
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,620
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?

707
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,760
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas?

708
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,100
Yes.

709
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,960
There were pilgrims for baby.

710
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,800
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

711
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,640
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

712
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,680
It was a...

713
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:10,480
When your little brother broke through the hole, it fell through a hole in the ice, and you went and saved him.

714
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:10,900
You didn't...

715
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,280
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

716
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,560
It was a wonderful life back then.

717
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,240
And we pulled some eggs, little jokes about him waking up, and then we'd put candles.

718
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,920
Like most people have.

719
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,020
He would have that smile on his face and a big red nose.

720
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,120
But today, Christmas is lost, it's me.

721
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,300
He just beat the crap out of Santa Claus.

722
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,280
Scott, you made your choice.

723
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,740
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

724
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,140
I did.

725
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


726
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


727
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


728
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


729
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


730
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


731
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


732
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


733
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


734
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


735
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


736
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


737
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


738
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


739
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


740
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


741
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


742
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


743
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


744
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


745
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,340
To your eternal soul.

746
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,680
You have found that I only could you afford to give to God that which was his,

747
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,720
but you could not afford to do otherwise.

748
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,960
The Senate still stands.

749
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,320
And throughout are darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

750
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,640
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

751
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,860
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

752
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,120
Sir, no!

753
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:09,960
No!

754
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,360
No!

755
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,180
I don't want to go to hell!

756
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:14,460
No!

757
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,800
The tailbearer will be at the judgment.

758
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,160
To be continued...

759
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,160

785
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,060
I got you.

786
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,440
Thin rye.

787
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:12,960
Jesus.

788
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,160
Elrond.

789
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,200
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

790
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,200
Oh, it tastes like butter.

791
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:19,940
A new Jesus.

792
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,120
A different Jesus.

793
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,400
It tastes like crappy pie, children.

794
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,380
A pipe-smoking Jesus.

795
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,780
Dave, you know where it is.

796
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,220
Go kick that window open.

797
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,440
I already kicked it.

798
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,520
I'll kick it again, though.

799
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,020
Kick it good this time.

800
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,280
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

801
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,080
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

802
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,080
We appreciate all that.

803
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,000
We're just trying to insult your fan club.

804
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,520
That's all.

805
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,740
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

806
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,720
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

807
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,200
Right.

808
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,460
I could hear him say that.

809
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,100
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

810
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,020
Next topic.

811
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,200
Next topic.

812
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,820
Terry.

813
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,980
The devil and the atheists.

814
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,440
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

815
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,460
And science.

816
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,180
That's the life of Brian, isn't it?

817
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,600
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

818
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,940
Listen to the sounds of hell.

819
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,180
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

820
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,300
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

821
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,780
Wrapped in wrapping paper.

822
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,000
We're gonna break.

823
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,220
Break our necks.

824
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,820
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

825
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,380
Sleigh ride to heck.

826
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,200
Sleigh ride to heck.

827
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,940
Sleigh ride to heck.

828
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,240
The elves are full of cheer.

829
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,740
The kids are tucked in bed.

830
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,480
What?

831
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,280
Santa ain't coming.

832
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,640
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

833
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,200
Their dreams are filled with toys.

834
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,780
But they're out of luck.

835
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,560
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to fuck.

836
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,340
Sleigh ride to heck.

837
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,920
Sleigh ride to heck.

838
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,000
Sleigh ride to heck.

839
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,600
Sleigh ride to heck.

840
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,880
Sleigh ride to heck.

841
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:40,880


842
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:47,000
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey,

843
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,340
James Kochalka, Superstar.

844
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:04,620
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

845
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,880
but he can also accept somebody stomping on a picture.

846
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,320
He'll do it himself.

847
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,740
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

848
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,420
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

849
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,080
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

850
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,840
but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy.

851
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:29,060
It's holy compared to the evil of so many, not all, by any means,

852
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,020
but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general, of course.

853
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,660
They and their corresponding.

854
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,040
They and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,

855
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,980
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

856
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,040
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

857
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,700
Jesus and Bob, like we say, are old drinking buddies.

858
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,040
Got nothing against Jesus.

859
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,940
It's just his fan club.

860
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,200
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

861
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,680
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

862
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,780
But the...

863
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Uptight rival cults.

864
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,680
They don't think God has a handkerchief.

865
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,300
Uh-uh, no.

866
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,840
Because God's perfect.

867
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,600
He doesn't even sneeze.

868
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:18,600
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

869
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,220
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.

870
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,720
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

871
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,580
Oh, and he's male.

872
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,260
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

873
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,060
Because we sin.

874
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,740
Oh, yeah.

875
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,460
We all sin.

876
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,440
We're bad.

877
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,260
We're worthless.

878
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:43,140
We're no good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent.

879
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,260
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

880
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:47,960
We turn.

881
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,920
Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

882
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,500
Thank you.

883
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,300
Thank you.

884
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:55,940


885
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,820
Thank you.

886
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,640
Thank you.

887
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:58,720


888
00:50:59,660 --> 00:50:59,660


889
00:50:59,780 --> 00:50:59,900
Thank you.

890
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,640
Thank you.

891
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,140
Thank you.

892
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:01,440
Thank you.

893
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:01,920


894
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:01,920


895
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,420
Thank you.

896
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,700
Thank you.

897
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,120
Thank you.

898
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,660
Thank you.

899
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,720
All your

900
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,120
thoughts

901
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,160
and

902
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,520
minds.

903
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,620
By Fernando Nande

904
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,240
Limor.

905
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,200
Oh, holy night

906
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,960
whose stars are brightly

907
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,200
shining.

908
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,500
It is the night of our

909
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,160
new, new, new birth.

910
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:41,400
Long lay, long lay the world in different pining

911
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,320
The pin and the stone mountains quenched

912
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,660
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices

913
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,720
Beyond the grave a new and glorious dawn

914
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,600
Fall on your knees

915
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,120
Oh hear the angel voices

916
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh night divine

917
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,180
Oh night when Christ was born

918
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:19,320
Oh night, oh night divine

919
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,880
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice

920
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,440
Mithras won his fight

921
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,960
Oh night

922
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,040
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

923
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,460
Come one, come all

924
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,640
It's He-Bob, hey kids, you can help the mighty Satinus Rice overthrow the evil normals

925
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,940
With new Bob-Dots, actually bigger with rocket fire

926
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,340
What I wouldn't do from Bob-Dots

927
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,760
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you, no?

928
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,420
Buy my chocolate, Space Cadet

929
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,760
Life support system down to zero cocoa

930
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,060
Feeling spacey

931
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,340
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles

932
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,080
Now so chocolatey

933
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,220
Mmm, smells cocoa-less

934
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,880
This cocoa-less

935
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,200
Blow

936
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,660
Roll of friends

937
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,960
What do you think?

938
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,700
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus

939
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,260
That we're trying to celebrate here

940
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,320
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob

941
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,640
The Santai Bob

942
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,700
As he's been referred to

943
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,280
In some early pre-scriptures

944
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,340
Even wrapped in a tie

945
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:44,300
Yet what of those

946
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:44,540
Nemesis dolls

947
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,260
Are they relevant

948
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,120
Is it theasing

949
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,120
Or are you an

950
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,320
Imposter

951
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,220

The Jethro's, friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

959
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:12,360
They're at, they did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

It's all Christmassy right now.

972
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,680
There's a bright green bob in the window and Christmassy lights.

973
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,020
Is DJA out there?

974
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,820
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

975
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,880
No, that's something just left for DJA.

976
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,920
It's all Christmassy.

977
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:42,880
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present under the tree.

978
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,880
Smell that cinnamon.

979
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,580
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

980
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,500
And those sugar plums.

981
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,900
Something's up the chimney hole in sight and it's his name.

Yeah.

Otherwise, gosh.

985
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,420
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

986
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,040
Oh, beloved Santa.

987
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,460
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

988
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,500
He's always so ready to let him be dressed back for so long.

989
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,100
Pray Bob and Mary Xmas!

990
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:44,800
Don't I just sat down all next to him and started playing awhile full otherwise?

991
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,220
Well,ーノ

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.

1010
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:16,440
Don't despair, just because it's Christmas.

1011
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:24,640
The children there are so gay at Christmas

1012
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,780
All the children on the street

1013
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,600
Hope they get something good to eat

1014
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,740
But for me it's not so great

1015
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,640
