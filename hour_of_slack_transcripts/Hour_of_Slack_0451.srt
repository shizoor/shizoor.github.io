1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Q. I tired. Hungry. When is it time to sleep? How do I go to the bathroom room?

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:16,560
Smack. Smack boom bam. Put your trust in TV. TV. TV gives me seeds. Plant seeds.

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,620
Flowers grow grow grow. I don't have any rights. Right. I don't know my rights.

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,360
Give me flowers or I shall die. I shall die. Die die die.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:44,260
Mrs. Q enters the TV room. Billy, it's time for the subgenius hour of sweat.

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:53,000
Smack. Get up now. Let us put you to sleep.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,540
Billy.

8
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:02,640
He reluctantly detaches his consciousness from the television. As if in a dream he is led to his bed.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:14,200
He is soon asleep. A dreamless sleep. His memory cleared. Ready for a new day. Ready for anything.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,060
And now, an explanation of the anatomy of a bobby.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,660
One.

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,560
Subliminal jests, rants, hints, etc. enter Bobby's ear canal.

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,500
Two.

14
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,160
Sound carried along past via eardrum and ear bones.

15
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,340
Three.

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,180
Sound encoded into nerve impulse in cochlea.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,380
Four.

18
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,420
Impulse sent to subconscious mind.

19
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,900
Five.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,280
Five.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,640
Bobby's subconscious being less dense than his own.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:53,760
Three.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,760


24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:20,760
impulse in the vesicles through without affecting either the impulse or the subconscious six in pulse bouts off thought process is crashes and temporary memory started seven memory feels what's encoded just and kesindo overflow for death poor the motor

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,640
areas in the cerebral cortex that control it.

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,820
the jaw, tongue, lips, lungs, and vocal cords.

27
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,180
9.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,440
Bobby, unaware of meaning behind the messages, repeats jokes and rants word for word.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
10.

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,060
Now empty temporary memory storage sends signal of relief to pleasure centers.

31
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,620
11.

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:57,120
Pleasure centers instruct jaw, tongue, lips, lung, and vocal cords to issue stupid giggle and grin.

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,640
12.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Cycle starts over.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,540
And that was It the Tard and Sheldon DeWeer,

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,420
Reverend Sheldon DeWeer from his tape hangnail of the start.

37
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,780
13.

38
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:30,120
But my friends, already we hear the accusations of sellouts coming from the armchair subgeniuses out there,

39
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,480
subfundamentalists, whose only pathetic reality is virtual.

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,940
These three crayons short of a full Crayola set gimme bobs complain to each other with smug complacency.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
14.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,320
Is nothing profane anymore?

43
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,540
15.

44
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,120
And this show isn't as obtuse and obnoxious as I could have done.

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,740
16.

46
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,220
Listen up you bobbies there.

47
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,900
17.

48
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,840
The church of the subgenius is not some namby-pamby art club.

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,240
18.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:18,600
Not a reassuring politically correct in-out list to check your dopeness against as you huddle with a few other outcast dweebs in your face.

51
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,600


52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,740
19.

53
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:30,740
You're a bunch of idiots in college dorms and high schools wrapping yourselves tight in your poster of daubs and pointing your fingers outward yelling PINKS over and over at everything that isn't you.

54
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,480
20.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,780
Like some damaged disc segment crashing eternally against the system software.

56
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,140
21.

57
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,960
Oh boy, have we got news for you.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,620
Yes, you!

59
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,760
You pseudo-suede sub.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,440
Jargon spout no.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,720
22.

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,740
You're a wannabe elite slacker than thou snob poseurs masturbating to your own hidden hitness.

63
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,780
23.

64
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,980
Bob's holy crusade isn't some underground circle jerk or silly codified in-joke.

65
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,660
Merely repeating Bob's name will not make you cool.

66
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,380
24.

67
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:18,580
Hating this show won't do you a bit of good on that ghastly day when the exes arrive to tab the planet's solar system.

68
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


69
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


70
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


71
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


72
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


73
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


74
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,580


75
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,080
25.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,080


77
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,080


78
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,080


79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,640
and spend them like so much chump change.

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,460
27.

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,660
We tell you, preaching to the saved is for cowards and free will is a joke.

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,240
28.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,280
As if we'd give a flying hamster poot if you liked this show or not.

84
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,020
What do you think this is, communism?

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,060
29.

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,180
You who hate this show think you know the meaning of true hate?

87
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,680
30.

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,560
You who are still mired in non-convenientism.

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,560


90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,560


91
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,560


92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,560


93
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,760
31.

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,820
You who are still mired in conformist conformity.

95
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,260
32.

96
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,160
Unknowing slaves to anti-fashion fashion trends.

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,840
33.

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,920
You jealous followers with your oh-so-smug assumptions can't stand the thought of rich, successful, sexy weirdos, can ya?

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:03,620
34.

100
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,360
If no other mutant succeeded anything, then there's nothing for you to measure your own personal failure against.

101
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,640
35.

102
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,560
And you can stay safely fropped out.

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,040
36.

104
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,560
Asleep in your carefully hoarded piles of hermetic dung.

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,560


106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,560


107
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,560


108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,280
37.

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,780
You can't even see the

110
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:32,780


111
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,340
As for us, we'll never stop.

112
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,160
39.

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,380
Never!

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:39,940
40.

115
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,700
Until every living and living dead organism on the Earth bows down before Bob.

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:45,860
41.

117
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,540
Until every creature, great and small, dies.

118
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,720
42.

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,860
Until every creature reaches that most manifest level of mental drives, the totally consummating desire to kill Bob.

120
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,400
43.

121
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,440
And then comes out the other side knowing that nothing matters anymore.

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,260
44.

123
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:15,440
Because, my friend, as St. Palmer Freedies and I have said in this rant, Bob isn't the answer and neither is anything else.

124
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,540
45.

125
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,060
Did I keep you?

126
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


127
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


128
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


129
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


130
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,380
What's really going on here?

131
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:18,940
Him.

132
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:18,940


133
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,200
What's really going on here?

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,440
Are we talking about the death of the Big Machine?

135
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,820
One of theassesMy

136
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,820


137
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,120
What does it all really mean?

138
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,880
47.

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,200
Are we talking about the death of the Big Machine?

140
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,680
5.

141
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,440
14.

142
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,340
That's right, America.

143
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,600
In one но蒙

144
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:31,600


145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,020
We're talking about the death of the Big Machine.

146
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,620
We're talking about the Big Hermetically Sealed Vacuum-Packed enterprise Tech actions

147
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,740
Por que pierwszy

148
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,340
goron

149
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
bits and bytes of information

150
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,360
which don't really, aren't really

151
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,440
having any existence.

152
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,740
And are these some way

153
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,980
a pizza front

154
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,140
for the corrupting snakes of hell?

155
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm asking you as a caller

156
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
and as a personal beninder

157
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,500
and a bad reminder,

158
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,340
I'm asking

159
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,600
each and every one of you

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,080
out there

161
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,980
to remain quiet.

162
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,580
Do not lay down.

163
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,960
Stand where you are

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
and do not leave your homes.

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Information

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
will be given out

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,340
on a first come,

168
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
user-friendly basis only.

169
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,520
So,

170
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,440
in the case

171
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,500
of an emergency or

172
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,960
a dynamic flux

173
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,400
or accident in the

174
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,280
warple frame,

175
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,640
in the warple fabric

176
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,580
of the time frame,

177
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,940
you will be

178
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,300
wrecked.

179
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,860
By your nearest authority

180
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,160
and we're not talking about

181
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,640
the man who waves the flag.

182
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
We're talking about the man

183
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,980
who finds that flag

184
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,220
like the Eerojima wavers

185
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,980
and raises it up on high

186
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,100
and plants it firmly

187
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,180
in his own breast.

188
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,000
He pounds it like a steak

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,780
into his heart.

190
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,780
May I interrupt here?

191
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,860
Um, Harry, let me take care

192
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,720
of a little business here

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,440
and then we'll continue

194
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,460
with this insanity.

195
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,380
I'm sorry, Taz.

196
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,560
I just got carried away.

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,780
I know you did, Dave.

198
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,140
I can't think about them too long.

199
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Attention all writers

200
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
or would-be writers.

201
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,700
That's you.

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,260
Huh?

203
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,360
What?

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,020
I've been a would-be writer

205
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,920
for so long now.

206
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,560
The third annual Cleveland

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,980
material.

208
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,300
That was the idea.

209
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,820
What?

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,340
That's the true-true that I was

211
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,360
listening on Radio Netherlands

212
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,220
and this marine biologist

213
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,600
was saying that by the year 2020,

214
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,540
and we're not talking TV or ice

215
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,940
in the year 2020.

216
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,520
Come on now.

217
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,140
2020.

218
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,180
Taz, Flipper may be dead by 2020.

219
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm talking about all the...

220
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,480
Flipper's already dead.

221
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,420
I'm talking about all the great whales.

222
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,180
And their great songs.

223
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,960
And all the great hits of the past.

224
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,640
Of course.

225
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,420
Because don't you know?

226
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,960
Jesus is going to come back

227
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,140
and make everything perfect

228
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,860
when, you know,

229
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,620
when it's all gone.

230
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm waiting.

231
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,240
I'm waiting already.

232
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm waiting.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,820
Well, you just, you know,

234
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,060
have some patience.

235
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,260
Some faith, brother.

236
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
I cannot have faith.

237
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,580
I am of ye of little faith.

238
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,520
Ye of little faith.

239
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm a doubting Thomas Gaugh.

240
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,100
If ye just had the faith

241
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,720
of a grain of mustard seed

242
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,480
or something like that...

243
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,020
Then, like, it would grow.

244
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,160
And I know all that stuff.

245
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,600
But I can't believe it.

246
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,400
I can't believe it.

247
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,160
I can't believe the lard

248
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,980
is going to come back

249
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,680
and repopulate the seas

250
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,740
with great whales

251
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,760
and even, well, great, great,

252
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,500
great videotapes.

253
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,800
Of great whales.

254
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,560
Of also great whales in bondage.

255
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,960
I can hardly wait for them.

256
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,220
They said that by 2025,

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,260
there'll be weird snuff films

258
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,160
of great whales.

259
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,900
Force-feeding great whales.

260
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,000
Force-feeding snuff films

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,180
of great whales.

262
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,500
Oh, man.

263
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,540
Now you're talking.

264
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,240
With diapers.

265
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,760
In diapers.

266
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,240
Yeah.

267
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,640
Yeah.

268
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,060
That's where we're heading, man.

269
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,320
No.

270
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,660
That's where we're heading.

271
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,720
I'm going head first.

272
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,260
Hey, there's a fetish party Sunday

273
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,180
at the Smart Bar.

274
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,120
A fetish party.

275
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,880
So if you come...

276
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,400
We missed the Friday the 13th party.

277
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,940
If you come dressed in your...

278
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,600
We're going to be there.

279
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,300
I want to be there.

280
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,200
Come and go to the fetish party.

281
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,480
Are you?

282
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,940
Yeah, sure.

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,340
What the hell?

284
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm going to dress in my little

285
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,140
leather underwear.

286
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,320
Well, I knew that you had

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,880
pierced nipples.

288
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,240
I knew that.

289
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,520
Yeah.

290
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,540
You should see my balls.

291
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,700
I don't...

292
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm sorry.

293
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,400
No, I don't particularly...

294
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,560
It's my baseballs.

295
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,640
Yeah, your big, shiny baseballs.

296
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:13,900
I know.

297
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140
I remember you talking about them too often.

298
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,660
Hello, you're on the air.

299
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,480
Hey, it's me.

300
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,960
Who are you?

301
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,240
Uh...

302
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,580
That's Walter.

303
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,140
Well, don't bring the whole thing

304
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,780
to a screaming halt.

305
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
That's okay, Walter.

306
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,140
You don't have to know your real name.

307
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,520
You can have a fake name

308
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,600
as long as you're talking to me.

309
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,660
It's like a pretend thing.

310
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm having a crisis.

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
What are you having a crisis about?

312
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,700
I found it.

313
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,380
If you're not dead,

314
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,880
you're part of it no matter what.

315
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,340
If you're not dead,

316
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,340
then you're stuck in this

317
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,480
smear of La Bombo.

318
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,680
Even you're asleep, Steve.

319
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,320
Did you relock the door?

320
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,200
Even I'm asleep?

321
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
You're a slave to their system.

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm a slave to no one.

323
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm speaking against

324
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,440
the corrupting worms.

325
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,000
No system.

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,260
Dave is the ultimate romantic hero.

327
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,340
No system is my master.

328
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,240
Like Don Giovanni.

329
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,740
I'm DJ, man.

330
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,460
No system is my alibi.

331
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm contrary to all that stuff.

332
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,100
Hello, you're on the air.

333
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,420
Hello.

334
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,760
All the dirty bastards.

335
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,100
687-351-...

336
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

337
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,460
That's the number in some of

338
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,840
the other places.

339
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,980
And we'll have to shut off

340
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,140
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith there

341
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,340
from taped off of WCSB in Cleveland.

342
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,120
Now, what's that about?

343
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,700
Oh, there we go.

344
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,860
This...

345
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,360
Speaking of Cleveland,

346
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,060
this background music is by Ron Slade

347
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,040
of Cleveland.

348
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,820
And...

349
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,100
And...

350
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,620
Oh, I guess now it's time to read you

351
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,380
a little bit of news

352
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,720
about the weird.

353
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,000
News of the weird here, dear friends.

354
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,760
News of the weird is a...

355
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,040
It's a new...

356
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,180
Some of you may see it in your weekly entertainment

357
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,260
magazines in your local town.

358
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,120
But we'll just...

359
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,980
Let's see.

360
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,440
We'll just read from it a little bit here.

361
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,740
Get some semi-neutral music in.

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,200
And...

363
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,040
Let's see.

364
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,980
Mm.

365
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,020
. . .

366
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,300
. . .

367
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,300


368
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,320
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

369
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,380
It's breath잽

370
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:26,960
.

371
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,040
ห

372
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,300
.

373
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,300


374
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,360
. .

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,400
.

376
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,460
.

377
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,520
.

378
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:27,560
.

379
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:27,620
.

380
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:27,660
.

381
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,660


382
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,900
.

383
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:27,900


384
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:27,940
.

385
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:27,940


386
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:27,940


387
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:27,940


388
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:27,940


389
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,000
.

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,120
!

391
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,000
.

392
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:34,700
!

393
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
.

394
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,420
they are an endangered species.

395
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,920
But people had used

396
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,520
stones, spears,

397
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,900
fires, and tribal drumbeats

398
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,140
to ward them off.

399
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,320
At least six people

400
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,720
were trampled to death.

401
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,840
Yes, revenge

402
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,680
is sweet, dear friends.

403
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,720
There's a lot of animal news

404
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,500
here. Animal

405
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,480
liberation news.

406
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,540
In November, officials

407
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,240
at, pardon me,

408
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,600
officials, gotta be ready

409
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,560
to have a radio star there. Whoa!

410
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,960
Wow.

411
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,960
What? Must have been them elephants.

412
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
Those elephants are getting them.

413
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,200
It is the elephants.

414
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,300
Oh no, it's not. It's the

415
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,360
Gyuto monks.

416
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,400
Anyway, in November, officials at

417
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,100
the Tokyo Sea Life Park

418
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,440
reported that about 10% of the

419
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,520
aquarium's bluefin and yellowfin

420
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,360
tuna have developed

421
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,480
deformed faces.

422
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,280
Because of the stress

423
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,680
of swimming in a small tank.

424
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,560
Large bumps

425
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,460
have appeared on some fish's

426
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,480
faces. Other fish's eyes

427
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,460
have become partially

428
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,920
dislodged.

429
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,600
I got news for you, friends. It's called

430
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,540
becoming middle

431
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,000
aged.

432
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,460
Uh, here's some

433
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,640
uh, oh, economic

434
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,520
weird news. In January, the

435
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,540
government of Brazil reported an annual

436
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,320
inflation rate for 1990.

437
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,140
In the year 1993, of

438
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,460
2,500%.

439
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,040
And Yugoslavia reported

440
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,000
that the cost of living rose

441
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,520
6

442
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,640
trillion percent

443
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,540
over the course of 1993.

444
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,380
In

445
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,400
Belgrade, a factory

446
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,480
that manufactures steel springs,

447
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,920
heard here in the background,

448
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,980
paid its workers in live

449
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,800
pigs rather than money.

450
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,500
In Rio de Janeiro,

451
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,620
a survey sponsored by the weekly

452
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,200
news magazine,

453
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,860
Istoé, found that

454
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,900
inflation was at least partly responsible

455
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,180
for the diminished frequency of sexual

456
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,260
relations in Brazil.

457
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,960
From an average person's

458
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,680
three times a week to

459
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,140
1.6. Said

460
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,580
a Sao Paulo psychotherapist,

461
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,160
you can't be a

462
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,340
victim in the street and a hero

463
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,480
in bed.

464
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Uh,

465
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,020
let's see, uh,

466
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,480
oh, uh,

467
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,940
for, regarding

468
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,080
the weirdo American community,

469
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,960
this woman, Rachel Barton Russell,

470
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,820
uh, petitioned a court in Springfield,

471
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,860
Oregon in February for a ruling on the

472
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,920
meaning of the state's law against

473
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,180
corpse abuse.

474
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,080
Her deceased husband, Donald Eugene

475
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,160
Russell, had declared in his will

476
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,220
that he wanted his skin

477
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,800
used to make book covers

478
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,980
for a collection of his poetry.

479
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,520
But the state mortuary and

480
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,560
cemetery board claims that carrying out

481
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,240
the request would subject a few

482
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,280
funeral home to liability for

483
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,820
corpse abuse.

484
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,080
Dug up my baby last night.

485
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,960
See, uh,

486
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,920
um,

487
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,140
in, oh, there's some nice,

488
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,860
nice news. In February, the Royal Bank of

489
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,820
Scotland announced that it would begin to issue

490
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,180
extra check cashing ID cards

491
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,320
to its transvestite customers

492
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,760
who request them so that they might have separate

493
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,220
cards depicting themselves as a sex worker.

494
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,300
They also announced that they would be

495
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,300


496
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,300


497
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,080
dressed as male and female in order to

498
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,980
avoid embarrassment or difficulties.

499
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,700
And, uh, in October in Iran, where celebratory

500
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,640
gunfire is traditional at weddings,

501
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,060
a guest named Rasool lost control of his

502
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,860
automatic weapon at a wedding in

503
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,720
Lorystan Province, accidentally killing

504
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,440
six people and wounding fourteen.

505
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,200
Oh, that is, ahem, an automatic weapon

506
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


507
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


508
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


509
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,080
at the wedding. You know, those things are hard to hold

510
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,240
onto once you start firing. It's hard to, to really aim

511
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,300
them if you've ever done that.

512
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,620
And here, a horrible death.

513
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,040
The international food company Nestle, UK, was fined

514
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,900
about $20,000 in January for injuries suffered by its

515
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,720
employee, Alex Smith, 36, at a plant in York, England,

516
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,180
while cleaning excess chocolate off the sides of a giant

517
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,580
mixing bowl. He slipped and fell in, triggering the mixing

518
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,080
paddles, which whipped him for more than a minute before

519
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,180
they were shut off.

520
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,120
It sounds kind of like the sorts of things that happened to, uh,

521
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,660
Bob's enemies when he was a little kid.

522
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,360
And, uh, professional so- sports news, professional soccer team

523
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,940
manager Dan O'Riordan, uh, defending his decision to levy

524
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,180
fines against players for flatulence in the locker room

525
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,720
said, it can get fairly oppressive when you've got 20 players

526
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,080
in a tiny dressing room all suffering the effects of a Sunday

527
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,260
night curry.

528
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,960
Yes, those effects could sound and smell about like this show,

529
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,760
dear friends. That's from News of the Weird, which you can

530

And, uh, oh, just thinking about that weird stuff makes me reach

537
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,000

538
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,440
song here, coming up by none other than Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

539
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,980
and I guess the Brain Rot Band. Thank you.

540

All on me, all on me, eight dollars, you pinch.

544
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,040
You got more money than you need.

545

You got eight hundred bucks for getting hit by a truck.

546
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,040
So don't tell me that you're gonna bleed.

547
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:24,960
Only eight dollars till Thursday, I promise to pay back

548
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,920

552
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,940
SUB Marie Shetz 003.

553
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,540
Huh? What? Oh, yeah, yeah.

554
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:04,040
Yeah, Lonesome Cowboy Dave there with a lonely $19 and a beer and a what?

555
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,020
A golfer's head.

556
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,500
A golfer's head?

557
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,260
No, hockey players' heads.

558
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,240
What are these guys talking about?

559
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,700
No, basketball.

560
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,380
Wait a minute, golfer doesn't sound too bad.

561
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,180
Yeah, golfer.

562
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,520
Okay, golfer head.

563
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,880
I hate golf. How about you? Do you hate golf?

564
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,620
I really hate golf.

565
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,140
Do you hate golf?

566
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,580
Okay, wait a minute. Let's see where we are.

567
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:30,320
J.R. Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius, Dallas, Texas, Reverend Ivan Stang, and a golfer head.

568
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,140
What's the golfer head doing, though?

569
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Okay, it's scarred.

570
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,260
It's scarred?

571
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,000
We'll give you that. I mean, we'll give you that.

572
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,840
How about coagulated scab of the head of the golfer?

573
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,820
Okay, if the head is coagulating and scabbed, then we know it's decapitated.

574
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,560
We know it's decapitated.

575
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,640
It's not the torso. We're going to forget the torso.

576
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,280
No, the torso's gone.

577
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,480
Yeah.

578
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,340
The torso's straight out.

579
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
We were far behind.

580
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:54,700
Okay.

581
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,480
We were on that.

582
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Okay, now let's review. We've got a golfer head.

583
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,040
We've got a golfer.

584
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,300
It's been decapitated.

585
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,780
Decapitated. What are we doing to it?

586
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,940
And it's got to be...

587
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,820
We don't get to win a baseball bat?

588
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,060
It's got to be...

589
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,960
Are we doing a field goal?

590
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,720
Should we just, like, set it on the floor and leave it there?

591
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:08,940
No.

592
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,840
Make it real stiff?

593
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,320
No.

594
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,020
It's way too stiff.

595
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,620
Dear friends, well, we'll leave Sterno, Janer, and Reverend Andrew there from Ogre Network.

596
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,560
Yeah, the doctor's for Bob.

597
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,500
Sorry, getting back together.

598
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,960
Getting back together again.

599
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:29,640
It's like the Beatles getting back together again and then killing each other.

600
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,400
Well, it's time for...

601
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
Well, it's kook time now.

602
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,620
Yes, time for...

603
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,400
Time for...

604
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,100
Where's my background?

605
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,360
There.

606
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,580
There we go.

607
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,040
Yes, it's smooth.

608
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,740
Smooth and groovy, dear friends.

609
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes, let's...

610
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,100
Now for our weekly reading from Donna Cossie's book, Kooks.

611
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,180
Tonight we'll be covering just a short section on a kook named Norma Cox,

612
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,640
who wrote a book called The Holy Land Above and Below,

613
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,700
which is profiled in this section of Kooks.

614
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,880
Oh, she also wrote UFOs and the Dragon Power.

615
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,920
And it's a real hodgepodge of all the classic crackpot conspiracy theories,

616
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,080
minus Bob.

617
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,640
So, of course, it's...

618
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:32,780
But just to give you a sample of what this wondrous Norma Cox has discovered

619
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,560
regarding contact with extraterrestrials by George Washington.

620
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,220
And we quote here from Norma Cox.

621
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,100
Enormously ambitious, the father of our country was aggressive and without scruples.

622
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,080
Scruples.

623
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,680
Giving not a damn for education and the finer side of life,

624
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,720
George Washington was a money-grabbing, glory-grubbing charlatan

625
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
with a bent for deceit and the devious.

626
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,460
With the ability to inspire trust and zeal,

627
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,040
he was the perfect tool for masonry.

628
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,540
Therefore, he was made privy to the deepest-held secrets of that diabolical organization

629
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,480
and allowed to fulfill his insatiable need for power, wealth,

630
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,080
and power.

631
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,080


632
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,080


633
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,820
And attention.

634
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,860
What a job lying historians have done on this faker over the last 200 years.

635
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,840
And George was an occultist who got a tremendous bang out of fooling around with the supernatural.

636
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,860
Of the highest masonic degree,

637
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,560
the father of our country, so-called,

638
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:50,560
was in full masonic regalia when he deposited secret objects at the cornerstone laying of the White House.

639
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,060
With all due respect,

640
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm going to give you a little bit of a sneak peek at the

641
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,680
story of George Washington.

642
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,700
And I'll be right back.

643
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:11,000
And visions mapped a course for the newly formed nation.

644
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,880
Thirteen states with thirteen masonic governors to follow.

645
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,720
Since that time, every man succeeding to the presidency of the United States,

646
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,040
whether a mason,

647
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,000
or a favored member of some other demonic order,

648
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:32,900
has held firmly to the treasonous outline plotted by the sorcerer we have been taught to honor and admire.

649
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,560
Years later,

650
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,140
the ignorant American citizens were given the Statue of Liberty,

651
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,300
which is not only a symbol of the pagan goddess Diana,

652
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,840
but also a radio antenna.

653
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,280
As Norma goes on here,

654
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,900
with great spikes,

655
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,140
or antenna,

656
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,900
crowning her head,

657
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,000
and sitting upon a star-shaped base in the midst of flowing water,

658
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,660
water essential for this purpose,

659
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,540
this huge copper statue,

660
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,100
copper,

661
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,860
a number one conductor of electricity,

662
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,640
serves a dual purpose.

663
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,160
One, under the cover of a symbol of liberty,

664
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,080
it mesmerizes the citizens into adoring a goddess they know nothing about.

665
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,640
Two, in this cover concealing a still more important function,

666
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,400
the statue serves as a tower,

667
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,060
one reaching into heaven.

668
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:27,660
And transmitting and receiving messages to and from the moon.

669
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,700
Yes, friends, from Donna Cossey's book,

670
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,920
Kooks, available from Feral House Press,

671
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,560
Feral House, F-E-R-A-L,

672
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:50,460
P.O. Box 3466, Portland, Oregon 97208.

673
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,080
And, uh, what else have we coming up here?

674
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,580
Oh, well, I could give her the answer.

675
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,900
That's what I ought to do.

676
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,220
I'll read the talk, but see,

677
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,260
some of these so-called Christians are a little bit mixed up.

678
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,600
You know, they got it all, they got things all turned around.

679
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,560
And, uh, but, but we do have the answer.

680
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,440
Yes, the answer.

681
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,160
A little paperback book,

682
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,560
found in Christian bookstores,

683
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,960
from which we now read.

684
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,280
One day in the near future,

685
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,680
God will have to get the attention of the world,

686
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,360
for time is running out.

687
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,300
By the year 2050, there could be between 50 to 75 billion people,

688
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,140
or even more, all jammed together

689
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,480
like a global pack of sardines upon the face of the earth.

690
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,980
And amidst this global panic and confusion

691
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,240
will be the perfect time for Satan to send forth his son.

692
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,220
That wicked being whom the Bible calls the Beast,

693
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,580
Revelation 13, the Antichrist.

694
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,180
Forget the fantasies of the Omen trilogy of movies

695
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,900
and the false theology of Hal Lindsey,

696
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,900
the late great planet Earth.

697
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,480
The Antichrist will not come as a political leader

698
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,460
or a world dictator.

699
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,840
He will initially come into the world seen as Christ.

700
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,580
He will claim that this is the second coming of Christ,

701
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,980
but not Jesus Christ.

702
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,380
He comes as the Christ of the occult world.

703
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,220
He will come as the totally unalienable,

704
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,460
perfected man,

705
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,220
as the evolutionary, pipe-smoking super-human.

706
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,700
And he comes in the capacity of a world teacher,

707
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,480
religious reformer, and as a guide for humanity.

708
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,420
Later on, he will take over the ten-nation Western conspiracy,

709
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,500
or I'm sorry, confederacy.

710
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,840
And then will come the second holocaust, dear friends,

711
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,780
and the first rapture, and the second rapture,

712
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,220
and the Satanist initiates will completely take over.

713
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,060
Uh, this initiation will...

714
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,620
This initiation will also take place very, very quickly.

715
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,780
Schools, college campuses, churches, synagogues, sports stadiums,

716
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,380
and military bases could all be instantly converted

717
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,360
to Luciferic initiation centers overnight.

718
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,920
The antichrist will teach that time is of the greatest importance.

719
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,040
The evil ones must be removed as quickly as possible.

720
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,260
And friends, we're trying to help that happen at grand prix speed,

721
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,960
as it says here in Harry Walther's great book,

722
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,480
The Two Raptures.

723
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,560
Or the answer, I guess, is actually what it is.

724
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,340
And you know, that's how that brings to mind this other one.

725
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,340


726
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,520
Another little piece here by Reverend Sheldon DeWare.

727
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,940
Jesus loves me, this I know,

728
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,420
cause my preacher tells me so.

729
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,860
If I argue, he'll use his tongue

730
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,420
till I scream out,

731
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,900
Yes, I'm wrong!

732
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,140
Oh, God, I'm a sinner!

733
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,460
I repent! Just make him stop!

734
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:08,440
Oh!

735
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,520
Oh!

736
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,240
...having a hard time finding customers at this time of night.

737
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,060
I think you better bring your own customers with you.

738
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,900
All right.

739
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,920
The inflatable...

740
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,720
Bring the inflatable ones we used last time, not the Moonies.

741
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,880
And the 700-foot tall Jesus.

742
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,340
Do you have to take that thing apart to get it on the train or not?

743
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,300
He had real good sand, if you know what I mean.

744
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,580
Remember that sand that he put...

745
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,540
Last time they told me I could check the Jesus, but, um...

746
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,740
But that... that...

747
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,580
I had to bring the Architeasma on board with me.

748
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,080
On the airplane?

749
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,200
Yep.

750
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:42,920
Wow.

751
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,660
Well, it's okay if you bring all that stuff,

752
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,440
because they do let you talk about Jesus on this radio station.

753
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,480
They don't have any kind of rules against it like the...

754
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,720
Right, that's like taking one of those PSA clearance impressions...

755
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,860
You're not just nailing him right up?

756
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Yeah.

757
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,400
Yeah.

758
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,660
He gets across just nailing him just...

759
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,840
Actually, send us a whole box of those miniature Jesus, too.

760
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,820
Those are delicious.

761
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,520
Ha, ha, ha.

762
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,360
Just...

763
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:15,800
Wonderful job of calling, and praise Bob, and hi out there to all the slackest minions listening to this station who...

764
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,720
The old Delta.

765
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,740
...do and know that even in these hard economic times, so the new Saturations subgenius is still the best of all for you.

766
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:31,980
Send that dollar, send that five dollar bill, send that ten dollar bill, send that twenty dollar bill, send that hundred, that unmarked crisp twing hundred two.

767
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,860
And the wallet came.

768
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,980
Hello, you're on the air.

769
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,300
Clown.

770
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,200
Oh, the...

771
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,620
All the dirty back...

772
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,960
687-3515.

773
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,940
...is the phone number.

774
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,260
Hang on a second.

775
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,820
We're just sort of sitting around the fire tonight.

776
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,720
Okay.

777
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,320
There it's also on the shortwave.

778
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,580
The nuclear fire, you can hear it buzzing over in the corner there.

779
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,960
I heard two other things which aren't important to anybody.

780
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,460
One is called the urban tribes of Buenos Aires.

781
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,060
Oh, shut up, you fat pig.

782
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,300
You don't know my true weight, buddy.

783
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,540
That wasn't very nice.

784
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,160
No, it wasn't very nice, but it was very, very tangy, like salsa.

785
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,700
I did notice that part of it.

786
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,280
I'm very concerned about what's going on.

787
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,280


788
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,280


789
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,280


790
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,020
I'm very concerned about what you were talking about.

791
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm terribly worried.

792
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,740
Do you know what I'm talking about then?

793
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,000
Unfortunately, yes.

794
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,720
There have been mass suicides in Buenos Aires.

795
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh, my God.

796
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,560
I don't want to talk about it.

797
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,160
There have been.

798
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,720
Really?

799
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,260
Over the past several...

800
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,420
Really?

801
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
That's a true one, though.

802
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,440
Really?

803
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,540
Oh, well, we'll make light of it then.

804
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,360
And also...

805
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:24,760
I don't care.

806
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,600
...the urban tribes.

807
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,580
Well, there's two things...

808
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm losing all my pity.

809
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,540
There's two things going on called the urban tribes down in South America, and there's

810
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,320
also been this big spate of suicides going on around the globe.

811
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,580
People just like, you know...

812
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,520
Often, so.

813
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,260
...in England, they run off the cliff.

814
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,840
Has that been happening there?

815
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,040
Yeah.

816
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,140
I just heard about this thing here, and then the urban tribes, they don't believe

817
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,580
in anything.

818
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,400
They just dress different to be against a different tribe, and it's purely style.

819
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,420
And they ask them what they believe in, and they say they don't believe in anything but

820
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,700
style.

821
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,240
Hello?

822
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,760
You're on the air.

823
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,260
Isn't it like the end times, or is it more like the beginning times?

824
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,260
Or is it just a bunch of more of the same damn in-between times we've been seeing all

825
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,640
the time?

826
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,120
You know, it's just proof that MKUltra was never closed.

827
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,780
Oh, yeah.

828
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,000
Uh-oh.

829
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,320
Dave?

830
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,680
MKUltra?

831
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,300
Never closed.

832
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,080
MKUltra was never closed.

833
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,480
That was in Time Magazine, but that guy, how do you say that?

834
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,460
He must be a spy.

835
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,200
I'm paranoid now.

836
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:17,920
Hello?

837
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,440
You're on the air.

838
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,260
I'm paranoid now.

839
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,880
No, MKUltra was never closed.

840
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,500
Of course not.

841
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,080
Who do you think runs the secret police?

842
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,240
The secret, secret, secret police.

843
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,000
And we're talking about guys who don't even get badges.

844
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,340
Some of them don't even get to carry winky badges.

845
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,720
I knew it.

846
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,440
Chepkeese.

847
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,600
Oh, my God, Chaz.

848
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,680
Let's not talk in those...

849
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,980
Those Egyptian vagaries will scare the children again.

850
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,500
And you eat Chepkeese.

851
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Every time you...

852
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,420
Hello, anyone there?

853
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:40,900
Call her.

854
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,800
Eye in the pyramid and the eyeball hanging out of the pyramid.

855
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,820
Chaz, what is it?

856
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,520
Novus Ordo Seclorum.

857
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,780
New World Order.

858
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,180
No sacred order.

859
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,900
New sacred order.

860
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,360
Yes.

861
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,640
Secular, secular.

862
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,480
No, it's sacred.

863
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,720
Secular.

864
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,560
It means sacred.

865
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,540
Secularum.

866
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,200
Sacred.

867
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,720
Organum Mundum means...

868
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,860
I know it means sacred.

869
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,660
I had a doctor.

870
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,960
I had a doctor tell me it means sacred.

871
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,240
And plus, you were a damn choir boy, too.

872
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,180
You used to know Latin.

873
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:09,860
Hello?

874
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,580
Yeah.

875
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,100
Don't you think it's weird that Chaz, this foul-mouthed sick person, was actually

876
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,820
a choir boy?

877
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,380
Yeah.

878
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,620
Okay, well, I'm glad you keep agreeing like a little lamprey, but say something right

879
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,520
now or we'll kill you.

880
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,600
Okay, I'll pick the topping.

881
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,600
Yeah, let him talk.

882
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,120
Okay.

883
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,200
Some people are shy.

884
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sorry.

885
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,560
Shy indeed.

887
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,080
Hello?

888
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,400
Hello?

889
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,620
Hello?

890
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:34,740
Hello?

891
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:34,740


892
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:34,740


893
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:34,740


894
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:34,740


895
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,240
This person's got a mono-syllabic vocabulary.

896
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,040
It's one of the Egyptian vagaries.

897
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,940
Why do you think if they could live to be 9,000 years old and eat 3,000% of their brain,

898
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,520
wouldn't they bet every horse in the X-Acta perfectly in the trifecta?

899
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,260
Have you seen how Jackie O, the lizard agent has run out of her use?

900
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,140
That is true, Jackie O, as a lizard agent, has really run out of Agent Orange.

901
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,320
They said that she was getting commands through her pillbox.

902
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,360
Huh?

903
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,680
I ran out of it once, and I ran back into it.

904
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,900
He ran it.

905
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,920
Now, this is a common thing, isn't it, Chaz?

906
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,300
Unfortunately, yes.

907
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,900
A lot of people run out of it, and they can't find anymore,

908
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,640
but then they run right into it as soon as it's going on again.

909
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
I'd ask you to help me, but...

910
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,340
Well, we can only help ourselves, and like a true...

911
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,720
Exactly right.

912
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,160
As a true sub...

913
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,100
That's why I didn't ask.

914
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
As a sub-moron.

915
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:26,900
I...

916
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,020
Don't say da-da to me.

917
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,020
I know what da-da means.

918
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
I'm not an abstruse rube.

919
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,060
I'm a glistening, gleaming dolt.

920
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,700
I noticed that, but I tried not to.

921
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,600
Well, try not to ever notice it again,

922
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,440
because someday when the sun comes up for the very last time,

923
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,040
we're all going to be ringing the lines of the cliffs,

924
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,640
screaming to that miscreant being as it zaps us down

925
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
and turns us into lard.

926
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,840
Or some other thing.

927
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,820
I want my mommy.

928
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,580
You can have your mommy.

929
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,220
I don't really want her like that.

930
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,260
That's the way I want her.

931
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,980
Uh-oh.

932
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:03,940
Mom.

933
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,480
You know, I want her gleaming white radish hump.

934
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,660
Oh, my God.

935
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,400
I do.

936
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,140
But I don't know if she wants mine.

937
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,100
We'll try to hide it.

938
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,920
I know they've given you the A treatment.

939
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,360
No, no, no, no, no.

940
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,300
You can tell, like, when my bells start ringing

941
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,060
or I make comments about the quantity of light in my brain,

942
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,840
like a thousand little pinholes,

943
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,740
that's when I'm being mind-controlled.

944
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,920
Now, when I'm not being mind-controlled,

945
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,980
it sounds like this.

946
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,020
What's happening?

947
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,680
Let's have another call right now.

948
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,320
Hello?

949
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,080
Hello, you're off the air.

950
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,400
Hello, you're on the air.

951
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,660
Have the nylons when grin wraps.

952
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah, hello, you're on the air, too.

953
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,960
Well, how come we're all on the air at the same time?

954
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,000
Well, because we have so much air, you wouldn't believe it.

955
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,500
Look at this.

956
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,700
A giant pile of busted microphones,

957
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,840
16 feet tall, along with a few broken tape recorders.

958
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,300
Are you a heavy breather?

959
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,660
I can hear you doing that.

960
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,440
Or are you merely sedated by the swatting numbers?

961
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,620
No, I'm sorry.

962
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,620
That isn't you.

963
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,580
I can see you now.

964
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:28,880
Go ahead.

965
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,640
Yeah, the picture's really fuzzy here.

966
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,600
We can't see you very good.

967
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,820
It's awfully nice of you to have us on our show.

968
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,500
Yeah, it's great being a radio star, huh?

969
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:36,960
Yeah.

970
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,060
How do you do it?

971
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,220
How do you keep up to life like that?

972
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,360
Not easy.

973
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,500
You eat a lot of chili.

974
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,280
A lot of chili.

975
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,440
A lot of hot weed.

976
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm heating up some chili.

977
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,280
Yeah.

978
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,920
And I was listening to you guys, and I just broke my leg.

979
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,780
Yeah, you should have tried to send in money first and then listen to us,

980
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,980
because you might, in fact, you might want to do that now,

981
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,760
because you've got one leg left, if you know what I mean.

982
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,640
I already sent the money in.

983
00:37:59,640 --> 00:37:59,740
Shut up.

984
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,740
Okay, then we'll leave that other leg alone.

985
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,100
I haven't even broken a leg yet.

986
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,500
Yeah?

987
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,420
How about an arm?

988
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,740
Oh.

989
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,980
How about another nostril?

990
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,540
That'll probably really help you get some slack.

991
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,980
Hey, now, that's expensive, though.

992
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,540
Now we're talking about things that are a little bit expensive

993
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,460
that you might have to fly all the way to Dobstown.

994
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,360
Yeah, microwave Dobstown.

995
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,220
I have a question for one of the doctors or one of the operating physicians.

996
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,940
Or did you want to share some chili with us?

997
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,300
Chili.

998
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,160
Yeah.

999
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,740
If you listen very carefully.

1000
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,180
I hear the tiny little sounds of the subgenius healing session.

1001
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,000
Gary, Gary, who are those people back there?

1002
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,200
Well, I see Bob Nelson.

1003
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,020
Who's that guy whispering?

1004
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,980
Delivering a baby.

1005
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,420
No, that man and woman.

1006
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,000
They're whispering.

1007
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,740
What are they doing?

1008
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,400
I don't know.

1009
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,860
I'm trying to breastfeed this woman.

1010
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,100
Oh, I see.

1011
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,080
It's so cold here.

1012
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,360
I don't even see how they can spend that much time out here without lighting their pipes up.

1013
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,200
Well.

1014
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,820
I'm going to put another layer of whiskey.

1015
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm going to put another layer of whiskey.

1016
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,860
We're out here at the airport.

1017
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:10,460
And occasionally we do these live shows because, well, when people are eating chili and they're breaking legs left and right.

1018
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,300
I'm sorry about that leg.

1019
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:11,600
I didn't.

1020
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,160
You probably don't need it, right?

1021
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,020
And, okay.

1022
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,980
And, okay.

1023
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,600
The therapy room, as you can see, is being occupied.

1024
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,760
We'll turn this up a little bit.

1025
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,680
Adjust the color there.

1026
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,100
Some of Dobst's treatments have been incredibly successful.

1027
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,500
And if you are watching us, you can find us there.

1028
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,740
Hello.

1029
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,740
Hey, tell Bob to eat chili or use Vaseline.

1030
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,480
Don't bother with those.

1031
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,020
Just the wetsuits, okay, ma'am?

1032
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:44,740
We ask that our other listeners bow their heads and thank J.R. and Bob Dobst for providing this slight respite to Conspiracy Radio.

1033
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,080
I've never met Bob either, but I've been touched by Bob.

1034
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,300
A lot of people involved are not going to be involved much longer.

1035
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,000
The coming attractions, I think they're called.

1036
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,380
Isn't that when the giant...

1037
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,620
The giant hand of Jehovah or the fist of the mighty something?

1038
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,820
Right, the wheelbarrow of Wotan.

1039
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,360
Oh, that's the wheelbarrow of Wotan that is powered by the two of the fists.

1040
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,000
So you can imagine how much trouble that will be.

1041
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,040
And a wheel of revenge in the front of the wheelbarrow, which continues on by itself for quite a while.

1042
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:23,080
Even after the wheelbarrow, yea, verily has dumped its load upon those who are unfaithful and do not send.

1043
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,440
Oh, minor, minor parts of souvenirs.

1044
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,060
Right, a dollar, a part of a dollar, a large, large part of a dollar.

1045
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,640
The subgenius foundation.

1046
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,260
And a check, a one dollar check is the best way because we like to see stacks and stacks and stacks.

1047
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,380
Have you ever seen two million one dollar checks?

1048
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,220
It's amazing.

1049
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,680
Filling the rooms in Dallas.

1050
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,020
Stuffed with cash.

1051
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:50,160
Once a week I fly here to do this show just to share with you these pictures of...

1052
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,360
Here, here, look.

1053
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,620
Here's a room full of one dollar checks ready for the rubber stamp.

1054
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,560
Isn't this amazing?

1055
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,060
So we don't even cash the checks.

1056
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,260
We don't even use the money.

1057
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,600
We just need it to interpret your psychic stench.

1058
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:09,800
Powerful Izzy is J.R. Bob Dobbs, our prophet, cannot get your psychic stench without the love offering.

1059
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,880
So we just ask that you send in a small part of your fortune.

1060
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:23,660
Whoever you may be or whatever kind of small job you might have, just slip out one of those little tiny green things and send it to the church so we can reach you and be in contact with you.

1061
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,400
I know, I'm back again.

1062
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,780
I'd rather have the rubber than the money.

1063
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,180
Can we make a deal here?

1064
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,740
Well, you can have both the rubber.

1065
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,380
And the money.

1066
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,140
Maybe.

1067
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,600
The rubber's used, though.

1068
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,640
Don't put it in the way.

1069
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,520
No, man, I'm not going for no used rubber.

1070
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,460
No, no, no, not that type of rubber.

1071
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,220
No, I'm talking about the sheets.

1072
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm talking about rubber bands around newspapers.

1073
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,900
Right, right, I'm talking about sheets.

1074
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,000
I don't want that.

1075
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,900
The sheets are about 34 feet by 18 feet.

1076
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,080
We use them to cover the airplanes.

1077
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,800
That's what I mean.

1078
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,820
One size fits all our house, I know.

1079
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,300
Yeah, yeah, the whole thing fits over the house.

1080
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,160
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail?

1081
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,040
Or are you going to write in and get your pipe?

1082
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,380
I'm still waiting for the cast.

1083
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,520
The cast?

1084
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,800
Well, the cast is all...

1085
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,000
Unfortunately, they'll be outside your house

1086
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,060
to sing a song about 8 o'clock this morning.

1087
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,100
Actually, we're expecting Vic Morrow, too.

1088
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,700
Yeah, he's going to be starring in all the body parts.

1089
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,800
I just want to know, you guys are very informative tonight,

1090
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,820
but I want to know, what planet are we on?

1091
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh, and we have been on the KPFA planet there

1092
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,180
with Puzzling Evidence

1093
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,080
and the great Gary Gabrog friend.

1094
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,240
That was an old...

1095
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,460
That's an old, old recording, my friends.

1096
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,580
Speaking of old recordings,

1097
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,580
listen to what happens when I turn the air conditioner on.

1098
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,720
See?

1099
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,700
Quiet, sweet, wonderful all of a sudden.

1100
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,940
Well, it was.

1101
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,240
Well, let's shift gears here.

1102
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:56,380
Friends, we certainly have had a lot of our friendly other shows,

1103
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,600
the KPFA Subgenius Show and the ESO Radio and Brain Rot,

1104
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,340
but we're not going to be doing that combo there

1105
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,720
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1106
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,820
What the heck?

1107
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,120
We'll just bring some more in.

1108
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,040
We'll go to...

1109
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,120
We'll go to Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1110
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,060
That's it, yeah.

1111
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,540
With her WREK Atlanta show.

1112
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:29,360
And she has some sad news

1113
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,500
and kind of a...

1114
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,280
What?

1115
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1116
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1117
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1118
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1119
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1120
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1121
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1122
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1123
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1124
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1125
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1126
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:31,900


1127
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,320
Hey, what's...

1128
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:36,900
Eh?

1129
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,160
Eh?

1130
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,480
Spooky.

1131
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,260
Very spooky noises, my friends.

1132
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,180
Okay, Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1133
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,640
Oh, that's a bit of a sad time

1134
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,420
because yesterday,

1135
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,800
well, I found out that Otis

1136
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,700
the drunk died.

1137
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,240
Oh, poor old Hal Smith, 77.

1138
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,120
The man who staggered and stumbled and slurred

1139
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,000
through the surreal streets of Mayberry

1140
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,260
and taught his kids that passed out drunks

1141
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,720
were not only funny, they were a nifty plot device.

1142
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,080
The article didn't say if he'd ended his life

1143
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,940
as a drunken sot in a Hicktown drunk tank,

1144
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,100
like the way Aunt B slipped into serious psychosis

1145
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,920
in Siler City, North Carolina,

1146
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,920
faking pies and calling for an Opie

1147
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,780
who never came home for dinner.

1148
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,820
But despite this loss, the endless cycle of death

1149
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,760
and rebirth grinds inexorably on.

1150
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,480
So we're going to make Otis the drunk

1151
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,920
our short-duration personal savior

1152
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,700
for this episode of The Fun House.

1153
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,480
Here we're setting him up a cot in the corner.

1154
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,380
Hey, sleep it off.

1155
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,000
And hey, when you wake up, we'll party with you.

1156
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,320
Uh, fuck!

1157
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,260
Stop abusing that substance, abusing my baby.

1158
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,480
Stop abusing that substance, abusing my baby.

1159
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,080
Because you're kicking him in the face.

1160
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,660
Such a damn disgrace.

1161
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,180
The way you treat him when you squeak this.

1162
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:29,800
Jesus.

1163
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,080
Fuck you.

1164
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,080


1165
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,080


1166
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:25,960
Okay, Gabby, look at me!

1167
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,460
Okay, Gabby, go!

1168
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,480
I have a green hug.

1169
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,040
What?

1170
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,380
Hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

1171
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,080
Okay, uh, that was, of course, one.

1172
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,420
Lonesome cowboy Dave again.

1173
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,380
And now, back to Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1174
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,180
Whoo!

1175
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,900
Yeah, this is a great time.

1176
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,080
It's a time of loss, a time of new beginnings for the Reverend Flooze here.

1177
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,060
And not necessarily because spring is near,

1178
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,820
although the mystery tree out in front of the Floozeum

1179
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,360
has burst into particularly outstanding fluorescence,

1180
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,180
huge, fleshy blossoms of petals

1181
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:29,900
that consistently

1182
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,260
see of human skin.

1183
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,060
Oh, nobody knows the genus of this strange plant,

1184
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,840
but I take it sudden erupting is an omniscient,

1185
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,020
and the end times are cruising up on us at a breakneck pace.

1186
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,240
Oh, but it won't be my neck that's breaking,

1187
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,200
because I'll be munching Fritos and dip in the hospitality suite

1188
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,080
to the excess escape vessels

1189
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,780
while watching global incineration up close and personal

1190
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,160
on the wall-size high-definition video screen.

1191
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,000
Ha!

1192
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,300
And believe me,

1193
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,400
I've been given a lot of thought about whose ends in particular

1194
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,720
I want to bear gleeful witness to.

1195
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,120
But the good thing is through the patented subgenius concept of time control

1196
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,320
and the miracle of robot-controlled heat-resistant Steadicams,

1197
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,860
there's no time limit on retribution.

1198
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,600
Now, yes, your foes will feel the fires of this particular hell

1199
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,200
for as long as you like,

1200
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,680
because every time you view and review their videotaped records,

1201
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,500
their own blazing pitch-anima raw nerve torments

1202
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,060
will be fed again and again into their agony-dew account.

1203
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,040
Oh, yes, they will owe you a debt of pain that they cannot waltz on.

1204
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,700
Sure, they say revenge is a dish best served cold,

1205
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,900
but I like it hot and spicy.

1206
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,680
Muy caliente!

1207
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,140
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

1208
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,640
There's something he said once before they took him away

1209
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,660
to the Massachusetts State Home for the Beardless.

1210
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:58,740
He said,

1211
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,120
I'm not bewildered.

1212
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,880
He said,

1213
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,640
Life is like a sewer.

1214
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,280
What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.

1215
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,840
Manamana, manamana,

1216
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,860
Yes, dear friends, it's right.

1217
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,660
And imagine Nenslow's consternation

1218
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,640
upon hearing what I'm saying.

1219
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,420
About to read and finding that such a situation

1220
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,360
which he wrote, though serious,

1221
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,640
has nothing whatsoever to do with the gross national world church

1222
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,220
of the subgenius's decision to repudiate Bob

1223
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,100
in all his smirking forms.

1224
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,100
No, indeed, oh, nothing at all.

1225
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,220
Nothing at all to do with that.

1226
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,980
It's just another damn coincidence, I tell ya.

1227
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,300
And if you're the kind of naive simpleton

1228
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,420
who'll take a simple coincidence,

1229
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,080
a matter of meaningless happenstance,

1230
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,720
and attribute all kinds of meaning and influence to it,

1231
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,200
well, I'm just sorry for you.

1232
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,380
That's all.

1233
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,640
Not meaning any disrespect or anything.

1234
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,360
I just think, hell, this is the 20th century,

1235
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,040
the atom age, the last days,

1236
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,440
predicted in some book somewhere.

1237
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,540
And I figure by this time,

1238
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,020
we should have crept far enough

1239
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,360
from the shadow of the cave mouth

1240
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,360
to see through such transparent ploys.

1241
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,620
We should, even the mere human among us,

1242
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,440
be able to keep our mental knuckles

1243
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,480
off the figurative ground long enough

1244
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,760
to straighten our psychological spine a little

1245
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,400
and stand allegorically correct.

1246
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,960
I figure.

1247
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,740
Eh, maybe not.

1248
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,400
Maybe I'm really as much of a nitwit

1249
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,140
as everybody seems to think I am.

1250
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,580
Maybe I oughta just quit,

1251
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,520
crawl into my bunker,

1252
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,300
and drink canned water till 1998,

1253
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,700
and let the squealin' hordes fight it out alone.

1254
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,080
But by something or other,

1255
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,500
hell, no dobs,

1256
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,380
I don't even have anything to...

1257
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,180
Without Bob, you can't curse.

1258
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,560
By dang, I just can't do it.

1259
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,800
I guess I'm just a meddler,

1260
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,340
a sucker, a dreamer,

1261
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,640
a hopeless romantic swept away

1262
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,720
by my own self-generated waves

1263
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,540
of juvenile emotion.

1264
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,340
But bling-ding-it,

1265
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,060
I still have faith in you!

1266
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,440
Yes, I still believe in you,

1267
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,240
and I still believe in the church,

1268
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,500
and in my own fellow and gal sub-geni.

1269
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,760
And I feel that if anybody can save

1270
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,640
this tired old world from a disgraceful,

1271
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,340
degenerate end,

1272
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,340
and nobody can,

1273
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,520
it's us.

1274
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,100
I mean, you and me, pal.

1275
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,280
Or palette.

1276
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,860
You and me, oh, we're different.

1277
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,160
We're not like the rest of them.

1278
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,580
We think alike.

1279
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,140
And I truly believe that if you and I can work together,

1280
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,020
if we can work together with the pitifully small handful

1281
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,940
of true sub-geni,

1282
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,260
whether they admit they're sub-geni or not,

1283
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,420
whether they hate the church and the terminology,

1284
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,300
or even don't know if it exists or not,

1285
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,440
but the true flock,

1286
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,720
if we can get together,

1287
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,220
we can really make a change for the good.

1288
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,060
I know it seems hopeless.

1289
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,760
I know sometimes you seem so alone.

1290
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,940
You look out into the bleak, gray, grimy world

1291
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,380
through a cracked and filthy window pane,

1292
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,080
and it all seems so pointless.

1293
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,560
And you say to yourself,

1294
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,700
there's squillions of them,

1295
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,940
and only one of me.

1296
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,540
What the heck can I do?

1297
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,380
Just remember,

1298
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,940
it's not only one of you.

1299
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,840
It's you and me.

1300
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,200
It's you and me in a secret underground of illusion,

1301
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,180
illuminated ones who for aeons

1302
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,860
have gently guided this sad old world upward

1303
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,120
in the face of incredible odds,

1304
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,160
sometimes without even knowing it.

1305
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,160
A strange idea, isn't it?

1306
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:09,260
That someone seemingly insignificant and powerless

1307
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,320
on the ragged edge of society

1308
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,980
could actually be the secret master or mistress of the world.

1309
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,060
But it's true.

1310
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,540
Look at them all,

1311
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,200
the squabbling organic robotoids

1312
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,920
acting out their ritual programs over and over again.

1313
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,220
They live to serve you.

1314
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,620
It's true.

1315
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,260
They live to serve you.

1316
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,240
Everything they build or make,

1317
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,160
all the extravagant waste they create,

1318
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,380
all the seemingly pointless,

1319
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,400
futile, murderous, hateful acts

1320
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,880
do have one ultimate goal.

1321
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,260
To make possible for you

1322
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,200
all those,

1323
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,980
those all too short moments,

1324
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,400
of pure slack you get

1325
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,900
in the course of the day's endless rounds of drudgery.

1326
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,380
I've always said that the folks I pity most

1327
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,660
are the ones who suffer from the delusion

1328
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,940
that they're not Jesus Christ.

1329
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,460
What I mean is that everyone who suffers,

1330
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,340
labors, and dies

1331
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,780
does so for you.

1332
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,640
To make your life better.

1333
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,740
Your laboring and suffering

1334
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,400
and death are not pointless either,

1335
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,200
but go to make another person's slack possible.

1336
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:31,320
My friend, no moment of pain, sorrow, or suffering

1337
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,020
goes to waste.

1338
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,820
All is transformed from the base metal of pain

1339
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,880
to the pure gold of slack

1340
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,920
through the action of the alchemical sublimate of...

1341
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,600
Well, not Bob in this case,

1342
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,720
because this rant was written by the great Northwest church of the South.

1343
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,900
I'm not a subgenius with no Bob.

1344
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,920
But something, I don't know.

1345
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,840
I lost my train of thought now.

1346
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,560
Anyway, it wasn't my train of thought to begin with.

1347
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,660
It was Nenslow's.

1348
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,400
That's all that stuff was written by Nenslow.

1349
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,500
I was just reading from it.

1350
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,760
And, uh, but you, but, but, you know what,

1351
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,820
you know what we're saying?

1352
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,180
You know what we're saying?

1353
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,120
You know what Doctorsters for Bob were saying in the background music?

1354
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,460
What D.K. Jones is saying in the background music right now.

1355
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,940
And, uh, but, but what we don't know

1356
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,620
is what we're gonna play next.

1357
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,920
Oh, I know what we need.

1358
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,260
We're getting down near the end of the show,

1359
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,440
so I'm gonna tell you the most important thing

1360
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,360
there is to tell you on this show,

1361
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,780
which is the address to write for free information.

1362
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,180
Got that pencil ready?

1363
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,020
That's Bob!

1364
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,180
It is Bob!

1365
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,020
It's only Bob!

1366
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,880
It's no one but Bob!

1367
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,800
And you just write to Bob at

1368
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,700
Post Office Box 140306

1369
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,920
Dallas, Texas 75214

1370
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,000
I'm gonna give that number again.

1371
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,440
That's Bob at Post Office Box

1372
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,640
140306

1373
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,420
Dallas, Texas 75214

1374
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,640
And, uh, here to take us out

1375
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,240
is, uh, this, uh, oddball little band

1376
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,620
from up north called

1377
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,320
The Merkins.

1378
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,940
Hey girls, I've got some news for you

1379
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,720
Please don't doubt because it's all true

1380
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,820
There's a little spot that can send you up and down

1381
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,800
Everybody's got one

1382
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,920
So rub off your little crown

1383
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,160
You can use your finger or a big vibrator

1384
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,660
You'll find your little spot just south of your equator

1385
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,060
Do it alone or with your favorite sweetie

1386
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,600
Hit the park or plums and just have a sweet time

1387
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,640
Two spots are fun

1388
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,040
We all have one

1389
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,400
Two spots are fun

1390
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,180
We all have one

1391
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,880
Two spots are fun

1392
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,160
We all have one

1393
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,780
Don't hesitate to press the secret button that's within you

1394
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,140
My name is Contessa and I've got a question

1395
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,720
Litter with a G-spot, will you give me a suggestion?

1396
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,880
I steer up with my job at the Delicatessen

1397
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,080
I've been sitting all day just indulging my obsession

1398
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,680
But letter with a G-spot, my G-spot is nowhere to be found

1399
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,560
Now where exactly did you say it was hanging around?

1400
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,300
Now listen, foolish girl, I told you once before

1401
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,860
That searching for your G-spot shouldn't be a chore

1402
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,840
Consider it a way to open up your mind

1403
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,100
Or Contessa, girl, you're gonna get left behind

1404
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,160
G-spots are fun

1405
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,420
We all have one

1406
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,740
Two spots are fun

1407
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,600
We all have one

1408
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,420
Two spots are fun

1409
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,600
We all have one

1410
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,360
Don't hesitate to press the secret button that's within you

1411
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:23,660
We all have one

1412
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:23,660


1413
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,180
We all have one

1414
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,240
Two spots are fun

1415
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,840
We all have one

1416
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,540
Two spots are fun

1417
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:45,800
Oh, and what's this

1418
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,000
My friends have all left me

1419
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,060
And I'm feeling so forlorn

1420
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,100
My instruments of passion

1421
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,880
Have turned on me with scorn

1422
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,260
I'm auctioning off my dildos

1423
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,840
On the 13th of November

1424
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,060
And I'm off to build a real life

1425
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,680
That I'm proud to remember

1426
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,180
So auction off your dildos

1427
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,700
And have a glass of wine

1428
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,800
Forget the golden juice bars

1429
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,400
You're living in your prime

1430
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,420
So listen closely ladies

1431
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,280
To your body and your mind

1432
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,120
You're packed to your own ecstasy

1433
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,660
Don't need to be defined

1434
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,620
G-Spots are fun

1435
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,980
We all have one

1436
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,400
G-Spots are fun

1437
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,220
We all have one

1438
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,000
G-Spots are fun

1439
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,160
We all have one

1440
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,740
Don't hesitate to press the secret button

1441
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,940
That's within you

1442
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:14,780
G-Spots are fun

1443
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,440
Just being you

1444
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:18,480
My gift to the 5000

1445
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,080
And that's what's added to this

1446
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,080


1447
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,080


1448
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,680
G eight owner

1449
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:21,680


1450
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,360
And another little shortcut

1451
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:29,880
P Government We человек

1452
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,260
Red and red

1453
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:44,780
JENN driver Manufactor

1454
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:51,140
I think it's important for those with the energy to do it

1455
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,480
to have something to do with it.

1456
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,260
You know what I mean?

1457
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,040
Send off for that strange stuff.

1458
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,640
And, well, I don't know what comes next,

1459
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,640
but we'll both find out now, won't we?

1460
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,700
Now, goodbye, fishers.

1461
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,140
Are you on?

1462
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,540
I know you're part of the Illuminati.

1463
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,300
You're head V.

1464
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,100
I'm what now?

1465
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,840
The head of the Illuminati, Dave.

1466
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,680
Oh, man, I'm not even the head V-keeper.

1467
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,240
Because if you weren't, they wouldn't let you speak.

1468
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,080
Oh, you think they got the power to make your vocal cords stop?

1469
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,460
I think they do.

1470
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,640
Well, then I'm going to make your stop,

1471
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,820
because I'm the head of the Illuminati.

1472
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,620
Well, you've already traced the call.

1473
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:29,640
I'm waiting.

1474
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,360
Yes, we have ways of knowing who you are.

1475
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,280
And with my all-seeing, all-knowing eyes,

1476
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,740
I'm just going to have to set up a little barricade.

1477
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,820
A little mental barricade?

1478
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,540
Do you think you can set this little mental barricade

1479
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,500
against this enormous intellect

1480
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,940
and this huge, big, fat brain?

1481
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,860
And you make me laugh,

1482
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,920
you common-air mortal type of person.

1483
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,660
I can see you out for...

1484
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,560
You live in Richmond Heights.

1485
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,300
You live at 45 Mr. Vons.

1486
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,400
What a brilliant opposition right there.

1487
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,960
He gave me his address.

1488
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,400
Now, what does your car look like, sir?

1489
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,420
I'm talking about the other times.

1490
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,440
I'm not the same person whom you were speaking with.

1491
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,900
Oh, okay, but you...

1492
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,960
I don't live in Concord.

1493
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,160
That was Concord boy.

1494
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,440
He's trying to kill me.

1495
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,680
Well, see, you're all victims of your own paranoid fantasy.

1496
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,700
That's what we listened to for three years ago,

1497
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,560
a long time ago.

1498
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,080
Remember, Chaz?

1499
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,620
Was a bunch of people calling each other up

1500
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,840
and saying they were killing each other.

1501
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,340
And not one of them ever died,

1502
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,860
because they kept on calling this damn program

1503
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,760
until we had to quit it.

1504
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,960
Well, no, I guess it's not true, but it sure is.

1505
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,820
I beg to...

1506
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,520
I beg to...

1507
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:44,520


1508
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,880
Okay, yeah, one of them Siberian singers,

1509
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,820
the Tupa Hoopas.

1510
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,720
Well, come on, now, let's finish your statement.

1511
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,720
All right, then I'll have to finish your statement.
